the roman traitor or the days of cicero cato and cataline a true tale of the republic by henry william herbert author of cromwell marmaduke wyvil brothers etc why not a borgia or a catilinepope volume ii this is one of the most powerful roman stories in the english language and is of itself sufficient to stamp the writer as a powerful man the dark intrigues of the days which csar sallust and cicero made illustrious when cataline defied and almost defeated the senate when the plots which ultimately overthrew the roman republic were being formed are described in a masterly manner the book deserves a permanent position by the side of the great bellum catalinarium of sallust and if we mistake not will not fail to occupy a prominent place among those produced in america philadelphia t b peterson

or the days of cicero cato and cataline a true tale of the republic chapter i the old patrician a roman father of the olden time ms play in a small street not far from the sacred way and the roman forum there was a large house occupying the whole of one insula as the space contained between four intersecting streets was called by the ancients but although by its great size and a certain rude magnificence arising from the massy stonework of its walls and the solemn antiquity of the old oscan columns which adorned its entrance it might be recognised at once as the abode of some patrician family it was as different in many respects from the abodes of the aristocracy of that day as if it had been erected in a different age and country it had no stately colonnades of foreign marbles no tesselated pavement to the vestibule no glowing frescoes on the walls no long lines of exterior windows glittering with the new luxury of glass all was decorous it is true but all at the same time was stern and grave and singular for its antique simplicity on either hand of the entrance there was in accordance with the custom of centuries long past when romes consulars were tillers of the ground a large shop with an open front devoted to the sale of the produce of the owners farm and strange to say although the custom had been long disused in these degenerate times it seemed that the owner of this timehonored mansion adhered sturdily to the ancient usage of his race for in one of these large cold unadorned vaults a tall grayheaded slave a rural laborer as it required no second glance to perceive was presiding over piles of cheese stonejars of honey baskets of autumn fruits and sacks of grain by the red light of a large smoky flambeau while a younger man who from his resemblance to the other might safely be pronounced his son was keeping an account of the sales by a somewhat complicated system of tallies in the other apartment two youths slaves likewise from the suburban or rustic farm were giving samples to such as wished to buy of different qualities of wine from several amphora or earthen pitchers which stood on a stone counter forming the sill of the lowbrowed window it was late in the evening already and the streets were rapidly growing dark yet there were many passengers abroad more perhaps than was usual at that hour and now and then a little group would form about one or the other of the windows cheapening and purchasing provisions and chatting for a few minutes after their business was finished with their gossips these groups were composed altogether of the lowest order of the free citizens of rome artizans and small shop keepers and here and there a woman of low origin or perhaps a slave the house steward of some noble family mingling half reluctantly with his superiors for the time had not arrived when the soft eunuchs of the east and the bold bravoes of the heroic north favorites and tools of some licentious lord dared to insult the freeborn men of rome or gloried in the badges of their servitude the conversation ran as it was natural to expect on the probable results of the next days election and it was a little remarkable that among these who should have been the supporters of the democratic faction there appeared to be far more of alarm and of suspicion concerning the objects of catiline than of enthusiasm for the popular cause he a man of the people or the peoples friend said an old gravelooking mechanic no by the gods no more than the wolf is the friend of the sheepfold he may hate the nobles said another or envy the great rich houses but he loves nothing of the people unless it be their purses if he can get a chance to squeeze them or their daughters interrupted a third if they be fair and willing little cares he for their goodwill cried yet a fourth so they are young and handsome it is but eight days since that some of his gang carried off marcus the butchers bride icilia on the night of her bridal they kept her three days and on the fourth sent her home dishonored with a scroll that she was now a fit wife for a butcher by the gods exclaimed one or two of the younger men who was it did this thing one of the peoples friends answered the other with a sneer the people have no friends since caius marius died said the deep voice of fulvius flaccus as he passed casually through the crowd but what befel the poor icilia asked an old matron who had been listening with greedy sympathy to the dark tale why marcus would yet have taken her to his bosom seeing she had no share in the guilt but she bore a heart too roman to bring disgrace upon one she loved or to survive her honor icilia is no longer she died like lucretia said an old man who stood near with a clouded brow which flashed into stormy light as the same deep voice asked aloud shall she be so avenged but the transient gleam faded instantly away and the sad face was again blank and rayless as he replied nofor who should avenge her the people the people shouted several voices for the mob was gathering and growing angry the roman people should avenge her tush answered fulvius flaccus there is no roman people and who are you exclaimed two or three of the younger men that dare tell us so the grandson answered the republican of one who while there yet was a people loved it his name his name shouted many voices he hath no namereplied fulvius he lost that and his life together lost them for the people inquired the old man whom he had first addressed and who had been scrutinizing him narrowly and by the people answered the other for the peoples cause and by the peoples treasonas is the case he added half scornfully half sadly with all who love the people hear him my countrymen said the old man hear him if there be any one can save you it is he it is fulvius the son of caius the son of marcusflaccus hear him i say if he will only lead you lead us speak to us lead us shouted the fickle crowd love us good fulvius as your fathers did of old and die for you as they died replied the other in a tone of melancholy sarcasm hark you my masters he added there are none now against whom to lead you and if there were i think there would be none to follow keep your palms unsoiled by the base bribes of the nobles keep your ears closed to the base lies of the demagogues keep your hearts true and honest keep your eyes open and watchful brawl not one with the other but be faithful as brethren should be grave laborious sober and above all things humble as men who once were free and great and now by their own fault are fallen and degraded make yourselves fit to be led gloriously and when the time shall come there will be no lack of glorious leaders but tomorrow what shall we do tomorrow cried several voices but this time it was the elder men who asked the question for whom shall we vote tomorrow for the friend of the people answered flaccus where shall we find him was the cry who is the friend of the people not he who would arm them one against the other he replied not he who would burn their workshops and destroy their means of daily sustenance not he by all the gods who sports with the honor of their wives the virtue but he was interrupted here by a stern sullen hum among his audience increasing gradually to a fierce savage outcry the mob swayed to and fro and it was evident that something was occurring in the midst by which it was tremendously excited breaking off suddenly in his speech the democrat leaped on a large block of stone standing at the corner of the large house in front of which the multitude was gathered and looked out anxiously if he might descry the cause of the tumult nor was it long ere he succeeded a young man tall and of a slender frame with features singularly handsome was making his way as best he could with unsteady steps and a face haggard and pale with debauchery through the tumultuous and angry concourse his head which had no other covering than its long curled and perfumed locks was crowned with a myrtle wreath he wore a long loose saffroncolored tunic richly embroidered but ungirt and flowing nearly to his ankles and from the dress and the torchbearers who preceded him as well as from his wild eye and reeling gait it was evident that he was returning from some riotous banquet fulvius instantly recognised him it was a kinsman of his own aulus the son of aulus fulvius the noblest of the survivors of his house a senator of the old school a man of stern and rigid virtue the owner of that grand simple mansion beside the door of which he stood but though he recognised his cousin he was at a loss for a while to discover the cause of the tumult till suddenly a word a female name angrily murmured through the crowd gave a clue to its meaning icilia icilia still though the crowd swayed to and fro and jostled and shouted becoming evidently more angry every moment it made way for the young noble who advanced fearlessly with a sort of calm and scornful insolence contemning the rage which his own vile deed had awakened at length one of the mob bolder than the rest thrust himself in between the torch bearers and their lord and meeting the latter face to face cried out so that all the crowd might hear lo aulus fulvius the violator of icilia the friend of the people a loud roar of savage laughter followed and then encouraged by the applause of his fellows the man added vote for aulus fulvius the friend of the people vote for good aulus and his virtuous friend catiline the hot blood flashed to the brow of the young noble at the undisguised scorn of the plebeians speech insolence he could have borne but contemptand contempt from a plebeian he raised his hand and slight and unmuscular as he appeared indignation lent such vigor to that effeminate arm that the blow which he dealt him on the face cast the burly mechanic headlong with the blood spouting from his mouth and nostrils a fearful roar of the mob and a furious rush against the oppressor followed the torchbearers fought for their master gallantly with their tough oaken staves and the young man showed his patrician blood by his patrician courage in the fray flaccus too wished and endeavored to interpose not so much that he cared to shield his unworthy kinsman as that he sought to preserve the energies of the people for a more noble trial the multitude moreover impeded one another by their own violent impetuosity and to this it was owing more than to the defence of his followers or the intercession of the popular flaccus that the young libertine was not torn to pieces on the threshold of his own fathers house the matter however was growing very seriousstones staves and torches flew fast through the airthe crash of windows in the neighboring houses was answered by the roar of the increasing mob and every thing seemed to portend a very dangerous tumult when at the same moment the door of the fulvian house was thrown open and the highcrested helmets of a cohort were seen approaching in a serried line above the bare heads of the multitude order was restored very rapidly for a pacific party had been rallying around fulvius flaccus and their efforts added to the advance of the levelled pila of the cohort were almost instantly successful nor did the sight which was presented by the opening door of the fulvian mansion lack its peculiar influence on the people an old man issued forth alone from the unfolded portals he was indeed extremely old with hair as white as snow and a long venerable beard falling in waves of silver far down upon his chest yet his eyebrows were black as night and these with the proud arch of his roman nose and the glance of his eagle eyes untamed by time or hardship almost denied the inference drawn from the white head and reverend chin his frame which must once have been unusually powerful and athletic was now lean and emaciated yet he held himself erect as a centennial pine on mount algidus and stood as firmly on his threshold looking down on the tumultuous concourse which waved and fluctuated like the smaller trees of the mountain side beneath him his dress was of the plain and narrow cut peculiar to the good olden time yet it had the distinctive marks of the senatorial rank it was the virtuous severe old senatorthe noblest alas soon to be the last of his noble race what means this tumult he said in a deep firm sonorous voice wherefore is it that ye shout thus and hurl stones about a friendly door for shame for shame what is it that ye lack bread ye have had it ever at my hands without seeking it thus rudely it is not bread most noble aulus that we would have cried the old man who had made himself somewhat conspicuous before but vengeance vengeance on whom and for what exclaimed the noble roman but ere his question could be answered the crowd opened before him and his son stood revealed sobered indeed by the danger he had run but pale haggard bleeding covered with mud and filth and supported by one of his wounded slaves ah cried the old man starting back aghast what is this what fresh crime what recent infamy what new pollution of our name icilia icilia vengeance for poor icilia cried the mob once again but they now made no effort to inflict the punishment for which they clamored so perfect was their confidence in the old mans justice even against his own flesh and blood at the next moment a voice was heard loud and clear as a silver trumpet calling upon the people to disperse it was the voice of paullus who now strode into the gap left by the opening concourse glittering in the full panoply of a decurion of the horse thirty dismounted troopers arranging themselves in a glittering line behind him at the sight of the soldiery led by one whose face was familiar to him the audacity of the young man revived and turning round with a light laugh toward arvina here is a precious coil he said my paullus about a poor plebeian harlot i never heard that icilia was such replied the young soldier sternly for the dark tale was but too well known nor must you look to me aulus fulvius for countenance in deeds like these although it be my duty to protect you from violence come my friends he continued turning to the multitude you must disperse at once to your several homes if any have been wronged by this man he can have justice at the tribunal of the prtor but there must be no violence is this thing true aulus asked the old man in tones so stern and solemn that the youth hung his head and was silent is this thing true the senator repeated why hath he not confessed it asked the old man who had spoken so many times before and who had lingered with fulvius flaccus and a few others of the crowd it is true who art thou asked the old patrician a terrible suspicion crossing his mind the father of that daughter whom thy son forcibly dishonored enter replied the senator throwing the door in front of which he stood wide open thou shalt have justice then casting a glance full of sad but resolute determination upon the culprit all whose audacity had passed away he said in a graver tone enter thou likewise thou shalt have punishment punishment answered the proud youth his eye flashing punishment and from whom punishment from thy father wilt thou question it punishment even unto death if thou shalt be found worthy to diethe law is not dead if it have slept awhile enter he dared not to replyhe dared not to refuse slow sullen and crestfallen he crossed his fathers threshhold but as he did so he glared terribly on paullus and shook his hand at him and cried in tones of deadly hatred this is thy doing cursescurses upon thee thou shalt rue it arvina smiled in calm contempt of his impotent resentment the culprit the accuser and the judge passed inward the door closed heavily behind them the crowd dispersed the soldiery marched onward and the street in front of the fulvian house was left dark and silent an hour perhaps had passed when the door was again opened and the aged plebeian icilias father issued into the dark street scourged he cried with a wild triumphant laugh scourged like a slave at his own fathers bidding rejoice exult icilia thy shame is half avenged chapter ii the consular comitia your voices coriolanus the morning had at length arrived big with the fate of rome the morning of the consular elections the sun shone broad and bright over the gorgeous city and the wide green expanse of the field of mars whereon from an hour before the first peep of dawn the mighty multitude of roman citizens had stood assembled all the formalities had been performed successfully the consul cicero who had gone forth beyond the walls to take the auspices accompanied by an augur had declared the auguries favorable the separate enclosures with the bridges as they were termed across which the centuries must pass to give their votes had been erected the distributors of the ballots and the guardians of the ballotboxes had been appointed and now as the sun rushed up with his crown of living glory into the cloudless arch of heaven the brazen trumpets of the centuries pealed long and loud calling the civic army to its ranks in order to commence their voting that was the awful moment and scarce a breast was there but beat high with hope or fear or dark and vague anticipation the consul and the friends of order were perhaps calmer and more confident than any others of that mighty concourse for they were satisfied with their preparations they were firm in the support of the patrician houses and in the unanimity of the roman knights conciliated by cicero scarcely less confident were the conspirators for with so much secrecy had the arrangements of the consul been made that although catiline knew himself suspected knew that his motives were perspicuous and his measures in some sort anticipated he yet believed that the time was propitious he hoped and believed as fully as he hoped that cicero and his party content with the triumph they had obtained in the senate and with the adjudication by that body of dictatorial power to the consuls were now deceived into the idea that the danger was already over still his fierce heart throbbed violently and there was a feeling of hot agonizing doubt blent with the truculent hope the savage ambition the strong thirst of blood which goaded him almost to madness from an early hour he had stood surrounded by his friends the leaders of that awful faction hard by the portico of the diribitorium or payoffice marking with a keen eye every group that entered the field of mars and addressing those whom he knew friendly to his measures with many a fiery word of greeting and encouragement cassius and lentulus a little way behind him leaned against the columns of the gateway with more than a thousand of the clients of their houses lounging about in groups seemingly inattentive but really alive to every word or glance of their leaders these men were all armed secretly with breast plates and the puissant roman sword beneath their peaceful togas these men welltrained in the wars of sylla hardy and brave and acting in a body were destined to commence the work of slaughter by slaying the great consul so soon as he should open the comitia cethegus had departed already to join his gladiators who to the number of fifteen hundred were gathered beyond the janiculum ready to act upon the guard and to beat down the standard which waved there the signal of election statilius gabinius and cparius were ready with their armed households and insurgent slaves prepared at a moments notice to throw open the prison doors and fire the city in twelve places fearless unanimous armed and athirst for blood the foes of the republic stood and marked with greedy eyes and visages inflamed and fiery their victims sweep through the gates arrayed in their peaceful robes unarmed as it would seem and unsuspecting not a guard was to be seen anywhere not a symptom of suspicion much less of preparation the wonted cohort only was gathered about the standard on the bridge gate of the janiculum but even these bore neither shields nor javelins and sat or lounged about unconcerned and evidently off their guard but the keen eye of catiline could mark the band of greytunicked gladiators mustered and ready to assume the offensive at a moments notice though now they were sauntering about or sitting down or lying in the shade or chatting with the country girls and rustic slaves who covered the sloping hillsides of the janiculum commanding a full view of the campus martius the fools muttered catiline the miserable goddeserted idiots does the man of arpinum deem me then so weak to be disarmed by an edict quelled by a paltry proclamation then as the stout smith caius crispus passed by him with a gang of workmen and a rabble of the lowest citizens ha he exclaimed hail crispushail brave heartsall things look well for us todaywell for the people your voices friends i must have your voices you shallcatiline replied the smithand our hands also he added with a significant smile and a dark glance catiline catilineall friends of the good people all foes of the proud patricians give noble catiline your voices catiline catiline for the persecuted people and with a wild and stirring shout the mob passed inward through the gate leaving the smith behind however who stopped as if to speak with one of the cornelian clients but in reality to wait further orders when shall we marchhe asked after a moment or two stealthily approaching the chief conspirator before they have called the prerogative century to vote or when the knights are in the bridges when the standard goes down fool replied catiline harshly do not you know your work at this moment a party of young and dissipated nobles came swaggering along the road with their ungirded tunics flowing down to their heels their long sleeves fringed with purple falling as far as to their wrists and their curled ringlets floating on their shoulders among them with a bloodshot eye a pale and haggard face and a strange terrible expression halfsullen halfashamed on all his features as if he fancied that his last nights disgrace was known to all men strode aulus fulvius the son of that stern senator your voices noblemen your voices cried catiline laughing with feigned gayetydo but your work today and tonight wine and fair women shouted one but aulus smiled savagely and darkly and answered in one word revenge next behind them came bassus the veteran father of the dead eaglebearer he who had told so sad a tale of patrician cruelty to fulvius flaccus in the forge why bassus my brave veteran give me your hand cried the conspirator making a forward step to meet him for whom vote you today for muroena and silanus ha for catiline and justice answered the old man justice on him who wronged the eaglebearers child who sits in the senate even yet defiled with her pure bloodthe infamous cornelius another man had paused to listen to these words and he now interposed speaking to bassus verily catiline is like to do thee justice my poor bassus on a member of the cornelian house ist lentulus i prithee or cethegus on whom thou wouldst have justice but the old man replied angrily the peoples friend shall give the people justice who ever knew a noble pity or right a poor man ask aulus fulviusreplied the other with a sarcastic tone and a strange smile lighting up his features besides is not catiline a noble at the word aulus fulvius leaped on him like a tiger with his face crimsoning and his heart almost bursting with fury he could not speak for rage but he seized the man who had uttered those mysterious words by the throat and brandished a long poniard extricated in a seconds space from the loose sleeve of his tunic furiously in the air as the bright blade flashed in the sunlight there was a forward rush among the conspirators who anxious to avert any casual affray that might have created a disturbance would have checked the blow but their aid would have come too late had not the man thus suddenly assaulted by an extraordinary exertion of strength vigor and agility wrenched the dagger from aulus hand and tripping him at the same moment with his foot hurled him upon his back in the dust which surged up in a great cloud covering his perfumed hair and snowwhite toga with its filthy and ftid particles ha ha he cried with a loud ringing laugh as he tossed the weapon high into the sunny air that all around might see ithere is one of your noble peoples friendsdo they wear daggers all for the peoples throats do they wave torches all against the peoples workshops the matter seemed to be growing serious and while two or three of the conspirators seized aulus and compelled him with gentle violence to desist from farther tumult cparius whispered into the ear of catiline this knave knows far too much were it not best three or four of our friend crispus men should knock him on the head no no cried catilineby hades no it is too late i tell you the whole thing will be settled within half an hour there goes the second trumpet and as he spoke the shrill blast of the brazen instruments rose piercingly and almost painfully upon the ear and the people might be seen collecting themselves rapidly into the centuries of their tribes in order to give their votes in their places as ascertained by lot and the thirdexclaimed cassius joyfullywill give the signal for election catiline interrupted him as if fearful that he would say some thing that should commit the party but see he added pointing with his hand across the wide plain toward a little knoll on which there stood a group of noblelooking men surrounded by a multitude of knights and patricians see yonder how thickly the laticlavian tunics muster and the crimsonedged togas of the noblesall the knights are there too methinks and look look the consuls of the year and my competitors come my friends come we must toward the consul he is about to open the comitia catiline catiline the peoples friend again shouted caius crispus and bassus took the word and repeated it in the shrill quavering accents of old ageall those who love the people vote for the peoples friendvote for the noble catiline and at once thousands of voices took the cry catiline catiline hail catiline that shall be consul and in the midst of these triumphant cries hardened and proud of heart and confident of the success of his bloodthirsty schemes he hurried forward accompanied by lentulus and his armed satellites panting already with anticipated joy and athirst for slaughter but as he swept along followed by the faction a great body of citizens of the lower orders decent substantial men came crowding toward the campus and paused to inquire the cause of the tumult which had left its visible effects in the flushed visages and knotted brows of many present two or three voices began to relate what had passed but the smith crispus who had lingered with one or two of his ruffians intent to murder the man who had crossed his chief so soon as the signal should be given rudely broke in and interrupted them with the old cry the peoples friend all ye who love the people vote for the peoples friend vote for the noble catiline had mighty marius been alive marius of arpinum or the great gracchi they had cried vote rather for the man of the peoplevote for cicero of arpinum tush what knows he of marius replied the smith what knows he of the great gracchi echoed one of his followers whether should best know marius they who fought by his side or they who slew his friends who should best know the great gracchi if not fulvius the grandson of that fulvius flaccus who died with them in the forum by the hands of saturninus vote for catiline vote for catiline friends of the people shouted the smith again rechoed by all his savage and vociferous gang seeking to drown the voice of the true man of the people aye exclaimed fulvius ironically springing upon a stone horseblock thence to address the people who shouted flaccus flaccus on all sides live fulvius flaccus speak to us noble fulvius aye he exclaimed friends of the people followers of marius vote if ye be wise men for the murderer of his kinsmanfor catiline who slew marius gratidianus no no we will none of them no catiline no follower of sylla to your tribes men of rometo your tribes the mingled cries waxed wild and terrible and it was clear that the popular party was broken by the bold words of the speaker into two bodies if ever it had been united but little cared the conspirators for that since they had counted not upon winning by a majority of tribes but by a civic massacre and noweven as that roar was the loudest while flaccus in vain strove to gain a hearing for the third time the brazen trumpets of the centuries awoke their stirring symphonies announcing that the hour had arrived for the tribes to commence their voting those who were in the secret looked eagerly over the field the hour had comethe leader was at their headthey waited but the signal that signal named by catiline in the house of lcathe blood of cicero they saw a mass of men pressing on like a mighty wedge through the dense multitude parting the waves of the living ocean as a stout galley parts the billows struggling on steadily toward the knoll whereon amid the magnates of the land consulars senators and knights covering it with the pomp of white and crimson gowns gemmed only by the flashing axeheads of the lictors stood the great consul they saw the gladiators forming themselves into a separate band on the slopes of the janiculum with a senators robe distinct among the dark gray tunics catiline and his clients were not a hundred paces distant from cicero and the assembled nobles they had halted their hands were busy in the bosom of their gowns griping the hilts of their assassins tools cethegus and his gladiators were not a hundred paces distant from the bridgegate of the janiculum and the cohorts bannered eagle they too had halted they too were forming in battle orderthey too were mustering their breath for the dread onsetthey too were handling their war weapons almost had caius crispus in his mad triumph shouted victory one moment and rome had been the prize for the winner in the gladiators battle and the notes of the brazen trumpets had not yet died away among the echoing hills they had not died away before they were taken up and repeated east west and north and south by shriller more pervading clangors it burst over the heads of the astonished people like heavens thunder the wild prolonged warflourish of the legions from the tarpeian rock and the guarded capitol from the rampired janiculum from the fortress beyond the island bridge from the towered steeps of the quirinal broke simultaneously the well known roman war note upsprang along the turreted wall of the janiculum with crested casques and burnished brazen corslets and the tremendous javelins of the cohorts a long line of metellus legionaries upsprang on the heights of the capitol and on each point of vantage an answering band of warriors full armed and last not least as that warlike din smote the sky cicero on whom every eye was riveted of that vast concourse flung back his toga and stood forth conspicuous armed with a mighty breastplate and girded with the sword that won him at an after day among the mountains of cilicia the high style of imperator a mighty shout burst from the faithful ranks of the knights and starting from their scabbards five thousand swordblades flashed in a trusty ring around the savior of his country catiline would have murdered him shouted the voice of fulvius flaccuscatiline would have burned your workshops catiline would have made himself dictator king vote men of rome vote friends of the people i vote now i say for catiline anticipated frustrated outwittedthe conspirators glared on each other hopeless against forces so combined what chance of success still although ruined in his hopes catiline bore up bravely and with an insolence of hardihood that in a good cause had been heroism affecting to laugh at the precautions and sneer at the pusillanimous mind that had suggested them he defied proof defied suspicion there was no overt actno proof and cicero satisfied with his triumphfor alarmed beyond measure and astonished all ranks and classes vied with each other in voting for silanus and murnatook no step to arrest or convict the ringleaders it was a moral not a physical victory at which he had aimed so nobly and nobly had he won it the views of the conspiracy frustrated the hearts of its leaders chilled and thunderstricken the loyalty and virtue of all classes aroused the eyes of the roman people opened to knowledge of their friends two wise and noble consuls chosen by who were on the point of casting their votes for a murderer and traitor the city saved from conflagration the commonwealth preserved in all its majesty these were the trophies of the consular comitia chapter iii the peril things bad begun make strong themselves by ill macbeth sixteen days had elapsed since the conspirators were again frustrated at the consular comitia yet not for that had the archtraitor withdrawn his foot one hairs breadth from his purpose or paused one moment in his career of crime and ruin there is beyond doubt a necessitynot as the ancients deemed supernatural and the work of fate but a natural moral necessityarising from the very quality of crime itself which spurs the criminal on to new guilt fresh atrocity in the dark path of wickedness there is no halting place the wretched climber must turn his face for ever upward for ever onward if he look backward his fall is inevitable his doom fixed so was it proved with catiline to gain impunity for his first deed of cruelty and blood another and another were forced on him until at last harassed and maddened by the consciousness of untold guilt his frantic spirit could find no respite save in the fierce intoxication of excitement the strange delight of new atrocity add to this that knowing himself anticipated and discovered he knew also that if spared for a time by his opponent it was no lack of will but lack of opportunity alone to crush him that held the hands of cicero inactive thus although for a time the energies of his weaker comrades sank paralysed by the frustration of their schemes and by the certainty that they were noted and observed even in their most secret hours his stronger and more vehement spirit found only in the greater danger the greater stimulus to action sixteen days had elapsed and gradually as the conspirators found that no steps were taken by the government for their apprehension or punishment they too waxed bolder and began to fancy in their insolent presumption that the republic was too weak or too timid to enforce its own laws upon undoubted traitors all the causes moreover which had urged them at first to councils so desperate existed undiminished nay exaggerated by delay their debts their inability to raise those funds which their boundless profusion rendered necessary still maddened them and to these the consciousness of detected guilt and that necessity which in the words of their chief makes even the timid brave were superadded the people and the senate who had all for a time been vehemently agitated by a thousand various emotions of anger fear anxiety revenge forgetting as all popular bodies are wont to do the past danger in the present security were beginning to doubt whether they had not been alarmed at a shadow and were half inclined to question the existence of any conspiracy save in the fears of their consul it was well for rome at that hour that there was still in the commonwealth a counterpoise to the democratic spirit which vehement and energetical beyond all others in sudden and great emergencies is ever restless and impatient of protracted watchfulness and preparation and lacks that persistency and resolute endurance which seems peculiar to aristocratic constitutions and now especially were demonstrated these opposite characteristics for while the lower orders and the popular portion of the senate who had been in the first instance most strenuous in their alarm and most urgent for strong measures were now hesitating doubting and almost compassionating the culprits who had fallen under such a load of obloquy the firmer and more moderate minds were guarding the safety of the commonwealth in secret and watching through their unknown emissaries every movement of the traitors it was about twelve oclock at night on the eighth day before the ides corresponding to our seventh of november when the consul was seated alone in the small but sumptuous library which has been described above meditating with an anxious and careworn expression over some papers which lay before him on the table no sound had been heard in the house for several hours all its inhabitants except the consul only with the slave who had charge of the outer door and one faithful freedman having long since retired to rest but from without the wailing of the stormy nightwind rose and fell in melancholy alternations of wild sobbing sound and breathless silence and the pattering of heavy rain was distinctly audible on the flat roofs and in the flooded tank or impluvium which occupied the centre of the hall it was in one of the lulls of the autumnal storm that a heavy knock was heard on the pannel of the exterior door reverberating in long echoes through the silent vestibule and the vast colonnades of the atrium and peristyle at that dead hour of night such a summons would have seemed strange in any season it was now almost alarming nor though he was endowed preeminently with that moral strength of mind which is the highest quality of courage and was by no means deficient in mere physical bravery did cicero raise his head from the perusal of his papers and listen to that unwonted sound without some symptoms of anxiety and perturbation so thoroughly acquainted as he was with the desperate wickedness the infernal energy and absolute fearlessness of catiline it could not but occur to him instantly when he heard that unusual summons at a time when all the innocent world was buried in calm sleep how easy and obvious a mode of liberation from all danger and restraint his murder would afford to men so daring and unscrupulous as those against whom he was playing for no less a stake than life or death there was he well knew but a single slave and he old and unarmed in the vestibule nor was the aged and effeminate greek freedman one on whom reliance could be placed in a deadly struggle all these things flashed suddenly upon the mind of cicero as the heavy knocking fell upon his ear followed by a murmur of many voices and the tread of many feet without he arose quietly from the bronze armchair on which he had been sitting walked across the room to a recess beside the bookshelves and reached down from a hook on which it hung among a collection of armor and weapons a stout straight roman broadsword with a highly adorned hilt and scabbard scarcely however had he taken the weapon in his hand before the door was thrown open and his freedman ushered in three men attired in the full costume of roman senators all hail at this untimely hour most noble cicero exclaimed the first who entered by all the gods cried the second rejoiced i am o consul to see that you are on your guard for there is need of watchfulness in truth for who love the republic which need it is in short added the third that has brought us hither most welcome at all times answered cicero laying aside the broadsword with a smile though of a truth i thought it might be less gracious visitors noble marcellus have you good tidings of the commonwealth and you metellus scipio and you marcus crassus friends to the state i know you and would trust that no ill news hath held you watchful be not too confident of that my consul replied scipio peril there is at hand to the commonwealth in your person we have strange tidings here confirming all that you made known to the senate on the twelfth day before the calends in letters left by an unknown man with crassus doorkeeper this evening said marcellus we were at supper with him when they came and straightway determined to accompany him hither in my person exclaimed cicerothen is the peril threatened from lucius sergius catiline were it for myself alone this were a matter of small moment but seeing that i hold alone the clues of this dark plot it were disastrous to the state should ought befall me who have set my life on this cast to save my country indeed disastrous exclaimed the wealthy crassus for these most horrible and cursed traitors are sworn as it would seem to consume this most glorious city of the earth and all its stately wealth with the sword and fire to destroy all the noble houses cried scipio and place the vile and loathsome rabble at the helm of state all this i well knew of old said cicero calmly but i pray you my friends be seated and let me see these papers and taking the anonymous letters from the hands of crassus he read them aloud pausing from time to time to meditate on the intention of the writer marcus licinius crassus thus ran the first is spoken of by those who love not rome as their lover and trusty comrade doth marcus licinius crassus deem that the flames which shall roar over universal rome will spare his houses only doth marcus crassus hope that when the fetters shall be stricken from the limbs of every slave in rome his serfs alone will hold their necks beneath a voluntary yokedoth he imagine that when all the gold of the rich shall be distributed among the needy his seven thousand talents shall escape the red hands of catiline and his associates be wise take heed the noble who forsakes his order earns scorn alone from his new partisans when cicero shall fall all noble romans shall perish lamentably with himwhen the great capitol itself shall melt in the conflagration all private dwellings shall go down in the common ruin take counsel of a friend true though unknown and humble hold fast to the republic rally the nobles and the rich around the consul ere the third day hence he shall be triumphant or be nothingfare thee well this is mysterious dark incomprehensible said cicero as he finished reading it had it been sent to me i should have read its secret thus as intended to awake suspicion in my mind of a brave and noble roman a true friend of his country he added taking the hand of crassus in his own yet even so it would have failed for as soon would i doubt the truth of heaven itself as question the patriotic faith of the conqueror of spartacus but left at thy house my crassus it seems almost senseless and unmeaning what have we more the snake is scotched not slain the spark is concealed not quenched the knife is sharp yet though it lie in the scabbard when was conspiracy beat down by clemency or treason conquered by timidity let those who would survive the ides of november keep their loins girded and their eyes wakeful what i am you may not learn but this much onlyi was a noble before i was a beggar a roman before i was atraitor ha continued the consul examining the paper closely this is somewhat more pregnantthe ides of novemberthe idesis it sothey shall be met withalit is a different handwriting also and here is a thirdha a third plainer than the first said metellus scipiopray mark it three men have swornwho never swear in vaina knight a senator and yet a senator again two of the three cornelii their knives are keen their hands sure their hearts resolute against the new man from arpinum let those who love cicero look to the seventh day before novembers ides the seventh dayha so soon be it so said the undaunted magistrate i am prepared for any fortune consul exclaimed the freedman again entering i watched with geta in the vestibule since these good fathers entered and now there have come two ladies clad in the sacred garb of vestals two lictors wait on them they ask to speak with the consul admit them madman exclaimed cicero admit them with all honor you have not surely kept them in the vestibule not so my consul they are seated on the ivory chairs in the tablinum pardon me noble friends i go to greet the holy virgins this is a strange and most unusual honour lead the way man and with the words he left the room in evident anxiety and haste while his three visitors stood gazing each on the other in apprehension mingled with wonder in a few moments however he returned alone very pale and wearing on his fine features a singular expression of awe and dignified selfcomplacency which seemed to be almost at variance with each other the gods he said as he entered in a deep and solemn tone the gods themselves attest romes peril by grand and awful portents the college of the vestals sends tidings that the state totters to its fall may the great gods avert cried his three auditors simultaneously growing as pale as death and faltering out their words from ashy lips in weak or uncertain accents it is so said cicero who though a pure deist in truth and no believer in romes monstrous polytheism was not sufficiently emancipated from the superstition of the age to dispute the truth of prodigies and portents it is so the priestess who watched the sacred flame on the eternal hearth beheld it leap thrice upward in a clear spire of vivid and unearthly light and lick the vaulted roofstonesthrice vanish into utter gloom once she believed the fire extinct and veiled her head in more than mortal terror but after momentary gloom it again revived while three strange sighs mightier than any human voice came breathing from the inmost shrine and waved the flame fitfully to and fro with a dread pallid lustre the college bids the consul to watch for himself and the republic these three days or ill shall come of it even as he spoke a bustle was again heard in the vestibule as of a fresh arrival and again the freedman entered my consul a veiled patrician woman craves to confer with you in private ha all rome is afoot methinks tonight do you know her my glaucias i saw her once before my consul on the night of the fearful storm when the falchion of flame shook over rome and the senate was convened suddenly ha she it is wellit is very well we shall know all anon and his face lighted up joyously as he spoke excuse me friends and fathers this is one privy to the plot with tidings of weight doubtless thanks for your news and good night for i must pray you leave me your warning hath come in good season and i will not be taken unaware the gods have rome in their keeping and to save her they will not let me perish fare ye well nobles i must be private with this woman after the ceremonial of the time his visitors departed but as they passed through the atrium they met the lady conducted by the old greek freedman little expecting to meet any one at that untimely hour she had allowed her veil to fall down upon her shoulders and although she made a movement to recover it as she saw the senators approaching her by the faint light of the single lamp which burned before the household gods on the small altar by the impluvium marcus marcellus caught a passing view of a pair of large languishing blue eyes and a face of rare beauty by the great gods he whispered in crassus ear that was the lovely fulvia ha curius paramour replied the other can it be possible that the stern consul amuses his light hours with such highborn harlotry not he not he said scipio i doubt not curius is one of them he is needy and bold and bloody but such a braggart answered marcellus i have known braggarts fight said crassus there was a fellow who served in the fifth legion he fought before the standard of the hastati and i deemed him a coward ever but in the last strife with spartacus he slew six men with his own hand i saw it i have heard of such things said scipio but it grows late let us move homeward and then he added as he was leaving the consuls door if he can trust his household cicero should arm it my life on it they will attempt to murder him he has given orders even now to arm his slaves said the freedman in reply and so soon as they have got their blades and bucklers i go to invite hither the surest of his clients thou shalt do well to do sobut see thou do it silently and with the words they hurried homeward through the dark streets leaving the wise and virtuous magistrate in conference with his abandoned yet trustworthy informant fulvia chapter iv the crisis he is about it the doors are open macbeth the morning had scarcely dawned after that dismal and tempestuous night when three men were observed by some of the earlier citizens passing up the sacred way toward the cerolian place it was not so much that the earliness of the hour attracted the notice of these spectatorsfor the romans were a matutinal people even in their most effeminate and luxurious ages and the sun found few loiterers in their chambers when he came forth from his oriental gatesas that the manner and expression of these men themselves were singular and such as might well excite suspicion they all walked abreast two clad in the full garb of senators and one in the distinctive dress of roman knighthood no one had heard them speak aloud nor seen them whisper one to the other they moved straight onward steadily indeed and rather slowly but with something of consciousness in their manner glancing furtively around them from beneath their bent brows and sometimes even casting their eyes over their shoulders as if to see whether they were followed at about a hundred paces after these three not however accompanying them or attached to their party so far at least as appearances are considered two largeframed fellows clothed in the dark gray frocks worn by slaves and gladiators came strolling in the same direction these men had the auburn hair blue eyes and massive if not stolid cast of features peculiar to northern races at that time the conquered slaves though destined soon to be the victors of romes gigantic power when the first three reached the corner of the next block of buildings to the corner of that magnificent street called the carinoe they paused for a few moments and after looking carefully about them to mark whether they were observed or not held a short whispered conversation which their stern faces and impassioned gestures seemed to denote momentous while they were thus engaged the other two came sauntering along and passed them by apparently unheeded and without speaking or saluting them those three men were the knight caius cornelius a friend and distant kinsman of cethegus who was the second of the number and lucius vargunteius a senator whose name has descended only to posterity through the black infamy of the deed which he was even at that moment meditating spurred into action by the menaces and violence of catiline who had now resolved to go forth and commence open warfare from the entrenched camp prepared in the appenines by caius manlius these men had volunteered on the previous night at a second meeting held in the house of lca to murder cicero with their own hands during his morning levee to this end they had now come forth thus early hoping so to anticipate the visit of his numerous clients and take him at advantage unprepared and defenceless three stout men were they as ever went forth armed and determined for premeditated crime stout in frame stout of heart invulnerable by any physical apprehension unassailable by any touch of conscience pitiless fearless utterly depraved yet there was something in their present enterprise that half daunted them something in the character of the man whom they were preparing to assassinatesomething of undefined feeling suggesting to them the certainty of the whole worlds reproach and scorn through everlasting ages however present success might trammel up the consequence though they would not have confessed it to their own hearts they were reluctant toward their task and this unadmitted reluctance it was which led them to pause and parley under the show of arranging their schemes which had in truth been fully organized on the preceding night they were too far committed however to recede and it is probable that no one of them although their hearts were full almost to suffocation as they neared the good consuls door had gone so far as to think of withdrawing his hand from the deed of blood the outer door of the vestibule was open and but one slave was stationed in the porch an old man quite unarmed not having so much even as a porters staff who was sitting on a stone bench in the morning sunshine as the conspirators ascended the marble steps which gave access to the vestibule and entered the beautiful tuscan colonnade the two germans who had stopped and looked back for a moment seeing them pass in set off as hard as they could run through an adjoining street toward the house of catiline which was not very far distant it was not long ere they reached it and entered without question or hindrance as men familiar and permitted in a small room adjoining the inner peristyle the master of the house was striding to and fro across the tesselated floor in a state of perturbation extreme even for him whose historian has described him with bloodless face and evil eyes irregular and restless motions and the impress of frantic guilt ever plain to be seen in his agitated features aurelia orestilla sat near him on a low cushioned stool with her superb italian face livid and sicklied by unusual dread her hands lay tightly clasped upon her kneeher lips were as white as ashes her large lustrous eyes burning and preternaturally distended were fixed on the haggard face of her husband and followed him as he strode up and down the room in impotent anxiety and expectation yet she privy as she was to all his blackest councils the instigator and rewarder of his most hideous crime knowing the hell of impotent agony that was consuming his heart she dared not address him with any words of hope or consolation at such a crisis all ordinary phrases of comfort or cheering love seem but a mockery to the spirit which can find no rest until the doubts that harass it are ended and this she felt to be the case and had her own torturing expectation allowed her to frame any speech to soothe him she would not have ventured on its utterance certain that it would call forth a torrent of imprecation on her head perhaps a burst of violence against her person the very affections of the wicked are strangely mixed at times with more discordant elements and it would have been a hard question to solve whether that horrible pair most loved or hated one another the womans passions strange to relate had been kindled at times by the very cruelty and fury which at other moments made her almost detest him there was a species of sublimity in the very atrocity of catilines wickedness which fascinated her morbid and polluted fancy and she almost admired the ferocity which tortured her and from which alone of mortal ills she shrank appalled and unresisting and catiline loved her as well as he could love anything loved her the more because she too in some sort had elicited his admiration for she had crossed him many times and once braved him and alone of human beings he had not crushed her they were liker to mated tigers which even in their raptures of affection rend with the fang and clutch with the unsheathed talon until the blood and anguish testify the fury of their passion than to beings of human mould and nature suddenly the traitor stopped short in his wild and agitated walk and seemed to listen intently although no sound came to the ears of the woman who was no less on the alert than he for any stir or rumor it ishe said at length clasping his hands above his headit is the step of arminius the trusty gladiatordo you not hear it orestilla no she replied shaking her head doubtfully there is no sound at all my ear is quicker of hearing too than yours catiline and if there were any step i should be first to mark it tush woman he made answer glaring upon her fiercely it is my heart that hears it you have a heart then she replied bitterly unable even at that time to refrain from taunting him and a hand also and a dagger and by hell and all its furies i know not why i do not flesh it in you i will one day no you will not she answered very quietly and wherefore not i have done many a worse deed in my day the gods would scarce punish me for that slaughter and men might well call it justicewherefore not i say do you think i so doat on your beauty that i cannot right gladly spare you because answered the woman meeting his fixed glare with a glance as meaning and as fiery because when i find that you meditate it i will act quickest i know a drug or two and an unguent of very sovereign virtue ha ha the reckless profligate burst into a wild ringing laugh of triumphant approbation ha ha thou mightst have given me a better reason where else should i find such a tigress by all the gods it is your clutch and claws that i prize more than your softest and most rapturous caress but hist hist nowdo you not hear that step i doi do she replied clasping her hands again which she had unclinched in her angerand it is arminius step i was wrong to cross thee catiline and thou so anxious we shall hear nowwe shall hear all almost as she spoke the german gladiator rushed into the room heated and panting from his swift race and without any sign of reverence or any salutation exclaimed abruptly catiline it is over ere this time i saw them enter his house the woman uttered a low choking shriek her face flushed crimson and then again turned paler than before and she fell back on her cushioned seat swooning with joy at the welcome tidings but catiline flung both his arms abroad toward heaven and cried aloudye gods for once i thank ye if there be gods indeed he added with a sneerthou sawest them enter hathou art not lyingby all the furies if you deceive me i will take care that you see nothing more in this world catiline these eyes saw them at length at length he exclaimed his eye flashing and his whole countenance glowing with fiendish animation and yet curses upon itthat i could not slay himthat i should owe to any other hand my vengeance on my victim thou hast done wellha here is gold arminius the last gold i ownbut what of that tomorrowtomorrow i will have millions away away bold heart arouse your friends and followersto arms to arms cry havoc through the streets and liberty and vengeance while he was speaking yet the door was again opened and cethegus entered with the others dull gloomy and crestfallen but catiline was in a state of excitement so tremendous that he saw nothing but the men at one bound he reached cethegus and catching him by both handshow he exclaimedhow was itquick tell me quick did he die hard did he die conscious in despair in anguishtell me tell me you tortured him in the slayingtell me he died a coward howling and cursing fate and knowing that i i slew him andspeak cethegusspeak man by the gods you are pale silentthese are not faces fit for triumph speak man i say how died heshow me his blood cethegus you have not wiped it from your dagger give me the blade that i may kiss away the precious deathdrops so rapidly and impetuously had he spoken heaping query on query that cethegus could not have answered if he would but to say the truth he was in little haste to do so when catiline ceased however which he did at length from actual want of breath to enquire farther he answered in a low smothered voice he is not dead at allhe refused not dead shrieked catiline for it was a shriek though articulate and one so piercing that it roused aurelia from her swoon of joynot dead yon villain swore that he saw you enternot dead he repeated half incredulouslyby heaven and hell i believe you are jesting with me tell me that you have lied and iii will worship you cethegus his porter refused us entrance and as the door was opened we saw in the atrium the slaves of his household and half a hundred of his clients all armed from head to foot with casque and corslet pilum broadsword and buckler and to complete the tale as we returned into the street baffled and desperate a window was thrown open in the banquethall above and we might see the consul with cato and marcellus and scipio and a score of consulars beside gazing upon us in all the triumph of security in all the confidence of success we are betrayed that is plainour plans are all known as soon as they are taken all frustrated ere acted all is lost catiline for what remains to do to dare answered the villain all undaunted even by this reverseand if need be to diebut to despair never but who can be the traitorwhere shall we look to find him look there exclaimed catiline pointing to the german gladiator who stood all confounded and chapfallen look there and you shall see one and see him punished too what ho without there ho a dozen of you if you would shun the lash and at the summons ten or twelve slaves and freedmen rushed into the room in trepidation almost in terror so savage was the temper of the lord whom they served and so merciless his wrath at the most trivial fault or error drag that brute hence he said waving his hand toward the unhappy gladiator put out his eyes fetter him foot and hand and cast him to the congers in the fishpond without a moments pause or hesitation they cast themselves upon their miserable comrade and though he struggled furiously and struck down two or three of the foremost and shouted himself hoarse in fruitless efforts to explain he was secured and bound and gagged within a shorter time than is required to describe it this done one of the freedmen looked toward his dreaded master and asked with pale lips and a faltering voice alive catiline aliveand hark you sirrah fasten his head above the water that he die not too speedily those biggest congers will lug him manfully cethegus we will go see the sport anon it will serve to amuse us after this disappointment there away with him begone the miserable creature struggled desperately in his bonds but in vain and strove so terribly to speak in despite his gag that his face turned almost black from the blood which rushed to every pore but no sound could he utter as he was dragged away save a deepmouthed groan which was drowned by the laughter of the remorseless wretches who gazed on his anguish with fiendish merriment among which hideous to relate the thrilling sounds of aurelias silvery and contagious mirth were distinctly audible he will take care to see more truly in hades said catiline with his sardonic smile as he was dragged out of the room by his appalled and trembling fellows but now to business tell me did you display any weapon or do aught that can be proved to show your intent on the consul nothing my catiline replied cethegus firmly nothing indeed cethegus by all our hopes deceive me not by your head nothing catiline then i care nothing for the failure answered the other keep good hearts and wear smiling faces i will kill him myself tomorrow if like the scorpion i must die in the deed try it not catiline you will but failand fail who ever knew me fail in vengeance no one said orestillaand no one can hinder you of it no not the gods there are no gods exclaimed the traitor and if there be it were all onei defy them cicero says there is one they tell me said cethegus half mocking half in earnestand he is very wise very replied the other with his accustomed sneertherefore that one may save himif he can the thing is settled cried aurelia orestilla i told him yesterday he ought to do it himselfi should not be content unless catilines hand dealt him the death blow catilines eye gloated upon him in the deathstruggle catilines tongue jeered him in the deathpang you love him dearly orestilla said cethegus and clearly he has earned it she replied by venus i would give half my hopes to see him kiss you and i if my lips had the hydras venom but come she added with a wreathed smile and a beaming eye let us go see the fishes eat yon varlet else shall we be too late for the sport rare sport said cethegus i have not seen a man eaten by a tiger even these six months past and by a fish i think never the fish do it better replied catilinebetter and cleanerthey leave the prettiest skeleton you can imaginethey are longer about it you will saytrue but i do not grudge the time no no the longer the merrier said aurelia laughing melodiouslythe last fellow i saw given to the tigers had his head crushed like a nutshell by a single blow he had not time to shriek even once there was no fun in that you know none indeed said cethegusbut i warrant you this german will howl gloriously when the fish are at him yes yes exclaimed the lovely woman clapping her hands joyously we must have the gag removed to give free vent to his music come come i am dying to see him some one must die since cicero did not happy fellow this if he only knew it to give his friends so much pleasure one of them such a fair lady too will there be more pleasure think you in seeing the congers eat the gladiator or in eating the congers afterward oh no comparison one can eat fat congers always we have the advantage of them truly for they cannot always eat fat gladiators and they walked away with as much glee and expectation to the scene of agony and fiendish torture vitiated by the frightful exhibitions of the circus and the arena as men in modern days would feel in going to enjoy the fictitious sorrows of some grand tragedian can it be that the contemplation of human wo in some form or other is in all ages grateful to poor corrupt humanity chapter v the oration quousque tandem abutere cicero the senate was assembled in the great temple on the palatine built on the spot where jupiter thence hailed as stator had stayed the tide of flight and sent the rallied romans back to a glorious triumph a cohort was stationed on the brow of the hill its spearheads glancing in the early sunshine the roman knights wearing their swords openly and clad in their girded tunics only mustered around the steps which led to the colonnade and doors of the temple a voluntary guard to the good consul a mighty concourse had flowed together from all quarters of the city and stood in dense masses in all the neighboring streets and in the area of the temple in hushed and anxious expectation the tribunes of the people awed for once by the imminence of the peril forgot to be factious within the mighty building there was dead silencesilence more eloquent than words for to the wonder of all men undismayed by detection unrebuked by the horror and hate which frowned on him from every brow catiline had assumed his place on the benches of his order not one even of his most intimate associates had dared to salute him not one even of the conspirators had dared to recognize the manifest traitor as he assumed his place the senators next to him had arisen and withdrawn from the infamous vicinity some of them even shaking their gowns as if to dissipate the contamination of his contact alone he sat therefore with a wide vacant space around himalone in that crowded housealone yet proud unrebuked undaunted the eyes of every man in the vast assembly were riveted in fear or hatred or astonishment on the set features and sullen scowling brow of the arch conspirator thus sat they thus they gazed for ten minutes space and so deep was the allabsorbing interest that none observed the consul who had arisen to his feet before the curule chair until the great volume of his clear sonorous voice rolled over them like the burst of sudden thunder amid the hush of nature which precedes it it was to no set form of words to no premeditated speech that he gave utterance nor did he in the usual form address the conscript fathers with his form drawn to its fullest height his arm outstretched as if it was about to launch the thunderbolt he hurled his impassioned indignation against the fearless culprit until how long o catiline wilt thou abuse our patience until how long too will thy frantic fury baffle us unto what extremity will thy unbridled insolence display itself do the nocturnal guards upon the palatine nothing dismay you nothing the watches through the city nothing the terrors of the people nothing the concourse hitherward of all good citizens nothing this most secure place for the senates convocation nothing the eyes and faces of all these and at the words he waved both arms slowly around pointing the features and expression of every senator filled with awe and aversion dost thou not feel that all thy plots are manifest not see that thy conspiracy was grasped irresistibly so soon as it was known thoroughly to all these which of us dost thou imagine ignorant of what thou didst where thou wert whom thou didst convoke what resolution thou didst take last night and the night yet preceding oh ye changed times oh ye degenerate customs the senate comprehends these things the consul sees them yet this man lives lives did i say yea indeed comes into the senate bears a part in the public councils marks out with his eyes and selects every one of us for slaughter but we strenuous brave men imagine that we do our duty to the state so long as we escape the frenzy the daggers of that villain long since it had been right catiline that thou shouldst have been led to death by the consuls mandatelong since should that doom have been turned upon thyself which thou hast been so long devising for all of us here present do i err saying this or did that most illustrious man publius scipio pontifex maximus when in no magisterial office take off tiberius gracchus for merely disturbing the established order of the state and shall we consuls endure catiline aiming to devastate the world with massacre and conflagration for i omit to state as too ancient precedents how caius servilius ahala slew with his own hand spurius melius when plotting revolution there was there was of old that energy of virtue in this commonwealth that brave men hedged the traitorous citizen about with heavier penalties than the most deadly foe we hold a powerful and weighty decree of the senate against thee o catiline neither the counsel nor the sanction of this order have been wanting to the republic we we i say it openly we consuls are wanting in our duty the senate decreed once that lucius opimius then consul should see that the republic took no harm not one night intervened caius gracchus was slain on mere suspicions of sedition the son of a most noble father most noble grandfather most noble ancestry marcus fulvius a consular was slain with both his children by a like decree of the senate the charge of the republic was committed to caius marius and lucius valerius the consulsdid the republics vengeance delay the death of lucius saterninus a tribune of the people of caius servilius a prtor even a single day and yet we consuls suffer the edge of this authority to be blunted until the twentieth day for we have such a decree of the senate but hidden in the scroll which contains it as a sword undrawn in its scabbard by which decree it were right o catiline that thou shouldst have been slaughtered on the instant thou livest and livest not to lay aside but to confirm and strengthen thine audacity i desire o conscript fathers to be merciful i desire too in such jeopardy of the republic not to seem culpably neglectful yet i condemn myself of inability of utter weakness there is a camp in italy hostile to the republic in the defiles that open on etruria daily the numbers of the foe are increasing and yet the general of that camp the leader of that foe we see within the walls aye even in the senate day by day plotting some intestine blow against the state were i to order thee to be arrested to be slain now o catiline i should have cause i think to dread the reproaches of all good citizens for having stricken thee too late rather than that of one for having stricken thee too severely and yet that which should have been done long ago i am not yet for a certain reason persuaded to do now thenthen at lengthwill i slay thee when there is not a man so base so desperately wicked so like to thee in character but he shall own thy slaying just so long as there shall be one man who dares to defend thee thou shalt live and thou shalt live as now thou livest beset on every side by numerous and steady guards so that thou canst not even stir against the commonwealth the eyes moreover and the ears of many even as heretofore shall spy thee out at unawares and mount guard on thee in private for what is there catiline which thou now canst expect more if neither night with all its darkness could conceal thy unholy meetings nor even the most private house contain within its walls the voice of thy conspiracy if all thy deeds shine forth burst into public view change now that hideous purpose take me along as thy adviser forget thy schemes of massacre of conflagration thou art hemmed in on every side thy every council is more clear to me than day and these thou canst now review with me dost thou remember how i stated in the senate on the twelfth day before the calends of november that caius manlius the satellite and cominister of thy audacity would be in arms on a given day which day would be the sixth before the calends of novemberdid i err catiline not in the fact so great as it was so atrocious so incredible but what is much more wondrous in the very day again i told thee in the senate that thou hadst conspired to slay the first men of the state on the fifth day before the calends of november when many leading men of rome quitted the city not so much to preserve their lives as to mar thy councils canst thou deny that thou wert hemmed in on that day by my guards and hindered by my vigilance from stirring thy hand against the state when frustrate by the departure of the rest thou saidst that our blood ours who had remained behind would satisfy thee what when thou wert so confident of seizing prneste by nocturnal escalade upon the very calends of november didst thou not feel that it was by my order that colony was garrisoned guarded watched impregnablethou doest nothing plottest nothing thinkest nothing which i shall noti say nothearbut shall not see shall not conspicuously comprehend review with me now the transactions of the night before the last so shalt thou understand that i watch far more vigilantly for the safety than thou for the destruction of the state i say that on that former night thou didst go to the street of the scythemakers i will speak plainly to the house of marcus lca that thou didst meet there many of thy associates in crime and madness wilt thou dare to deny it why so silent if thou deniest i will prove it for i see some of those here here in the senate who were with thee oh ye immortal gods in what region of the earth do we dwell in what city do we live of what republic are we citizens here they are here in the midst of us conscript fathers here in this council the most sacred the most solemn of the universal world who are planning the slaughter of myself the slaughter of you all planning the ruin of this city and therein the ruin of the world i the consul see these men and ask their opinions on state matters nay those whom it were but justice to slaughter with the sword i refrain as yet from wounding with a word thou wert therefore in the house of lca on that night o catiline thou didst allot the districts of italy thou didst determine whither each one of thy followers should set forth thou didst choose whom thou wouldst lead along with thee whom leave behind thou didst assign the wards of the city for conflagration thou didst assert that ere long thou wouldst go forth in person thou saidst there was but one cause why thou shouldst yet delay a little namely that i was alive two roman knights were found who offered themselves to liberate thee from that care and promised that they would butcher me that very night a little before daylight in my own bed of all these things i was aware when your assembly was scarce yet broken up i strengthened my house and guarded it with an unwonted garrison i refused admittance to those whom thou hadst sent to salute me when they arrived even as i had predicted to many eminent men that they would arrive and at that very time since then these things stand thus o catiline proceed as thou hast begun depart when thou wilt from the city the gates are open begone too long already have those camps of manlius lacked their general lead forth with the morrow all thy menif not all as many at least as thou art able purify the city of thy presence thou wilt discharge me from great terror so soon as a wall shall be interposed between thee and me dwell among us thou canst now no longer i will not endure i will not suffer i will not permit it great thanks must be rendered to the immortal gods and to this stator jove especially the ancient guardian of this city that we have escaped so many times already this plague so foul so horrible so fraught with ruin to the republic not often is the highest weal of a state jeoparded in the person of a single individual so long as you plotted against me merely as consul elect o catiline i protected myself not by public guards but by private diligence when at the late comitia thou wouldst have murdered me presiding as consul in the field of mars with thy competitors i checked thy nefarious plans by the protection and force of my friends without exciting any public tumultin a word as often as thou hast thrust at me myself have i parried the blow although i perceived clearly that my fall was conjoined with dread calamity to the republic now now thou dost strike openly at the whole commonwealth the dwellings of the city dost summon the temples of the immortal gods the lives of all citizens in a word italy herself to havoc and perdition whereforeseeing that as yet i dare not do what should be my first duty what is the ancient and peculiar usage of this state and in accordance with the discipline of our fathersi will at least do that which in respect to security is more lenient in respect to the common good more useful for should i command thee to be slain the surviving band of thy conspirators would settle down in the republic but ifas i have been long exhorting thee thou wilt go forth the vast and pestilent contamination of thy comrades will be drained out of the city what is this catiline dost hesitate to do that for my bidding which of thine own accord thou wert about doing the consul commands the enemy to go forth from the state dost thou enquire of me whether into exile i do not order but if thou wilt have my counsel i advise it for what is there o catiline that can delight thee any longer in this city in which there is not one man without thy band of desperadoes who does not fear not one who does not hate theewhat brand of domestic turpitude is not burnt in upon thy life what shame of private bearing clings not to thee for endless infamy what scenes of impure lust what deeds of daring crime what horrible pollution attaches not to thy whole careerto what young man once entangled in the meshes of thy corruption hast thou not tendered the torch of licentiousness or the steel of murder must i say more even of late when thou hadst rendered thy house vacant for new nuptials by the death of thy late wife didst thou not overtop that hideous crime by a crime more incredible which i pass over and permit willingly to rest in silence lest it be known that in this state guilt so enormous has existed and has not been punished i pass over the ruin of thy fortunes which all men know to be impending on the next ides i proceed to those things which pertain not to the private infamy of thy career not to thy domestic difficulties and baseness but to the supreme safety of the state and to the life and welfare of us all can the light of this life the breath of this heaven be grateful to thee catiline when thou art conscious that not one of these but knows how thou didst stand armed in the comitium on the day previous to the calends of january when lepidus and tullus were the consuls that thou hadst mustered a band of assassins to slay the consuls and the noblest of the citizens that no relenting of thy heart no faltering from fear opposed thy guilt and frenzy but the wonted good fortune of the commonwealth and now i pass from these things for neither are these crimes not known to all nor have there not been many more recently committed how many times hast not thou thrust at me while elect how many times when consul how many thrusts of thine so nearly aimed that they appeared inevitable have i not shunned by a slight diversion and as they say of gladiators by the movements of my body thou doest nothing attemptest nothing plannest nothing which can escape my knowledge at the moment when i would know it yet thou wilt neither cease from endeavoring nor from plotting how many times already hath that dagger been wrested from thy hand how many times hath it fallen by chance and escaped thy grasp still thou canst not be deprived of it more than an instants spaceand yet i know not with what unhallowed rites it has been consecrated and devoted by thee that thou shouldst deem it necessary to flesh it in the body of a consul now then what life is this of thine for i will now address thee not so that i may seem moved by that detestation which i feel toward thee but by compassion no portion of which is thy due but a moment since thou didst come into the senate and which one man from so vast a concourse from thine own chosen and familiar friends saluted thee if this has befallen no one within the memory of man wilt thou await loud contumely condemned already by the most severe sentence of this silence what wouldst thou have when all those seats around thee were left vacant on thy coming when all those consulars whom thou so frequently hadst designated unto slaughter as soon as thou didst take thy seat left all that portion of the benches bare and vacant with what spirit in one word can thou deem this endurable by hercules did my slaves so dread me as all thy fellow citizens dread thee i should conceive it time for leaving my own housedost thou not hold it time to leave this cityand if i felt myself without just cause suspected and odious to my countrymen i should choose rather to be beyond the reach of their vision than to be gazed upon by hostile eyes of all men dost thou hesitate when conscious of thine own crimes thou must acknowledge that the hate of all is just and due long agodost thou i say hesitate to avoid the presence and the sight of those whose eyes and senses thine aspect every day is wounding if thine own parents feared and hated thee and could by no means be reconciled thou wouldst i presume withdraw thyself somewhither beyond the reach of their eyesnow thy country which is the common parent of us all dreads and detests thee and has passed judgment on thee long ago as meditating nothing but her parricide wilt thou now neither revere her authority nor obey her judgment nor yet dread her violence since thus she now deals with thee catiline thus speaks to thee in silence no deed of infamy hath been done in these many years unless through theeno deed of atrocity without theeto thee alone the murder of many citizens to thee alone the spoliation and oppression of our allies hath been free and unpunished thou hast been powerful not only to escape laws and prosecutions but openly to break through and overturn them to these things though indeed intolerable i have submitted as best i mightbut it can now no longer be endured that i should be in one eternal dread of thee onlythat catiline on what alarm soever alone should be the source of terrorthat no treason against me can be imagined such as should be revolting to thy desperate criminality wherefore begone and liberate me from this terror so that if true i may not be ruined if false i may at least shake with fear no longer if thy country should thus as i have said parley with thee should she not obtain what she demands even if she lack force to compel it what more shall i say when thou didst offer thyself to go into some private custody what when to shun suspicion thou didst profess thy willingness to take up thy residence under the roof of manius lepidus refused by whom thou hadst audacity to come to me and request that i would admit thee to my house and when thou didst receive from me this answer that i could not exist within the same house with that man whose presence even inside the same city walls i esteemed vast peril to my life thou didst then go to the prtor quintus metellus and then repulsed by him to marcus marcellus thine own comrade a virtuous man truly one whom past doubt thou didst deem likely to be most vigilant in guarding most crafty in suspecting most strenuous in bringing thee to justice and how far shall that man be believed distant from deserving chains and a dungeon who judges himself to be worthy of safekeepingsince then these things are so dost hesitate o catiline since here thou canst not tarry with an equal mind to depart for some other land and give that life rescued from many just and deserved penalties to solitude and exile lay the matter thou sayest before the senate for that it is which thou requirest and if this order shall command thee into banishment thou wilt obey their bidding i will not lay it before themfor to do so is repugnant to my character yet i will so act that thou shalt clearly see what these think of thee depart from the city catiline deliver the state from terror begone into banishment if that be the word for which thou tarriest then the great orator paused once again not to breathe though the vehement and uninterrupted torrent of his eloquence might well have required an interval of rest but to give the confounded listener occasion to note the feelings of the assembled senate perfectly in accordance with his words it was but a moment however that he paused and that ended again burst out the thunderous weight of his magnificent invective what means this catiline dost thou note these dost thou observe their silence they permit my words they are mute why dost thou wait that confirmation of their words which thou seest given already by their silence but had i spoken these same words to that admirable youth publius sextius or to that very valiant man marcus marcellus i tell thee that this very senate would have already in this very temple laid violent hands on me the consul and that too most justly but with regard to thee when quiescent they approve when passive they decree when mute they cry aloud nor these alone whose authority it seems is very dear whose life most cheap in your eyes but all those roman knights do likewise most honorable and most worthy men and all those other valiant citizens who stand about the senate house whose dense ranks thou couldst see whose zeal thou couldst discover whose patriotic cries thou couldst hear but a little while ago whose hands and weapons i have scarcely for a long time restrained from thee whom i will yet induce to escort thee to the gates of rome if thou wilt leave this city which thou hast sought so long to devastate and ruin and yet what say i can it be hoped that anything should ever bend thee that thou shouldst ever be reformed that thou shouldst dream of any flight that thou shouldst contemplate any exile would would indeed that the immortal gods might give thee such a purpose and yet i perceive if astounded by my voice thou shouldst bend thy spirit to go into voluntary exile how vast a storm of odium would hang over me if not at this present time when the memory of thy villanies is recent at least from the passions of posterity but to me it is worth this sacrifice so that the storm burst on my individual head and be connected with no perils to the state but that thou shouldst be moved by thine own vices that thou shouldst dread the penalties of the law that thou shouldst yield to the exigences of the republic this indeed is not to be expected for thou art not such an one o catiline that any sense of shame should ever recall thee from infamy any sense of fear from peril any glimmering of reason from insanity wherefore as i have said many times already go forth from among us and if thou wouldst stir up against me as constantly thou sayest against me thine enemy a storm of enmity and odium then begone straightway into exile scarcely shall i have power to endure the clamors of the world scarcely shall i have power to sustain the burthen of that odium if thou wilt but go into voluntary banishment now at the consuls bidding if on the contrary thou wouldst advance my glory and my reputation then go forth with thy lawless band of ruffians betake thyself to manlius stir up the desperate citizens to arms withdraw thyself from all good men levy war on thy country exult in unhallowed schemes of robbery and murder so that thou shalt not pass for one driven forth by my tyranny into the arms of strangers but for one joining by invitation his own friends and comrades yet why should i invite thee when i well know that thy confederates are sent forth already who nigh forum aurelium shall wait in arms for your arrival when i well know that thou hast already a day promised and appointed whereon to join the camp of manlius when i well know that the silver eagle hath been prepared alreadythe silver eagle which will i trust prove ruinous and fatal to thee and all thine host to which a shrine has been established in thine own house thy villanies its fitting incense for how shalt thou endure its absence any longer thou who wert wont to adore it setting forth to sacrilege and slaughter thou who so often hast upraised that impious right hand of thine from its accursed altars to murder citizens of rome at length then at length thou must go forth whither long since thy frantic and unbridled passions have impelled thee nor shall this war against thy country vex or afflict thee nay rather shall it bring to thee a strange and unimaginable pleasure for to this frantic career did nature give thee birth to this hath thine own inclination trained to this fortune preserved theefor never hast thou wishedi say not peaceful leisurebut war itself unless that war were sacrilegious thou hast drawn together from the most infamous of wretches wretches abandoned not only by all fortune but all hope a bodyguard of desperadoes among these what pleasure wilt thou not experience in what bliss not exult in what raptures not madly revel when thou shalt neither see nor hear one virtuous man in such a concourse of thy comrades to this this mode of life tended all those strenuous toils of thine which are so widely talked ofto lie on the bare ground not lying in wait merely for some occasion of adultery but for some opportunity of daring crime to watch through the night not plotting merely against the sleep of betrayed husbands but against the property of murdered victims now then thou hast a notable occasion for displaying those illustrious qualities of thine that wonderful endurance of hunger of cold of destitution by which ere long thou shalt feel thyself undone and ruined this much however i did accomplish when i defeated thee in the comitia that thou shouldst strike at the republic as an exile rather than ravage it as a consul and that the warfare so villanously evoked by thee should be called rather the struggle of a base banditti than the fair strife of warriors now conscript fathers that i may solemnly abjure and deprecate the just reproaches of my country listen i pray you earnestly to what i say and commit it deeply to your memories and minds for if my country who is much dearer to me than my life if all italy if the whole commonwealth should thus expostulate with me what dost thou marcus tullius him whom thou hast proved to be my enemy whom thou seest the future leader in the war against me whom thou knowest even now the expected general in the camp of my foeshim the author of every crime the head of this conspiracy the summoner of insurgent slaves and ruined citizenshim wilt thou suffer to go forth and in such guise that he shall not be as one banished from the walls but rather as one let loose to war against the city wilt thou not then command that he shall be led away to prison that he shall be hurried off to death that he shall be visited with the last torments of the law what is it that dissuades thee is it the custom of thine ancestors not sofor many times in this republic have men even in private stations inflicted death on traitorsis it the laws enacted concerning the punishment of roman citizens not sofor never in this city have rebels against the commonwealth been suffered to retain the rights of citizens or romans dost thou shrink from the odium of posterity if it be so in truth thou dost repay great gratitude unto the roman people who hath elevated thee a man known by thine own actions only commended by no ancestral glory so rapidly through all the grades of honor to this most high authority of consul if in the fear of any future odium if in the dread of any present peril thou dost neglect the safety of the citizens again if thou dost shrink from enmity whether dost deem most terrible that purchased by a severe and brave discharge of duty or that by inability and shameful weakness or once more when all italy shall be waste with civil war when her towns shall be demolished her houses blazing to the sky dost fancy that thy good report shall not be then consumed in the fierce glare of enmity and odium to these most solemn appeals of my country and to the minds of those men who think in likewise i will now make brief answer could i have judged it for the best o conscript fathers that catiline should have been done to death then would i not have granted one hours tenure of existence to that gladiator for if the first of men noblest of citizens were graced not polluted by the blood of saturninus and the gracchi and flaccus and many more in olden time there surely is no cause why i should apprehend a burst of future odium for taking off this parricide of the republic yet if such odium did inevitably impend above me i have ever been of this mind that i regard that hatred which is earned by honorable duty not as reproach but glory yet there are some in this assembly who either do not see the perils which are imminent above us or seeing deny their eyesight some who have nursed the hopes of catiline by moderate decrees and strengthened this conspiracy from its birth until now by disbelieving its existenceand many more there are not of the wicked only but of the inexperienced who if i should do justice upon this man would raise a cry that i had dealt with him cruelly and as a regal tyrant now i am well assured that if he once arrive whither he means to go at the camp of manlius there will be none so blind as not to see the reality of this conspiracy none so wicked as to deny it but on the other hand were this man slain alone i perceive that this ruin of the state might indeed be repressed for a season but could not be suppressed for everwhile if he cast himself forth and lead his comrades with him and gather to his host all his disbanded desperate outlaws not only will this full grown pestilence of rome be utterly extinguished and abolished but the very seed and germ of all evil will be extirpated for ever for it is a long time o conscript fathers that we have been dwelling amid the perils and stratagems of this conspiracy and i know not how it is that the ripeness of all crime the maturity of ancient guilt and frenzy hath burst to light at once during my consulship but this i know that if from so vast a horde of assassins and banditti this man alone be taken off we may perchance be relieved for some brief space from apprehension and dismay but the peril itself will strike inward and settle down into the veins and vitals of the commonwealth as oftentimes men laboring under some dread disease if while tossing in feverish heat they drink cold water will seem indeed to be relieved for some brief space but are thereafter much more seriously and perilously afflicted so will this ulcer which exists in the republic if relieved by the cutting off this man grow but the more inveterate the others left alive wherefore o conscript fathers let the wicked withdraw themselves let them retire from among the good let them herd together in one place let them in one word as often i have said before be divided from us by the city wall let them cease to plot against the consul in his own house to stand about the tribunal of the city prtor deterring him from justice to beset even the senate house with swords to prepare blazing brands and fiery arrows for the conflagration of the city let it in one word be borne as an inscription upon the brow of every citizen what are his sentiments toward the republic this i can promise you o conscript fathers that there shall be such diligence in us consuls such valor in the roman knights such unanimity in all good citizens that you shall see catiline once departed all that is secret exposed all that is dark brought to light all that is dangerous put down all that is guilty punished under these omens catiline to the eternal welfare of the state to thine own ruin and destruction to the perdition of all those who have linked themselves with thee in this league of infamy and parricide go forth to thine atrocious and sacrilegious warfare and do thou jove who wert consecrated by romulus under the same auspices with this city whom we truly hail as the stator and supporter of this city of this empire chase forth this man and this mans associates from thine own altars and from the shrines of other gods from the roofs and hearths of the city from the lives and fortunes of the citizens and consummate the solemn ruin of all enemies of the good all foes of their country all assassins of italy linked in one league of guilt and bond of infamy living or dead by thine eternal torments the dread voice ceasedthe terrible oration ended and instantly with flushed cheek and glaring eye and the foam on his gnashed teeth fierce energetical undaunted catiline sprang to his feet to reply but a deep solemn murmur rose on all sides deepening swelling into a vast overwhelming conclamationdown with the traitoraway with the parricide but unchecked by this awful demonstration of the popular mind he still raised his voice to its highest pitch defying all both gods and men till again it was drowned by that appalling torrent of scorn and imprecation then with a furious gesture and a yelling voice that rose clear above all the din and clamor since he exclaimed my enemies will drive me headlong to destruction i will extinguish the conflagration which consumes me in their universal ruin and pursued by the yells and groans and curses of that great concourse and hunted by wilder furies within his own dark soul the baffled traitor rushed precipitately homeward chapter vi the flight abiit excessit evasit erupit cicero his heart was a living hell as he rushed homeward cut off on every side detected contemned hated what was left to the traitor to retrace his steps was impossiblenor if possible would his indomitable pride have consented to surrender his ambitious schemes his hopes of vengeance he rushed homeward struck down a slave who asked him some officious question spurned orestilla out of his way with a bitter earnest curse barred himself up in his inmost chamber and remained there alone one hour one hour but in that hour what years what ages of time what an eternity of agony was concentrated for once in many years he sat still motionless silent while thought succeeded thought and passion passion with indescribable rapidity and vividness in that one hour all the deeds of his life passed before him from his wild and reckless boyhood to his atrocious and dishonored manhood the victims of his fiendish passions seemed to fleet one by one before his eyes with deathlike visages and ghastly menace the noble virgin whom he had first dishonored scarcely as yet a boy pointed with bloody fingers to the deep selfinflicted wound which yawned in her snowy bosom the vestal who had broken through all bounds of virtue piety and honor sacrificed soul and body to his unpitying lust gazed at him with that unearthly terror in her eyes which glared from them as they looked their last at earth and heaven when she descended young and lovely into a living grave the son whom he had poisoned to render his house vacant for unhallowed nuptials with his whole frame convulsed in agony and the sardonic grin of death on his writhing lips frowned on him his brother who had drawn life from the same soft bosom but whose kindred blood had pleaded vainly against the fratricidal dagger frowned on him his sisters husband that mild and blameless knight whose last breath was spent in words of peace and pardon to his slayer now frowned on him the stern impassive face of marius gratidianus unmoved alike by agony or insult frowned on him in the serene dignity of sustaining virtue men of all ranks and ages done to death by his hand or his head by poison by the knife by drowning by starvationwomen deceived or violated and then murdered while their kisses were yet warm on his lipsinfants tortured to death in the very wantonness of cruelty and crime that must have been nigh akin to madness gibbered and glared upon him these things would seem impossible they are in truth incredible but they are true beyond the possibility of cavil he was indeed one of those unaccountable and extraordinary monsters who thanks to nature appear but once in many ages to whom sin is dear for its own naked self to whom butchery is a pastime and blood and agonies and tears a pleasurable excitement to their mad morbid appetites and in this hour of downfall one by one did his fancy conjure up before him the victims of his merciless love his merciless hatredboth alike sure and deadly it was a strange combination of mind for there must have been in the spirit that evoked these phantoms of the conscience something of remorse if not of repentance pale ghastly grim reproachful they all seemed to him to be appealing to the just heavens for justice and revenge yet there was even more of triumph and proud selfgratulation in his mood than of remorse for the past or of apprehension for the future as he thought of each as he thought of all he in some sort gloated over the memory of his success in some sort derived confidence from the very number of his unpunished crimes they crossed me he muttered to himself and where are theymy fate cried out for their lives and their lives were forfeit who ever stood in my path that has not perished from before my face not one who ever strove with me that has not fallen who ever frowned upon me that has not expiated the bended brow by the deathgrinnot one not one scores hundreds have died for thwarting me but who of men has lived to boast of itnot one he rose from his seat stalked slowly across the room drew his hand across his brow twice with a thoughtful gesture and then said cicero cicero better thou never hadst been born betterbut it must bemy fate my fate demands it and neither eloquence nor wisdom virtue nor valor shall avail to save thee these were brave beautiful wise pious eloquent and what availed it to them my fate my fate shall prevail to recede is to perish is to be scornedto advance is to winto win universal empire and he stretched out his hand as if he clutched an imaginary globeto win fame honor the applause of agesfor with the peoplethe dear peoplefailure alone and poverty are guiltsuccess by craft or crime success is piety and virtueon catiline thy path is onward still upward and onward but not here then he unbarred the door what ho chrea and prompt at the word the freedman entered send out my trustiest slaves summon me hither instantly lentulus and the rest of those who supped here on the calends ha the calends he repeated the word as if some new idea had struck him on the mention of that day and he paused thoughtfully aye paullus arvina i had well nigh forgotteni have it aulus is the man he hath some private grudge at him and beside those he added again addressing the freedman go thyself and bring aulus fulvius hither the son of the senatorhim thou wilt find with cethegus the others at the house of decius brutus near the forum they dine with sempronia get thee gone and beshrew thy life tarry not or thou diest the man quitted the room in haste and catiline continued muttering to himselfaye but for that cursed boy we should have had prneste on the calends he shall repent it ere he die and he shall die too but not yetnot till he is aweary of his very life and then by tortures that shall make the most weary life a boon i have it all the method and the men weak fool thou better hadst been mine then turning to the table he sat down and wrote many letters addressed to men of consular dignity persons of worth and honor declaring that borne down on all sides by false accusations and helpless to oppose the faction of his enemies he yielded to the spite of fortune and was departing for marseilles a voluntary exile not conscious of any crime but careful of the tranquillity of the republic and anxious that no strife should arise from his private griefs to one who afterward almost deceived by his profound and wonderful dissimulation read it aloud in the senate in proof that no civil war was impending he wrote lucius catiline to quintus catulus sends health your most distinguished faith known by experience gives me in mighty perils a grateful confidence thus to address you since i have resolved to prepare no defence in the new steps which i have taken i am resolved to set forth my apology conscious to myself of no crime whichso may the god of honor guard meyou may rely upon as true goaded by injury and insult robbed of the guerdon of my toils and industry that state of dignity at which i aimed i publicly have undertaken according to my wont the cause of the unhappy and oppressed not because i am unable to pay all debts contracted on my own account from my own propertyfrom those incurred in behalf of others the generosity of orestilla and her daughter by their treasures would have released mebut because i saw men honored who deserve no honor and felt myself disgraced on false suspicion on this plea i now take measures honorable in my circumstances for preserving that dignity which yet remains to me i would have written more but i learn that violence is about to be offered me now i commend to you orestilla and trust her to your faith as you love your own children shield her from injury farewell this strange letter intended as after events evidently proved to bear a double sense he had scarce sealed when aulus fulvius was announced for a few moments after he entered catiline continued writing then handing chrea who at a sign had remained in waiting a list of many names let them he said be here prepared for a journey and in arms at the fifth hour prepare a banquet of the richest ample for all these in the atrium in the garden triclinium a feast for tenthe rarest meats the choicest wines the delicatest perfumes the fairest slavegirls in most voluptuous attire at the third hour see to it get thee hence the freedman bowed low and departed on his mission then turning to the young patrician i have sent for you he said the first noble aulus because i hold you the first in honor bravery and action because i believe that you will serve me truly and to the utmost am i deceived catiline you have judged aright and that you cannot serve me more gratefully to yourself than in avenging me on that young pedant paullus arvina the eyes of the youthful profligate flashed dark fire and his whole face beamed with intense satisfaction by all the powers of tartarus he cried show me but how and i will hunt him to the gates of hades catiline nodded to him with an approving smile and after looking around him warily for a minute as if fearful even of the walls overhearing him he stepped close up to him and whispered in his ear for several moments do you conceive me ha he said aloud when he had ended excellent well cried the other in rapturous triumph but how gain an opportunity look you here is his signature some trivial note or other i kept it judging that one day it might serve a purpose you can write i know very cleverlyi have not forgotten old alimentus willwrite to her in his name requesting her to visit him with hortensia otherwise she will doubt the letter then you can meet her and do as i have told you will not that pass my fulvius it shall pass answered the young man confidently my life on it rely on me i hold it done already returned catiline but you comprehend allunstained in all honor until she reach me else were the vengeance incomplete it shall be so but when when best you can accomplish it this night i leave the city you leave the city this night at the sixth hour but to return catiline to return with a victorious an avenging army to return as destroyer with a sword sharper than that of mighty sylla a torch hotter than that of the mad ephesian to return aulus in such guise that ashes and blood only show where romewas but ere that i must join you aye in the appenines at the camp of caius manlius fear me not the deed is accomplishedhatred and vengeance joined to resolve never fail never but lo here come the rest not a word to one of these the burly swordsmith is your man and his fellows strike suddenly and soon and till you strike be silent ha lentulus cethegus good friends allwelcome welcome he cried as they entered eight in number the ringleaders of the atrocious plot grasping each by the hand i have called you to a council a banquet and thence to action good things all answered lentulus so that the first be brief and bold the second long and loud the last daring and decisive they shall be so all three listen this very night i set forth to join caius manlius in his camp things work not here as i would have them my presence keeps alive suspicion terror watchfulness i absent security will grow apace and from that boldness and from boldness rashness so will you find that opportunity which dread of me while present delays fatally watch your time choose your men augment by any means the powers of our faction gain over friends get rid of enemies secretly if you can if not audaciously destroy the consulyou will soon find occasion or if not find make it be ready with the blade and brand to burn and to slaughter so soon as my trumpets shall sound havoc from the hills of fiesol metellus and his men will be sent after me with speed marcius rex will be ordered from the city with his cohorts to capua or apulia or the picene district for in all these the slaves will rise so soon as my eagle soars above the appenine the heart of the city will then lie open to your daggers and they shall pierce it to the core cried cethegus wisely you have resolved my catiline as ever said longinus cassius go and success sit upon your banners be not thou over slow my cassius nor thou cethegus over daring temper each one the metal of the other let your counsels be as the gathering of the stormclouds certain and slow your deeds as the thunderbolt rash rapid irresistible how will you go forth catiline alone in secret asked autronius no by the father of quirinus with my casque on my head and my broadsword on my thigh and with three hundred of my clients at my back they sup in my atrium at the fifth hour of the night and at the sixth we mount our horses i think cicero will not bar our passage by mars he would beat the gates down rather to let you forth the more easily if he be wise he would he is wise said catiline would god that he were less so to be overwise is worse sometimes than to be foolish answered cethegus and to be over bold worse than to be a coward said catiline therefore cethegus be thou neither now my friends i do not say leave me but excuse me until the third hour when we will banquet nay go not forth from the house i pray you it may arouse suspicion which i would have you shun there are books in the library for who would read foils in the garden balls in the fivescourt for who would breathe themselves before supper and lastly there are some fair slaves in the womens chamber for who would listen to the lute or kiss soft lips and not unwilling i have still many things to do ere i depart and those done a farewell caress to orestilla said cethegus laughing aye would i could take her with me do you doubt her then that you fear to leave her if i doubted i would not leave heror i would leave her so as not to doubt her alexion himself cannot in general cure the people whom i doubt i hope you never will doubt me said curius who was present the judas of the faction endeavoring to jest yet more than half feeling what he said i hope notreplied catiline with a strange fixed glance and a singular smile for he did in truth at that very moment half doubt the speaker if i do curius it will not be for long but i must go he added and make ready amuse yourselves as best you can till i return to you come aulus fulvius i must speak with you farther and with the words he left them not indeed to apply themselves to any sport or pleasure but to converse anxiously eagerly almost fearfully on the events which were passing in succession so rapid and so unforeseen their souls were too much absorbed by one dominant idea one devouring passion to find any interest in any small or casual excitement to spirits so absorbed hours fly like minutes and none of those guilty men were aware of the lapse of time until catiline returned dressed in a suit of splendid armor of blue iberian steel embossed with studs and chasings of pure silver with a rich scarlet sagum over it fringed with deep lace his knees were bare but his legs were defended by greaves of the same fabric and material with his corslet and a slave bore behind him his bright helmet triply crested with crimson horsehair his oblong shield charged with a silver thunderbolt and his short broadsword of bilboa steel which was already in those days as famous as in the middle ages he looked indeed every inch a captain and if undaunted valor unbounded energy commanding intellect an eye of lightning unequalled selfpossession endless resource incomparable endurance of cold heat hunger toil watchfulness and extremity of pain be qualities which constitute one then was he a great captain a captain well formed to lead a host of demons the banquet followed with all that could gratify the eye the ear the nostril or the palate the board blazed with lights redoubled by the glare of gold and crystal flowers perfumes incense streamed over all till the whole atmosphere was charged with voluptuous sweetness the softest music breathed from the instruments of concealed performers the rarest wines flowed like water and flashing eyes and wreathed smiles and bare arms and bare bosoms and most voluptuous forms decked to inflame the senses of the coldest were prodigal of charms and soft abandonment no modest pen may describe the orgies that ensuedthe drunkenness the lust the frantic mirth the unnatural mad revelry there was but one at that banquet who although he drank more deeply rioted more sensually laughed more loudly sang more wildly than any of the guests was yet as cool amid that terrible scene of excitement as in the council chamber as on the battle field his sallow face flushed not his hard clear eye swam not languidly nor danced with intoxication his voice quivered not his pulse was as slow as even as its wont that mans frame like his soul was of trebly tempered steel had catiline not been the worst he had been the greatest of romans but his race in rome was now nearly ended the waterclocks announced the fifth hour and leaving the more private triclinium in which the ringleaders alone had feasted followed by his guestswho were flushed reeling and half frenziedwith a steady step a cold eye and a presence like that of mars himself the arch traitor entered the great open hall wherein three hundred of his clients armed sumptuously in the style of legionary horsemen had banqueted magnificently though they had stopped short of the verge of excess all rose to their feet as catiline entered hushed in dread expectation he stood for one moment gazing on his adherents tried veterans every man of them casehardened in the furnace of syllas fiery discipline with proud confidence and triumph in his eye and then addressed them in clear high tones piercing as those of an adamantine trumpet since he said it is permitted to us neither to live in rome securely nor to die in rome honorably i go forthwill you follow me and with an unanimous cry as it had been the voice of one man they answered to the death catiline i go forth harming no one hating no one fearing no one guiltless of all but of loving the people goaded to ruin by the proud patricians injured insulted well nigh maddened i go forth to seek not power nor revenge but innocence and safety if they will leave me peace the lamb shall be less gentle if they will drive me into war the famished lion shall be tamer soldiers of sylla will you have syllas friend in peace for your guardian in war for your captain and again in one tumultuous shout they replied in peace or in war through life and unto death catiline behold then your eagleand with the word he snatched from a marble slab on which it lay covered by tapestry the silver bird of mars hovering with expanded wings over a bannered staff and brandished it on high in triumph behold your standard your omen and your god swear that it shall shine yet again above romes capitol every sword flashed from its scabbard every knee was bent and kneeling with the bright blades all pointed like concentric sunbeams toward that bloody idol in deep emotion and deep awe they swore to be true to the eagle traitors to rome parricides to their country one cup of wine and then to horse and to glory the goblets were brimmed with the liquid madness they were quaffed to the very dregs they clanged empty upon the marble floor ten minutes more and the hall was deserted and mounted on proud horses brought suddenly together by a perfect combination of time and place with the broad steel heads of their javelins sparkling in the moonbeams and the renowned eagle poised with bright wings above them the escort of the roman traitor rode through the city streets at midnight audacious in full military pomp in ordered files with a cavalry clarion timing their steady marchrode unresisted through the city gates under the eyes of a roman cohort to try the fortunes of civil war in the provinces frustrate of massacre and conflagration in the capitol cicero knew it and rejoiced and when he cried aloud on the following day abiit excessit evasit erupithe hath departed he hath stolen out he hath gone from among us he hath burst forth into warhis great heart thrilled and his voice quivered with prophetic joy and conscious triumph he felt even then that he had saved his country chapter vii the ambassadors give first admittance to th ambassadors hamlet it wanted a short time of noon on a fine bracing day in the latter end of november something more than a fortnight had elapsed since the flight of catiline and as no further discoveries had been made nor any tumults or disturbances arisen in the city men had returned to their former avocations and had for the most part forgotten already the circumstances which had a little while before convulsed the public mind with fear or favor no certain tidings had been received or if received divulged to the people of catilines proceedings it being only known that he had tarried for a few days at the countryhouse of caius flaminius flamma near to arretium where he was believed to be amusing himself with boarhunting on the other hand the letters of justification and complaint against cicero had been shewn to their friends by all those who had received them all men of character and weight and their contents had thus gained great publicity the consequence of this was naturally enough that the friends and favorers of the conspiracy acting with singular wisdom and foresight studiously affected the utmost moderation and humility of bearing while complaining every where of the injustice done to catiline and of the false suspicions maliciously cast on many estimable individuals by the lowborn and ambitious person who was temporarily at the head of the state the friends of cicero and the republic on the contrary lay on their oars in breathless expectation of some new occurrence which should confirm the public mind and approve their own conduct well aware that much time could not elapse before catiline would be heard of at the head of an army in the meantime the city wore its wonted aspect men bought and sold and toiled or sported and women smiled and sighed flaunted and wantoned in the streets as if a few short days before they had not been wringing their hands in terror dissolved in tears and speechless from dismay it was a market day and the forum was crowded almost to overflowing the country people had flocked in as usual to sell the produce of their farms and their wagons stood here and there laden with seasonable fruits cheeses and jars of wine pigeons in wicker cages fresh herbs and such like articles of traffic many had brought their wives sunburned blackhaired and blackeyed from their villas in the latin or sabine country to purchase city luxuries many had come to have their lawsuits decided many to crave justice against their superiors from the tribunes of the people many to get their wills registered to pay or borrow money and to transact that sort of business for which the day was set aside nor were the townsmen absent from the gay scene for to them the nundin or market days were holydays in which the courts of law were shut and the offices closed to them at least although open to the rural citizens for the despatch of business the members of the city tribes crowded therefore to the forum many of these too accompanied by their women to buy provisions to ask for news from the country and to stare at the uncouth and sturdy forms of the farmers or admire the black eyes and merry faces of the country lasses it was a lively and gay scene the bankers shops distinguished by the golden shields of the samnites suspended from the lintels of their doors were thronged with moneychangers and alive with the hum of traffic ever and anon some curule magistrate in his fringed toga with his lictors in number proportioned to his rank would come sweeping through the dense crowd or some plebeian officer with his ushers and beadles or before whom the ranks of the multitude would open of their own accord and bow reverentially some whitestoled vestal virgin with her fair features closely veiled from profane eyes the sacred fillets on her head and her lictor following her dainty step with his shouldered fasces street musicians there were also and shows of various kinds about which the lower orders of the people collected eagerly and here and there among the white stoles and gayly colored shawls of the matrons and maidens might be seen the flowered togas and showy headdresses of those unfortunate girls many of them rare specimens of female beauty whose character precluded them from wearing the attire of their own sex ha fabius sanga whither thou in such haste through the crowd cried a fine manly voice to a patrician of middle age who was forcing his way hurriedly among the jostling mob near to the steps of the comitium or building appropriated to the reception of ambassadors the person thus addressed turned his head quickly though without slackening his speed ah is it thou arvina come with me thou art young and strong give me thy arm and help me through this concourse willingly replied the young man but why are you in such haste he continued as he joined him you can have no business here today aye but i have my paullus i am the patron to these gallic ambassadors who have come hither to crave relief from the senate for their people they must receive their answer in the comitium today and i fear me much i am late ah by the gods i saw them on that day they entered the city right stout and martial barbarians what is their plea will they succeed i fear not answered sanga they are too poor senatorial relief must be bought nowadays the longest purse is the most righteous cause their case is a hard one too their nation is oppressed with debt both private and public they have been faithful allies to the state and served it well in war and now seek remission of some grievous tributes but what shall we say they are poorbarbarianstheir aid not needed now by the republicand as you know my paullus justice is sold now in rome like silk for its weight in gold the more shame answered paullus it was not by such practices that our fathers built up this grand edifice of the republic riches have done it paullus riches and commerce while we had many tillers of the ground and few merchants we were brave in the field and just at home think you then that the spirit of commerce is averse to justice and bravery and freedom no i do not think it arvina i know it answered fabius sanga who with the truth and candor of a patrician of romes olden school possessed and that justly much repute for wisdom and foresight all mercantile communities are base communities look at tyre in old times look at carthage in our grandfathers days at corinth in our own merchants are never patriots and rich men seldom unless they be landholders but see see there are my clients descending the steps of the comitium by all the gods i am too late their audience is ended now by themis the goddess of justice will they deem me also venal as he spoke they had come to the foot of the grand flight of marble steps leading up to the doors of the grcostasis or comitium or rather had come as near to the foot as the immense concourse which had gathered about that spot to stare at the wild figures and foreign gait of the ambassadors would allow them to approach it is in vain to press forward yet my sanga a moment or two and these clowns will be satisfied with gazing yet by hercules i cannot blame them for these highlanders are wondrous muscular and stout warriors to look upon and their garb although somewhat savage is very martial and striking and in truth their celtic bonnets with their long single eagle feathers set somewhat obliquely on their abundant auburn hair their saffroncolored shirts tightfitting trews of tartan plaid and variegated mantles floating over their brawny shoulders their chains and bracelets of gold and silver their long daggers in their girdles and their tremendous broadswords swinging at their thighs did present a strange contrast to the simple tunics of white woollen and plain togas of the same material which constituted the attire of ninetenths of the spectators i mustmust get nearer replied sanga anxiously i must speak with them i can see by the moody brows and sullen looks of the elder nobles and by the compressed lips and fiery glances of the young warriors that matters have gone amiss with them i shall be blamed i know for itbut i have failed in my duty as their patron and must bear it there will be mischief i pray you let us pass my friends he continued addressing the people i am the patron of their nation let us pass but it was in vain that they besought and strove the pressure of the mob was if anything augmented and paullus was compelled to remain motionless with his companion hoping that the allobroges would move in their direction but while they were thus waiting a thin keenlooking man pressed up to the ambassadors from the farther side while they were yet upon the steps and saluting them cordially pressed their hands as if he were an old and familiar friend nor did the highlanders appear less glad to see him for they shook his hand warmly and spoke to him with vehement words and sparkling eyes who is that man who greets our allobroges so warmly asked arvina of his companion know you the man i know him answered sanga watching the gestures which accompanied their conversation with an eager eye although too far off to hear anything that was passing it is one of these traders of whom we spoke but now and as pestilent a knave and rogue as ever sold goods by short measure and paid his purchases in light coin publius umbrenus is the man a gallic trader he hath become rich by the business he hath carried on with this same tribe bartering roman wares goldsmiths work trinkets cutlery wines and the like against their furs and hides and above all against their amber he gains three hundred fold by every barter and yet by the god of faith he brings them in his debt after all and yet the simpleminded credulous barbarians believe him their best friend i would buy it at no small price to know what he saith to them see he points to the comitium by your head paullus he is poisoning their minds against the senate see said arvina they descend the steps in the other direction he is leading them away with him somewhither to no good end said sanga emphatically and then smiting his breast with his hand he continued evidently much afflicted my poor clients my poor simple highlanders he will mislead them to their ruin they are going toward vestas temple said arvina if we should turn back through the arch of fabius and so enter into the western branch of the sacred way we might overtake them near the ruminal figtree you might for you are young and active but i am growing old paullus and the gout afflicts my feet and makes me slower than my years will you do so and mark whither he leads them and come back and tell me you shall find me in nattas the booksellers shop at the corner of the street argiletum willingly sanga answered the young man the rather if it may profit these poor gauls anything thou art a good youth paullus the gods reward it to thee remember nattas bookshop doubt me not said arvina and he set off at a pace so rapid as brought him up with those whom he was pursuing within ten minutes the ambassadors six or eight in number among whom the old whiteheaded chief he had observedwhen he went with hortensia and his betrothed to see their ingress into rometogether with the young warrior whose haughty bearing he had noticed on that occasion were most eminent had been joined by another roman beside umbrenus him paullus recognised at once for titus volturcius a native and nobleman of crotona a greek city on the gulf of tarentum although a citizen of rome he was a man of evil repute as a wild debauchee a gambler and seducer and arvina had observed him more than once in company with cornelius lentulus this led him to suspect that sanga was perhaps more accurate in his suspicions than he himself imagined and that something might be in progress here against the republic he watched them warily therefore and soon found an ample confirmation of the worst he imagined in seeing them enter the house of decius brutus the husband of the beautiful but infamous sempronia it must not be supposed that the privity of these various individuals to the conspiracy was accurately known to young arvina but he was well aware that lentulus and catiline were sworn friends and that sempronia was the very queen of those abandoned and licentious ladies who were the instigators and rewarders of the young nobles in their profligacy and their crimes it did not require therefore any wondrous degree of foresight to see that something dangerous was probably brewing in this amalgamation of ingredients so incongruous as roman nobles and patrician harlots with wild barbarians from the gallic highlands without tarrying therefore longer than to ascertain that he was not mistaken in the house he hurried back to meet sanga at the appointed place promising himself that not sanga only but cicero himself should be made acquainted with that which he had discovered so opportunely the argiletum was a street leading down from the vegetable mart which lay just beyond the porta fluminiana or river gate to the banks of the tiber at the quays called pulchrum littus or the beautiful shore it was therefore a convenient place of meeting for persons who had parted company in the forum particularly when going in that direction which had been taken by umbrenus and the ambassadors hastening onward to the street appointedwhich was for the most part inhabited by booksellers copyists and embellishers of illuminated manuscripts beside a few tailorshe was hailed just as he reached the river gate by a wellknown voice from a cross street and turning round he felt his hand warmly grasped by an old friend aristius fuscus one of the noble youths with whom he had striven in the campus martius on that eventful day when he first visited the house of catiline hail paullus exclaimed the new comer i have not seen you in many days where have you been since you beat us all in the quinquertium absent from town on business of the state part of the time my fuscus answered arvina shaking his friends hand gayly i was sent to prneste with my troop of horse before the calends of november and returned not until the ides and since that i fancyreplied the other laughing you have been sunning yourself in the bright smiles of the fair julia i thought you were to have led her home as your bride ere this time you are wrong for once good friend said paullus with a wellpleased smile julia is absent from the city also she and hortensia are on a visit to their farm at the foot of mount algidus i have not seen them since my return from prneste your slaves i trow know every milestone by this time on the via labicana do you write to her daily not so indeed aristius he replied we are too long betrothed and too confident each in the good faith of the other to think it needful to kill my poor slaves in bearing amatory billets you are wise paullus as you are true and will i hope be happy lovers the gods grant it replied paullus do they return shortly it is long since i have visited hortensia she would do justly to refuse me admittance when next i go to salute her not until after the next market day but here i must leave you i am going to nattas shop in the argiletum to purchase books ha or to the tailors the last i presume gay bridegroomthere are you know two nattas natta the bookseller is my man but i go thither not as a buyer but to meet a friend fabius sanga a very wise and virtuous roman replied the other stopping at the corner of the street argiletum but tarry a moment when shall we meet again i am going down to the hippodrome can you not join me there when you have finished your business with sanga i can gladly answered arvina as they stopped previous to separating a young man who had been walking for some distance close at their heels passed them nodding as he did so to arvina who returned his salutation very distantly aulus fulvius said aristius as paullus bowed to him as bad a specimen of a young patrician as one might see for many days even if he searched for rascals as the philosopher did for an honest man by lanthorns light at noon he has been following our steps by my headto pick up our stray words and weave them into calumnies and villainy i care not answered arvina lightly he may make all he can of what he heard we were talking no treason no truly not even lovers treason said his friend well do not tarry long arvina i will not be assured not the fourth part of an hour see there is fabius sanga awaiting me even now walk slowly and i will overtake you before you reach the campus and with the word he turned down the argiletum and joined the patron of the allobroges at the booksellers door in the meantime aulus fulvius who had heard all that he desired wheeled about and walked back toward the carmental gate but as he passed the head of the argiletum he cast a lurid glance of singular malignity upon arvina who was standing in full view conversing with his friend and muttered between his teeth the fool the hypocrite the pedant well said wise catiline that it matters not much whether one listen to his friends so he listen well to his enemies the foolso he thinks he shall have julia but he never shall by hades never a slenderly made boy dressed in a succinct huntsmans tunic with subligacula or drawers reaching to within a hands breadth of his knee was loitering near the corner gazing wistfully on arvina and as aulus muttered those words half aloud he jerked his head sharply around and looked very keenly at the speaker never shall have julia he repeated to himself he must have spoken that concerning arvina i wonder who he is i never saw him before i must knowi must know forthwith for he shall have her by heaven and him who dwells in it he shall have her and turning a lingering and languid look toward paullus the slight boy darted away in pursuit of aulus a moment afterward arvina his conference with sanga ended and ignorant of all that byplay took the road leading to the campus eager to overtake his friend aristius chapter viii the latin villa i come o agamemnons daughter fair to this thy sylvan lair electra through a soft lap in the wooded chain of mount algidus a bright pellucid stream after wheeling and fretting among the crags and ledges of the upper valleys winds its way gently toward the farfamed tiber shut in on every side except the south by the lower spurs of the mountain ridge in which it is so snugly nestled covered with rich groves of chesnuttrees and sheltered on the northward by the dark pines of the loftier steeps it were difficult to conceive a fairer site for a villa than that sweet vale accordingly on a little knoll in the jaws of the gorge whence issued that clear streamlet facing the pleasant south yet sheltered from its excessive heats by a line of superb plane trees festooned with luxuriant vines there stood a long low building of the antique form built of darkcolored stone a villa in the days of cicero was a very different thing from the luxurious pleasurehouses which came into vogue in the days of the later emperors of which pliny has given us descriptions so minute and glowing yet even his tusculan retreat was a building of vast pretension when compared with this which was in fact neither more nor less than an old roman farmhouse of that innocent and unsophisticated day when the consulars of the republic were tillers of the soil and when heroes returned from the almost immortal triumph to the management of the spade and the ploughshare this villa had it is true been adorned somewhat and fitted to the temporary abode of individuals more refined and elegant than the rough steward and rustic slaves who were its usual tenants yet it still retained its original form and was adapted to its original uses the house itself which was but two stories high was in form a hollow square to the courts enclosed in which access was gained by a pair of lofty wooden gates in the rear it had in the first instance presented on all sides merely a blank wall exteriorly all the windows looking into the court the centre of which was occupied by a large tank of water the whole interior serving the purpose of a farm yard the whole ground floor of the building had formerly been occupied by stables roothouses winepresses dairies cheeserooms and the like and by the slaves kitchen which was the first apartment toward the right of the entrance the upper story contained the granaries and the dormitories of the workmen and three sides still remained unaltered the front however of the villa had been pierced with a handsome doorway and several windows a colonnade of rustic stonework had been carried along the faade and a beautiful garden had been laid out before it with grassy terraces clipped hedges box trees transmuted by the gardeners art into similitudes of peacocks centaurs tritons swans and many other forms of fowls or fishes unknown alike and unnamed by gods or mortals the sun was within about half an hour of his setting and his slant beams falling through a gap in the western hills streamed down into the little valley casting long stripes of alternate light and shadow over the smoothly shaven lawn sparkling upon the ripples of the streamlet and gilding the embrowned or yellow foliage of the sere hillsides with brighter and more vivid colors at this pleasant hour notwithstanding the lateness of the season and looking upon this pleasant scene a group of females were collected under the rustic colonnade of italian marble engaged in some of those light toils which in feminine hands are so graceful the foremost of these seated apart somewhat from the others were the stately and still beautiful hortensia and her lovely daughter both of them employed in twirling the soft threads from the merrily revolving spindle into large osier baskets and the elder lady glancing at times toward the knot of slave girls as if to see that they performed their light tasks and at times if their mirth waxed too loud checking it by a gesture of her elevated finger a little while before julia had been singing in her sweet low voice one of those favorite old ballads which were so much prized by the romans and to which livy is probably so much indebted for the redundant imagery of his pictured page commemorative of the deeds and virtues of the old houses but as her lay came to its end her eye had fallen on the broad bloodred disc of the descending daygod and had followed him upon his downward path until he was lost to view among the tangled coppices that fringed the brow of the western hill her hands dropped listlessly into her lap releasing the snowwhite thread which they had drawn out so daintily and keeping her eyes still fixed steadily on the point where he had disappeared she gave vent to her feelings in a longdrawn heigho in every language and in all times expression of sentimental sadness wherefore so sad a sigh my julia asked hortensia gazing affectionately at the saddened brow of the fair girlmethinks there is nothing very melancholy here nothing that should call forth repining see see hortensia how he sinks like a dying warrior amid those sanguine clouds cried the girl pointing to the great orb of the sun just as its last limb was disappearing and into a couch of bays and myrtles like that warrior when his duty is done his fame won exclaimed hortensia throwing her arm abroad enthusiastically and truly the hillside behind which he was lost to view was feathered thick with the shrubs of which she spokemethinks there is nought for which to sigh in such a setting either of the sun or the hero but see how dark and gloomy he has left all behind himthe river which was golden but now while he smiled upon it now that he is gone is leaden but he shall rise again tomorrow brighter and yet more glorious and yet more gloriously shall the stream blaze back his rising than his setting lustre alas alas hortensia wherefore alas my julia for so will not the warrior rise who sinks forever although it may be into a bed of glory and if the setting of the sun leave all here lustreless and dark and gloomy although that must arise again tomorrow what must the setting do of one who shall arise no more for ever whose light of life was to one heart what the sunbeam was to the streamlet but which unlike that sunbeam shall never shine on the heart any more hortensia my poor child cried the noble matron affected almost to tears you are thinking of paullus when am i not thinking of him mother said the girl remember we have left the city seeking these quiet shades in order to eschew that turmoil that peril in the heat of which he is now striving for his country remember that he will plunge into all that strife the more desperately because he fancies that he was too remiss before remember this hortensia and say if thou canst that i have no cause for sad forebodings that can i not my julia she repliedfor who is there on earth who knoweth what the next sun shall bring forth the sunshine of today oft breeds the storm of tomorrowand again from the tempest of the eve how oft is born the brightest and most happy morning wisest is he and happiest my child who wraps himself in his own virtue careless of what the day shall bring to pass and confident that all the shafts of fortune must rebound harmless and blunted from his sure armor of philosophy must not the heart have bled hortensia before it can so involve itself in virtuemust not such philosophy be the tardy offspring of great sorrow for the most part i fear it is so julia answered the matron but some souls there are so innocent and quiet so undisturbed by the outward world that they have that almost by nature which others only win by suffering and tears cold and unfeeling souls i fancy replied the girl for it appears to me that this philosophy which smiles on all spite of fortune must be akin to selfish and morose indifference i see not much to love hortensia or to admire in the stoic nor much more i imagine said hortensia not sorry to draw her mind from the subject which occupied it so painfully in the epicurean much less answered julia quickly his creed is mere madness and impiety to believe that the gods care nothing for the good or evilye gods she interrupted herself suddenly almost with a shriek what is this a slave riding as if for life on a foaming horse from the cityward oh my prophetic soul hortensia and she turned pale as death although she remained quite firm and selfpossessed it may be nothing julia or it may be good tidings answered hortensia although she was in truth scarce less alarmed than her daughter by the unexpected arrival good tidings travel not so quickly beside what can there be of good so unexpected but we shall knowwe shall know quickly and she arose as if to descend the steps into the garden but she sank back again into her seat crying i am faint i am sick here hortensia and she laid her hand on her heart as she spoke nay do not tarry with me i pray thee see what he brings anything but the torture of suspense i go i go my child cried the matron descending the marble steps to the lawn on which the slave had just drawn up his panting horse he has a letter in his hand be of good courage and a moment afterward she cried out joyously it is in his hand julia paullus arvinas hand fear nothing and with a quick light step she returned and gave the little slip of vellum into the small white hand which trembled so much that it scarcely could receive it a snowwhite dove to thee kind venus cried the girl raising her eyes in gratitude to heaven before she broke the seal but as she did so and read the first lines her face was again overcast and her eyes were dilated with wild terror it is soit is sohortensia i knewoh my soul i knew it and she let fall the letter and fell back in her seat almost fainting whatwhat exclaimed hortensia it is arvinas handhe must be in lifewhat is it my own julia wounded almost to death faltered the girl in accents half choked with anguish read read aloud kind mother alarmed by her daughters suffering and terror hortensia caught the parchment from her half lifeless fingers and scanning its contents hastily with her eyes read as follows paullus arvina to julia and hortensia greeting your well known constancy and courage give me the confidence to write frankly to you concealing nothing your affection makes me sure that you will hasten to grant my request last night in a tumult aroused by the desperate followers of catiline stricken down and severely wounded i narrowly missed death great thanks are due to the gods that the assassins weapon failed to penetrate to my vitals be not too much alarmed however alexion ciceros friend and physician has visited me and declares that unless fever supervene there is no danger from the wound still i am chained to my couch wearily and in pain with none but slaves about me at such times the heart asks for more tender ministeringwherefore i pray you julia let not one day elapse but come to me hortensia by the gods bring her to the city catiline hath fled the peril hath passed overbut lo i am growing fainti can write no more nowthere is a swimming of my brain and a cloud over my eyes farewell come to me quickly that it prove not too latecome to me quickly if you indeed love arvina we will go julia we will go to him instantly said hortensiabut be of good cheer poor child alexion declares that there is no danger and no one is so wise as he be of good cheer we will set forth this night this hour ere daybreak we will be in rome hark lydia she continued turning to one of the slave girls call me the steward old davus let the boy gota take the horse of the messenger and bring thou the man hither then she added addressing julia i will question him farther while they prepare the carpentum ho davusfor the old slave who was close at hand entered forthwithhave the mules harnessed instantly to the carpentum and let the six thracians who accompanied us from rome saddle their horses and take arms ill fortune has befallen young arvina we must return to town this nightas speedily as may be within an hour hortensia all shall be in readiness on my head be it else it is welland hark you send hither wine and breadwe will not wait until they make supper ready beside this youth is worn out with his long ride and needs refreshment as the steward left the room she gazed attentively at the young slave who had brought the despatch and not recognising his features a half feeling of suspicion crossed her mind so that she stooped and whispered to julia who looked up hastily and answered nonobut what matters it it is his handwriting and his signet i do not know said hortensia doubtfullyi think he would have sent one of the older men one whom we knew i think he would have sent medonthen she said to the boy i have never seen thy face before i believe good youth how long hast thou served arvina since the ides of october hortensia he purchased me of marcus crassus purchased thee ha said hortensia yet more doubtfully than beforethat is strange his household was large enough already how came he then to purchase thee i was hired out by crassus as is his wont to do to crispus the swordsmith in the sacred waya cruel tyrant and oppressor whom when he was barbarously scourging me for a small error noble arvina saw and then finding his intercession fruitless purchased me as he said that thereafter i should be entreated as a man not as a beast of burthen it is true by the gods exclaimed the girl clasping her hands enthusiastically and a bright blush coming up into her pale face had i been told the action without the actors name i should have known therein arvina thou shouldst be grateful therefore to this good arvinasaid hortensia gazing at him with a fixed eye she knew not wherefore yet with a sort of dubious presentiment of coming evil grateful cried the youth clasping his hands fervently togetherye gods grateful hortensia by your head i worship himi would die for him how came he to send thee on this mission why sent he not medon or euphranor or one of his elder freedmen medon he could not send nor euphranor it went ill with them both in that affray wherein my lord was wounded the older slaves keep watch around his bed the strongest and most trusty are under arms in the atrium and wert thou with him in that same affray i was with him hortensia when fell it out and for what cause hast thou not heard hortensiahas he not told you by the gods i thought the world had known it how before catiline may it be ill with him and his went forth from the city he and his friends and followers attacked the consuls on the palatine with armed violence it was fought through the streets doubtfully for near three hours and the fortunes of the republic were at stake and well nigh despaired of if not lost cicero was down on the pavement and catilines sword flashing over him when with his slaves and freedmen my master cut his way through the ranks of the conspiracy and bore off the great magistrate unharmed but as he turned a villain buried his sica in his back and though he saved the state he well nigh lost his life to win everlasting fame and the love of all good citizens hast seen him since he was wounded exclaimed julia who had devoured every word he uttered with insatiable longing and avidity surely replied the boy i received that scroll from his own handsmy orders from his own lipsspare not an instant he said jason tarry not though you kill your steed if you would have me live let julia see this letter before midnight it lacks as yet four hours of midnight doth it not noble julia five i think but how looked how spoke he is he in great pain jason how seemed he when you left him he was very pale juliavery wan and his lips ashy white his voice faltered very much moreover and when he had made an end of speaking he swooned away i heard that he was better somewhat ere i set out to come hither but the physician speaks of fever to be apprehended on any irritation or excitement should you delay long in visiting him i fear the consequences might be perilous indeed do you hear do you hear that hortensia by the gods let us go at once we need no preparation we will go julia old davus hour hath nearly passed already we will be in the city before daybreak fear not my sweet one all shall go well with our beloved paullus the gods grant it here is wine jason said hortensia drink boy you must needs be weary after so hard a gallop you have done well and shall repose here this night tomorrow when well rested and refreshed you shall follow us to rome pardon me lady said the youth i am not weary love for arvina hath prevailed over all weariness furnish me i beseech you with a fresh horse and let me go with you it shall be as you wish said hortensia but your frame seems too slender to endure much labor the gods have given me a willing heart hortensiaand the strong will makes strong the feeble body well spoken youth your devotion shall lose you nothing believe me come julia let us go and array us for the journey the nights are cold now in december and the passes of the algidus are bleak and gusty the ladies left the room and before the hour which davus had required was spent they were seated together in the rich carpentum well wrapped in the soft manycolored woollen fabrics which supplied the place of furs among the romansit being considered a relic of barbarism to wear the skins of beasts until the love for this decoration again returned in the last centuries of the empire old davus grasped the reins two thracian slaves well mounted and armed with the small circular targets and lances of their native land gallopped before the carriage accompanied by the slave who had brought the message while four more similarly equipped brought up the rear and thus before the moon had arisen travelling at a rapid pace they cleared the cultivated country and were involved in the wild passes of mount algidus scarcely however had they wound out of sight when gallopping at mad and reckless speed down a wild woodroad on the northern side of the villa there came a horseman bestriding a white courser of rare symmetry and action now almost black with sweat and envelopped with foamflakes the rider was the same singularlooking darkcomplexioned boy who had overheard the exclamation of aulus fulvius concerning young arvina uttered at the head of the street argiletum his body was bent over the rude saddlebow with weariness and he reeled to and fro as if he would have fallen from his horse when he pulled up at the door of the villa i would speak he said in a faint and faltering voice presently with hortensiamatters of life and death depend on it the gods avert the omen cried the woman to whom he had addressed himself hortensia hath gone but now to rome with young julia on the arrival of a message from arvina too late too latecried the boy beating his breast with both hands they are betrayed to death or dishonor how what is this what say you cried the chief slave of the farm a person of some trust and importance who had just come up it was a tall slight fairhaired slave who bore the messagehe called himself jasonhe rode a bay horse did he not asked the new comer he was he did a bay horse with one white foot before and a white star on his forehead a rare beast from numidia or cyrenaica replied the steward who was quite at home in the article of horseflesh he brought tidings that arvina is sorely wounded he brought tidings therefore it was that they set forth at so short notice he left the horse here and was mounted on a black horse of the farm arvina is not wounded that bay horse is cethegus the conspirators arvina hath sent no message they are betrayed i tell you man aulus fulvius awaits them with a gang of desperadoes in the deep cleft of the hills where the crossroad comes in by which you reach the flaminian from the labican way arm yourselves speedily and follow else will they carry julia to catilines camp in the appenines beside fiesol what there will befall her catilines character best may inform you cometo armsmen to horse and follow but ignorant of the person of the messenger lacking an authorized head fearful of taking the responsibility and incurring the reproach perhaps the punishment of credulity they loitered and hesitated and though they did at length get to horse and set out in pursuit it was not till hortensias cavalcade had been gone above an hour meanwhile unconscious of what had occurred behind them and eager only to arrive at rome as speedily as possible the ladies journeyed onward with full hearts in silence and in sorrow there is a deep dark gorge in the mountain chain through which this road lay nearly a mile in length with a fierce torrent on one hand and a sheer face of craggy rocks towering above it on the other beyond the torrent the chesnut woods hung black and gloomy along the precipitous slopes with their ragged treetops distinctly marked against the clear obscure of the nocturnal sky midway this gorge a narrow broken path comes down a cleft in the rocky wall on the right hand side as you go toward rome by which through a wild and broken country the flaminian way can be reached and by it the district of etruria and the famous val darno they had just reached this point and were congratulating themselves on having thus accomplished the most difficult part of their journey when the messenger who rode in front uttered a long clear whistle the twang of a dozen bowstrings followed from some large blocks of stone which embarrassed the pass at the junction of the two roads and both the thracians who preceded the carnage went down one of them killed outright the other with his horse shot dead under him ho traitor shouted the latter extricating himself from the dead charger and hurling his javelin with fatal accuracy at the false slave thou at least shalt not boast of thy villainy treachery treachery turn back hortensia fly avus to me to me comrades but with a loud shout down came young aulus fulvius from the pass armed head to foot as a roman legionary soldierdown came the gigantic smith caius crispus and fifteen men at least with blade and buckler at his back the slaves fought desperately for their mistress liberty or life but the odds were too great both in numbers and equipment and not five minutes passed before they were all cut down and stretched out dead or dying on the rocky floor of the dark defile the strife ended aulus fulvius strode quickly to the carpentum which had been overturned in the affray and which his lawless followers were already ransacking one of these wretches his own namesake aulus the swordsmiths foreman had already caught julia in his licentious grasp and was about to press his foul lips to her cheek when the young patrician snatched her from his arms and pushed him violently backward ho fool and villain he exclaimed barest thou to think such dainties are for thee she is sacred to catiline and vengeance this one at least then shouted the ruffian making at hortensia nor that one either cried the smith interposing but as aulus the foreman still struggled to lay hold of the patrician lady he very coolly struck him across the bare brow with the edge of his heavy cutting sword cleaving him down to the teethnay then take that thou foolthen turning to fulvius he added he was a brawler always and would have kept no discipline now or ever well done smith replied aulus fulvius the same fate to all who disobey orders we have no time for dalliance now it will be day ere long and we must be miles hence ere it dawns bind me hortensia firmly to yon chesnut tree stout smith but do not harm her we too have mothers he added with a singular revulsion of feeling at such a moment for you my beauty we will have you consoled by a warmer lover than that most shallowpated fool and sophist arvina come i say come no one shall harm you and without farther words despite all her struggles and remonstrances he bound a handkerchief tightly under her chin to prevent her cries wrapped her in a thick crimson pallium and springing upon his charger with the assistance of the smith placed her before him on the saddlecloth and set off a furious pace through the steep bypath leaving the defile tenanted only by the dying and the dead with the exception of hortensia who rent the deaf air in vain with frantic cries of anguish until at last she fainted nature being too weak for the endurance of such prolonged agony about an hour afterward she was released and carried to her roman mansion alive and unharmed in body but almost frantic with despair by the party of slaves who had come up too late to save her julia under the guidance of the young unknown he when he perceived that his efforts had been useless and when he learned how julia had been carried off by the conspirators leaving the party to escort hortensia and bear their slaughtered comrades homeward rode slowly and thoughtfully away into the recesses of the wild country whither aulus had borne his captive exclaiming in a low silent voice with a clinched hand and eyes turned heavenward i will die ere dishonor reach her aid me aid me thou nemesisaid me to save and avenge chapter ix the mulvian bridge under which king bezonian speak or die two gentlemen of verona on that same night and nearly at the same hour wherein the messenger of aulus fulvius arrived at the latin villa there was a splendid banquet given in a house near the forum it was the house of decius brutus unworthy bearer of a timehonored name the husband of the infamous sempronia at an earlier hour of the evening a great crowd had been gathered round the doors eager to gaze on the ambassadors of the highland gauls who their mission to rome ended unsuccessfully feasted there for the last time previous to their departure as it grew dark however tired of waiting in the hope of seeing the plaided warriors depart the throng had dispersed and with exception of the city watches and the cohorts which from hour to hour perambulated them the streets were unusually silent and almost deserted there was no glare of lights from the windows of brutus house as there would be in these days and in modern mansions to indicate the scene of festivity for it was in the inmost chamber of the most secluded suite of apartments that the boards had been spread for the comissatio or nocturnal revel the cna or dinner had been partaken by all the guests previous to their arrival at their entertainers and the tables were laid only with light dainties and provocatives to thirst such as salted meats and fishes the roe of the sturgeon highly seasoned with herbs and fruits and pastry and confections of all kinds rich urns with heaters containing hot spiced wines prepared with honey smoked on the boards of costly citrean wood intermixed with crystal vases filled with the rarest vintages of the falernian hills cooled and diluted with snowwater and around the circular tables on the tapestried couches reclined the banqueters of both sexes quaffing the rich wines to strange toasts jesting and laughing wildly singing at times themselves as the myrtle branch and the lute went round at times listening to the licentious chaunts of the unveiled and almost unrobed dancing girls or the obscene and scurrilous buffoonery of the mimes and clowns who played so conspicuous a part in the roman entertainments of a later period among these banqueters there was not a single person not privy to the conspiracy and few who have not been introduced already to the acquaintance of the reader but among these few was semproniasempronia who could be all things at all times and to all personswho with all the softness and grace and beauty of the most feminine of her sex possessed all the daring energy vigor wisdom of the bravest and most intriguing manaccomplished to the utmost in all the liberal arts a poetess and minstrel unrivalled by professional performers a dancer more finished and voluptuous than beseemed a roman matron a scholar in both tongues the greek as well as her own and priding herself on her ability to charm the gravest and most learned sages by the modesty of her bearing and the wealth of her intellect as easily as the most profligate debauchees by her facetious levity her loose wit and her abandonment of all restraint to the wildest license on this evening she had strained every nerve to fascinate to dazzle to astonish she had danced as a bacchanal with her luxuriant hair dishevelled beneath a crown of vine leaves with her bright shoulders and superb bust displayed at every motion by the displacement of the panthers skin which alone covered them timing her graceful steps to the clang of the silver cymbals which she waved and clashed with her bare arms above her stately head and showing off the beauties of her form in attitudes more classically graceful more studiously indelicate than the most reckless figurante of our days she had sung every species of melody and rythm from the wildest dithyrambic to the severest and most grave alcaic she had struck the lute calling forth notes such as might have performed the miracles attributed to orpheus and amphion she had exerted her unrivalled learning so far as to discourse eloquently in the uncouth and almost unknown tongues of germany and gaul for she had gaulish hearers gaulish admirers whom whether from mere female vanity whether from the awakening of some strange unbridled passion or whether from some deeper cause she was bent on delighting for mixed in brilliant contrast with the violet and flower enwoven tunics with the myrtlecrowned perfumed lovelocks of the roman feasters were seen the gay and manychequered plaids the jewelled weapons and loose lionlike tresses of the gallic highlanders and the wild blue eyes sharp and clear as the untamed falcons gazing in wonder or glancing in childlike simplicity at the strange scenes and gorgeous luxuries which amazed all their senses the tall and powerful young chief who had on several occasions attracted the notice of arvina and whom he had tracked but a few days before into this very house reclined on the same couch with its accomplished mistress and it was on him that her sweetest smiles her most speaking glances were levelled for him that her charms were displayed so unreservedly and boldly and the eyes of the young gaul flashed at times a strange fire but it was difficult to tell if it were indignation or desire that kindled that sharp flameand his cheek burned with a hectic and unwonted hue but whether it was the hue of shame or passion what eye could determine one thing alone was evident that he encouraged her in her wild licence and affected if he did not feel the most decided admiration for her beauty his hand had toyed with hers his fingers had strayed through the mazes of her superb raven ringlets his lip had pressed hers unrebuked and his ear had drunk in long murmuring lowbreathed sighs and whispers unheard by any other her roman lovers in other words twothirds of those present for she was no chary dame looked at each other some with a sneering smile some with a shrewd and knowing glance and some with illdissembled jealousy but not one of them all so admirable was her dissimulationif that may be called admirable which is most odiouscould satisfy himself whether she was indeed captivated by the robust and manly beauty of the young barbarian or whether it was merely a piece of consummate acting the more to attach him to their cause it might have been observed had the quick eye of catiline been there prompt to read human hearts as if they were written booksthat the older envoys looked with suspicious and uneasy glances at the demeanor of their young associate that they consulted one another from time to time with grave and searching eyes and that once or twice when sempronia who alone of those present understood their language was at a distance they uttered a few words in gaelic not in the most agreeable or happiest accent wilder and wilder waxed the revelry and now the slaves withdrew and breaking off into pairs or groups the guests dispersed themselves among the peristyles dimly illuminated with many twinkling lamps and shrubberies of myrtle and laurestinus which adorned the courts and gardens of the proud mansions some to plot deeds of private revenge private crueltysome to arrange their schemes of public insurrectionsome to dally in secret corners with the fair patricianssome to drain mightier draughts than they had yet partaken some to gamble for desperate stakes all to drown care and the anguish of conscious guilt in the fierce pleasure of excitement apart from the rest stood two of the elder gauls in deep and eager conferenceone the whiteheaded chief and leader of the embassy the other a stately and noblelooking man of some fortyfive or fifty years they were watching their comrade who had just stolen away with one arm twined about the fair sempronias waist and her hand clasped in his through the inner peristyle into the womens chambers feargus i doubt him said the old man in a low guarded whisper i doubt him very sorely these roman harlots are made to bewitch any man much more us gael whose souls kindle at a spark it is true phadraig answered the other still speaking in their own tongue saw ever any man such infamyand thesethese dogs and goats call us barbarians us by the spirit of thunder who would die fifty deaths every hour ere we would see our matrons nay but our matrons basest slaves demean themselves as these patricians base carnal bloodyminded beasts are theyand yet forsooth they boast themselves the masters of the world alas that it should be so feargus answered the other but so it is that they are masters and shall be masters yet awhile but not long i have heard i have seen among the mist of our waterfalls the avalanches of our hills the voices and the signs of romes coming ruin but not yet therefore it is that i counselled peace i know that thou art taishatr the great seer of our people replied the other with an expression of deep awe on his featuresshall rome indeed so perish she shall feargus her sons shall forget the use of the blade her daughters of the distafffor heroes and warriors she shall bring forth pipers and fiddlers pandars and posturers for heroines and matrons songstresses dancing girls and harlots the beginning thou seest now the end cometh not in ages and our people phadraig our northern races shall govern and despise them our arms shall carry devastation into regions of which their consuls never heard and under gaelic eagles our men shall wield thunder louder and deadlier than the bolts of roman gods i have said feargus it shall be but not yet nor shall our eyes behold it but it shall soothe us yet in these days of our countrys desolation to know how great she shall be hereafter and these how less than littlethe very name of roman synonimous with slavery and degradation there was a long pause during which neither of the chieftains spoke the one musing over the strange visions which are phenomena by no means unusual to mountaineers in all ages the other dreaming of future glory to his race and aroused by the predictions of the seer to an ecstacy as it were of expectant triumph enough of thissaid the old man at length as i said but now i doubt eachin sorely if he prove false i will stab him to the heart with my own hand though he be my fathers brothers grandson and the best warrior of our tribe but no no phadraig the boy is young and his blood is hot and fiery and the charms of that witch might well move a colder spiritbut he is true as steel and wise and wary for one so young he may sun himself in her smiles or revel on her lips but trust me eachin of the iron hand will never betray council keep your eye on him nevertheless feargus said the other and as you said but now kill him at once if you perceive him false ha what noble patricius cried lentulus coming up to them suddenly and addressing the old chief by his latinized namewhat is this that thou arguest so sagely in thy sonorous and male tongue the might and majesty of rome answered the old man quietly and our peoples misery and degradation nay nay chief be not downhearted look upward now after dark night comes brilliant morning said the roman your people shall rise ere long to power and glory and dominion so i told feargus ha the brave ferragus and doth he not credit your wisdoms prophecy i put all faith in romes gratitude in catilines valor and justice aye when we once have put down this faction we will do justice to our friends and we are of the number surely the twenty thousand horse which you have promised us are twenty thousand pledges of your friendship as many claims on our favor see here comes eachin said the old man and time wears onward it is nigh midnight we must away to our lodgings our train awaits us and we but tarry for your envoy and the letters titus volturcius i will go fetch him hither he hath our letters sealed and ready he is but draining a last cup with our brave cethegus i will go fetch him and with the words he turned away gathering his toga in superb draperies about his stately person and traversing the corridor with proud and measured strides and as he went muttered through his teeththe fool barbarians as if we would give them anything but chains and scourges the poor benighted idiots ho eachin where left you our fair hostess asked feargus in latinmethinks you are smitten somewhat with her beauty she is very beautiful said the old chieftain gravely beautiful feargus phadraig beautiful did ye say and the youth gazed at them in wonder that vile sensual soulless harlot she beautiful then virtue must be base indeed and honor shameful he cried with noble indignation in his own galic tongue his eyes flashing and his cheek burning crimson why if you held her then so cheaply have you so much affected her society oh you suspect me feargus but it needs not the barbarian hath some shrewdness and some honesty sempronia too suspected us and would have won my secret from me had i indeed a secret by sweet words and sweeter kisses and thou gave kiss for kiss with interest and soft word for soft word i have sighed as if i were any romanbut no secret feargus phadraig no secret do you doubt me not i boy answered the warrior your father was my cousin and i think you are not a bastard i think not either but see here come these noble romans it is their envoy with the letters for their leader we shall be dismissed now from this haunt of thieves and harlots and laughed at when dismissed for fools and barbarians one never knows who is the fool till the game is lost nor who is laughed at till it is won here is our titus my good friends said lentulus coming forward leading along with him a slightlymade but wellformed and activelooking man with a downcast yet roving eye and a sneering lip as if he were one who believing nothing deserved not to be believed in anything himself he hath the letters and credentials secured on his person on his introduction our catiline shall know you as true friends and as such receive and reward you titus volturcius is welcome we tarried but for him we will now take our leaves with thanks for your gracious courtesies a trifle a mere trifle said sempronia who had that moment returnedwe only desired to teach you how we romans live in our homes daily a very pleasant lesson ha my young friendsaid lentulus to eachin and then he said out to cethegus in greek i am compelled to call the highland bull my friend for his accursed name would break the jaws of any romanthere is no twisting it into latin hush he will hear you lentulus said the other i believe the brutes hear with their eyes and understand through their fingerends and he too used the same language yet strange to say it would have seemed as if the young man did in some sort comprehend his words for his cheek turned fiery red and he bit his lip and played nervously with the hilt of the claymore thou will not forget the lesson whispered sempronia never replied the highlander never while one red drop runs in these veins and the last drop in them will i shed gladly to teach these noble romans how grateful a barbarian can be poor though he be and half savage for being thus instructed in roman hospitality and roman virtue farewell ye noble senators farewell most beautiful and noble matron and with deep salutations half dignified half awkward the gauls strode away into the quiet and moonlighted streets strange contrast to the glare and riot of those patrician halls and polluted chambers a singular speech that said cethegus musing it sounded much as if it might bear a double meaning could it be irony and cover treason irony in a stupid gaul thou art mad cethegus to think of it said autronius with a sneer i should as soon look for wit in an elephant said longinus cassius or i for love in a cold lizard cried sempronia laughing you found some love in the barbarian i think my sempronia exclaimed cethegus more warmth than wit i assure you she replied still laughing i acted my part with him rarely if he were inclined once to play us false he is bound to us now by chains of roses fair one never mind if he break them call me chaste semproniaenquired cparius interrupting her audacious she answered with an affected frown amid the laugh which followed the retort what do you think of it my lentulus asked cethegus who although he had jested with the others did not by any means appear satisfied in his mind or convinced of the good faith of the highlanders that it is two hours now past midnight answered lentulus yawning and that i am amazing sleepy i was not in bed till the third watch last night writing those letters ill luck to them that is what i think cethegus and that i am going to bed now to trouble myself about the matter no more until the saturnalia and so that company broke up never to meet again on this side hades not long thereafter the gauls having reached their lodgings at the house of their patron fabius sanga where everything had been prepared already for their departure mounted their horses and set forth on their way homeward accompanied by a long train of armed followers titus volturcius riding in the first rank between the principal chiefs of the party the moon had risen and the night was almost as clear as day for a slight touch of frost had banished all the vapors from the sky and the stars sparkled with unusual brilliancy although it was clear and keen however the night was by no means cold as it would have been under the like circumstances in our more northern climes and the gardens in the suburbs of the city with their numerous clumps of stonepine and thickets of arbutus and laurestinus looked rich and gay with their polished green foliage long after the deciduous trees had dropped their sere leaves on the steamy earth no sounds came to the ears of the travellers as they rode at that dead hour of night through the deserted streets the whole of the vast city appeared to be hushed in deep slumber soon caius volturcius boasted as they rode along to burst like a volcano into the din and glare of mighty conflagration they met not a single individual as they threaded the broad suburra with their long train of slaves and ledhorses not one as they passed through the gorge between the viminal and quirinal hills nor as they scaled the summit of the latter eminence and reached the city walls where they overlooked sallusts gardens in the valley and on the opposite slope the perfumed hill of flowers a sleepy sentinel unbarred the gate for the ambassadors while four or five of his comrades sat dozing in their armor around a stove in the centre of the little guardhouse or replenishing their horn cups at short intervals from an urn of hot wine which hissed and simmered on the hearth excellent guard they keep said volturcius sneeringly right trusty discipline of much avail would such watchers be were catiline without the walls with ten thousand men of syllas veterans and is your catiline so great a captain asked the highlander the best in rome since sylla is no more he learned the art of war under that grand that consummate soldier he was scarce second to him in his life time why then hath rome found no service for him asked the gaul if he as you say is so valiant and so skillful why hath he not commanded in the east in place of pompey or lucullus jealousy is the bane of rome jealousy and corruption catiline will not pander to the pride of the insolent patricians nor buy of them employments or honors with his gold and is he free from this corruption no man on earth of more tried integrity while all of rome beside is venal his hand alone is conscious of no bribe his heart alone incorruptible thou must be a true friend of his all men speak not so highly of this catiline some men lie touching him specially they lie by the gods i believe so answered the old gaul with calm irony by mars and apollo they lie foully i think i have heard one at least do so thou shalt hear hundreds if thou listen to them so many aye by the godsmost of theby your head patricius that was a man i think armed too who looked forth from behind yon buttress of the bridge no no volturcius twas but the shadow of yon pine tree waving athwart the moonlight i marked it long since answered the wily gaul proceed i pray youmost of the what wert thou about to say but by this time the speakers had advanced to the centre of the long mulvian bridge a magnificent stone structure crossing the broad and sluggish tiber two miles below the city and giving access to the farfamed flaminian way their train following closely after them had all entered into the defile the last of them having already passed the abutment nearest to rome when a loud shout arose from either side the bridge and from the thickets and gardens at each extremity forth rushed a band of stout youths armed with casques and cuirasses of bronze with the oblong shields and spanish stabbing swords of the legionaries each band was led by a prtor lucius valerius flaccus commanding at the end next rome and caius pomptinus on the emilian way and each fell into accurate and beautiful array barring the outlets of the bridge with a triple file of bright blades and sturdy bucklers nor was this all for a little party was pushed forward on each flank with bows and javelins ready to enfilade the narrow pass with cross shot of their missiles in case any attempt should be made to force a passage and at the end moreover of the bridge toward etruria and the camp of catiline at which such an attempt was most likely to occur the glittering helmets and crimson horsehair crests of a troop of cavalry were seen glancing in the moonbeams as they wheeled into line behind the footmen ready to charge at once should the infantry be broken stand stand cried the soldiery at each end stand and surrender but the younger men of the gauls unsheathing their claymores set up their terrible slogan or celtic battle cry and plunging their spurs into the sides of their fiery horses came thundering across the bridge with a charge that would probably have trodden the prtors infantry under foot had not the old chief whom the romans called patricius and ferragus reined their steeds suddenly across the way calling upon their men to halt and be steady but volturcius knowing too well the consequence of being taken dashed forward with his sword drawn and made a desperate attempt to cut his way through the infantry striking down two or three slashing and stabbing to the right and left displaying singular skill in the use of his weapon and extreme personal intrepidity treason treason my friends he shouted ho ferragus patricius ho charge charge men gallantly they are but a handful and still he plied his blade which was now crimson to the hilt with fearful energy no no not so cried the ambassadorslay down your arms it is the prtors train lay down your arms all shall be well if you resist not and at the same time yield thee yield thee volturcius cried pomptinus we are friends all and would not hurt theebut have thee we must and thy lettersdost thou not know me titus very well caius cried the other still fighting desperately against a host for the men were commanded not to kill but to take him alive at all hazards i know thee very well but i will not yield to thee so take that prtor and with the word he dealt him a blow on his crest that brought him to his knee in a moment he is a mad man cried a veteran legionary we must kill him not for your lives shouted pomptinus and springing to his feet he plunged his sword home into his horses chest up to the very hilt and then leaping on one side nimbly as the animal fell headlong being slain outright he seized volturcius by the shoulder and pulled him down from the saddle but even at this disadvantage the conspirator renewed the single combat with the prtor until at length assured by his repeated promises that his life should be spared he yielded his sword to that officer and adjuring him in the name of all the gods to protect him gave himself up a prisoner as if to avowed enemies those of the gauls who had been ignorant at first what was in progress perceiving now that the whole matter had been arranged with the concurrence of their chiefs submitted quietly and two or three of the prtors people who had been wounded being accommodated with temporary litters made of bucklers and javelins with watch cloaks thrown over them the whole party turned their horses heads and directed their march toward rome and silence amid which the gentle murmur of the river and the sigh of the breeze were distinctly audible succeeded to the clang of arms and the shouts of the combatants unheard for many a year so near to the walls of the worlds metropolis chapter x the arrest rebellious subjects enemies of peace romeo and juliet it was already daylight when the loud clang and clatter of a squadron passing along the streets at a sharp trot aroused the citizens of rome from their beds for though the morning had broke it was still very early many a lattice was opened and many a head thrust out as the troopers swept along with all their accoutrements jingling and clashing through the early silence a spectacle which in ordinary times would have excited much astonishment perhaps aroused a tumult since it was in direct opposition to the laws that armed soldiers should enter the city walls in time of peace but so much had the public mind been disturbed of late that the sight which a month before would have filled the streets with anxious or angry multitudes now hardly seemed to merit a second glance and the spectators hurried back to their couches invoking the aid of the good consul who watched so well over the liberties and lives of rome or muttering curses on his head according as they were well or illafflicted toward the state one man there was however who was awakened by the clatter from the deep sleep of drunkenness with a flushed face and an aching head in a house on the clivus scauri a steep street running down the southern slope of the palatine into the cerolian place and overlooking the mansion of cicero starting up from his low couch he called out sharply and with a querulous accent to a freedman who was watching his feverish slumbers desiring him to look out and see what made that clatter the man passed quickly into an adjoining room which commanded a view of the street and returned instantly saying it is a squadron of horse cparius young arvinas i think and they appear to be conducting a prisoner for there is one man among them in his tunic and abolla only while the troopers around him have their swords drawn sobered at once the conspirator leaped from his couch and almost overthrew the attendant in his eagerness to reach the window in time to observe the troopers they were just halting in the cerolian place when he saw them and dismounting chargers and men in a confused and dusty group before the door of cicero he gazed as if his eyes would burst from their sockets if possibly he might distinguish the wearer of the rich blue riding cloak of which he could catch glimpses among the glittering corslets and scarlet cassocks of the legionary horse but for a while he gazed in vain at length two figures mounted the marble steps leading to the tuscan colonnade and were thus brought clearly into view above the crested casques of the soldiery one a tall wellmade figure splendidly accoutred in the cavalry armor of the day he recognized at once for arvina and in the stouter person clad in the blue abolla the color of which he had already connected with one whom he knewhis worst fears all realizedhe discovered the messenger of treason titus volturcius of crotona by the gods all is lost he muttered striking his hand violently on his thigh escape alone is left to us ha he continued addressing his freedman i will arise and go forth speedily give me my tunic sonever mind the feminalia there clasp my sandals death and furies how slow thou art now my dagger and my toga hark now i go to the house of lentulus see thou and have my chariot harnessed for a journey with the four thracian steeds put into it my armor a sword casque and buckler for thyself and all the gold which is locked in the great chest in the atrium here is the key tarry not for thy life and bring the car thyself to the arch of fabius allobrox wait there until i come to thee i will be there within the hour it shall be done cparius see that it be done if thou wouldst scape the scourge and with the word he rushed out of the chamber as if the avenger of blood were at his heels but the freedman looked after him with a bitter and scornful smile and muttered the scourgethe scourge and i a freedman this is another friend of the people his villanies i fancy are near upon detection and he would fly to join catiline but i will thwart him in the meantime quitting his own house in great trepidation the conspirator walked very rapidly through the streets until he reached the house of lentulus which was not far distant from the forum he was admitted instantly and without question for all the slaves knew him as the intimate friend of their master but at the bed room door he was stopped by the favorite freedman of lentulus who urged that his lord had not retired till morning and had desired that he should not be disturbed earlier than noon cparius on the other hand insisted raising his voice so loudly that the sleeper was awakened and recognizing the accent of his friend cried out peevishly oh let him in agathon let him in quickly or he will talk thee deaf and me frantic what in the name of proserpine and pluto is it now the plot is discovered all is lost exclaimed the other forgetting all prudence in the haste and terror of the moment to the abyss of tartarus with the plot and thee also replied the other savagely i hope it is discovered for i shall get some sleep then i have had none these six months and turning on his other side he drew the embroidered coverlid over his head and appeared to court the interrupted slumber by all gods i tell thee lentulus volturcius is arrested these eyes beheld him dragged into the house of cicero my chariot waits me now at the arch of fabius i go to join catiline i prithee then go quicklythou torturest me man i say get thee gone get thee gone better to die than to live thus sleepless whom the gods wish to ruin they first dementate exclaimed cpariusthou wilt be seized within the hour i care not so that till then i can sleep once more i saybegone cparius shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as he left the room and then made the best of his way to the arch of fabius but he found not his chariot there not though he waited well nigh two hours did it arrive at all hopeless at length and desperate he set forth alone and on foot in the vain hope of escaping the pursuit of ciceros unerring justice meanwhile disturbed more than he would admit by cparius tidings lentulus did in some sort arouse himself to consideration it may be so he said to himself cparius declared he saw him if it be so twere better perhaps indeed to leave the city and yet he continued pondering deeply to fly is to admit guilt and it is too late moreover tush tush i daresay it is but cparius terrorhe was a fool always and i believe a coward also beside if it be true there is no proof and what dare cicero against meagainst me a consular of romeat the worst he will implore me to deliver the city of my presence as he did catiline ha ha i will to sleep again yet stay i am athirst after sempronias revel fool that i was not to drink more last night and quench this fiery craving ho agathon my boy fetch me the great goblet the double sextarius of spiced mulse with a snowwater this order was obeyed instantly and after draining the huge beaker to the bottom the indolent and reckless traitor rolled himself over and was asleep again as soundly in five minutes as if he were not in truth slumbering upon the brink of a volcano not long however did he sleep in peace for cparius had scarcely been gone an hour when he was again startled from his doze by a knocking so violent at the outer door that the whole house rechoed with the din he heard the doors opened and a short angry parle broken short by the raised voice of the new comers and the clanging of armed footsteps along the marble corridor which led toward his chamber a moment afterward pale as death with his hair starting and a wild eye agathon entered the room how now exclaimed lentulus who fully aroused by this time was sitting on the edge of the low bedstead with a purple gown cast carelessly around him what is this new disturbance the atrium is full of armed soldiers lentulus replied the man with a faltering accent well hast thou never seen a soldier before that thou starest so wildly asked his master with a sneer which even the extremity of danger could not restrain their leader insists on present speech with thee i told him that thou wert asleep but he replied that waking or asleep he must have speech with thee truly a valiant leader answered the prtor hath he a name this bold centurion paullus ccilius arvina replied the young man who having followed the freedman to the door had overheard all that was passing is my nameno centurion as thou mayest see lentulus loth am i to disturb thy slumbers then wherefore do it youth asked lentulus quickly most broken things may be repaired but i know not how you shall mend a broken nap or recompense the loss of it if irreparable not of my own will but by the consuls order the consuls what antonius he scarce need have sent a troop of horse to ask an old friend to breakfast cicero sent me prtor to crave your instant presence at his house touching affairs of state ha cicero said he affecting to be much surprised cicero scarcely is on such terms with me as to take such a liberty waking me thus at the dead of night it is well nigh the fourth hour lentulus what if it be an i choose to call it midnight and what if i refuse to obey such unceremonious bidding in that case lentulus my orders are to compel your attendance i have two decuries of men in your atrium but i trust that you will drive me to no such necessity two decuries replied lentulus scornfully i have but to lift my little finger and my freedmen and slaves would kick your decuries and yourself after them into the velabrum the blood mounted to the brow of the young soldier i have endured he said something too much of this will you go with us peacefully lentulus or will you force us to take you through the street like a felon oh peacefully arvina peacefully i did but jest with you my hero but i knew not that the cavalry of the seventh legionthe legion of mars i think they call ithad become so degraded as to do the work of thieftakers nor i lentulus answered paul but you should know best in this matter if it be theft for which thou art summoned before cicero then are we indeed thieftakers but if so not only i believe should we be the first legionaries of rome so employed but thou the first roman consular so guilty so proud ha exclaimed the haughty conspirator gazing at him with a curled lip and flashing eye well i could quell that pride in one moment with one word even so proud because honest answered the young man as haughtily as the other for the rest will you clothe yourself at oncei can wait babbling here no longer i will quell it look you boy you love julia the bright daughter of hortensiashe is worth loving by the way and catiline hath noted it you fancy that she is safe now at the latin villa of her mother she is not safenor at the latin villa i have touched you have i not arvina started as if a serpent had bitten him but in a moment he recovered himself saying calmly tush it is a poor deceit you cannot alarm me in truth it was a deceit but not so very poor after all since it succeeded you were sorely wounded a few days since arvina and wrote i think to julia requesting her to set forth at once to rome with hortensia folly replied arvina drivelling folly come hasten your dressing lentulus you need not perfume your hair and curl your beard as if you were going to a banquet i never hasten anything my paullus things done hastily are rarely things done well what thou didst not write such a letteri thought thou hadstof this at least i am sure that she received such an one and set out for rome within an hour after by the gods exclaimed paullus a little eagerly for lentulus had changed the slight bantering tone in which he had been speaking for a quick short decided accent seeming to denote that he was in earnest where is she now speak lentulus i adjure thee tell me if thou wouldst have me serve thee i thought i could abate that pride somewhat said lentulus sneeringly i thought so indeed but by all the gods arvina i know not where your julia may be now i know whither they are conveying herwhere she soon will bebut i fancy that the knowing it would give you but little pleasure unless indeed you could prevent it my poor youth to know is something at least toward preventing it if therefore thou art not as i believe indeed thou art merely mocking me i pray thee tell me whither are they conveying her where will she soon be to the camp of manlius nigh fiesol in the arms of one lucius sergius catilinea great admirer of your auburnhaired blueeyed beauties my arvina the young man with his eyes gleaming and his face crimsoning with furious rage made two steps forward and seizing the burly traitor by the throat compressed his gullet as if in an iron vice and shook him to and fro as easily as if he had been a stripling shame on thee filth and carrion that thou art so to speak of a betrothed bride to her promised husband if it were true wretched villain i would save the hangman his task and break your traitors throat with this handbut thou liest thou liest he shouted pushing him to the other end of the narrow sleeping chamber in poor revenge thou liest but if you wish to live beware how you so lie any more i do not lie indeed my dear arvina replied the other in a bland fawning voice full of mock humility but i prithee boy keep thy hands from my throat in future unless thou wouldst desire to know how a crookbladed sica some sixteen inches long feels in the region of thy heart such an one as this arvina he added showing a long keen weapon not unlike a turkish yatagan in shape which he drew from beneath his pillow then casting it aside with a contemptuous gesture he continuedbut this is mere childs play now mark me i did not lie nor do aulus fulvius wrote the letteraulus fulvius slave carried it yesterevenaulus fulvius beset the road by which they must comeaulus fulvius is ere this time on his road many a league conveying her to catilineand this he said putting a small slip of parchment into the hands of the astonished paullus is aulus fulvius handwriting yes certainly that is his s in the word salutem he affects ever the greek sigma in his writing he is a very pretty penman aulus fulvius the strip of parchment bore these words whom i am you will know by the matter the camp in etruria will receive the dove from the latin villa all hath succeededhealth i found it on my desk when i returned from supper this morning auluss slave brought it hither he is within if thou wouldst speak him arvina staggered back like a man who has received a mortal stab as he read those fatal words and stared about him with a wild and wandering eye it was a moment or two before he could find any speech and when he did speak at length it was in tones so altered and broken that his nearest friend would not have recognized his voice whereforehe gaspedwherefore have you done this to me for vengeance thundered the proud conspirator casting his crimsonbordered toga over his laticlavian tunic for vengeance boy lead onlead on to your consul in what have i wronged you cried arvina in a paroxysm of almost unspeakable despair in what that you should take such infernal vengeance for julias love thou didst betray catiline betray us in julias infamy thou shalt be punished anything anything anything but thisstrike here strike here with that sica thou didst unsheath but now slay me by inches if thou wiltbut spare her oh by your mothers memory oh by your sisters honor spare her and i will lead on to your consul exclaimed lentulus waving his hand proudly to the door i can but diethe gods be thanked for it thy life is bitterer than many deaths already i say coward and fool lead on where is thy boasted pride in the dust at my feet i trample i spit on it once again to your consul and thou couldst save her by a word at a hint from me fulvius will set her free but that word but that hint my lips shall never uttermy hand indite unless unless unless whatspeak speak lentulus by the gods by your head by your life speak place me beyond the walls of rome with twenty of my freedmen armed and mountedit can be done on the instant they are here they are readyand julia shall be in thy bosom ere tomorrows sun shall sink behind the hills of latium a traitor to my country lentulus never tush boy think upon beautiful soft weeping innocent julia rescued by thee from catilinefrom pollutionthink on her gratitude her love her kiss think on a life a whole long life of raptureand then balance against it one small foolish word dishonor arvina interrupted him fiercely aye to which thou consignest julia whom thou lovest kind venus guard me from such lovers dishonor never can come nigh her replied arvina who had recovered his senses completely and who though unutterably wretched was now as firm and as cold as marble death it may be but not dishonor be it so answered lentulus we will leave her the option of the two but believe me when dishonor is pleasant women rarely choose death in preference to it you have had your option too my arvina but i it seems can have none but must wait upon your consul you have the same which you give julia answered paullus sternly there is your dagger and your heart here he added laying his hand on the broad breast of the infamous patrician true count its pulsescooler i think and more regular than thine paullus tush man i know a hundred wiser things and pleasanter than dying but once more lead on i will speak no word again till i speak to the consul and without farther words he strode to the door followed closely by the young soldier resolute and determined to perform his duty let what might come of it he passed through his marble peristyles looked with a cool eye on his flowery parterres and sparkling fountains nodded a careless adieu to his slaves and freedmen and entered the atrium where arvinas troopers awaited him wondering and impatient at the long delay with a proud gesture he waved his hand toward the door and six of the number marched forward three and three while the rest falling into regular array behind him escorted him with all respect but with stern watchfulness along the via sacra to the carin quickly arriving at the atrium of ciceros house which was filled with his friends and clients all in arms and with many knights and patricians whom he knew but no one of whom saluted or seemed to recognize him he was admitted into the tablinum or saloon at the doors of which six lictors were on guard with their fasces on entering this small but sumptuous chamber he found assembled there already cethegus statilius and gabinius silent with white lips in an agony of terror worse than death ha my friends he exclaimed with an unaltered mien and voice we are met once again but we seem not by all the gods to be well pleased with the meeting why so downcast cethegus because on earth it is our last meeting he replied and it was clear to see that the boldest and fiercest and most furious of the band while danger was afar was the most utterly appalled now when fate appeared imminent and certain why then answered lentulus we shall meet in hell cethegus by the gods jest not so foully wherefore not i prithee if that this be our last meeting good faith let it be a merry one i know not for my part what ails ye all are you mad or know you not that volturcius is a prisoner and our letters in the hands of the consul they will kill us ere noon then they must make haste caius it is noon already but cheer thee up be not so much afraid my brave cethegusthey dare not slay us dare not for their own lives they dare not but as he spoke raising his voice to its highest pitch the curtains which closed the other end of the tablinum were suddenly drawn back and cicero appeared clad in his consular robes and with his ivory staff in his hand antonius his colleague stood in the intercolumniation with all the lictors at his back and many knights in their appropriate tunics but with military cloaks above them in place of the peaceful toga and with their swords girded by their sides prtor said cicero in a dignified but serene voice with no show of taunting or of triumph over his fallen enemy the senate is assembled in the temple of concord the fathers wait but for your coming give me your hand that i may conduct you thither my hand consul not as a friends i trust said the undaunted traitor as a magistrates cornelius lentulus replied cicero severely whose hand even if guilty may not be polluted by an inferiors grasp as a magistrates you have it consul we go to the shrine of concord antonius my noble colleague let us begone senators follow us escape you cannot if you would and i would spare you the disgrace of chains we follow cicero answered cethegus in a hollow voice and casting his eyes with a wild and haggard expression on gabinius he added in a whisper to our death be it so replied the other one can but die once and if his time be come as well now as hereafter i fear not death now when i see it face to face i think i have heard thee say the same he spoke answered statilius with a bitter and sarcastic laugh of the death of others then would god he then had met his own so should we now have been innocent and fearless i at least if not innocent am fearless and watched on every side by the knights and followed by the lictors two behind each the ringleaders of the plot all save cparius who had fled and catilinewho was in open arms an outlaw and proclaimed enemy of his countrythe ringleaders were led away to trial the fate of rome hung on the firmness of their judges chapter xi the young patrician not always robes of state are worn most nobly by the nobly born h w h the light of that eventful morning which broke pregnant with ruin to the conspiracy found aulus fulvius and his band still struggling among the rugged defiles which it was necessary to traverse in order to gain the via cassia or western branch of the great north road it had been necessary to make a wide circuit in order to effect this inasmuch as the latin road of which the labican way was a branch left the city to the southeastward nearly opposite to the flaminian or north road so that the two if prolonged would have met in the forum and made almost a right line nor had this been their only difficulty for they had been compelled to avoid all the villages and scattered farm houses which lay on their route in the fear that julias outcries and resistancefor she frequently succeeded in removing the bandage from her mouthwould awaken suspicion and cause their arrest while in the immediate vicinity of rome at one time the party had been within a very few miles of the city passing over the tiber scarce five miles above the mulvian bridge about an hour before the arrest of the ambassadors and it was from this point that aulus sent off his messenger to lentulus announcing his success thereby directly disobeying the commands of catiline who had enjoined it on him almost with his last words to communicate this enterprise to none of his colleagues in guilt crossing the flaminian or great northern road they had found a relay of fresh horses stationed in a little grove of which by this time they stood greatly in need and striking across the country at length reached the cassian road near the little river galera just as the sun rose above the eastern hills at this moment they had not actually effected above ten miles of their journey as reckoned from the gates of rome to the camp of catiline which was nearly two hundred miles distant though they had traversed nearly forty during the night in their wearisome but unavoidable circuit they were however admirably mounted on fresh horses and had procured a cisium or light carriage for two persons not much unlike in form to a light gig in which they had placed the unhappy julia with a slight boy the son of caius crispus as the driver by threats of the most atrocious nature they had at length succeeded in compelling her to temporary silence death she had not only despised but implored even when the point of their daggers were razing the skin of her soft neck and so terribly were they embarrassed and exasperated by her persistence that it is probable they would have taken her life had it not been for fear of catiline whose orders were express to bring her to his camp alive and in honor at length aulus fulvius had threatened in the plainest language outrages so enormous that the poor girls spirit sank and that she took an oath in order to avoid immediate indignities and those the most atrocious to remain silent during the next six hours had she been able to possess herself of any weapon she would undoubtedly have destroyed herself as the only means she could imagine of escaping what to her was worse than loss of life the loss of honor and it was chiefly in the hope of effecting this ere nightfall that she took the oath prescribed to her in terms of such tremendous sanctity that no roman would dream of breaking it on any pretext of compulsion liberated by their success in this atrocious scheme from that apprehension they now pushed forward rapidly and reached the station at baccan in a wooded gorge between a range of low hills and a clear lake at about nine in the morning of our time or the third hour by roman computation here they obtained a fresh horse for the vehicle which carried julia and tarrying so long only as to swallow a draught of wine they pressed onward through a steep defile along which the road wound among wooded crags toward sutrium at this place which was a city of some note they were joined by forty or fifty partisans well armed and mounted on good horses all veteran soldiers who had been settled on the confiscated estates of his enemies by the great usurper sylla and thenceforth feeling themselves strong enough to overawe any opposition they might meet on the way they journeyed at a slower rate in perfect confidence of success numbering now not less than sixty wellequipped cavaliers before noon they were thirty miles distant from rome and had reached the bottom of a long and almost precipitous ascent where the road scorning any divergence to the right or left scaled the abrupt heights of a craggy hill known at the present day as the monte soriano the ancient name of which has not descended to these times scarcely however had they reached the first pitch of the hill in loose and straggling order when the rearmost rider came spurring furiously to the head of the column and announced to aulus fulvius that they were pursued by a body of men nearly equal to themselves in number who were coming up at a rate so rapid as made it certain that they would be overtaken encumbered as they were with the wheeled carriage conveying the hapless julia a brief council was held in which firmly resisting the proposal of the newcomers to murder their captive and disperse in small bodies among the hills aulus fulvius and caius crispus determined on dividing their men into two parties the first of these commanded by the smith and consisting of twothirds of their whole force was destined to press forward as rapidly as possible while fulvius with the second should make a charge down hill upon the pursuers by which it was hoped that they might be so effectually checked and alarmed as to give up the pursuit no time was lost in the execution a second horse was attached to the cisium for they had many sumpter animals along with them and several spare chargers and so much speed did they make that crispus had reached the summit of the ridge and commenced the descent before the pursuers had come up with fulvius and the rear there is a little hollow midway the ascent which is thickly set with evergreen oaks and hollies and in the centre of this hollow the road makes a turn almost at right angles behind the corner of the wood which entirely concealed them from any persons coming up the hill aulus drew up his men in double lines and as the band whom he suspected to be in pursuit of him came into the open space in loose array and with their horses blown and weary he charged upon them with a fierce shout and threw them into disorder in a moment nothing could indicate more clearly the utter recklessness of the catilinarian party and the cheap estimate at which they held human life than the perfect unconcern with which they set upon a party of men whose identity with those whom they feared was so entirely unproved nothing at the same time could indicate more clearly the fury and uncalculating valor which had grown up among them nurtured by the strange policy of catiline during a peace of eighteen years duration eighteen men for aulus fulvius included they numbered no more set fiercely upon a force of nearly three times their number with no advantage of arms or accoutrement or even of discipline for although all old soldiers these men had not for years been accustomed to act together nor were any of them personally acquainted with the young leader who for the first time commanded them the one link which held them together was welded out of crime and desperation each man knew that his neighbor as well as himself must win or diethere was no compromise no halfway measure that could by any possibility preserve them and therefore as one man they charged as one man they struck and death followed every blow at their first onset with horses comparatively fresh against the blown chargers and disordered mass of their pursuers they were entirely successful above a dozen of their opponents went down horse and man and the remainder were driven scattering along the slope nearly to the foot of the declivity uncertain as he had been at the first who were the men whom he thus recklessly attacked aulus fulvius had not well turned the angle of the wood before he recognized the faces of almost all the leading men of the opposite party they were the oldest and most trusty of the clients of his house and half a dozen at the least of his own name and kindred led them it needed not a moment therefore to satisfy him that they were in quest of himself and of himself alonethat they were no organized troop and invested with no state authority but merely a band suddenly collected from his fathers household to bring him back in person from the fatal road on which he had entered so fatally well did he know the rigor of the old roman law as regarded the paternal power and well did he know the severity with which his father would execute it the terrors inspired by the thought of an avenging country would have been nothingthe bare idea of being surrendered a fettered captive to his dread fathers indignation maddened him fiercely therefore as he rushed out leading his ambushed followers the fury of his first charge was mere boys play when compared to the virulent and concentrated rage with which he fought after he had discovered fairly against whom he was pitted had his men shared his feeling the pursuers must have been utterly defeated and cut to pieces without the possibility of escape but while he recognized his personal enemies in the persons he attacked the men who followed him as quickly perceived that those whom they were cutting down were not regular soldiers nor led by any roman magistrate they almost doubted therefore as they charged whether they were not in error and when the horsemen of the other faction were discomfitted and driven down the hill on the instant they felt no inclination to pursue or harass them farther not so however aulus he had observed in the first onset the features of a cousin whom he hated and now added to other motives the fierce thirst for his kinsmans blood stirred his blood almost into frenzy knowing moreover that he was himself the object of their pursuit he knew likewise that the pursuit would not be given up for any casual check but that to conquer he must crush them precipitately madly therefore he drove down the hill oversetting horseman after horseman the greater part of them unwoundedfor the short roman sword however efficient at close quarters and on foot was a most ineffective weapon for a cavalieruntil he reached the bottom of the hill there he reined up his charger for a moment and looked back waving his hand and shouting loudly to bring on his comrades to a second charge to his astonishment however he saw them collected in a body at nearly a miles distance on the brow of the first hill beckoning him to come back and evidently possessed by no thought less than that of risking their lives or liberty by any fresh act of hostility in the mean time the fugitives who had now reached the level ground and found themselves unpressed began to halt and before aulus fulvius had well made up his mind what to do they had been rallied and reformed and were advancing slowly with a firm and unbroken front well calculated to deter his handful which had already been diminished in strength by one man killed and four or five more or less severely wounded from rashly making any fresh attack alone and unsupported nothing remained for him but to retreat if possible and make his way back to his people who he felt well assured would again charge if again menaced with pursuit to do this however had now ceased to be an easy perhaps to be a feasible matter between himself and his own men there were at least ten of his fathers clients several of them indeed were wounded and all had been overthrown in the shock either by himself or his troopers but they had all regained their horses andapparently in consequence of some agreement or tacit understanding with his comrades were coming down the hill at a gentle trot to rejoin their own party now it was that aulus began to regret having sent forward the smith and those of the conspirators to whom he was individually known with julia in the van since of the fellows who had followed him thus far merely because inferior will always follow superior daring and who now appeared mightily inclined to desert him not three were so much as acquainted with his name and not one had any intimacy with him or indeed any community of feeling unless it were the community of crime these things flashed upon aulus in an instant the rather that he saw the hated cousin whom he had passed unnoticed in his headlong charge quietly bringing the clients into line between himself and his wavering associates he was in fact hemmed in on every side he was alone and his horse which he had taxed to the uttermost was wounded and failing fast his case was indeed desperate for he could now see that his own faction were drawing off already with the evident intention of rejoining the bulk of the party careless of his fate and glad to escape at so small a sacrifice still even in this extremity he had no thought of surrenderindeed to him death and surrender were but two names for one thing he looked to the right and to the left if there were any possibility of scaling the wooded slopes and so rejoining the sturdy swordsmith without coming to blows again with his fathers household but one glance told him that such hopes were vain indeed on either hand the crags rose inaccessible even to the foot of man unless he were a practised mountaineer then rose the untamed spirit of his race the firm roman hardihood deeming naught done while anything remains to do and holding all things feasible to the bold heart and ready handthe spirit which saved rome when hannibal was thundering at her gates which made her from a petty town the queen and mistress of the universe he gathered his reins firmly in his hand and turning his horses head down the declivity put the beast to a slow trot as if he had resolved to force his way toward rome but in a moment when his manoeuvre had as he expected caused the men in his rear to put their horses to their speed and thus to break their line he again wheeled and giving his charger the spur with pitiless severity drove up the steep declivity like a thunderbolt and meeting his enemies straggling along in succession actually succeeded in cutting down two before he was envelopped unhorsed and disarmed which as his cousins men came charging up and down the road at once it was inevitable that he must be from the beginning curses upon thee it is thou he said grinding his teeth and shaking his weaponless hand at his kinsman in impotent malignityit is thou caius curses upon thee from my birth thou hast crossed me it were better thou hadst died aulus replied the other solemnly but in sorrow more than anger better that thou hadst died than been so led back to rome why didst thou not kill me then asked aulus with a sneer of sarcastic spitewhy dost thou not kill me now thou art sacro sanctus answered the other with an expression of horror in his eyesdoomed set apart sanctified unto destructionwords alas henceforth avail nothing bind himhe continued turning toward his menbind him i say hard with his hands behind his back and his legs under his horses belly go your way he added go to your bloody camp and accursed leaderwaving his hand as he spoke to the veterans above who seemed half inclined to make an effort to rescue the prisoner go your way we have no quarrel with you now we came for him and having got him we return what cried the darkeyed boy who had come up too late to the latin villa on the preceding night and who strange to state was riding with the clients of the fulvian house unweariedwhat will you not save her will you not do that for which alone i led ye hither will you be falsifiers of your word and dishonored alas answered caius fulvius it is impossiblewe are outnumbered my poor boy and may not aid you as we would but be of good cheer this villain taken they will not dare to harm her the youth shook his head mournfully but made no reply aulus however who had heard all that was said glared savagely upon the boy and after examining his features minutely for a moment exclaimedi know thy face who art thou quick thy name i have no name replied the other gloomily that voice i know thee he shouted an expression of infernal joy animating his features thou miserable fool and driveller and is it for thisfor this that thou hast brought the bloodhounds on my track to restore her to him mark me then mark me and see if i am not avengedher dishonor her agony her infamy are no less certain than my death catiline catiline shall avenge me upon herupon himupon theethou weaker more variable thing thanwoman catiline thinkst thou he will fail he hath failed ere now replied the boy proudly failed when exclaimed aulus forgetting his own situation in the excitement of the wordy contest when he crossed methen turning once more to the leader of the fulvian clients the darkeyed boy said in a calm determined voice you will not therefore aid me we cannot enough look to him then that he escape you not fear us not but whither goest thou to rescue julia tell thou to arvina how these things have fallen out and whither they have led her and above all that one is on her traces who will die or save her ha ha laughed aulus savagely in the glee of his vengeful triumph thou wilt die but not save her i am avenged alreadyavenged in julias ruin wretch exclaimed his kinsman indignant and disgustedalmost it shames me that my name is fulvius fearful however is the punishment that overhangs thee think on that aulus and if shame fetter not thy tongue at least let terror freeze it terror of whom perhaps of thee accursed aulus thou hasta father at that word father his eyes dropped instantly their haughty insolence abashed his face turned deadly pale his tongue was frozen he spoke no word again until at an early hour of morning they reached the house he had so fatally dishonored meanwhile as the party who had captured him returned slowly with their prisoner down the mountain side the last of the rebels having gallopped off long before to join the swordsmith and his gang the boy who took so deep an interest in julia dismounted from the white horse which had borne him for so many hours with unabated fire and spirit and leaving the high road turned into a glade among the holm oaks watered by a small streamlet leading his courser by the rein having reached a secluded spot quite removed from sight of the highway he drew from a small wallet which was attached to the croupe some pieces of coarse bread and a skin of generous wine of which he partook sparingly himself giving by far the larger portion to his fourfooted friend who greedily devoured the cake saturated with the rich grapejuice this done he fastened the beast to a tree so that he could both graze and drink from the stream and then throwing himself down at length on the grass he soon fell into a heavy and quiet sleep it was already sunset when he awoke and the gray hues of night were gathering fast over the landscape but he seemed to care nothing for the approaching darkness as he arose reinvigorated and full of spirit and walked up to his horse which whinnied his joyful recognition and tossed his long thin mane with a spirited and fiery air as he felt the wellknown hand clapping his high arched crest courage brave horse he criedcourage white ister we will yet save her forarvina and with the words he mounted and cantered away through the gloom of the woodland night on the road toward bolsena well assured of the route taken by caius crispus and his infernal crew chapter xii the roman father daughter he fled that flight was parricide masons caractacus the streets of rome were in fierce and terrible confusion all that day long on which the conspirators were arrested and all the night that followed it late on the evening of that day when it was already dark the consul had addressed the people by torchlight in the forum delivering that superb speech known as the third oration against catiline in it he had informed them clearly of all the events which had occurred in the last twentyfour days since the delivery of his second speech more especially treating of those which had taken place in the preceding day and night the conspiracy made manifest by overwhelming evidencethe arrest of the ambassadors the seizure of the letters the acknowledgment of those letters for their own by the terrified and bewildered traitors and lastly the committal of the ringleaders of the plot to close custody previous to the discussion of their fatesuch were the wondrous and exciting facts which he had announced to the assembled multitudes inviting them to join him in a solemn thanksgiving to the gods and public celebration decreed by the senate to his honor congratulating them on their escape from a danger so imminent and so general and calling on them in conclusion to watch over the safety of the city by nocturnal guards and patroles as they had done so diligently during all that emergency the thundering acclamations which greeted the close of that luculent and powerful exposition the zeal with which the concourse hailed him unanimously savior of rome and father of his country the eagerness of affection with which all ranks and ages thronged around him expressing their gratitude and their devotion by all means imaginable proved satisfactorily that whatever might have been the result had massacre plunder and conflagration fallen upon them unawares the vast mass of the people were now loyal and true to their country the seven hills never had resounded with louder din of civic triumph than they did on that glorious night not when the noble scipio triumphed for carthage overthrown not when the mighty marius begirt with a host of captives and all the pomp of war dismounted happiest of men from his teutonic car the streets were as light as day with the glare of lamps and torches and bonfires blazing on all the circumjacent heights as with tremendous shouts and unpremeditated triumph the mighty multitude escorted the great consul home not to his own house where the rites of the good goddess were in celebration and whither no male could be admitted but to his nextdoor neighbors mansion in which he and his friends were entertained with more than regal splendor what could have been more glorious what more unmixed with any touch of bitterness or self reproach than ciceros position on that evening his country saved from miseries unparalleledsaved by himself aloneno aid of rival generals no force of marshalled hosts to detract from the greatness of his own achievementall the strife borne all the success won all the glory conquered by the force of his own genius of his own moral resolution no blood of friends had been spilt to buy that conquest and wring its tribute of anguished sorrow from eyes bright with the mixed excitement of regret and triumphno widows tears no orphans sighs had mounted heavenward amid those joyous conclamations with no sword drawn with no army arrayed alone in his peaceful toga he had conquered the worlds peace and for that night at least he enjoyed as his great merits meed a worlds gratitude all night long had the streets been crowded with fond and ardent throngs of all ages sexes ranks conditions questioning cheering carolling carousingall in appearance at least unanimous in joy for none dared in such an ebullition of patriotic feeling to display any disaffection and the morrow dawned upon rome still noisy still alive with tumultuous joy still filled through the whole area within its walls by thousands and tens of thousands hoarse with shouting weary almost of revelling haggard and pale from the excess of excitement such was the scene which the metropolis of the world presented when at the second hour of the morning on the day following the arrest of lentulus a small party consisting of about fifty horsemen conducting a prisoner with his arms bound behind his back gagged and with the lappet of his cloak so disposed as to conceal his face entered the quirinal gate from the direction of the flaminian way they were the clients of the fulvian house leading the miserable aulus homeward under the command of his cousin the horses were jaded and bleeding from many a spur gall the men were covered with dust and sweat and several of their number were wounded but what at once struck the minds of all who beheld them was that their faces although stern and resolute were grave dejected and sad while still it would seem that they were returning in triumph from some successful expedition at any other time the entrance of such a party would have awakened much astonishment and surprise perhaps might have created a tumult among the excitable and easily agitated romans but now so strangely had the popular mind been stimulated during the last days that they either paid no attention to the train at all or observed pointing to the prisoner that there went another of the parricides just however as the newcomers entered the gate another armed band met them moving outward the latter being a full troop thirty in number of cavalry of the seventh legion with a banner and clarion and paullus arvina at their head in complete armor above which he wore a rich scarlet cloak or paludamentum floating over his left shoulder the face of the young man was as pale as that of a corpse his eyes were sunken and surrounded by dark circles his cheeks were hollow and among the short black curls which were visible beneath the brazen peak of his sculptured casque there was one as white as snow since the dread news had reached him of julias abduction he had not closed his eyes for a moment and although scarcely eight and forty hours had elapsed since he received the fatal intelligence he had grown older by many years no one who looked upon him would have judged him to be younger than thirtyfive or forty years when he was in truth little more than half way on lifes journey toward the second period there was a cold firm determination too written on all his features such as is rarely seen in young men and the wild vacillating light which used to flicker so changefully over his fine face was lost in an expression of mournful and despairing resolution still his attitude on his chargers back was fine and spirited his head was proudly erect and his voice as from time to time he uttered some command to his troopers was clear steady and sonorous so much indeed was he altered that caius fulvius who knew him well gazed at him doubtfully for half a minute ere he addressed him as the two troops came almost into contact the mounted clients of the fulvian house withdrawing to the wayside to allow the legionaries to pass assured at last that it was indeed arvina he called out as he passed tell me i pray thee paullus what means this concourse in the streets hath aught of ill befallen ha is it thou caius fulvius replied arvina i will speak with thee anon lead the men forward he added turning round in his saddle to the second decurion of his troop my good drusus i will overtake you ere you shall reach the mulvian bridge here wheeling his horse to the side of the young nobleman where hast thou been caius that thou hast not heard all the conspirators have been arrested lentulus and cethegus gabinius statilius and cparius they have confessed their lettersthe gaulish ambassadors and titus volturcius have given evidence against them the senate is debating even now on their doom indeed indeed when did all this fall out enquired the other evidently in great astonishment yesterday morning they were taken the previous night in the third watch the ambassadors were stopped on the mulvian bridge and the treasonable papers found on volturcius ha this is indeed news cried caius what will befall lentulus and the rest do men know anything death answered arvina gravely death art thou certain a prtor a consular of rome and all the others senators death paullus death replied the other still more solemnly than before yet methinks that rather should be a boon than the fit penalty of such guilt but where have you been that you are ignorant of all this and whom have you there caius fulvius shook his head sorrowfully and a deep groan burst from the lips of the muffled man a groan of rage mingled with hate and terror i will tell thee arvina said the young man after a moments pause during which paullus had been gazing with a singular and even to himself incomprehensible emotion at the captive horseman we have been sent to fetch him back and he pointed to his wretched cousin as he fled to join catiline we overtook him nigh to volsinii whowho exclaimed arvina in a terrible hoarse voiceby all the gods who is he aulus ha villain villain he shall die by my hand burst from arvinas lips with a stifled cry and drawing his sword as he spoke he made toward him but caius fulvius and several others of the clients threw themselves into the way and the former said quietly but very firmly nono my paullus that must not be his life is devoted to a baser doom nor must his blood be shed by a hand so noble but whereforeha he exclaimed interrupting himself in mid speech ha julia i rememberi rememberwould to the gods i could have rescued her for one seconds space paullus arvina glared upon the speaker as if he would have stabbed him where he sat on his horse motionless and unresisting then shaking his head with an abrupt impatient motion as if to rid himself of some fixed image or impression he said you are right caius but tell me by the gods was she with him saw you aught of her as you took him she was in his power my poor paullus as we were told at sutrium but when we overtook him he had sent forward all his band but a small party who fought so hard and handled us so roughly that he once taken we dared not set on them again but be of good cheer my paullus there is a gallant youth on the track of them the same youth who went to save her at the latin villa but arrived too late the same who brought us the tidings of yon villains flight who led us in pursuit of them he follows still and swears that he will save her the gods grant it a youth ha who is he i know not he refused to tell us still saying that he was nameless a slight slender blackeyed youth exceeding darkcomplexioned but handsome withal you would have said to look on him he would lack strength to ride an hour yet by the god of faith he was in the saddle incessantly for nearly forty hours and shewed less weariness than our sturdiest men never saw i such fiery will and resolute endurance in one so young and feeble strange muttered paullusstrange why came he not to me he did go to your mansion but found you not you were absent on state businessthen came he to the father of this demon who sent us in pursuit and we have as i tell you succeeded may you do so likewise he charged me to say to you there was one on her track who would die to save her tis passing strange i may not even guess who it should be he added musing the gods give him strength but tell me caius can i by any speed overtake them i fear me not paullus ere they have reached the camp they were nigh to volsinii at noon yesterday of course they will not loiter on the way alas replied the unhappy youth curses curses ten thousand curses on his head and he glanced savagely upon aulus as he spoketo what doom do ye lead him to an indignant fathers pitiless revenge may he perish illmay his unburied spirit wander and wail forever upon the banks of acheron unpardoned and despairing and turning suddenly away as if afraid to trust himself longer in sight of his mortal enemy he plunged his spurs deep into his chargers flank and gallopped away in order to overtake his troop with which he was proceeding to join the army which antonius the consul and petreius his lieutenant were collecting on the seacoast of etruria in order to act against catiline meanwhile the others rode forward on their gloomy errand toward the fulvian house they reached its doors and at the trampling of their horses feet before any summons had been given with a brow dark as night and a cold determined eye the aged senator came forth to meet his faithful clients at the first glance he cast upon the party the old man saw that they had succeeded and a strange expression of satisfaction mixed with agony crossed his stern face it is well he said gravely ye have preserved the honor of my house i give ye thanks my friends well have ye done your duty it remains only that i do my own bring in your prisoner caius and ye my friends leave us i pray you to our destiny the young man to whom he addressed himself leaped down from his horse with one or two of the clients and unbuckling the thong which fastened his cousins legs under the belly of the beast he rode lifted him to the ground for in a sort of sullen spite although unable to resist he moved neither hand nor foot more than a marble statue would have done and when he stood on the pavement he made no step toward the door and it was necessary to carry him bodily up the steps of the colonnade and through the vestibule into the atrium in that vast hall a fearful group was assembled on a large arm chair at the upper end sat an aged matron perfectly blind with hair as white as snow and a face furrowed with wrinkles the work of above a century she was the mother of the senator the grandmother of the young culprit at her right hand stood another large chair vacant the seat of the master of the house and at her left sat another lady already far advanced in years yet stately firm and unflinchingthe wretched but proud mother behind her stood three girls of various ages the youngest not counting above sixteen years all beautiful and finely made but pale as death with their superb dark eyes dilated and their white lips mute with strange horror lower down the hall toward the door and not far removed from the altar of the household gods near the impluvium stood a black wooden block with a huge broad axe lying on it and a grimvisaged slave leaning against the wall with folded arms in a sort of stoical indifferencethe butcher of the family by his trade he little cared whether he practised it on beasts or men and perhaps he looked forward with some pleasurable feelings to the dealing of a blow against one of the proud lords of empire no one could look upon that mute and sad assemblage without perceiving that some dread domestic tragedy was in process but how dreadful no one could conceive who was not thoroughly acquainted with the strange and tremendous rigor of the old roman law the face of the mother was terribly convulsed as she heard the clanging hoof tramps at the door and in an agony of unendurable suspense she laid her hand upon her heart as if to still its wild throbbing roman although she was and trained from her childhood upward in the strictest school of stoicism he on whom they were gathered there to sit in judgment was still her firstborn her only son and she could not but remember in this hour of wo the unutterable pleasure with which she had listened to the first small cry of him then so innocent and weak and gentle who now so strong in manhood and so fierce in sin stood living on the verge of death but now as the clanging of the horse hoofs ceased different sounds succeeded and in a moment the anxious ears of the wife and mother could discern the footsteps of the proud husband and the fallen child they entered the hall old aulus fulvius striding with martial steps and a resolute yet solemn brow toward the chair of judgment like to some warlike flamen about to execute the wrath of the gods upon his fated victim the son shuffling along with downcast eyes and an irregular pace supported on one hand by his detested cousin and on the other by an aged freedman of the house the head of the younger aulus was yet veiled with the lappet of his gown so that he had seen none of those who were then assembled none of the fatal apparatus of his foreordered doom but now as the old man took his seat he made a movement with his hand and caius obedient to the gesture lifted the woollen covering from the sons brow and released his hold of his arm at a second wafture the nephew and the freedman both departed glad to be spared the witnessing a scene so awful as that which was about to ensue the sound of their departing footsteps fell with an icy chill on the stout heart of the young conspirator and although he hated the man who had just left the room more than any living being he would yet willingly have detained him at that crisis he felt that even hatred was less to be apprehended than the cold hard decision of the impassive unrelenting father in whose heart every sentiment was dead but those of justice and of rigorous honor aulus lift up your eyes and for the first time since he had entered the hall the culprit looked up and gazed with a wild and haggard eye on the familiar objects which met his glance on every side and yet familiar as they were all seemed to be strange altered and unusual the statues of his dead ancestors as they stood grim and uncouth in their antique sculpture between the pillars of the wall seemed to dilate in size and become gigantic to frown stern contempt on their degenerate descendant the grotesque forms of the etruscan household gods appeared to gibber at him the very flames upon the altar before them cast lurid gleams and ominous to his distempered fancy it was singular that the last thing which he observed was that which would have been the first to attract the notice of a strangerthe block the axe and the sullen headsman a quick shudder ran through every limb and artery of his body and he turned white and livid his spirit was utterly appalled and broken his aspect was that of a sneaking culprit a mean craven aulus lift up your eyes and he did lift them with a strong effort to meet the fixed and searching gaze of his father but so cold so penetrating was that gaze that his glance fell abashed and he trembled from head to foot and came well nigh to falling on the earth in his great terror aulus art thou afraid to diethou who hast sworn so deeply to dye thine hands in my gore in the gore of all who loved their country art thou afraid to die stabber adulterer poisoner ravisher parricide catilinarian art thou afraid to die i should have thought when thou didst put on such resolves thou wouldst have cast aside all that is human once more i say art thou afraid to die to die he exclaimed in husky tones which seemed to stick in his parched throatto die to be nothing and again the convulsive shudder ran through his whole frame but ere the senator could open his lips to reply the blind old grandam asked in a voice so clear and shrill that its accents seemed to pierce the very souls of all who heard it is he a coward aulus fulvius is he a coward too as well as a villain the first of our race is he a coward i fear it answered the old man gloomily but cowardly or brave he must disgrace our house no farther his time is come his fate cries out for him aulus must die happy to die without the taint of public and detected infamyhappy to die unseen in his fathers house not in the base and sordid tullianum mother mother exclaimed the wretched youth in a paroxysm of agony sisters speak for meplead for me i am young oh too young to die the mother whom thou hast sworn to murderthe sisters whose virgin youth thou hast agreed to yield to the licentious arms of thy foul confederates answered the old man sternly while the women with blanched visages convulsed with agony were silent even to that appeal speak speak will you not speak for me for your firstborn son my mother farewellthe cold word came forth from her pallid lips with a mighty effortfarewell unhappy and unable to endure the dreadful scene any longer she arose from her seat and laid her hand on the blind womans arm come she said mother of my lord our task is ended his doom spoken let us go hence but the youngest sister overcoming her fear of the stern father her modesty of youth and her sense of highstrained honor cast herself at the old mans feet and clung about his knees crying with a shrill painful cry oh father by your right hand by your gray head by all the gods i implore you pardon spare him up up base girl cried the old man wouldst have the infamy of our house made public and thou most miserable boy spare her thou this disgrace and me this anguishveil thy head bow thee to the block bid the slave do his office at least aulus if thou hast not lived at least die a roman the second of the girls while her sister had made that fruitless appeal to the fathers mercy walked steadily to her brother kissed his brow with a tearless eye and in a low voice bade him farewell for ever then turned away impassive as her father and followed her mother and the blind grandam from the fatal hall but the third daughter stepped up to the faltering youth with a hectic flush on her cheek and a fitful fire in her eye and whispered in his ear aulus my brother unhappy one it is vain thou must die for our houses honor die then my brother as it becomes a fulvius bravely and by a free hand which of our house perished ever by a base weapon or a slavish blow thou wert brave everbe brave now oh my brother and at her words his courage his pride rallied to his aid and he met her eye with a flashing glance and answered in a firm tone i will sister i will die as becomes a roman as becomes a fulvius but how shall i die by a free hand bound as i am and weaponless thus brother she replied drawing a short keen knife from the bosom of her linen stola and severing the bonds which confined his elbows she placed it in his hands it is keen it will not fail you it is the last gift of the last who loves you aulus the best gift farewell sister farewell aulus for ever and she too kissed him on the brow and as she kissed him a hot tear fell upon his cheek then turning toward her sister who was still clinging to the old mans knees embarrassing him with useless prayers so that he had observed none of that byplay she said to her firmly come little girl come it is fruitless bid him farewell he is prepared to die he cannot survive his honor and she drew her away screaming and struggling with eyes deluged in tears from the apartment wherein the senator now stood face to face with his first born the slave alone present as a witness of the last struggle but aulus had by this time recovered all the courage of his race all his own natural audacity and waving his hand with a proud gesture toward the slave he exclaimed in tones of severe authority dismiss that wretched slave aulus fulvius ready i am to dienay i wish not to live but it becomes not thee to doom me to such a death nor me so to die noble i am and free and by a free hand will i die and a noble weapon there was so much command so much high pride and spirit in his tone his expression and his gesture that an answering chord was struck in the mind of the old man so that without reply and without evincing any surprise at seeing the youths arms unbound he waved a signal to the slave to depart from the atrium then the youth knelt down on one knee before the altar and cried aloud in a solemn voice pardon me ye gods of our house for this dishonor which i have brought upon you absolve me ye grand ancestors mine eyes are open now and i perceive the sin the shame the sorrow of my deeds absolve me ye great gods and ye glorious men and thou my father think sometimes of the son whom it repented of his guilt but whom it pained nothe raised his arm aloft and the bright knifeblade glittered in the rays of the altarfire when the old senator sprang forward with all his features working strangely and cried hold it might be that he had relented but if it were so it was too late for finishing his interrupted sentence with these words to die for his houses honor the young man struck himself one quick blow on the breast with a hand so sure and steady that the knife pierced through his ribs as if they had been paper and clove his heart asunder standing fixed hiltdeep in his chest while without word or groan or sigh or struggle he dropped flat on his back beside the impluvium and was dead in less time than it has taken to describe the deed the father looked on for a moment calmly and then said in a cool hard voice it is well it is well the gods be thanked he died as a roman should then he composed his limbs and threw a white cloth which lay nigh the block over the face and body of the wretched youth but as he turned to leave the atrium nature was too strong for his philosophy for his pride and crying out my son my son he was yet mine own son mine own aulus and burying his face in his toga he burst into a paroxysm of loud grief and threw himself at length on the dead body father and son victims alike to the inexorable roman honor chapter xiii the doom without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not striving time allowed hamlet the nones of november were perilous indeed to rome the conspirators arrested two days previously and fully convicted on the evidence of the gaulish ambassadors of titus volturcius of crotona and of lucius tarquiniusconvicted on the evidence of their own lettersand lastly convicted by their own admissions were yet uncondemned and in free custody as it was termed under the charge of certain senators and magistrates whose zeal for the republic was undoubted there was still in the city a considerable mass of men turbulent disaffected ripe for tumultthere was still in the senate a large party not indeed favorable to the plot but far from being unfavorable to the plotterscatiline was at the head of a power which had increased already to nearly the force of two legions and was in full march upon rome should the least check of the armies sent against him occur under such circumstances there was but little doubt that an eruption of the gladiators and a servile insurrection would liberate the traitors and perhaps even crown their frantic rashness with success such was the state of things on the morning of the nones and the brow of the great consul was dark and his heart heavy as he entered the senate convened on this occasion in the temple of jupiter stator in order to take the voice of that body on the fate of lentulus and the rest but scarcely had he taken his seat before a messenger was introduced breathless and pale the herald of present insurrection the freedmen and clients of lentulus were in arms the gladiators and the slaves of cethegus were up already and hurrying through the streets toward the house of quintus cornificius wherein their master was confined many slaves of other houses and no small number of disaffected citizens had joined them and the watches were well nigh overpowered ere long the roar of the mob might be heard even within those hallowed precincts booming up from the narrow streets about the forum like the distant sound of a heavy surf another and another messenger followed the first in quick successionone manipule of soldiers had been overpowered and driven into some houses where they defended themselves though hard set with their missilesthe multitude was thundering at the gates of the city prisons and if not quelled immediately would shortly swell their numbers by the accession of all the desperate criminals convicted slaves and reckless debtors who were crowded together in those abodes of guilt and wretchedness then was it seen when the howls of the rabble were echoing through the arches of the sanctuary wherein they sate when massacre and conflagration were imminent and close at hand then was it seen how much of real majesty and power resided still in the roman senate firm as when hannibal was thundering at their gates solemn as when the gaul was ravaging their city they sat and debated grave fearless and unmoved orders were issued to concentrate forces upon the spot where the tumult was raging the knights who were collected under arms in the whole force of their order without the gates of the temple as a guard to the senate were informed that the fathers were sufficiently defended by their own sanctity and were requested to march down upon the forum and disperse the rioters the heavy tramp of their solid march instantly succeeded the transmission of the order and in a short time after the deep swell of their charging shout rose high above the discordant clamors of the mob from the hollow of the velabrum still not a senator left his seat or changed countenance although it might be seen by the fiery glances and clinched hands of some among the younger nobles that they would have gladly joined the knights in charging their hereditary enemies the democratic rabble the question which was then debating was of more weight however than any triumph over the mob for by the decision of that question it was to be determined whether the traitors and the treason should be crushed simultaneously and forever or whether rome itself should be abandoned to the pleasure of the rebels that question was the life or death of lentulus cethegus gabinius statilius and cparius all of whom were in separate custody the last having been brought in on the previous evening arrested on his way to the camp of catiline and manlius should the senate decree their death the commonwealth might be deemed safeshould it absolve them by that weakness the republic must be lost and on the turn of a die did that question seem to hang decius junius silanus whose opinion was first asked spoke briefly but strenuously and to the point and as became the consul elect soon to be the first magistrate of that great empire he declared for the capital punishment of all those named above and of four others lucius cassius publius furius publius umbrenus and quintus annius if they should be thereafter apprehended several others of the high patrician family followed on the same side and no one had as yet ventured openly to urge the impunity of the parricides although tiberius nero had recommended a delay in taking the question and the casting of the prisoners meanwhile into actual incarceration under the safeguard of a military force but it had now come to the turn of caius julius csar the great leader then of the democratic faction the great captain that was to be in after days and the first emperor of subjugated rome an orator second if second to cicero alone ardent impassioned yet bland clement easy liberal both of hand and council averse to cicero from personal pique as well as from party opposition an eager candidate for popular applause and favor it was most natural that he should take side with the conspirators still his name having been coupled obscurely with their infamous designs although cicero had positively refused to suffer his accusation or impeachment it required so much boldness so much audacity indeed to enable him to stand forward as their open champion that many men disbelieved that he would venture on a step so hazardous the greatest possible anxiety was manifested therefore in the house when that distinguished senator arose and began in low deep harmonious tones and words which rolled forth like a gentle river in an easy and silvery flow it were well he said conscript fathers that all men who debate on dubious matters should be unbiassed in opinion by hate or friendship clemency or anger when passions intervene the mind can rarely perceive truth nor hath at one time any man obeyed his interests and his pleasures the intellect there prevails where most it is exerted if passion governs it passion hath the sole sway reason is powerless it were an easy task for me conscript fathers to quote instances in which kings and nations impelled by enmity or pity have taken unadvised and evil counsels but i prefer to cite those wherein our ancestors defying the influence of passion have acted well and wisely during the macedonian war which we waged against king perseus the state of rhodes splendid then and stately which had been built up by the aid and opulence of rome proved faithless to us and a foe yet when the war being ended debate was had concerning her our fathers suffered her citizens to go unpunished in order that no men might infer that rome had gone to war for greed and not for just resentment again in all the punic wars although the carthaginians repeatedly committed outrages against them in violation both of truce and treaties never once did they follow that example considering rather what should seem worthy of themselves than what might be inflicted justly on their foes this same consideration you should now take conscript fathers having care that the crimes of publius lentulus and his fellows weigh not upon your minds with greater potency than your own dignity and honor and that ye obey not rather the dictates of resentment than the teachings of your old renown for if a punishment worthy their crimes can be discovered i approve of it of how new precedent soever but if the enormity of their guilt overtop the invention of all men then i shall vote that we abide by the customs prescribed by our laws and institutions many of those who have already spoken have dilated in glowing and set phrases on the perils which have menaced the republic they have descanted on the horrors of warfare on the woes which befall the vanquished the rape of virgins the tearing of children from parental arms the ransacking of human homes and divine temples the subjecting of matrons to the brutal will of the conquerors havoc and conflagration and all places filled with arms and corpses with massacre and miserybut in the name of the immortal gods to what do such orations tend do they aim at inflaming your wrath against this conspiracy vain vain were such intent for is it probable that words will inflame the mind of any one if such and so atrocious facts have failed to inflame it that is indeed impossible nor hath any man at any period esteemed his own injuries too lightly most persons on the contrary hold them more heavy than they are but consequences fall not equally on all men conscript fathers they who in lowly places pass their lives in obscurity escape the censure of the world if they err on occasion under the influences of passion their fortunes and their fame are equal they who endowed with high commands live in exalted stations perform every action of their lives in the full gaze of all men thus to the greatest fortunes the smallest licence is conceded the great man must in no case consult his affections or his anger least of all must he yield to passion that which is styled wrath in the lowlyborn becomes tyranny and cruel pride in the high and noble i indeed think with those who have preceded me that every torture is too small for their atrocity and crime but it is human natures trick to remember always that which occurs the last in order forgetful of the criminals guilt the world dwells ever on the horror of his punishment if it lean never so little to the side of severity well sure am i that the speech of decius silanus a brave and energetic man was dictated by his love for the republicthat in a cause so weighty he is moved neither by favor nor resentment yet his vote to my eyes appears i say not cruel for what could be cruel inflicted on such menbut foreign to the sense of our institutions now it is clear silanus that either fear of future peril or indignation at past wrong impelled you to vote for an unprecedented penalty of fear it is needless to speak farther when through the active energy of that most eminent man our consul such forces are assembled under arms concerning the punishment of these men we must speak however as the circumstances of the case require we must admit that in agony and wo death is no penalty but rather the repose from sorrow death alone is the refuge from every mortal sufferingin death alone there is no place for joy or grief but if this be not so wherefore in the name of the gods have ye not added also to your sentence that they be scourged before their execution is it that the porcian law forbids that cannot besince other laws as strenuously prohibit the infliction of capital punishment on condemned citizens enjoining that they be suffered to go into exile is it then that to be scourged is more severe and cruel than to be slain not sofor what can be too severe or too cruel for men convicted of such crime if on the other hand it be less severe how is it fitting to obey that law in the lesser which you set at naught in the greater article but you will ask me perchance who will find fault with any punishment inflicted upon the parricides of the republic timefuture daysfortune whose caprice governs nations true these men merit all that can befall them but do ye conscript fathers pause on the precedent which you establish against others never did bad example arise but from a good precedentonly when the reins of empire have fallen from wise hands into ignorant or wicked guidance that good example is perverted from grand and worthy to base and unworthy ends the men of lacedemon when they had conquered athens set thirty tyrants at the helm who should control the commonwealth they at the first began to take off the guiltiest individuals wretches hated by all without form of trial thereat the people were rejoiced and cried out that their deaths were just and merited ere long when license had gained ground they slew alike the virtuous and the guilty and governed all by terror thus did that state oppressed by slavery rue bitterly its insane mirth within our memory when victorious sylla commanded damasippus and his crew who had grown up a blight to the republic to be put to the swords edge who did not praise the deed who did not exclaim earnestly that men factious and infamous who had torn the republic by their tumults were slain justly and yet that deed was the commencement of great havoc for when one envied the city mansion or the country farm nay but the plate or garment of another he strove with all his energy to have him on the lists of the proscription therefore they who exulted at the death of damasippus were themselves ere long dragged to execution nor was there an end put to the massacre until sylla had satiated all his men with plunder these things indeed i fear not under marcus tullius nor at this day but in a mighty state there are many and diverse dispositions it may be at another time under another consul who shall perhaps hold an army at his back that the wrong shall be taken for the right if it be so whenon this precedent by this decree of this senatethat consul shall have drawn the sword who will compel him to put it back into the scabbard who moderate his execution our ancestors o conscript fathers never lacked either wisdom in design or energy in action nor did their pride restrain them from copying those institutions of their neighbors which they deemed good and wise their arms offensive and defensive they imitated from the samnitesmost of the ensigns of their magistracies they borrowed of the tuscans in a word whatsoever they observed good and fitting among their allies or their foes they followed up with the greatest zeal at home they chose to imitate rather than envy what was good but in those days after the fashion of the greeks they punished citizens with stripes they took the lives of condemned criminals as the republic grew in size and party strife arose among its multitudinous citizens innocent persons were taken off under the pretext of the law and many wrongful deeds were committed with impunity then was the porcian law enacted with others of like tenor permitting convicts to depart into exile this i esteem o conscript fathers the first great cause wherefore this novel penalty be not established as a precedent the wisdom and the valor of our ancestors who from a small beginning created this vast empire were greater far than we who scarcely can retain what they won so nobly would i have therefore you will ask these men suffered to go at large and so to augment the hosts of catiline far from it but i shall vote thus that their property be confiscated and they themselves detained in perpetual fetters in those municipalities of italy which are the wealthiest and the strongest that the senate never again consider their case or bring their cause before the peopleand that whosoever shall speak for them be pronounced of the senate an enemy to his country and to the common good of all men this specious and artful oration in which while affecting to condemn what he dared not defend openly he had more than insinuated a doubt of the legality of sentencing the traitors was listened to by all present with deep attention and by the secret partizans of the conspiracy with joy and exultation so sure did they esteem it that in the teeth of this insidious argument the senate would not venture to inflict capital punishment on their friends that they evinced their approbation by loud cheers while many of the patrician party were shaken in their previous convictions and many of those who perceived the fallacy of his sophistical reasoning and detected his latent determination to screen the parricides of the state felt the hazard and difficulty of proceeding as the exigencies of the case required ciceros brow grew dark as silanus avowed openly that he had altered his opinion and should vote for the motion of tiberius nero to defer judgment then cicero himself arose and in the noblest perhaps of all his orations exerted himself strenuously to controvert the arguments and abolish the evil influence of the noble demagogue he did not indeed openly urge the death of the traitors but he dwelt with tremendous force on the atrocious nature of the crimes and on the consequence of their success he showed the fallacy of csars insinuation that death was a less severe enactment than perpetual imprisonment he pointed out the impossibility and injustice of compelling the municipalities to take charge of the prisonersthe insecurity of those towns as places of detentionthe almost entire certainty that the men would ere long be released either by some popular tumult or some party measure and he concluded with a forcible and earnest peroration appealing to the senators by their love of life of their families of their country to take counsel worthily of themselves and of their common mother entreating them to decree firmly and promising that he would execute their sentence be it what it might fearlessly as he sat down the order was agitated like a sea in the tumultuous calm which succeeds to the wrath and riot created by a succession of gales blowing from different quarters murmurs of approbation and encouragement were mixed with groans and loud evidences of displeasure the passions of the great concourse were aroused thoroughly and the debate waxed wild and stormy senator arose after senator advocating some the death some the banishment and some emboldened by csars remarks even proposing the enlargement of the conspirators at length when all arguments appeared to be exhausted and no hope left of anything like an unanimous decision being adopted marcus portius cato arose from his seat stern grave composed and awful from the severe integrity of his grand character the turbulent assembly was calm in a moment all eyes were fixed on the harsh features of the stoic all ears hung rivetted in expectation on his deep guttural intonations and short vigorous sentences it was evident almost ere he began to speak that his opinion would sway the votes of the order my mind is greatly different he said conscript fathers when i consider the perils of our case and recall to my memory the speeches of some whom i have heard today those senators it seems to me have descanted on the punishment of the men who have levied war against their country and their parents against their healths and their altars but the facts of the case require not punishment of their crimes but defence from their assaultsother crimes you may punish after their commissionunless you prevent this from being done when it is done vainly shall ye ask for judgment the city stormed nothing remains to the vanquished now in the name of the immortal gods i call upon you you who have always set more store on your mansions your farms your statues and your pictures than on the interests of the state if you desire to retain these things be they what they may to which you cling so lovingly if you desire to give yourselves leisure for your luxuries arouse yourselves now or never and take up the commonwealth it is no question now of taxes no question of plundering our allies the lives the liberties of every one of us are hanging on your doubtful decision oftentimes conscript fathers have i spoken at length in this assembly oftentimes have i inveighed against the luxury and avarice of our citizens and therefore have i many men my enemies i who have never pardoned my own soul even for any trivial error could not readily excuse in others the lusts which result in open criminality but although you neglected those crimes as matters of small moment still the republic by its stability and opulence sustained the weight cast on it by your negligence now however we ask not whether we shall live corrupt or virtuous we ask not how we shall render rome most great and most magnificent we ask thiswhether we ourselves and with ourselves all that we possess whatsoever shall be yielded up to the enemy who here will speak to me of clemency and pity long long ago have we cast away the true names of things for now to be lavish of the goods of others is termed liberality audacity in guilt is denominated valor into such extremity has the republic fallen let senators therefore since such are their habitudes and morals be liberal of the fortunes of our allies be merciful to the pilferers of the treasury but let them not be lavish in bestowing our blood upon them let them not in pity for a few scoundrels send all good citizens to perdition caius csar spoke a while since eloquently and in set terms in this house concerning life and death esteeming those things false i presume which are believed by most men of a future state that the wicked i mean journey on a different road from the righteous and inhabit places aloof from them dark horrid waste and fearful he hath declared his intent therefore to vote for the confiscation of their property and the detention of themselves in the borough towns in close custody fearing forsooth that if they be kept in rome they may be rescued forcibly either by the confederates in their plot or by a hireling rabble just as if there were only rogues and villains in this city and none throughout all italyjust as if audacity cannot effect the greatest things there where the means of defence are the smallest wherefore his plan is absurd if he fear peril from these men and if he alone in the midst of consternation so general do not fear the more need is there that you and i do fear them wherefore when you vote on the fate of publius lentulus and the rest hold this assured that you are voting also on the fate of catilines army on the fate of the whole conspiracy with the more energy you act the more will their courage fail them if they shall see you falter but a little all at once they will fall on fiercely be far from believing that our ancestors raised this republic from a small state to a great empire by dint of arms alone had it been so much greater should we have rendered it who have much greater force than they of citizens and of allies of arms and of horses but there were other things which made them great which we lack altogether at home industry abroad justice a mind free to take counsel unbiassed by crime or passion instead of these things we possess luxury and avarice public need private opulence we praise wealth and practice indolence between righteous and guilty we make no distinction ambition gains all the rewards of virtue nor is this strange when separately every one of you takes counsel for himself alone when at home you are slaves to pleasure here in the senate house to bribery or favor thence it arises that a general charge is made from all quarters against the helpless commonwealth but this i will pass over the noblest of our citizens have conspired to put the torch to the republic they have called to their aid in open war the gallic nation most hostile to the name of roman the chief of your enemy is thundering above your very heads and are you hesitating even now what you shall do with enemies taken within your very wallsoh you had better pity them i thinkthe poor young men have only erred a little misled by ambitionyou had better send them away in arms i swear that should they once take those arms that clemency and mercifulness of yours will be changed into wo and wailing forsooth it is a desperate crisis and yet you fear it not yea by the gods but you do fear it vehemently yet in your indolence and feebleness of mind waiting the one upon the other you hesitate relying i presume on the protection of the immortals who have so many times preserved this republic in its greatest dangers the aid of the gods is not gained by prayers or womanish supplication to those who watch who act who take counsel wisely all things turn out successful yield yourselves up to idleness and sloth and in vain you shall implore the godsthey are irate and hostile in the time of our forefathers titus manlius torquatus during the gallic war commanded his own son to be slain because he had fought against orders and that illustrious youth suffered the penalty of his immoderate valordo ye know this and delay what ye shall decide against the cruellest parricides is it forsooth that the lives of these men are in their character repugnant to this guiltoh spare the dignity of lentulus if he have ever spared his own modesty his own good report if he have ever spared any man or any god oh pardon the youth of cethegus if this be not the second time that he has waged war on his country for wherefore should i speak of gabinius statilius or cpariuswho if they ever felt any care for the republic would never have taken these councils to conclude conscript fathers if there were any space for a mistake i would leave you right willingly by hercules to be corrected by facts since you will not be warned by words but we are hemmed in on all sides catiline with his army is at our very throatsothers of our foes are within our walls in the bosom of the state nothing can be prepared nor any counsel taken so privately but they must know itwherefore i shall vote thus seeing that the republic is plunged into most fearful peril by the guilty plot of atrocious citizens seeing that these men are convicted on the evidence of titus volturcius and of the ambassadors of the allobroges and seeing that they have confessed the intent of murder conflagration and other foul and barbarous crimes against their fellow citizens and native countryi shall vote i say that execution according to the custom of our ancestors be done upon them having thus confessed as upon men manifestly convicted of capital treason the stern voice ceased the bitter irony which had stung so many souls to the quick the cutting sarcasm which had demolished csars sophistry the clear reasoning which had so manifestly found the heart of the mystery were silent and folding his narrow toga closely about him the severe patriot resumed his seat he alone unexcited and impassive but his words had done their work the guilty were smitten into silence even the daring eloquence and high heart of the ambitious csar were subdued and mutethe friends of their country were encouraged to shake off their apathy with one voice unanimous the consulars of rome cried out for the question applauding loudly the energy and fearlessness of cato and accusing one another of timidity and weakness a great majority of the senate likewise exclaimed aloud that they required no more words but were prepared to vote and convinced that the time had arrived for striking cicero put it to the vote according to the regular form requiring those who thought with marcus porcius cato to pass over to the right of the curule chair the question was not in doubt a moment for above threefourths of the whole body arose as a single man and passed over to the right of the chair and gathered about the seat of cato while very few joined themselves openly to julius csar who sat somewhat crestfallen and scarcely able to conceal his disappointment immediately on the left of the consul rallying however before the vote of the senate had been taken the factious noble sprang to his feet and loudly called upon the tribunes in general and upon lucius bestia in particular a private friend of catiline and understood by all to be one of the conspirators to interpose their veto that was too much however even for tribunician daring no answer was made from the benches of the popular magistrates for once awed into patriotic silence but a low sneering laugh ran through the crowded ranks of the patricians and the vote was taken now nearly unanimous for many men disgusted by that last step who had believed the measure to be unconstitutional passed across openly from csars side to that of cato a decree of the senate was framed forthwith and committed to writing by the persons appointed in presence of marcus porcius cato and decius julius silanus as authorities or witnesses of the act empowering the consul to see execution done upon the guilty where and when it should to him seem fitting thus was it that cicero and cato for a while saved the commonwealth and checked the future dictator in his first efforts to subvert the liberties of rome happy for him and for his country if it had been his last chapter xiv the tullianum to be or not be that is the question hamlet night was at hand the roman senate might not sit after the sun had set although the tribunes had failed in the consternation of the moment to respond to the call of csar there was no doubt that if one night should intervene those miscalled magistrates would check the course of justice confined apart one from the other in free custody the traitors had not failed to learn all that was passing almost ere it passed their hopes had been high when the rabble were alert and thundering at the prison gatesnor when the charge of the knights had beaten back the multitude did they despair for simultaneously with those evil tidings they learned the effect of csars speech and shortly afterward the news reached them that ciceros reply had found few willing auditors confined apart one from the other they had eaten and drunken and their hearts were jocund and sublime the eloquence of csar the turbulence of the tribunes were their predominant ideas confined apart one from the other one thought was common to them allimmediate liberation speedy vengeance and in truth immediate was the liberation speedy the vengeance night was at hand the triumvirs whose duty it was to superintend all capital punishmentsa thing almost unknown in romehad been instructed to prepare whatever should be needful lentulus sat alone in an inner chamber of the house of publius lentulus spintherus an dile at that time there was it is true a guard at the door and clients under arms in the atrium but in his own apartment the proud conspirator was still master of himself indeed soon to be master of rome in his own frantic fantasy bright lights were burning in bronze candelabra rich wines were before him his own favorite freedman leaned on the back of his ivory arm chair and jested lightly on the discomfiture of noble cicero on the sure triumph of democratic csar fill up the glass again my phormio cried the exhilarated parricide this namesake of my own hath good wine at the leastwe may not taste it again shortlyfill up i say and do not spare to brim your own what if our boys were beaten in the streets today brave csar was not beaten in the senate by hercules no cried the wily greek base inheritor of a superb nameand if he had been checked there are the tribunes but he was not checked phormio asked the conspirator in evident anxiety by your head no you shall yet be the third cornelius who shall rule rome the door of the small room was suddenly thrown open and the tall form of cicero stood in the shadow of the entrance the gleam of the lamps fell full on his white robes and glittered on his ivory sceptre but behind him it showed the grim dark features of the capital triumvirs and flickered on the axeheads of the lictors the glass fell from the hand of lentulus the wine untasted and so deep was the silence of that awful moment that the gurgling of the liquor as it trickled from the shattered fragments of the crystal goblet was distinctly audible there was a silent pauseno word no motion followed the entrance of the consul face to face he stood with the deadliest of his foes catiline absent face to face he stood with his overthrown and subdued enemy and yet on his broad tranquil brow there was no frown of hatred on his calm lip there there was no curl of gratified resentment of high triumph raising his hand with a slow but very solemn gesture he uttered in his deep harmonious accents accents which at that moment spoke in almost an unnatural cadence this one word come and calm and proud as the consul the degraded senator the fallen consul replied with a question to death consul come give me my toga phormio and robing himself with an air as quiet and an expression as unconcerned as if he had been setting forth to a banquet the proud epicurean gazed with a calmer eye upon the consul than that good man could fix upon his victim this signet to semproniathat sword tono nothis purse to thyself phormio consul precede i follow and the step of the convicted traitor as he descended from the portico of that mansion for the last time was firmer statelier prouder than that of his conductor the streets were throngedthe windows crowdedthe housetops heapedwith glaring mute spectators some twenty knights no more unarmed with the exception of their swords composed the consuls escort lentulus knew them man by man had drunk with them played with them lent money to them borrowed of them he looked upon them they were the handful leading him to death what made them break the ties which bound them to their brother noble what made them forget mutual pleasures enjoyed mutual perils incurred mutual benefits accepted they were the nobles true to their order he looked upon the thronged streetsupon the crowded windowsupon the heaped housetops he saw myriads myriads who had fed on his bounty encouraged his infamy hoped from his atrocity urged him to his crime myriads who now frowned upon himcursed himhowled at himormore cowardlywere silent myriads who might have saved him and did not wherefore they were the people false to their leader he looked from the handful to the myriadand shook himself as a lion in his wrath and stamped the dust from his sandals cicero saw the movement and read its meaning he met the glance not humiliated but prouder for the mobs reprobation and said what he would not have said had the glance been conscious thou seesthearest the voice of the people answered the traitor with a bitter sneer the voice of god replied the consul looking upward that voice of god shall shout for joy at thy head on the rostrum such is the fate of all who would serve the people the eloquent tongue stabbed with the harlots bodkin the head and the hand nailed on the beaked column in after days showed which best knew the people their savior or their parricide there is a place in romethere is a placereader thou mayest have seen iton the right hand as thou goest up the steps of the asylum ascending from the forum to the capitol there is a place wrote sallust some nineteen hundred years agothere is a place within the prison which is called tullianum after you have ascended a little way to the left about twelve feet underground it is built strongly with walls on every side and arched above with a stone vaulting but its aspect is foul and terrible from neglect darkness and stench it is there nowthou mayest have seen it reader men call it the mamertine prison it was then called tullianum because it was so antique at that time that vague tradition only told of its origin long centuries before built by the fabulous king tullius the tullianumthe mamertine prison the bath which jugurtha found very cold when the earrings had been torn from his bleeding ears and stript of his last vestment he was let down to die by the hangmans noose the prison in which scarce one century later saint paul was held in durance what time agrippa said unto festus this man might have been set at liberty had he not appealed unto csar unto csar csar the third emperor the third tyrant of the roman people lentulus had appealed unto csar and was cast likewise into the tullianum the voice of the people is the voice of god whether of the twain slew lentulus whether of the twain set free paul from the tullianum in those days there was a tall and massive structure above that sordid and tremendous vault on the right hand as you go up towards the capitol the steps of the asylum were lined on either side by legionaries in full armor and as the consul walked up with his victim side by side each soldier faced about and by a simple movement doubling their files occupied the whole space of the steep ascent with a solid column while all the heights above and the great capitol itself bristled with spears and flashed with tawny light from the dense ranks of brazen corslets the capital triumvirs received the consul at the door and with his prisoner he passed inward it was in perfect keeping with the roman character that a man hopeless of success should die without an effort and to the fullest lentulus acted out that character impassive and unmoved he went to his death he disgraced his evil life by no cowardice in death by no fruitless call upon the people for assistance by no vain cry to the nobles for mercy but it was the impassibility of the epicurean not of the stoic that sustained him he went to die like his brother democrats of france with the madness of atheism in his heart the mirth of perdition on his tongue they two the convict and the consul ascended a little two or three steps to the left and entered a large apartment paved walled and roofed with stone but in the centre of the floor there was a small round aperture there were a dozen persons in that guardroom four of whom were his fellowtraitorsgabinius statilius cparius and cethegustwo prtors four legionaries and two moorish slaves composed the group until with the triumvirs and his twelve lictors cicero entered ha my cparius exclaimed lentulus who had not seen him since the morning of his arrest we have met again but i slept my sleep out thou mightst as well have slept too for we are both met here to die to die great gods to die cried cparius utterly overcome and almost fainting with despair great gods indeed replied lentulus with his accustomed halfsardonic halfindolent sneer they must be great indeed to let such a puppet as that and he pointed to cicero as he spoke do as he will with us to die to die tushwhat is that but to sleep to sleep without the trouble of awaking or the annoyance of tomorrow what sayest thou my cethegus that thou art a sluggard a fool and a coward curses curses curses upon thee and he made an effort to rush against his comrade as if to strike him and when the guards seized him and dragged him back he shook his fist at cicero and gnashed his teeth and howling out thou too thou too shalt die proscribed and thy countrys foe by a sudden effort cast off the men who held him and crying slaves and dastards see how a roman noble dies rushed with his head down at the solid wall as a buffalo rushes blindly against an elephant he fell as if he were dead the blood gushing from eyes nose and mouth and lay senseless lentulus thought he was killed gazed on him for a moment tranquilly and then said with a quiet laugh he was a fool alwaysa rash fool then turning to cicero he addedby hercules this is slow work i am exceeding hungry and somewhat dry and as i fancy i shall eat nothing more today nor drink i would fain go to sleep wouldst thou drink lentulus asked one of the triumvirs would i not had i wine bring wine said the magistrate to one of the moorish slaves who went out and returned in an instant with a large brazen platter supporting several goblets lentulus seized one quickly and swallowed it at a mouthfulthere is a hot thirst in that last excitementbut as the flavor reached his palate when the roughness of the harsh draught had passed away he flung the cup down scornfully and said finish it take this filthy taste from my lips let me rest and with the words he advanced to the moors who stood beside the welllike aperture and without a word suffered them to place the rope under his arms and lower him into the pit just as his head however was disappearing he cast his eyes upward and met the earnest gaze of the consul the voice of the people the man of the people he cried sarcastically fool fool they shall avenge me think upon me near formi was that spite or a prophecy the eyes of the dying sometimes look far into futurity the haughty traitor was beyond the sight before his words had ceased to ring in the ears of the spectators there was a small low sound heard from belownot a groan not a strugglebut a rustle a sob a fluttersilence so did that patrician of the most noble house of the cornelii who once held consular dominion in rome meet his end merited by his course of life and his overt actions cethegus perished senseless half dead by his own deed cparius died sullen gabinius weak and almost fainting statilius struggling and howling all by a hard and slavish death strangled by the base noose of a foreign hangman an hour afterward their corpses were hurled down the gemonian stairs among the shouts and acclamations of the drunken slavish rabble an hour afterward cicero stood on the rostrum near the libonian wellthat rostrum whereon at a later day lentulus prophecy was fulfilledand called out in a voice as solemn and almost as deep as thunder they were and the voice of the people yelled out its joy because they were no longer and hailed their slayer the savior and father of his country a few years afterward how did they not hail anthony chapter xv the camp in the appennines with that he gave his able horse the head henry iv there is a wild gorge in the very summit of the appennines not quite midway between florence and pistoia the waters of which shed in different directions flow on the one hand tributaries to the po and on the other to the arno swelling the adriatic and the mediterranean seas the mountains rise abruptly in bare crags covered here and there by a low growth of myrtle and wild olives on either hand this gorge quite inaccessible to any large array of armed men though capable of being traversed by solitary foresters or shepherds below the hills fall downward in a succession of vast broken ridges in places rocky and almost perpendicular in places swelling into rounded knolls feathered with dark rich forests of holm oak and chesnut in the highest part of this gorge where it spreads out into a little plain perched like the eyry of some ravenous bird of prey the camp of catiline was pitched on the second evening after the execution of his comrades selected with rare judgment commanding all the lower country and the descent on one hand into the val darno and thence to rome on the other into the plain of the po and thence into cisalpine gaul the whole of which was ripe for insurrection that camp secured to him an advance upon the city should his friends prove successful or a retreat into regions where he could raise new levies in case of their failure a roman camp was little less than a regular fortification being formed mostly in an oblong square with a broad ditch and earthen ramparts garnished by a stockade with wooden towers at the gates one of which pierced each side of the intrenchment and to such a degree of perfection and celerity had long experience and the most rigid discipline brought the legions that it required an incredibly short time to prepare such a camp for any number of men a thing which never was omitted to be done nightly even during the most arduous marches and in the face of an enemy catiline was too able and too old a soldier to neglect such precaution under any circumstances and assuredly he would not have done so now when the consul antonius lay with two veteran legions within twenty miles distance in the low country east of florence while quintus metellus celer at the head of a yet larger force was in the picene district on his rear and not so far off but he might have attempted to strike a blow at him his camp capable of containing two full legions the number of which he had completed all freeborn men and roman citizens for he had refused the slaves who flocked at first to his standard in great force was perfectly defended and provided with all the usual tents and divisions so that every cohort manipule and century nay every man knew his own station the sun had just sunk beneath the horizon and the night watches had been set by sound of trumpets the horsemen had been appointed for the rounds and an outpost of lightarmed soldiers pushed forward in front of all the gates there was a rosy tinge still lingering in the sky and a few slant rays were shot through the gaps in the mountain ridge gilding the evergreen foliage of the holmoaks with bright lustre and warming the cold grey stones which cumbered the sides and summits of the giant hills but all the level country at their feet was covered with deep purple shadow catiline sat alone in his prtorium as the generals pavilion was entitled situated on a little knoll nearly in the centre of the camp between the tents of the tribunes and the quarters of the extraordinary horse he was completely armed all but his head and wore a rich scarlet cloak above his panoply his helmet and buckler lying upon the ground beside him in easy reach of his hand a pen was in his fingers and a sheet of parchment was stretched on the board before him but he was not writing although there were several lines scrawled on it in a bold coarse hand his face was paler and more livid than usual and his frame thinner almost indeed emaciated yet every sinew and muscle was hard as tempered steel but now there was a strange expression in his features it was not doubt nor hesitation much less fear and consisted perhaps rather in the absence of his wonted characteristics the unquiet and quick changes the passionate restlessness the fell deadly sneer and the blighting flash of the dark eye than in any token of peculiar meaningthere was a cold and almost vacant expression in his gaze and an impassive calmness in all his lineaments that were in singular contrast with the character of the man and he sat a thing most unusual for him perfectly motionless buried in deep thought the night was very cold and without a heavy hoar frost was falling so that a fire of charcoal had keen kindled in a bronze brazier and as the light of the sky died away strange lurid gleams and fantastic shadows rose and fell upon the walls of the large tent rendered more fickle and grotesque by the wavering of the canvass in the gusty night air there was wine with several goblets upon the board at which he sat with his eyes fixed straight before him and at his elbow there stood a tall brazen tripod supporting a large lamp with several burners but none of these were lighted and but for the fitful glare of the charcoal the tent would have been completely dark still he called not to any slave nor appeared to observe the growing obscurity but sat gloomily ponderingon what once or twice he drew his hand across his eyes and then glared still more fixedly upon the dark and waving shadows as if he saw something more than common in their uncertain outlines suddenly he spoke in a hoarse altered voicethis is strange he said very strange now were i one of these weak fools who believe in omens i should shake but tush tush how should there be omens for who should send them there must be gods to have omens and that is too absurd for credence gods gods he repeated half dubiouslyyet if there shouldha ha art thou turned dotard catiline there are no gods or why sleep their thunders aye there it is again he added gazing on vacancy by my right hand it is very strange three times last night the first time when the watch was set and twice afterward i saw him and three times again tonight since the trumpet was blown lentulus with his lips distorted his face black and full of blood his eyes starting from their sockets like a man strangled and he beckoned me with his pale hand i saw him yet so shadowy and so transparent that i might mark the waving of the canvass through his figurebut tush tush it is but a trick of the fancy i am worn out with this daily marching and the bodys fatigue hath made the mind weak and weary and it is dull here too no dice no women and no revelling i will take some wine he added starting up and quaffing two or three goblets full in quick succession my blood is thin and cold and wants warming ha that is betterit is right old setinian too i marvel whence manlius had it then he rose from his seat and began to stride about the room impatiently after a moment or two he dashed his hand fiercely against his brow and cried in a voice full of anguish and perturbation tidings tidings i would give half the world for tidings curses curses upon it that i began this game at all or had not brave colleagues it is time can it be that their hearts have failed them that they have feared or delayed to strike or have been overthrown detectedtidings tidings by hades i must have tidings what ho he exclaimed raising his voice to a higher pitch ho i say ho chrea and from an outer compartment of the tent the greek freedman entered bearing a lighted lamp in his hand chrea summon manlius hither and leave the lamp have been long in the darkness wert sleeping catiline sleeping exclaimed the traitor with a savage cry hoarse as the roar of a wounded lionsleeping thou idiot do men sleep on volcanoes do men sleep in the crisis of their fortunes i have not slept these six nights get thee gone summon manlius and then as the freedman left the room he added perchance i shall sleep no more untili sleep for ever i would i could sleep and not see those faces they never troubled me till now i would i knew if that sleep is dreamless if it were soperhaps perhaps but no no by all the furies no until my foot hath trodden on the neck of cicero as he spoke manlius entered the room a tall dark sinisterlooking scarseamed veteran equipped in splendid armor of which the helmet alone was visible so closely was he wrapped against the cold in a huge shaggy watchcloak as his subordinate appeared every trace of the conflict which had been in progress within him vanished and his brow became as impassive his eye as hard and keen as its wont welcome my caius he exclaimed look you we have present need of council the blow must be stricken before this in rome or must have failed altogether if it have been stricken we should be nearer rome to profit by itif it have failed we must destroy antonius army before metellus join him i doubt not he is marching hitherward even now besides we must we must have tidingswe must know all and all truly then seeing that manlius doubted look you he continued let us march at daybreak tomorrow upon fsul leaving antonius in the plain on our right marching along the crest of the hills he cannot assail our flank we can outstrip him too and reach arretium ere the second sunset he thinking we have surely tidings from our friends in the city will follow in disordered haste and should we have bad news doubling upon him on a sudden we may overpower him at one blow it is a sure scheme either waythinkst thou not so good friend nay more it is the only one i think so sergius he replied in very deed i think so forage too is becoming scarce in the camp and the baggage horses are dying the men are murmuring also for want of the pleasures the carouses and the women of the cities they will regain their spirits in an hour when they shall hear of the march upon rome i prithee let them hear it then my caius and that presently give orders to the tribunes and centurions to have the tents struck and the baggage loaded in the first hour of the last nightwatch we will advance atha he exclaimed interrupting himself suddenly and listening with eager attention there is a horse tramp crossing from the gates by the gods news from rome tarry with me until we hear it within five minutes chrea reentered the tent introducing a man dressed and armed as a lighthorseman covered with mudstains travelworn bending with fatigue and shivering with cold the hoarfrost hanging white upon his eyebrows and beard from rome good fellow catiline inquired quickly from rome catiline replied the other bearing a letter from the noble lentulus givegive it quick and with the word he snatched the scroll from the mans hand tore it violently open and read aloud as follows who i may be you will learn from the bearer all things go bravely the ambassadors have lost their suit but we have won ours they return home tomorrow by the flaminian way one titus of crotona guiding them who shall explain to you our thoughts and hopesbut of this doubt not thoughts shall be deeds and hopes success before this hour tomorrow by all the gods cried catiline with a shout of joy ere this time all is won cicero cicero i have triumphed and thou mine enemy art nothing then turning to the messenger he asked when didst leave rome with these joyous tidings when sawest the noble lentulus on the fourth day before the nones at sunset and we are now in the sixth before the ides thou hast loitered on the way sirrah i was compelled to quit my road catiline and to lie hid four days among the hills to avoid a troop of horse which pursued me seeing that i was armed an advanced guard i think of antonius army thou didst well get thee gone and bid them supply thy wants eat drink and sleepwe march upon rome at daybreak tomorrow the man left the apartment and looking to manlius with a flushed cheek and exulting aspect catiline exclaimed murmuring for pleasure and for women are they tell them good friend they shall have all the gold of rome for their pleasure and all its patrician dames for their women stir up their souls my manlius kindle their blood with it matters not what fire see to it my good comrade i am aweary and will lay me down i can sleep after these good tidings but it was not destined that he should sleep so soon he had thrown himself again into a chair and filled himself a brimming goblet of the rich wine when he repeated to himself in a half musing tone murmuring for their women haby venus i cannot blame the knaves it is dull work enough without the darlings

died as die she shall in torture by my hand curses on her she has thwarted defied foiled me by every fiend and fury ill shall she perish were she ten times my daughter again there was a bustle without the entrance of the pavilion and again chrea introduced a messenger it was niger one of the swordsmiths men catiline recognized him in an instant ha niger my good lad from caius crispus ha from caius crispus praying succor and that swift lest it be too late succor against whom succor where and wherefore against a century of antonius foot they came upon us unawares killed forty of our men and drove the stout smith for shelter into a ruined watchtower on the hill above the cataract near to usella which happily afforded him a shelter they have besieged us there these two days but cannot storm us until our arrows fail or they bring up engines but our food is finished and our wine wakes low and julia who julia shouted catiline scarce able to believe his ears and springing from his chair in rapturous agitationby your life speak what julia hortensias daughter whom enough enough chreahe scrawled a few words on a strip of parchmentthis to terentius the captain of my guard three hundred select horsemen to be in arms and mounted within half an hour let them take torches and a guide for usella saddle the black horse erebus get me some food and a watchcloak get thee away now tell me all good fellow the man stated rapidly but circumstantially all that he knew of the occurrences of julias seizure of the capture of aulus and of their journey and then his eyes gleaming with the fierce blaze of excited passion and triumphant hatred catiline crossquestioned him concerning the unhappy girl had she been brought thus far safely and with unblemished honor had she suffered from hunger or fatigue had her beauty been impaired by privation and having received satisfactory replies to all his queries he gave himself up to transports of exultation such as his own most confidential freedman never before had witnessed dismissing the messenger he strode to and fro the hut tossing his arms aloft and bursting into paroxysms of fierce laughter ha ha too muchit is too much for one night ha ha ha ha love hatred passion triumph rage revenge ambition all all gratified ha ha soft gentle juliaproud virtuous one that did despise me thou shalt writhe for itfrom thy soul shalt thou bleed for it ha

virtue no gods i say no gods no gods chrea but as he spoke there burst close over head an appaling crash of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid and pervading that the whole tent seemed to be on fire the terrified greek fell to the earth stunned and dazzled but the audacious and insane blasphemer tossing his arms and lifting his front proudly exclaimed with his cynical sneer if ye be gods strike strike i defy your vain noise your harmless thunder for ten minutes or more blaze succeeded blaze and crash followed crash with such tremendous rapidity that the whole heavens nay the whole atmosphere appeared incandescent with white sulphureous omnipresent fire and that the roar of the volleyed thunder was continuous and incessant still the fierce traitor blenched not crime and success had maddened him his heart was hardened his head frenzied to his own destruction but the winter storm in the mountains was as brief as it was sudden and tremendous and it ceased as abruptly as it broke out unexpectedly a tempest of hail came pelting down the grapeshot as it were of that heavenly artillery scourging the earth with furious force during ten minutes more and then the night was as serene and tranquil as it had been before that elemental uproar as the last flash of lightning flickered faintly away and the last thunder roll died out in the sky catiline stirred the freedman with his foot get up thou coward fool did i not tell thee that there are no gods lo you now for what should they have roused this trumpery pother if not to strike me tush man i say get up is it thou sergius catiline asked the greek scarce daring to raise his head from the ground did not the bolt annihilate thee art thou not indeed dead judge if i be dead fool by this and this and this and with each word he kicked and trampled on the grovelling wretch with such savage violence and fury that he bellowed and howled for mercy and was scarce able to creep out of the apartment when he ceased stamping upon him and ordered him to begone speedily and bring his charger ere many minutes had elapsed the traitor was on horseback and issuing from the gates of his camp into the calm and starry night he drove with his escort at his heels with the impetuosity and din of a whirlwind waking the mountain echoes by the clang of the thundering hoofs and the clash of the brazen armor and steel scabbards down the steep defile toward usella chapter xvi the watchtower of usella our castles strength will laugh a siege to scorn macbeth the watchtower in which caius crispus and his gang had taken refuge from the legionaries was one of those small isolated structures many of which had been perched in the olden time on the summits of the jutting crags or in the passes of the appennines but most of which had fallen long before into utter ruin some had been destroyed in the border wars of the innumerable petty tribes which ere the romans became masters of the peninsula divided among themselves that portion of italy and held it in continual turmoil with their incessant wars and forays some had mouldered away by the slow hand of ruthless time and yet more had been pulled down for the sake of their materials which now filled a more useful if less glorious station in the enclosures of tilled fields and the walls of rustic dwellings from such a fate the watchtower of usella had been saved by several accidents its natural and artificial strength had prevented its sack or storm during the earlier period of its existencethe difficulty of approaching it had saved its solid masonry from the cupidity of the rural proprietorsand yet more its formidable situation commanding one of the great hill passes into cisalpine gaul had induced the roman government to retain it in use as a fortified post so long as their gallic neighbors were half subdued only and capable of giving them trouble by their tumultuous incursions although it had consisted therefore in the first instance of little more than a rude circular tower of that architecture called cyclopean additions had been made to it by the romans of a strong brick wall with a parapet enclosing a space of about a hundred feet in diameter accessible only by a single gateway with a steep and narrow path leading to it and thoroughly commanded by the tower itself in front this wall was founded on a rough craggy bank of some thirty feet in height rising from the main road traversing the defile by which alone it could be approached for on the right and left the rocks had been scarped artificially and in the rear there was a natural gorge through which a narrow but impetuous torrent raved between precipices a hundred feet in depth although an arch of twenty foot span would have crossed the ravine with ease against the wall at this point on the inner side the romans had constructed a small barrack with three apartments each of which had a narrow window overlooking the bed of the torrent no danger being apprehended from that quarter such was the place into which crispus had retreated under the guidance of one of the etruscan conspirators after the attack of the roman infantry and having succeeded in reaching it by aid of their horses half an hour before their pursuers came up they had contrived to barricade the gateway solidly with some felled pine trees and had even managed to bring in with them a yoke of oxen and a mule laden with wine which they had seized from the peasants in the street of the little village of usella as they gallopped through it goading their blown and weary animals to the top of their speed it was singularly characteristic of the brutal pertinacity and perhaps of the sagacity also of caius crispus that nothing could induce him to release the miserable julia who was but an incumbrance to their flight and a hindrance to their defence to all her entreaties and promises of safety from his captors and reward from her friends if he would release her he had replied only with a sneer saying that he would ensure his own safety at an obolus fee and that for his reward he would trust noble catiline for the rest he added imagine not that you shall escape to rejoice the heart of that slave arvina no minion no we will fight till our flesh be hacked from our bones ere they shall make their way in hither and if they do so they shall find theedead and dishonored pray therefore if thou be wise for our success such might in part indeed have been his reasoning for he was cruel and licentious as well as reckless and audacious but it is probable that knowing himself to be in the vicinity of catilines army he calculated on finding some method of conveying to him information of the prize that lay within his grasp and so of securing both rescue and reward if he had not however in the first instance thought of this it was not long ere it occurred to him when he at once proceeded to put it into execution within half an hour of the entrance of the little party into this semiruinous stronghold the legionary foot came up about a hundred and fifty men in number but without scaling ladders artillery or engines elated by their success however they immediately formed what was called the tortoise by raising their shields and overlapping the edges of them above their heads in such a manner as to make a complete penthouse which might defend them from the missiles of the besieged and under cover of this they rushed forward dauntlessly to cut down the palisade with their hooks and axes in this they would have probably succeeded for the arrows and ordinary missiles of the defenders rebounded and rolled down innocuous from the tough brassbound bullhides and the rebels were already well nigh in despair when caius crispus who had been playing his part gallantly at the barricade and had stabbed two or three of the legionaries with his pilum in hand to hand encounter through the apertures of the grating rushed up to the battlements covered with blood and dust and shouting ho by hercules this will never do friends give me yon crowbarso take levers all of you and axes we must roll down the coping on their headsapplied his own skill and vast personal strength to the task in an instant the levers were fixed and grasping his crowbar with gigantic energy he set up his favorite chaunt as cheerily as he had done of old in his smithy on the sacred way ply ply my boys now ply the lever heave at it heave at it all together great mars the war god watches ye laboring joyously joyous watches but his words were cut short by a thundering crash for animated by his untamed spirit his fellows had heaved with such a will at the long line of freestone coping that after tottering for a few seconds and reeling to and fro it all rushed down with the speed and havoc of an avalanche drowning all human sounds with the exception of one piercing yell of anguish which rose clear above the confused roar and clatter ho by the thunderer we have smashed them beneath their tortoise like an egg in its shell now ply your bows brave boys now hurl your javelins well shot well shot indeed my niger you hit that highcrested centurion full in the mouth as he called on them to rally and nailed his tongue to his jaws give me another pilum rufus this he continued as he poised and launched it hurtling through the air this to the ensignbearer and scarce was the word said ere the ponderous missile alighted on his extended shield pierced its tough fourfold bullhide as if it had been a sheet of parchment drove through his bronze cuirass and hurled him to the ground slain outright in an instant ha they have got enough of it shout boys victoria victoria and the wild cheering of the rebels pealed high above the roar of the torrent striking dismay into the soul of the wretched julia but although the rebels had thus far succeeded and the legionaries had fallen back bearing their dead and wounded with them the success was by no means absolute or final and this no man knew better than the swordsmith he watched the soldiers eagerly as they drew off in orderly array into the hollow way and after a short consultation posting themselves directly in front of the gate with sentinels thrown out in all directions lighted a large watch fire in the road with the intention evidently of converting the storm into a blockade a few moments afterward he saw a soldier mount the horse of the slain centurion and gallop down the hill in the direction of antonius army which was well known to be lying to the southeastward still a few minutes later a small party was sent down into the village and returned bringing provisions which the men almost immediately began to cook after having posted a chain of videttes from one bank to the other of the precipitous ravine so as to assure themselves that no possibility of escape was left to the besieged in any direction by which they conceived escape to be practicable ha exclaimed crispus as he watched their movements they will give us no more trouble tonight but we will make sure of them by posting one sentinel above the gate and another on the head of the watchtower then we will light us a good fire in the yard below and feast there on the beef and wine of those brute peasants the legionaries fancy that they can starve us out but they know not how well we are provided hark you my niger go down and butcher those two beeves and when they are flayed and decapitated blow me a good loud trumpet blast and roll down the heads over the battlements long ere we have consumed our provender catiline will be down on them in force i go to look around the place and make all certain and with the words he ascended to the summit of the old watchtower and stood there for many minutes surveying the whole conformation of the country and all the defences of the place with a calm and skilful eye the man was by no means destitute of certain natural talents and an aptitude for war which had it been cultivated or improved might possibly have made him a captain he speedily perceived therefore that the defences were tenable so long only as no ladders or engines should be brought against them which he was well assured would be done within twentyfour hours at the latest he knew also that want of provisions must compel him to surrender at discretion before many days and he felt it to be very doubtful whether without some strong effort on their part catiline would hear at all of their situation until it should be entirely too late he began therefore at once to look about him for means of despatching an envoy nothing doubting that succor would be sent to him instantly could the arch traitor be informed that the lovely julia was a prisoner awaiting his licentious pleasure descending from the battlements he proceeded at once to the barrack rooms in the rear hoping to find some possibility of lowering a messenger into the bed of the stream or transporting him across the ravine unseen by the sentinels of the enemy then casting open a door of fast decaying woodwork he entered the first of the low mouldering unfurnished rooms and stepping across the paved floor with a noiseless foot thrust his head out of the window and gazed anxiously up and down the course of the ravine he became satisfied at once that his idea was feasible for the old wall was built at this place in salient angles following the natural line of the cliffs and the window of the central room was situated in the bottom of the recess between two jutting curtains in each of which was another embrasure it was evident therefore that a person lowered by the middle window into the gorge beneath would be screened from the view of any watchers by the projection of the walls and crispus nothing doubted but that once in the bottom of the ravine a path might be found more or less difficult by which to reach the upper country beyond the ravine rose many broken knolls covered with a thick undergrowth of young chesnut hollies wild laurels and the like and through these a winding road might be discovered penetrating the passes of the hills and crossing the glen at a half miles distance below on a singlearched brick bridge by which it joined the causeway occupied by the legionaries having observed so much caius crispus was on the point of withdrawing his head forgetting all about his prisoner who on their entrance into this dismantled hold had been thrust in hither as into the place where she would be most out of harms way and least likely to escape but just as he was satisfied with gazing the lovely face of julia pale as an image of statuary marble with all her splendid auburn hair unbound was advanced out of the middle window evidently looking out like himself for means of escape but to her the prospect was not as to him satisfactory and uttering a deep sigh she shook her head sadly and wrung her hands with an expression of utter despair ha ha my pretty one it is too deep i trow cried crispus whom she had not yet observed with a cruel laugh nothing i swear without wings can descend that abyss unless like sappho whom the poets tell us of it would put an end to both love and life together no no you cannot escape thus my pretty one and on the outside i will make sure of you for the rest i will send you some watch cloaks for a bed some supper and some wine we will not starve you my fair julia and no one shall harm you here for i will sleep across your door myself this night and ere tomorrows sunset we shall be in the camp with catiline he was as good as his word for he returned almost immediately bringing a pile of watchcloaks which he arranged into a rude semblance of a bed with a pack saddle for the pillow in the innermost recess of the inner room with some bread and beef broiled hastily on the embers and some wine mixed with water which last she drank eagerly for fear and anxiety had parched her and she was faint with thirst before he went out again he looked earnestly from the unlatticed window in order to assure himself that she had no means of escape scarce was he gone before she heard the shrill blast of the roman trumpets blown clearly and scientifically for the watchsetting and soon afterward all the din and bustle which had been rife through the livelong day sank into silence and she could hear the brawling of the brook below chafing and raving against the rocks which barred its bed and the wind murmuring against the leafless treetops shortly after this it became quite dark and after sitting musing awhile with a sad and despairing heart and putting up a wild prayer to the gods for mercy and protection she went once more and leaned out of the window gazing wistfully on the black stones and foamy water nothing she said to herself sadly repeating caius crispus words could descend hence without wings and live it is too true alas too true she paused for a moment and then while a flash of singular enthusiastic joy irradiated all her pallid lineaments she exclaimed but the great gods be praised one can leap down and die let life go what is life since i can thus preserve my honor she paused again and considered then clasped her hands together and seemed to be on the point of casting herself into that awful gulf but she resisted the temptation and said not yet not yet there is hope yet on earth and i will live awhile for hope and for paullus i can do this at any timeof this refuge at least they cannot rob me i will live yet awhile and with the words she turned away quietly went to the pile of watchcloaks and lying down forgot ere long her sorrows and her dread in calm and innocent slumber she had not been very long asleep however when a sound from without the door aroused her and as she started to her feet caius crispus looked into the cell with a flambeau of pinewood blazing in his right hand to ascertain if she was still within and safe under his keeping you have been sleeping ha he exclaimed that is well you must be weary will you have more wine some water if you will but no wine i am athirst and feverish you shall have water and thrusting the flambeau into the earth between the crevices in the pavement he left the room abruptly scarce was he gone leaving the whole apartment blazing with a bright light which rendered every object within clearly visible to any spectator from the farther side of the ravine before a shrill voice with something of a feminine tone was heard on the other brink exclaiming in suppressed tones hist hist julia great gods who calls on julia julia serena is it thou most miserable i she made answer but who calls me a friendbe wary and silent and you shall not lack aid but julia heard the heavy step of the swordsmith approaching and laying her finger on her lips she sprang back hastily from the window and when her gaoler entered was busy apparently in arranging her miserable bed it was not long that he tarried for after casting one keen glance around him to see that all was right he freed her of his hated presence taking the torch along with him and leaving her in utter darkness as soon as his footstep had died away into silence she hurried back to the embrasure and gazed forth earnestly but the moon had not yet risen and all the gulf of the ravine and the banks on both sides were black as night and she could discern nothing she coughed gently hoping to attract the attention of her unknown friend and to learn more of her chances of escape but no farther sound or signal was made to her and after watching long in hope deferred and anxiety unspeakable she returned to her sad pallet and bathed her pillow with hot tears until she wept herself at length into unconsciousness of suffering the last refuge of the wretched when they have not the christians hope to sustain them she was almost worn out with anxiety and toil and she slept soundly until the blowing of the roman trumpets in the pass again aroused her and before she had well collected her thoughts so as to satisfy herself where she was and wherefore the shouts and groans of a sudden conflict the rattling of stones and javelins on the tiled roof the clang of arms and all the dread accompaniments of a mortal conflict awoke her to a full sense of her situation the day lagged tediously and slow no one came near her and although she watched the farther side of the gorge with all the frantic hope which is so near akin to despair she saw nothing heard nothing but a few woodpigeons among the leafless treetops but the sob of the torrent and the sigh of the wintry wind at times indeed the long stern swell of the legionary trumpets would again sound for the assault and the din of warfare would follow it but the skirmishes were of shorter and shorter duration and the tumultuous cheering of the rebels at the close of every onslaught proved that their defence had been maintained at least and that the besiegers had gained no advantage it was perhaps four oclock in the afternoon and the sun was beginning to verge to the westward when just after the cessation of one of the brief attacksby which it would appear that the besiegers intended rather to harass the garrison and keep them constantly on the alert than to effect anything decidedthe sound of armed footsteps again reached the ears of julia a moment afterward caius crispus entered the room hastily accompanied by niger and rufus the latter bearing in his hand a coil of twisted rope manufactured from the raw hide of the slaughtered cattle cut into narrow stripes and ingeniously interwoven ha he exclaimed starting for a moment as he saw julia i had forgotten you we have been hardly pressed all day and i have had no time to think of you but we shall have more leisure now are you hungry julia for her only reply she pointed to the food yet untouched which he had brought to her on the previous evening and shook her head sadly but uttered not a word well well he exclaimed we have no time to talk about such matters now but eat you shall or i will have you crammed as they stuff fatlivered geese come niger we must lose no minute if they attack again and miss me from the battlements they will be suspecting something and will perhaps come prying to the rearhave you seen any soldiers girl on this side i trow you have been gazing from the window all day long in the hope of escaping but i suppose you will not tell me truly if i tell you not truly i shall hold my peace but i will tell you that i have seen no human being no living thing indeed unless it be a thrush and three wood pigeons fluttering in the treetops yonder that is a lie i dare be sworn cried niger if it had been the truth she would not have breathed a word of it to us beside which it is too cool altogether by mulciber my patron if i believed so it should go hardly with her but it matters not come we must lose no time and passing into the central room of the three they made one end of the rope fast about the waist of niger and the other to an upright mullion in the embrasure which although broken half way up afforded ample purchase whereby to lower him into the chasm this done the man clambered out of the window very coolly going backward as if he were about to descend a ladder but when his face was on the point of disappearing below the sill as he hung by his hands alone having no foothold whatever he said quietly if i shout caius crispus haul me up instantly i shall not do so if there be any path below but if i whistle be sure that all is right lower away farewell hold on hold on man replied crispus quickly turn yourself round so as to bring your back to the crags face else shall the angles of the rock maim and the dust blind you thats it most bravely done you are a right good cragsman i was born among the crags at all events answered the other and i think now that i am going to die among them but what of that one must die some day fewer words lower away i say i am tired of hanging here between heaven and tartarus no words were spoken farther by any of the party but the smith with the aid of rufus paid out the line rapidly although steadily hand under hand until the whole length was run out with the exception of some three or four feet just at this moment when crispus was beginning to despair of success and was half afraid that he had miscalculated the length of the rope the strain on it was slackened for a moment and then ceased altogether the next instant a low and guarded whistle rose from the gorge above the gurgling of the waters but not so loud as to reach any ears save those for which it was intended a grim smile curled the swordsmiths lip and his fierce eye glittered with cruel triumph we are safe nowcatiline will be here long before daybreak your prayers have availed us julia for i doubt not he added with malicious irony that you have prayed for us before she had time to reply to his cruel sarcasm a fresh swell of the besiegers trumpets and a loud burst of shouts and warcries from the battlement announced a fresh attack the smith rushed from the room instantly with rufus at his heels and julia had already made one step toward the window intending to attempt the perilous descent alone and unaided when crispus turned back suddenly crying the rope the rope by the gods do not leave the rope she hath enough of the amazons blood in her to attempt it of the romans blood say rather she exclaimed springing toward the casement half maddened in perceiving her last hope frustrated had she reached it she surely would have perished for no female head and hands how strong and resolute so ever could have descended that frail rope and even if they could the ruffian rather than see her so escape would have cut it asunder and so precipitated her to the bottom of the rocky chasm but she did not attain her object for caius crispus caught her with both arms around the waist and threw her so violently to the after end of the room that her head striking the angle of the wall she was stunned for the moment and lay almost senseless on the floor while the savage with a rude brutal laugh at her disappointment rushed out of the room bearing the rope along with him scarce had he gone however when audible distinctly amid the dissonant danger of the fray the same feminine voice which she had heard on the previous night again aroused her crying hist hist hist julia she sprang to her feet and gained the window in a moment and there on the other verge of the chasm near twenty feet distant from the window at which she stood she discovered the figure of a slender darkeyed and darkcomplexioned boy clad in a hunters tunic and bearing a bow in his hand and a quiver full of arrows on his shoulder she had never seen that boy before yet was there something in his features and expression that seemed familiar to her that sort of vague resemblance to something well known and accustomed which leads men to suppose that they must have dreamed of things which mysteriously enough they seem to remember on their first occurrence the boy raised his hand joyously and cried aloud without any fear of being heard well knowing that all eyes and ears of the defenders of the place were turned to the side when the fight was raging be of good cheer you are saved julia paullus is nigh at hand but ere he come i will save you be of good courage watch well these windows but seem to be observing nothing and with the words he turned away and was lost to her sight in an instant among the thicklyset underwood ere long however she caught a glimpse of him again mounted upon a beautiful white horse and gallopping like the wind down the sandy road which wound through the wooded knolls toward the bridge below again she lost him and again he glanced upon her sight for a single second as he spurred his fleet horse across the single arch of brick and dashed into the woods on the hither side of the torrent two weary hours passed and the sun was nigh to his setting and she had seen heard nothing more her heart sickening with hope deferred and all her frame trembling with terrible excitement she had almost begun to doubt whether the whole appearance of the boy might not have been a mere illusion of her feverish senses a vain creation of her distempered fancy still fiercer than before the battle raged without and now there was no intermission of the uproar to which was added the crashing of the roofs beneath heavy stones betokening that engines of some kind had been brought up from the host or constructed on the spot at length however her close watch was rewarded a slight stir among the evergreen bushes on the brink of the opposite cliff caught her quick eye and in another moment the head of a man not of the boy whom she had seen before nor yet as her hope suggested of her own paullus but of an aquilinenosed cleanshorn roman soldier with an intelligent expression and quick eye was thrust forward perceiving julia at the window he drew back for a second and the boy appeared in his place and then both showed themselves together the soldier holding in his hand the bow and arrows of the hunter youth he is a friend said the boy do all that he commands you but so fiercely was the battle raging now that it was his signs rather than his words which she comprehended the next moment a gesture of his hand warned her to withdraw from the embrasure and scarcely had she done so before an arrow whistled from the bow and dropped into the room having a piece of very slender twine attached to the end of it perceiving the intention at a glance the quick witted girl detached the string from the shaft without delay and throwing the latter out of the window lest it should betray the plan drew in the twine until she had some forty yards within the room when it was checked from the other side neither the soldier nor the youth showing themselves at all during the operation this done however the boy again stood forth and pitched a leaden bullet such as was used by the slingers of the day into the window perceiving that the ball was perforated she secured it in an instant to the end of the clue which she held in her hand and judging that the object of her friends was to establish a communication from their side cast it back to them with a great effort having first passed the twine around the mullion by aid of which crispus had lowered down his messenger the soldier caught the bullet and nodded his approbation with a smile but again receded into the bushes suffering the slack of the twine to fall down in an easy curve into the ravine so that the double communication would scarce have been perceived even by one looking for it in the gathering twilight the boys voice once more reached her ears though his form was concealed among the shrubbery fear nothing you are safe he said but we can do no more until after midnight when the moon shall give us light to rescue you be tranquil and farewell be tranquiltranquil when life or deathhonor or infamybliss or despair hung on that feeble twine scarce thicker than the spiders web hung on the chance of every flying second each one of which was bringing nigher and more nigh the hoofs of catilines atrocious band when voice of man can bid the waves be tranquil while the northwester is tossing their ruffian tops and when the billows slumber at his bidding then may the comforter assay with some chance of success to still the throbbings of the human heart convulsed by such hopes such terrors as then were all but maddening the innocent and tranquil heart of julia tranquil she could not be but she was calm and selfpossessed and patient hour after hour lagged away and the night fell black as the pit of acheron and still by the glare of pale fires and torches the lurid light of which she could perceive from her windows reflected on the heavens the savage combatants fought on unwearied and unsparing once only she went again to that window wherefrom hung all her hopes so fearful was she that crispus might find her there and suspect what was in process with trembling fingers she felt for the twine fatal as the thread of destiny should any fell chance sever it and in its place she found a stout cord which had been quietly drawn around the mullion still hanging in a deep double bight invisible amid the gloom from side to side of the chasm and now for the first time she comprehended clearly the means by which her unknown friends proposed to reach her by hauling on one end of the rope any light plank or ladder might be drawn over to the hither from the farther bank and the gorge might so be securely bridged and safely traversed perceiving this and fancying that she could distinguish the faint clink of a hammer among the trees beyond the forest knoll she did indeed become almost tranquil she even lay down on her couch and closed her eyes and exerted all the power of her mind to be composed and selfpossessed when the moment of her destiny should arrive but oh how daylong did the minutes seem how more than yearlong the hours she opened her curtained lids and lo what was that faint pale lustre glimmering through the treetops on the far mountains browall glory to diana chaste guardian of the chaste and pure it was the signal of her safety it was it was the everblessed moon breathless with joy she darted to the opening and slowly warily creeping athwart the gloomy void she saw the cords drawn taught and running stiffly it is true and reluctantly but surely around the mouldering stone mullion while from the other side ghostlike and pale the skeleton of a light ladder was advancing to meet her hand as if by magic ten minutes more and she would be free oh the strange bliss the inconceivable rapture of that thought free from pollution infamy free to live happy and unblemished free to be the beloved the honored bride of her own arvina why did she shudder suddenly why grew she rigid with dilated eyes and lips apart like a carved effigy of agonized surprise hark to that rising sound more rapid than the rush of the stream and louder than the wailing of the wind thick pattering down the rocky gorge nearer and nearer till it thunders high above all the tumult of the battle the furious gallop of approaching horse the sharp and angry clang of harness lo the hot glare outfacing the pale moonbeam the fierce crimson blaze of torches gleaming far down the mountain side a torrent of rushing fire hark the wild cheer catiline catiline to the skies mixed with the wailing blast of the roman trumpets unwillingly retreating from the halfwon watchtower pull for your lives she cried in accents full of horror and appalling anguishpull pull if ye would not see me perish but it was all too late amid a storm of tumultuous acclamation catiline drew his panting charger up before the barricaded gateway which had so long resisted the dread onset of the legionaries and which now instantly flew open to admit him waving his hand to his men to pursue the retreating infantry he sprang down from his horse uttering but one word in the deep voice of smothered passionjulia his armed foot clanged on the pavement ere the bridge was entirely withdrawn for they who manned the ropes now dragged it back as vehemently as they had urged forward a moment since back from the window juliacried the voiceif he perceive the ropes all is lost trust me we never will forsake you meet him be bold be daring but defy him not scarce had she time to catch the friendly admonition and act on it as she did instantly before the door of the outer room was thrown violently open and with his sallow face inflamed and fiery and his black eye blazing with hellish light catiline exclaimed as he strode in hot haste across the threshold at last at last i have thee julia chapter xvii tidings from rome time and the tide wear through the longest day shakspeare at last i have thee julia mighty indeed was the effort of the mind which enabled that fair slight girl to bear up with an undaunted lip and serene eye against the presence of that atrocious villain and hope neverdying hope was the spirit which nerved her to that effort it was strange knowing as she did the character of that atrocious and bloodthirsty tyrant that she should not have given way entirely to feminine despair and terror or sought by tears and prayers to disarm his purpose but her high blood cried out from every vein and artery of her body and she stood calm and sustained by conscious virtue even in that extremity of peril neither tempting assault by any display of coward weakness nor provoking it by any show of defiance there is nothing perhaps so difficult to any one who is not a butcher or an executioner by trade with sensibilities blunted by the force of habit as to attack or injure any thing which neither flies nor resists neither braves nor trembles and catiline himself savage and brutal as he was full of ungoverned impulse and unbridled passion felt though he knew not wherefore this difficulty at this moment had she fallen at his feet trembling and tearful and implored his mercy he would have gloated on her terrors laughed tears and prayers to scorn yea torn her from an altars foot to pour out upon her the vials of agony and foul pollution had she defied or braved his violence his fury would have trampled her to the earth in an instant and murder would have followed in the footsteps of worse violence but as she stood there firm cold erect and motionless as a statue of rare marble with scarcely a pulse throbbing in her veins and her clear azure eyes fixed on him with a cold and steady gaze as if she would have fascinated him by their serene chaste influence he likewise stood and gazed upon her with a strange mixture of impressions wherein something akin to love and admiration were blent with what in minds of better mould should have been reverence and awe he felt in short that he lacked a spur to prick the sides of his intent a provocation to insult and aggression yet stronger than the passion and hot thirst of vengeance which had been well nigh chilled by her severe and icy fortitude tis said that a lion will turn and flee from a maid in the pride of her purity and here a fiercer and more dangerous savage stood powerless and daunted for the moment by the same holy influence of virtue which it is said has potency to tame the pinched king of the desert it was not however in the nature of that man to yield himself up long to any influence save that of his own passions and after standing mute for perhaps a minute during which the flush on his sallow cheek and the glare of his fiery eye were blanched and dimmed somewhat he advanced a step or two toward her repeating the words i have thee thou art mine julia thy prisoner catiline she replied quietlyif you make women prisoners my slave minion i am freeborn and noble a patrician of a house as ancient as thine own my ancestors i have heard say fought side by side with sergius silo the more cause that their daughter should sleep side by side with sergius catiline he replied with bitter irony but there was less of actual passion in his tones than of a desire to lash himself into fury the less cause that a freeborn lady should be disgraced by the grandson of his comrade in arms who gave her father being thus far her replies had been conducted in the spirit most likely to control if any thing could control the demon that possessed him but seeing that her words had produced more effect on him than she had deemed possible she made an effort to improve her advantage and added looking him firmly in the eye i have heard tell that thou art proud catiline as thou art nobly born let then thine own pride proud proud ha minion what have your nobles left me that i should glory inwhat of which i may still be proud a name of the grandest blasted by their base lies and infamous service converted into shame valor warped into crime at home poverty degradation ruin abroad debt mockery disgrace proud proud by nemesis fond girl i am proudto be the thing that they have made me a terror and a curse to all who call themselves patrician for daring remorseless for brave cruel for voluptuous sensual for fearless ruthless for enterprising reckless for ambitious desperate for a man a monster for a philosopher an atheist ha ha ha ha i am proud minion proud to be that i amthat which thou julia shalt soon find me she perceived when it was too late the error which she had made and fearful of incensing him farther answered nothing but he was not so to be set at naught for he had succeeded now in lashing himself into a fit of fury and advancing upon her with a face full of all hideous passions a face that denoted his fell purpose as plainly as any words could declare them dost hear me girl i say thou art mine julia thy prisoner catiline she again repeated in the same steady tone as at first but the charm had now failed of its effect and it was fortunate for the sweet girl that the fell wretch before whom she stood defenceless had so much of the catlike tigerlike spirit in his nature so much that prompted him to tantalize and torment before striking to teaze and harass and break down the mind before doing violence to the body of his subject enemies or of those whom he chose to deem such had he suspected at this moment that any chance of succor was at hand however remote he lacked neither the will nor the occasion to destroy her he fancied that she was completely at his mercy and perceiving that in despite of her assumed coolness she writhed beneath the terrors of his tongue he revelled in the fiendish pleasure of triumphing in words over her spirit before wreaking his vengeance on her person my slave julia my slave soul and body my slave here and for ever slave to my passions and my pleasures wilt yield or resist fair girl resist i do beseech thee let some fire animate those lovely eyes even if it be the fire of furysome light kindle those pallid cheeks even if it be the light of hatred i am aweary of tame conquests then wherefore conquer or conquering wherefore not spareshe answered i conquer to slake my thirst of vengeance i spare not for the wise mans word to the fallen is still v victis wilt yield or resist julia wilt be the sharer or the victim of my pleasures speak i say speak he shouted savagely perceiving that she sought to evade a direct answer speak and reply directly or i will do to thee forthwith what most thou dreadest and then wipe out thy shame by agonies of death to which the tortures of old regulus were luxury if i must choose the victim she replied steadily but i believe you will not so disgrace your manhood ha you believe so you shall feel soon and know one question more wilt thou yield or resist resist she answered to the last and when dishonored die and by death like lucretia win back greater honor lucretias death had witnesses and her tale found mens ears thy death shall be silent thy shame loud i will proclaim the first my deed the last thy voluntary proclaim itshe interrupted him with her eyes flashing bright indignation and her lip curling with ineffable disdain as she forgot all prudence in the scorn called forth by his injurious wordsproclaim it to the world who will believe it the world frailtys name is woman and falsehoodscatiline by hadesand he sprang upon her with a bound like that of a tiger and twined his arms about her waist clasping her to his breast with brutal violence and striving to press his foul lips on her innocent mouth but she endowed with momentary strength infinitely unwonted and unnatural the strength of despair and frenzy caught his bare throat with both her hands and writhing herself back to the full length of her arms uttered a volume of shrieks so awfully shrill and piercing that they struck terror into the souls of the brutal rebels without and harrowed up the spirits of her friends who lay concealed within earshot waiting now almost in despair an opportunity to aid her so strong was the clutch which her small hands had fixed upon his throat that ere he could release himself sufficiently to draw a full breath he was compelled to let her go and ere he fully recovered himself she had made a spring back toward the window with the evident purpose of throwing herself out into the yawning gulf below it but something caught her eye which apparently deterred her and turning her back upon it quickly she faced her persecutor once again at this moment there was a loud and angry bustle in the outer court immediately followed by a violent knocking at the door but so terrible was the excitement of both these human beings hers the excitement of innocence in trial his of atrocity triumphant that neither heard it though it was sudden and strong enough to have startled any sleepers save those of the grave ha but this charms me i knew not that you had so much of the tigress to fit you for the tigers mate but what a fool you are to waste your breath in yells and your strength in struggles like to those when there are none to hear or to witness them witnesses are found to all crimes right early and avengers she exclaimed with the high mien of a prophetess and still that vehement knocking continued unheeded as the earthquake which reeled unnoticed beneath the feet of the combatants at thrasymene to this at least there are no witnesses there shall be no avengers the gods are my witnesses shall be my avengers tush there are no gods julia and again he rushed on her and caught her in his arms but as he spoke those impious words sprang to do that atrocious deed a witness was found and it might be an avenger unnoticed by the traitor in the fierce whirlwind of his passion that hunter boy stood forth on the further brink revealed a boy no longer for the phrygian bonnet had fallen off and the redundant raven tresses of a girl flowed back on the wind her attitude and air were those of diana as she bent her good bow against the ravisher orion her right foot advanced firmly her right hand drawn back to the ear her fine eye glaring upon the arrow which bore with unerring aim full on the breast of her own corrupter her own father catiline who had more wrongs to avenge than lucia another second and the shaft would have quivered in the heart of the arch villain sped by the hand from which he deserved it the most dearly the room within was brighter than day from the red torch light which filled it falling full on the gaunt form and grim visage of the monster her hand was firm her eye steady her heart pitiless but in the better course of her changed life heaven spared her the dread crime of parricide just as the chord was at the tightest just as the feathers quivered and the barb thrilled about to leap from the terse string the tall form of the soldier sprang up into the clear moonlight from the underwood and crying hold hold mastered her bowhand with the speed of light and dragged her down into the covert well was it that he did so for just as catiline seized julia the second time in his resistless grasp and ere his lips had contaminated her sweet mouth the giant crispus who had so long been knocking unheeded rushed into the room and seized his leader by the shoulder unseen until he literally touched him another time for this he said catiline there are tidings from rome which to tartarus with thy tidings let them tarry they will not tarry catiline replied the smith who was as pale as a ghost and almost tremblingleast of all for such painted womans flesh as this is get thee away it were better wiser safer to stand between the lion and his prey than between catiline and julia then have it shouted the smith all is discovered all undone lentulus and cethegus gabinius and statilius and cparius all dead by the hangmans noose in the tullianum the idiots is that all thy precious tidings see how i will avenge them and he struggled to shake himself free from the grasp of crispus but the smith held him firmly and replied it is not all catiline metellus celer is within ten leagues of the camp at the foot of the mountains we have no retreat left into gaul come come speak to the soldiers you can deal with this harlotry hereafter catiline glared upon him as if he would have stabbed him to the heart but seeing the absolute necessity of enquiring into the truth of this report he turned to leave the room the gods be praised the gods have spoken loud the gods have saved me cried julia falling on her knees are there no gods now o catiline to hades with thy gods and striking the unhappy girl a coward blow which felled her to the ground senseless he rushed from the room with his confederate in crime barring the outer door behind him chapter xviii the rescue speed malise speed the dun deers hide on fleeter foot was never tied lady of the lake scarcely had the door closed behind catiline who rushed forth torch in hand as if goaded by the furies of orestes when half a dozen stout men sheathed in the full armor of roman legionaries sprang out of the brushwood on the gorges brink and seizing the ropes which had hung idle during that critical hour hauled on them with such energetical and zealous power that the ladder was drawn across the chasm with almost lightning speed the hooks with which its outer end was garnished caught in the crevices of the ruined wall and a slender communication was established although the slight structure which bridged the abyss was scarcely capable of supporting the weight of a human being the soldiers accustomed as all roman soldiers were to all the expediences and resources of warfare had prepared planks which were to be run forward on the ladder in order to construct a firm bridge for the plan of the besiegers until interrupted by catilines arrival had been to take the stronghold in reverse while a false attack in front should be in progress and throwing ten or twelve stout soldiers into the heart of the place to make themselves masters of it by a coupdemain this welldevised scheme being rendered unfeasible by the sudden charge of catilines horse and the rout of the legionaries the small subalterns detachment which had been sent round under lucias guidancefor it was she who had discerned the means of passing the chasm while lying in wait to assist julia and disclosed it to the centurion commandinghad been left alone and isolated its line of retreat cut off and itself without a leader the singular scenes however which they had witnessed the interest which almost involuntarily they had been led to take in the fate of the fair girl her calm and dauntless fortitude and above all the atrocious villainy of catiline had inspired every individual of that little band with an heroic resolution to set their lives upon a cast in order to rescue one who to all of them was personally unknown in addition to this the discovery of lucias sexfor they had believed her to be what she appeared a boywhich followed immediately on the loss of her phrygian bonnet and the story of her bitter wrongs which had taken wind acted as a powerful incentive to men naturally bold and enterprising for it is needless to add that with the revelation of her sex that of her character as the archtraitors child and victim went as it were hand in hand they had resolved therefore on rescuing the one and revenging the other of these women at any risk to themselves whatsoever and now having waited their opportunity with the accustomed patience of roman veterans they acted upon it with their habitual skill and celerity but rapid as were their movements they were outstripped by the almost superhuman agility of lucia who knowing well the character of the human fiend with whom they had to contend his wondrous promptitude in counsel his lightning speed in execution was well assured that there was not one moment to be lost if they would save arvinas betrothed bride from a fate worse than many deaths as soon therefore as she saw the hooks of the scaling ladder catch firm hold of the broken wall before a single plank had been laid over its frail and distant rungs she bounded over it with the light and airy foot of a practised dancerfinding account at that perilous moment in one of those indelicate accomplishments in which she had been instructed for purposes the basest and most horrible accustomed as they were to deeds of energy and rapid daring the stout soldiers stood aghast for measuring the action by their own weight and ponderous armature they naturally overrated its peril to one so slightly made as lucia and yet the hazard was extreme for not taking it into account that a single slip or false step must precipitate her into the abyss the slender woodwork of the ladder actually bent as she alighted on it from each of her long airy bounds it was but a second however in which she glanced across it darted through the small embrasure and was lost to the eyes of the men within the darkness of the old barrack astonished though they were at the girls successful daring the soldiers were not paralyzed at all nor did they cease from their work in less than a minute after she had entered the window a board was thrust forward running upon the framework of the ladder and upon that a stout plank two feet in breadth capable of supporting if necessary the weight of several armed men nor had this bridge been established many seconds before the soldier in command ran forward upon it and met lucia at the embrasure bearing with strength far greater than her slight form and unmuscular limbs appeared to promise the still senseless form of julia catching her from the arms of lucia the robust legionary cast the fainting girl across his shoulder as though she had been a feather and rushed back with her toward his comrades crying aloud in haste alarm quick quick follow me quick lucia i hear footsteps they are coming the caution was needless for almost outstripping the heavy soldier the fleetfooted girl stood with him on the farther bank yet had it come a moment later it would have come all too late for having with his wonted celerity ascertained the truth of these fatal tidings and ordered the body of horse whom he had brought up with him and who had returned from pursuing the infantry on seeing a larger body coming up from antonius army to return with all speed to the camp of manlius retaining only a dozen troopers as a personal escort catiline had come back to bear off his lovely captive the clang of his haughty step had reached the ears of the legionary just as he drew poor julia unconscious of her rescue through the barrack window and as they stood on the brink of the ravine thus far in safety the red glare of the torches streaming through the embrasures announced the arrival of their enemies within almost arms length of them the awful burst of imprecations which thundered from the lips of catiline as he perceived that his victim had been snatched from him struck awe even into the hearts of those brave veterans a tiger robbed of its young is but a weak and poor example of the frantic ungovernable beastlike rage which appeared to prevail entirely above all senses all consideration and all reason may i perish ill may i die crucified may the fowls of the air the beasts of the field devour me if she so escape he shouted and perceiving the means by which she had been carried off he called loudly for his men to follow and was in the very act of leaping out from the embrasure upon the bridge which they had not time to withdraw when one of the legionaries spurned away the frail fabric with his foot and drawing his short falchion severed the cords which secured it at a single blow swinging off instantly in mid air it was dashed heavily against the rocky wall of the precipice and dislodged by the shock the planks went thundering down into the torrent at the bottom of the gorge while upheld by the hooks to the stone window sill the ladder hung useless on catilines side of the chasm all communication thus completely interrupted at the same moment three of the heavy pila which were the peculiar missiles of the legion were hurled by as many stout arms at the furious desperado but it was not his fate so to perish one of the pondrous weapons hurtled so close to his temple that the keen head razed the skin the others blunted or shivered against the sides or lintel of the window fell harmless into the abyss thou fool cried the man who had rescued julia addressing him who had cut away the bridge thou shouldst have let him reach the middle ere thou didst strike that blow then would he have lain there now and he pointed downward with his finger into the yawning gulf i do not know replied the other by the gods catiline is near enough to me when he is twenty paces distant thou art right soldier and didst well and wisely said lucia hastily hadst thou tarried to strike until he reached the middle thou never wouldst have stricken at all one foot without that window he would have cleared that chasm as easily as i would leap a furrow but come come come we must not loiter nor lose one instant he will not so submit to be thwarted i have two horses by the roadside yonder their speed alone shall save us right right replied the soldier lead to them quickly it is for life or death hark he is calling his men now to horse we shall have a close run for it by hercules and weasked one of the veterans disperse yourselves among the hills and make your way singly to the camp he will not think of you with us before him farewell the gods guide and guard thee we shall much need i fear their guidance answered the legionary setting off at a swift pace still bearing julia who was now beginning to revive in the fresh air following hard on lucia who ran literally like the wind to the spot where she had tied her own beautiful white ister and another horse a powerful and wellbred thracian charger to the stems of two chesnut trees in readiness for any fortunes rapidly as the soldier ran still the lightfooted girl outstripped him and when he reached the sandy road she had already loosened the reins from the trees to which they had been attached and held them in readiness mount mount cried lucia for your life i will help you to lift her i am better now exclaimed juliaoh ye gods and safe too i can help myself now and in an instant she was seated behind the stout manatarms and clinging with both hands to his sword belt if you see me no more as i think you will not julia tell paullus lucia saved you anddied for love of him nowride ride ride for your life ride and giving their good horses head they sprang forth plying the rein and scourge at headlong speed as they ascended the first little hillock they saw the troopers of catiline pouring out of the watchtower gate and thundering down the slope toward the bridge with furious shouts at a rate scarcely inferior to their own they had but one hope of safety to reach the little bridge and pass it before their pursuers should gain it and cut off their retreat toward their friends whom they knew to be nigh at hand but to do so appeared well nigh impossible it was a little in their favor that the steeds of catilines troopers had been harassed by a long and unusually rapid night march while their own were fresh and full of spirit but this advantage was neutralized at least by the double weight which impeded the progress and bore down the energies of the noble thracian courser bearing julia and the soldier again it was in their favor that the road on their side the chasm was somewhat shorter and much more level than that by which catiline and his riders were straining every nerve gallopping on a parallel line with the tremulous and excited fugitives but this advantage also was diminished by the fact that they must turn twice at right anglesonce to gain the bridge and once more into the high road beyond itwhile the rebels had a straight course though down a hill side so steep that it might well be called precipitous the day had by this time broken and either party could see the other clearly even to the dresses of the men and the colors of the horses not above the sixth part of a mile being occupied by the valley of the stream dividing the two roads for life fire flashed from the flinty road at every bound of the brave coursers and blood flew from every whirl of the knotted thong but gallantly the highblooded beasts answered it at every bound they gained a little on their pursuers whose horses foamed and labored down the abrupt descent one or two of them falling and rolling over their riders so steep was the declivity for life catiline had gained the head of his party and his black horse had outstripped them by several lengths if the course had been longer the safety of the fugitives would have been now certain but so brief was the space and so little did they gain in that awful race that the nicest eye hardly could have calculated which first would reach the bridge so secure of his prize was catiline that his keen blade was already out and as he bowed over his chargers neck goring his flanks with his bloody spurs he shouted in his hoarse demoniacal accents victory and vengeance still hopeful and dauntless the stout legionary gallopped oncourage he exclaimed courage lady we shall first cross the bridge had lucia chosen it with her light weight and splendid horsemanship she might easily have left julia and the soldier easily have crossed the defile in advance of catiline easily have escaped his vengeance but she reined in white ister and held him well in hand behind the others muttering to herself in low determined accents she shall be saved but my time is come suddenly there was a hasty shout of alarm from the troopers on the other side hold catiline rein up rein up and several of the foremost riders drew in their horses within a minute all except catiline had halted they see our friends they are close at hand we are saved by the immortal gods we are saved cried the legionary with a cry of triumph but in reply across the narrow gorge came the hoarse roar of catiline above the din of his thundering gallopby hades death or vengeance ride ride shrieked lucia from behind ride i say fool you are not saved he will not halt for a beat when revenge spurs him for your life ride it was a fearful crisis the thracian charger reached the bridge the hollow arch resounded but once under his clanging hoofsthe second stride cleared it he wheeled down the road and julia pale as death whose eyes had been closed in the agony of that fearful expectation unclosed them at the legionarys joyous shout but closed them again in terror and despair with a faint shriek as they met the grim countenance of catiline distorted with every hellish passion and splashed with blood gouts from his reeking coursers side thrust forward parallel nearly to the black coursers foamy jawsboth nearly within arms length of her as it appeared to her excited fancy we are lost we are lost she screamed we are saved we are saved shouted the soldier as he saw coming up the road at a gallop to meet them the bronze casques and floating horsehair crests and scarlet cloaks of a whole squadron of legionary cavalry arrayed beneath a golden eaglethe head of their column scarcely distant three hundred yards but they were not saved yet nor would have beenfor catilines horse was close upon their croupe and his uplifted blade almost flashed over themwhen with a wild cry lucia dashed her white ister at full speed as she crossed the bridge athwart the counter of black erebus the thundering speed at which the black horse came down the hill and the superior weight of himself and his rider hurled the white palfrey and the brave girl headlong but his stride was checked and blown as he was he stumbled and rolled over horse and man a minute was enough to save them and before lucia had regained her feet the ranks of the new comers had opened to receive the fugitives and had halted around them in some slight confusion the gods be blessed for ever she exclaimed clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven i have saved her and lost thyself thrice miserable fool hissed a hoarse well known voice in her ear as a heavy hand seized her by the shoulder and twisted her violently round she stood face to face with catiline and met his horrid glare of hate with a glance prouder than his own and brighter she smiled triumphantly as she said in a clear high voice i have saved her for which take thy reward in this and this and this and with the words he dealt her three stabs the least of which was mortal but even in that moment of dread passion with fiendish ingenuity he endeavored to avoid giving her a wound that should be directly fatal there writhe and howl till slow death relieve you meet end to such beginning cried the unhappy girl adulterous parent incestuous seducer kindred slayer ha ha ha ha and with a wild laugh she fell to the ground and lay with her eyes closed motionless and for the moment senseless but he with his childs blood smoking on his hand shook his sword aloft fiercely against the legionaries and leaping on his black horse which had arisen from the ground unhurt by its fall gallopped across the bridge and plunging through the underwood into the deep chesnut forest was lost to the view of the soldiers who had spurred up in pursuit of him that they abandoned it ere long as hopeless it was not long that lucia lay oblivious of her sufferings a sense of fresh coolness on her brow and the checked flow of the blood which gushed from those cruel wounds were the first sensations of which she became aware but as she opened her eyes they met well known and loving faces and soft hands were busy about her bleeding gashes and hot tears were falling on her poor pallid face from eyes that seldom wept julia was kneeling at her side paullus arvina was bending over her in speechless gratitude and sorrow and the stern cavaliers of the legion unused to any soft emotions stood round holding their chargers bridles with frowning brows and lips quivering with sentiments which few of them had experienced since the far days of their gentler boyhood oh happy she exclaimed in a soft low tone how happy it is so to die and in dying to see thee paullus oh no no no cried julia you must not shall not die my friend my sister o tell her paullus that she will not die that she will yet be spared to our prayers our love our gratitude our veneration but paullus spoke not a soldier and a man used to see death in all shapes in the arena he knew that there was no hope and had his life depended on it he could not at that moment have deceived her little however cared the dying girl for that even if she had heard or comprehended the appeal her ears her mind were full of other thoughts and a bright beautiful irradiation played over her wan lips and ashy features as she cried joyously although her voice was very tremulous and weak paullus do you hear that her friend her sister paullus paullus do you hear that julia calls me her friendme me her sister me the disgraced peace peace dear lucia you must not speak such words said paullus be your past errors what they mayand who am i that i should talk of errorsthis pure high lovethis delicate devotionthis death most heroical and glorious no no i cannot and the strong man bowed his head upon his hands and burst into an agony of tears and passion no revelation from on high had taught those poor romans that joy shall be in heaven over the sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance yet groping darkly on their way by the dim lights of nature and philosophy they had perceived at least that it is harder far for one corrupted from her very childhood corrupted by the very parents who should have guided with all her highest qualities of mind and body perverted studiously till they had hardened into vices to raise herself erect at once from the slough of sensuality and sin and spring aloft as the butterfly transmuted from the grub into the purity and loveliness of virtuethan for one who hath known no trial suffered no temptation to hold the path of rectitude unswerving and julia whose high soul and native delicacy were all incapable of comprehending the nature much less the seductions of such degradation as that poor victim of parental villainy had undergone saw clearly and understood at a glance the difficulty the gloriousness the wonder of that beautiful regeneration no no dear lucia dear sister if you love that name she said in soothing tones holding her cold hands clasped in her own quivering fingers indeed indeed you must not think or speak of yourself thus your sins if you have sinned are the sins of others your virtues and your excellence all all your own i have heard many times of women who have fallen from high virtue in spite of noble teachings in spite of high examples and whom neither love nor shame could rescue from pollutionbut never never did i hear of one who so raised herself alone unaided in spite of evil teaching in spite the atrocity of others in spite of infamous examples to purity devotion such as thine but fear not lucia fear not dearest girl you shall not die believe i do not fear i desire it said the dying girl who was growing weaker and fainter every moment to a life and a love like mine both guilty both unhappy death is a refuge not a terror and if there be as you believe who are so wise and virtuous a place beyond the grave where souls parted here on earth may meet and dwell in serene and tranquil bliss perhaps i say perhaps julia this death may compensate that lifethis blood may wash away the sin the shame the pollution believe it o believe it exclaimed julia earnestly how else should the gods be allgreat and allwise since vice triumphs often here and virtue pines in sorrow be sure i say be sure of it there is a place hereafter where all sorrows shall be turned to joy all sufferings compensated all inequalities made even be sure of that dear lucia i am sure of it she replied a brighter gleam of pleasure crossing her features on which the hues of death were fast darkening i am sure of it now i think my mind grows clearer as my body dies away i seei seethere is god juliathere is an hereafteran eternityrest for the weary joy for the woful yes yes i seei feel it we shall meet julia we shall meet paullus paullus and she sank back fainting and overpowered upon julias bosom in a moment or two however she opened her eyes again but it was clear that the spirit was on the point of taking its departure i am going she said in a very low voice i am going his sword was more merciful than its masterbury me in a nameless grave let no stone tell the tale of unhappy guilty lucia but come sometimes julia paullus and look where i lie and sometimeswill you not sometimes remember lucia you shall live in our souls forever replied julia stooping down to kiss her in your arms paullus in your arms will you not let me julia twere sweet to die in your arms paullus how can you ask cried julia who scarce could speak for the tears and sobs which almost choked her here paullus take her gently gently oh sweetoh happy she murmured as she leaned her head against his heart and fixed her glazing eyes upon his features and clasped his hand with her poor dying fingers she told you paullus that for your love i died to save her she didshe diddear dearest lucia kiss me she whispered i am going very fast kiss me on the brow paullus where years ago you kissed me when i was yet an innocent child then fancying that he hesitated she cried you will let him kiss me now will you not julia he is yours oh kiss her kiss her paullus exclaimed julia eagerly how could you fancy lucia that i should wish otherwise kiss her lips not her brow paullus arvina kiss me first thou dear julia i may call you dear dear lucia dearest sister and the pure girl leaned over and pressed a long kiss on the cold lips of the unhappy guilty regenerated being whose death had won for her honor and life and happiness now paullus now cried lucia raising herself from his bosom by a last feeble effort and stretching out her arms now ere it be too late he bowed down to her and kissed her lips and she clasped her arms close about his neck and returned that last chaste caress murmuring paullus mine own in death mine own own paullus there was a sudden rigor a passing tremulous spasm which ran through her whole frame for a momenther arms clasped his neck more tightly than before and then released their hold all listless and unconsciousher head fell back with the eyes glazed and visionless and the white lips half open she is dead julia exclaimed paullus who was not ashamed to weep at that sad close of so young and sorrowful a life dead for our happiness hush hush cried julia who was still gazing on the face of the deadthere is a changesee see how beautiful how tranquil and in truth a sweet placid smile had settled about the pallid mouth and nothing can be conceived more lovely than the calm holy pure expression which breathed from every lineament of the lifeless countenance she is gone peace to her manes she is at rest now paullus she is happy murmured julia how excellent she was how true how brave how devoted oh yes i doubt not she is happy the gods grant it he replied fervently but i have yet a duty and drawing his short straight sword he severed one long dark curl from the lifeless head and raising it aloft in his left hand while with the right he pointed heavenward the gleaming steel ye gods he cried supernal and infernal and ye spirits and powers shades of the mighty dead hear earth and heaven and thou tartarus by this good steel by this right hand in presence of this sacred dead i swear i devote catiline and his hated head to vengeance by this sword may he perish may this hair be steeped in his lifeblood may he know himself when dying the victim of my vengeancemay dogs eat his bodyand his unburied spirit know neither tartarus nor elysium it was strange but as he ceased from that wild imprecation a faint flash of lightning veined the remote horizon and a low clap of thunder rumbled afar off echoing among the hillsperchance the last of a storm unheard before and unnoticed by the distracted minds of the spectators of that scene but the superstitious romans accepted it as an omen thundercried one the gods have spoken i hail the omen exclaimed paullus sheathing his sword and thrusting the tress of hair into his bosom by my hand shall he perish and thenceforth it was believed generally by the soldiers that in the coming struggle catiline was destined to fall and by the hand of paul arvina chapter xix the eve of battle canst thou not minister to a mind diseased macbeth nearly a fortnight had elapsed since the rescue of julia and the sad death of catilines unhappy daughter and yet the battle which was daily and hourly expected had not been fought with rare ability and generalship catiline had avoided an action with the troops of antonius marching and countermarching among the rugged passes of the appennines now toward rome now toward gaul keeping the enemy constantly on the alert harassing the consuls outposts threatening the city itself with an assault and maintaining with studious skill that appearance of mystery which is so potent an instrument whether to terrify or to fascinate the vulgar mind during this period the celerity of his movements had been such that his little host appeared to be almost ubiquitous and men knew not where to look for his descent or how to anticipate the blow which he evidently had it in contemplation to deliver in the meantime he had given such of his adherents as fled from rome immediately on the execution of the conspirators an opportunity to join him and many had in fact done so with their clients and bands of gladiators the disaffected of the open country had all united themselves to him and having commenced operations with a force not exceeding two thousand men he was now at the head of six times that number whom he had formed into two complete legions and disciplined them with equal assiduity and success now however the time had arrived when it was for his advantage no longer to avoid an encounter with the troops of the commonwealth for having gained all that he proposed to himself by his dilatory movements and fabian policy time namely for the concentration of his adherents and opportunity to discipline his men he now began to suffer from the inconveniences of the system unsupplied with magazines or any regular supply of provisions his army like a flight of locusts had stripped the country bare at every halting place and that wild hill country had few resources even when shorn by the licentious band of his desperadoes upon which to support an army the consequence therefore of his incessant hurrying to and fro was that the valleys of the mountain chain which he had made the theatre of his campaign were now utterly exhausted that his beasts of burden were broken down and foundered and that the line of his march might be traced by the carcasses of mules and horses which had given out by the wayside and by the flights of carrion birds which hovered in clouds about his rear prescient of the coming carnage his first attempt was to elude metellus celer who had marched down from the picene district on the adriatic sea with great rapidity and taken post at the foot of the mountains on the head waters of the streams which flow down into the great plain of the po in this attempt he had been frustrated by the ability of the officer who was opposed to him who had raised no less than three legions fully equipped for war by him every movement of the conspirator was anticipated and met by some corresponding measure which rendered it abortive nor was it any longer difficult for him to penetrate the designs of catiline since the peasantry and mountaineers who had throughout that district been favorable to the conspiracy in the first instance and who were prepared to favor any design which promised to deliver them from inexorable taxation had been by this time so unmercifully plundered and harassed by that banditti that they were now as willing to betray catiline to the romans as they had been desirous before of giving the romans into his hands at disadvantage fully aware of all these facts and knowing farther that antonius had now come up so close to his rear with a large army that he was in imminent danger of being surrounded and taken between two fires the desperate traitor suddenly took the boldest and perhaps the wisest measure wheeling directly round he turned his back toward gaul whither he had been marching and set his face toward the city then making three great forced marches he came upon the army of antonius as it was in column of march among the heights above pistoria and had there been daylight for the attack when the heads of the consuls cohorts were discovered it is possible that he might have forced him to fight at disadvantage and even defeated him in that case there would have been no force capable of opposing him on that side rome and every probability would have been in favor of his making himself master of the city a success which would have gone far to insure his triumph it was late in the evening however when the hostile armies came into presence each of the other and on that account and perhaps for another and stronger reason catiline determined on foregoing the advantages of a surprise caius antonius the consul in command it must be remembered had been one of the original confederates in catilines first scheme of massacre and conflagration which had been defeated by the unexpected death of curius piso detached from the conspiracy only by ciceros rare skill and disinterested cession to him of the rich province of macedonia antonius might therefore justly be supposed unlikely to urge matters to extremities against his quondam comrades and it was probably in no small degree on this account that catiline had resolved on trying the chances of battle rather against an old friend than against an enemy so fixed and of so resolute patrician principles as metellus celer he thought moreover that it was just within the calculation of chances that antonius might either purposely mismanoeuvre so as to allow him to descend upon rome without a battle or adopt such tactics as should give him a victory he halted his army therefore in a little gorge of the hills opening out upon a level plain flanked on the left by the steep acclivities of the mountain which towered in that direction ridge above ridge inaccessible and on the right by a rugged and rocky spur jutting out from the same ridge by which his line of battle would be rendered entirely unassailable on the flanks and rear in this wild spot amid huge gray rocks and hanging woods of ancient chesnuts and wild olive as gray and hoary as the stones among which they grew he had pitched his camp and now lay awaiting in grim anticipation what the morrow should bring forth while opposite to his front on a lower plateau of the same eminence the great army of the consul might be descried with its regular entrenchments and superb array of tents its forests of gleaming spears and its innumerable ensigns glancing and waving in the cold wintry moonshine the mind of the traitor was darker and more gloomy than its wont he had supped with his officers manlius and a nobleman of fsul whose name the historian has not recorded who held the third rank in the rebel army but their fare had been meagre and insipid their wines the thin vintage of that hill country a little attempt at festivity had been made but it had failed altogether the spirits of the men although undaunted and prepared to dare the utmost lacked all that fiery and enthusiastic ardor which kindles patriot breasts with a flame so pure and pervading on the eve of the most desperate encounters enemies of their country enemies almost of mankind these desperadoes were prepared to fight desperately to fight unto the death because to win was their only salvation and if defeated death their only refuge but for them there was no grand heartelevating spur to action no fame to be won no deathless name to be purchasedtheir names deathless already as they knew too well through black infamyno grateful countrys praises to be gained cheaply by a soldiers deathno there were none of these things all their excitements were temporal sensual earthy the hope to conquer the lust to bask in the sunshine of power the desire to revel at ease in boundless luxury and riot and against these the rewards of victory what were the penalties of defeatdeath infamy the hatred and the scorn of ages the wicked have no friends never perhaps was this fact exemplified more clearly than on that battle eve community of guilt indeed bound those vicious souls togethercommunity of interests of fears of perils held them in leagueyet feeling as they did feel that their sole chance of safety lay in the maintenance of that confederation each looked with evil eyes upon his neighbor each almost hated the others accusing them internally of having drawn them into their present perilous peril of having failed at need or of being swayed by selfish motives only so little truth there is in the principle which catiline had set forth in his first address to his banded parricides that the community of desires and dislikes constitutes in one word true friendship and now so darkly did their destiny lower on those depraved and ruined spirits that even their recklessness that last light which emanates from crime in despair had burned out and the furies of consciencethat conscience which they had so often stifled so often laughed to scorn so often drowned with riot and debauch so often silenced by fierce sophistrynow hunted them harpies of the soul worse than the fabulous eumenides of parricide orestes the gloomy meal was ended the parties separated all of them as it would seem relieved by the termination of those mock festivities which while they brought no gayity to the heart imposed a necessity of seeming mirthful and at ease when they were in truth disturbed by dark thoughts of the past and terrible forebodings of the future as soon as his guests had departed and the traitor was left alone he arose from his seat according to his custom and began to pace the room with vehement and rapid strides gesticulating wildly and muttering sentences the terrible oaths and blasphemies of which were alone audible just at this time a prolonged flourish of trumpets from without announced the changing of the watch it was nine oclock ha the third hour already he exclaimed starting as he heard the wild blast and chrea not yet returned from antonius can it be that the dog freedman has played me false or can antonius have seized him as a hostagei will go forth he added after a short pause i will go forth and observe the night and throwing a large cloak over his armor and putting a broadbrimmed felt hat upon his head in lieu of the high crested helmet he sallied out into the camp carrying in addition to his sword a short massive javelin in his right hand the night was extremely dark and murky the moon had not yet risen and but for the campfires of the two armies it would have been impossible to walk any distance without the aid of a torch or lantern a faint lurid light was dispersed from these however over the whole sky and thence was reflected weakly on the rugged and broken ground which lay between the entrenched lines of the two hosts for a while concealed entirely by his disguise catiline wandered through the long streets of tents listening to the conversation of the soldiers about the watchfires their strange superstitious legends and old traditionary songs and to say truth the heart of that desperate man was somewhat lightened by his discovery that the spirits of the men were alert and eager for the battle their temper keen and courageous their confidence in the prowess and ability of their chief unbounded he is the best soldier since the days of sylla said one grayheaded veteran whose face was scarred by the pontic scymetars of mithridates he is a better soldier in the field than ever sylla was by hercules replied another aye in the field sylla i have heard say rarely unsheathed his sword and never led his men to hand and hand encounter interposed a younger man than the old colonists to whom he spoke it is the head to plan not the hand to execute that makes the great captain caius or marcus titus or tullus can any one of them strike home as far perhaps farther than your syllas or your catilines by mars i much doubt it cried another i would back catiline with sword and buckler against the stoutest and the deftest gladiator that ever wielded blade he is as active and as strong as a libyan tiger aye and as merciless may the foe find him so tomorrow tomorrow by the gods i wish it were tomorrow it is cold work this whereas tomorrow night i promise you we shall be ransacking antonius camp with store of choice wines and rare viands but who shall live to share them is another question one which concerns not those who win and by the god of battles we will do that tomorrow let who may fall asleep and who may keep awake to tell of it a sound sleep to the slumberers a merry rouse to the quick boys who shall keep waking shouted another and the cups were brimmed and quaffed amid a storm of loud tumultuous cheering under cover of this tumult catiline withdrew from the neighborhood into which he had intruded with the stealthy pace of the beast to which the soldiers had compared him and as he retired he muttered to himselfthey are in the right frame of mindof the right stuff to winand yetand yet he paused and shook his head gloomily as if he dared not trust his own lips to complete the sentence he had thus begun a moment afterward he exclaimedbut chrea but chrea how long the villain tarries by heaven i will go forth and meet him and suiting the action to the word he walked rapidly down the quintana or central way to the prtorian gate there giving the word to the nightwatch in a whisper and showing his grim face to the halfastonished sentinel on duty he passed out of the lines alone and unguarded after advancing a few paces he was challenged again by the pickets of the velites who were thrust out in advance of the gates and again giving the word was suffered to pass on and now stood beyond the farthest outpost of his army cautiously and silently but with a swift step and determined air he now advanced directly toward the front of the roman entrenchments which lay at a little more than a miles distance from his own lines and ere long reached a knoll or hillock which would by daylight have commanded a complete view of the whole area of the consuls camp not being much out of a slings cast from the ramparts the camp of the consul lay on the slope of a hill so that the rear was considerably higher than the front catilines eye as he stood on that little eminence could therefore clearly discern all the different streets and divisions of the camp by the long lines of lamps and torches which blazed along the several avenues and he gazed anxiously and long at that strange silent picture with the exception of a slight clash and clang heard at times on the walls where the skirmishers were going on their rounds and the neigh of some restless charger there was nothing that should have indicated to the ear that nearly twenty thousand men were sleeping among those tented lines of lightsleeping how many of them their last natural slumber no thoughts of that kind however intruded on the mind of the desperado careless of human life reckless of human suffering he gazed only with his enquiring glance of profound penetration hoping to espy something whereby he might learn the fatenot of his messenger that was to him a matter of supreme indifferencebut of his message to antonius nor was he very long in doubt on this head for while he was yet gazing there was a bustle clearly perceptible about the prtorium lights were seen flitting to and fro voices were heard calling and answering to one another and then the din of hammers and sounds of busy preparation this might have lasted perchance half an hour to the great amazement of the traitor who could not conceive the meaning of that nocturnal hubbub when the clang of harness succeeded by the heavy regular tramp of men marching followed the turmoil and with many torches borne before them the spears and eagle of a cohort were seen coming rapidly toward the prtorian gate by hecate cried catilinewhat may this mean i wonder they are too few for an assault nay even for a false alarm they have halted at the gate by the gods they are filing out they march hitherward and lo manlius is aware of them i will risk something to tarry here and watch them as he spoke the cohort marched forward straight on the hillock where he stood and so far was it from seeking to conceal its whereabout that its trumpets were blown frequently and loudly as if to attract observation meantime the camp of catiline was on the alert also the ramparts were lined with torches by the red glare of which the legionaries might be seen mustering in dense array with shields in serried order and spear heads twinkling in the torchlight as the cohorts approached the hill catiline fell back toward his own camp a little and soon found shelter in a small thicket of holleys and wild myrtle which would effectually conceal him from the enemy while he could observe their every motion from its safe covert on the hillock the cohort haltedone manipule stood to its arms in front while the rest formed a hollow square all facing outward around its summit the torches were lowered so that with all his endeavors catiline could by no means discover what was in process within that guarded space again the din of hammers rose on his ear mixed now with groans and agonizing supplications which waxed at length into a fearful howl the utterance of one past doubt in more than mortal agony a strange and terrible suspicion broke upon catiline and the sweat started in beadlike drops from his sallow brow it was not long ere that suspicion became certainty the clang of the hammers ceased the wild howls sank into a continuous weak pitiful wailing the creak of pullies and cordage the shouts of men plying levers and hauling ropes succeeded and slowly sullenly uprose hardly seen in the black night air a huge black cross it reached its elevation and was made fast in almost less time than it has taken to relate it and instantly a pile of faggots which had been raised a short distance in front if it and steeped in oil or some other unctuous matter was set on fire a tall wavering snowwhite glare shot upward and revealed writhing in agony and wailing wofully the naked form of chrea bleeding at every pore from the effects of the merciless roman scourging nailed on the fatal cross so near was the little thicket in which catiline lay that he could mark every sinew of that gory frame working in agony could read every twitch of those convulsed features again the roman trumpets were blown shrill and piercing and a centurion stepping forward a little way in front of the advanced manipule shouted at the pitch of his voice thus perish all the messengers of parricides and traitors excited almost beyond his powers of endurance by what he beheld and heard the fierce traitor writhed in his hiding place not sixty paces distant from the speaker and gnashed his teeth in impotent malignity his fingers griped the tough shaft of his massive pilum as if they would have left their prints in the closegrained ash while that ferocious spirit was yet strong within him the wretched freedman half frenzied doubtless by his tortures lifted his voice in a wild cry on his master catiline catiline he shrieked so thrillingly that every man in both camps heard every syllable distinct and clear chrea calls on catiline help save avenge catiline catiline a loud hoarse laugh burst from the roman legionaries and the centurion shouted in derision but at that instant the desperate spectator of that horrid scene sprang to his feet reckless and shouting as he leaped into the circle of bright radiance catiline hears chrea and delivershurled his massive javelin with deadly aim at his tortured servant it was the first blow catiline ever dealt in mercy and mercifully did it perform its errand the broad head was buried in the naked breast of the victim and with one sob one shudder the spirit was released from the tortured clay had a thunderbolt fallen among the cohort the men could not have been more stunnedmore astounded before they had sufficiently recovered from their shock to cast a missile at him much less to start forth in pursuit he was half way toward his own camp in safety and ere long a prolonged burst again and again reiterated of joyous acclamations told to the consular camp that the traitors knew and appreciated the strange and dauntless daring of their almost ubiquitous leader an hour afterward that leader was alone in his tent stretched on his couch sleeping but oh that sleepnot gentle slumber not natures soft nursebut natures horrible convulsion the eyes wide open glaring dilated in their sockets as of a strangled manthe brow beaded with black sweat dropsthe teeth grinded togetherthe white lips muttering words too horrible to be recordedthe talonlike fingers clutching at vacancy it was too horrible to last with a wild cry lucia ha lucia fury avenger fiend he started to his feet and glared around him with a bewildered eye as if expecting to behold some ghastly supernatural visitant at length he said with a shudderwhich he could not repress it was a dream a dreambut ye gods what a dream i will sleep no moretill tomorrow tomorrow he repeated in a doubtful and enquiring tone tomorrow if i should fall tomorrow and such dreams come in that sleep which hath no waking those dreams should be realitythat reality should behell i know noti begin to doubt some things which of yore i held certain what if there should be gods avenging everlasting torturers if there should be a hell ha ha he laughed wildly and almost frantically ha ha what matters it methinks this is a hell already and with the words he struck his hand heavily on his broad breast and relapsed into gloomy and sullen meditation that night he slept no more but strode backward and forward hour after hour gnawing his nether lip till the blood streamed from the wounds inflicted by his unconscious teeth what awful and mysterious retribution might await him in the land of spirits it is not for mortals to premise but in this at least did he speak truth that nightconscience and crime may kindle in the human heart a hell which nothing can extinguish so long as the soul live identical selfknowing selftormenting chapter xx the field of pistoria make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous harbingers of blood and death macbeth the first faint streaks of day were scarcely visible in the east when catiline glad to escape the horrors which he had endured through the dark solitude of the night watches issued from his tent armed at all points and every inch a captain all irresolution all doubt all nervousness had passed away energy and the strong excitement of the moment had overpowered conscience and looking on his high haughty port his cold hard eye his resolute impassive face one would have said that man at least never trembled at realities far less at shadows but who shall say in truth which are the shadows of this world which the realities many a one it may be will find to his sorrow when the great day shall come that the hard selfish narrow fact the reality after which his whole life was a chase a struggle is but the shadow of a shade the unsubstantial good the scholars or the poets dream which he scorned as an empty nothing is an immortal truth an everlasting and immutable reality catiline shook at shadows whom not the substance of ten thousand soldiers armed in proof could move unless it were to emulation and defiance which were in truth more real more substantial causes of dismay those shadows which appalled him or those realities which he despised ere that sun set upon whose rising he gazed with an eye so calm and steadfast that question to him at least was solved for everto us it is perhaps still a question but at that moment he thought nothing of the past nothing of the future the present claimed his whole undivided mind and to the present he surrendered it abstracted from all speculations clear and unclouded and pervading as an eagles vision all his arrangements for the day had been made on the previous night so perfectly that the troops were already filing out from the prtorian gate in orderly array and taking their ground on the little plain at the mouth of the gorge in the order of battle which had been determined by the chiefs beforehand the space which he had selected whereon to receive the attack of antonius army was indeed admirably chosen it front it was so narrow that eight cohorts drawn up in a line ten deep according to the roman usage filled it completely behind these the twelve remaining cohorts which completed the force of his two legions were arrayed in reserve in denser and more solid order the interval between the mountains on the left and the craggy hill on the right which protected his flanks being much narrower as it ascended toward the gorge in which the rebel camp was pitched in front of the army there was a small plain perfectly level lying in an amphitheatre as it were of rocks and mountains with neither thicket brake nor hillock to mar its smooth expanse or hinder the shock of armies and extending perhaps half a mile toward the consular army below this the ground fell off in a long abrupt and rugged declivity somewhat exceeding a second half mile in length with many thickets and clumps of trees on its slope and the hillock at its foot whereon still frowned chreas cross with the gory and hideous carcase already blackened by the frosty night wind hanging from its rough timbers an awful omen to that army of desperate traitors beyond that hillock the ground swelled again into a lofty ridge facing the mouth of the gorge in which catiline had arrayed his army with all advantages of position sun and wind in his favor the sun rose splendid and unclouded and as his long rays streamed through the hollows in the mountain top nothing can be conceived more wildly romantic than the mountain scene more gorgeous and exciting than the living picture which they illuminated the hoary pinnacles of the huge mountains with their crowns of thundersplintered rocks the eyries of innumerable birds of prey gleaming all golden in the splendors of the dawntheir long abrupt declivities broken with crags feathered with gray and leafless forests and dotted here and there with masses of rich evergreens all bathed in soft and misty lightand at the base of them the mouth of the deep gorge a gulf of massive purple shadow through which could be descried indistinctly the lines of the deserted palisades and ramparts whence had marched out that mass of living valor which now was arrayed in splendid order just where the broad rays sweeping down the hills dwelt in their morning glory motionless they stood in their solid formation as living statues one mass as it appeared of gold and scarlet for all their casques and shields and corslets were of bright burnished bronze and all the cassocks of the men and cloaks of the officers of the vivid hue named from the flower of the pomegranate so that to borrow a splendid image of xenophon describing the array of the ten thousand the whole army lightened with brass and bloomed with crimson and now from the camp in the rear a splendid train came sweeping at full speed with waving crests of crimson horsehair dancing above their gleaming helmets and a broad banner fluttering in the air under the wellknown silver eagle the tutelar bird of marius the god of the archtraitors sacrilegious worship armed in bright steel these were the body guard of catiline three hundred chosen veterans the clients of his own and the cornelian houses men steeped to the lips in infamy and crime soldiers of fifty victories syllas atrocious colonists mounted on splendid thracian chargers with catiline at their head enthroned like a conquering king on his superb black erebus they came sweeping at full gallop through the intervals of the foot and as they reached the front of the array wheeled up at once into a long single line facing their infantry and at a single wafture of their leaders hand halted all like a single man then riding forward at a foots pace into the interval between the horse and foot catiline passed along the whole line from end to end surveying every man and taking in with his rapid and instinctive glance every minute detail in silence at the right wing which manlius commanded he paused a moment or two and spoke eagerly but shortly to his subordinate but when he reached the extreme left he merely nodded his approbation to the florentine crying aloud in his deep tones the one word remember then gallopping back at the top of his horses speed to the eagle which stood in front of the centre he checked black erebus so suddenly that he reared bolt upright and stood for a seconds space pawing the vacant air uncertain if he could recover that rude impulse but the rare horsemanship of catiline prevailed and horse and man stood statuelike and immoveable then pitching his voice so high and clear that every man of that dense host could hear and follow him he burst abruptly into the spirited and stirring speech which has been preserved complete by the most elegant of roman writers soldiers i hold it an established fact that words cannot give valorthat a weak army cannot be made strong nor a coward army brave by any speech of their commander how much audacity is given to each mans spirit by nature or by habit so much will be displayed in battle whom neither glory nor peril can excite you shall exhort in vain terror deafens the ears of his intellect i have convoked you therefore not to exhort but to admonish you in brief and to inform you of the causes of my counsel soldiers you all well know how terrible a disaster the cowardice and sloth of lentulus brought on himself and us and how expecting reinforcements from the city i was hindered from marching into gaul now i would have you understand all equally with me in what condition we are placed the armies of our enemy two in number one from the city the other from the side of gaul are pressing hard upon us in this place were it our interest to do so we can hold out no longer the scarcity of corn and forage forbid that whithersoever we desire to go our path must be opened by the sword wherefore i warn you that you be of a bold and ready spirit and when the battle have commenced that ye remember this that in your own right hand ye carry wealth honor glory moreover liberty and your country victorious all things are safe to us supplies in abundance shall be ours the colonies and free boroughs will open their gates to us failing through cowardice these selfsame things will become hostile to us not any place nor any friend shall protect him whom his own arms have not protected however soldiers the same necessity doth not actuate us and our enemies we fight for our country our liberty our life to them it is supererogatory to do battle for the power of a few nobles wherefore fall on with the greater boldness mindful of your own valor we might all of us have passed our lives in utter infamy as exiles a few of you stripped of your property might still have dwelt in rome coveting that of your neighbors because these things appeared too base and foul for mens endurance you resolved upon this career if you would quit it you must perforce be bold no one except victorious hath ever exchanged war for peace since to expect safety from flight when you have turned away from the foe that armor which defends the body is indeed madness always in battle to who most fears there is most peril valor stands as a wall to shield its possessor soldiers when i consider you and recall to mind your deeds great hopes of victory possess me your spirit age and valor give me confidence moreover that necessity of conquest which renders even cowards brave as for the numbers of the enemy the defiles will not permit them to surround you and yet should fortune prove jealous of your valor beware that ye lose not your lives unavenged beware that being captured ye be not rather butchered like sheep than slain fighting like men and leaving to your foes a victory of blood and lamentation he ceased and what a shout went up seeming to shake the earthfast hill scaring the eagles from their high nests and rolling in long echoes like reverberated thunder among the resounding hills twice thrice that soul fraught acclamation pealed up to heaven sure token of resolution unto death in the hardened hearts of that desperate banditti catiline drank delighted inspiration from the sound and cried in triumphant tones enough your shout is prophetic soldiers already we have conquered then leaping from his charger to the ground he turned to his bodyguard exclaiming to fight my friends we have no need of horses to fly we desire them not on foot we must conquer or on foot die in all events our peril as our hope must be equal dismount then all of ye and leading your chargers to the rear slay them so shall we all run equal in this race of death or glory and with the word leading his superb horse through the intervals between the cohorts of the foot he drew his heavy sword and smote him one tremendous blow which clove through spine and muscle through artery and vein and gullet severing the beauteous head from the graceful and swanlike neck and hurling the noble animal to the earth a motionless and quivering mass it was most characteristic of the ruthless and brutal temper of that parricidal monster that he cut down the noble animal which had so long and so gallantly borne him which had saved his life more than once by its speed and courage which followed him fed from his hand obeyed his voice like a dog almost like a child without the slightest show of pity or compunction many bad cruel savagehearted men ruthless to their own fellows have proved themselves not devoid altogether of humanity by their love to some faithful animal but it would seem that this most atrocious of mankind lacked even the one touch of nature which makes the whole world kin he killed his favorite horse the only friend perhaps that he possessed on earth not only unreluctant but with a sort of savage glee and a sneering jest if things go ill with us to day i shall be fitly horsed on erebus by hades then hurrying to the van he took post with his three hundred and all the picked centurions and veterans of the reserve mustered beneath the famous cimbric eagle in the centre of the first rank prepared to play out to the last his desperate and deadly game the ablest chief and the most daring soldier that ever buckled blade for parricide and treason chapter xxi the battle at least well die with harness on our back macbeth it was indeed time that the last arrangements of the traitor were completed for long since from the gates of the consular camp the great army of the enemy had been filing out and falling into order not a mile distant one third at least superior to the rebel host in numbers the loyal soldiers were as high in spirit as firm in resolution were better armed better officered and above all strong in a better cause nor if those had the incentive of despair to spur them to great deeds did these lack a yet stronger stimulus to action there were bright eyes and fair forms in their camp dependent on their victory for life and yet dearer honor so great was the terror spread through those regions by the name of catiline and by the outrages committed already by his barbarous banditti that all the female nobility of the provinces wherein the war was waging had fled to the roman camp as to their only place of safety for all that district was ripe for insurrection the borough towns awaited only the first sunshine of success to join the rebellion the rural slaves were to a man false at heart and it was evident to all that the slightest check of the consular forces would be the signal for tumult massacre and conflagration in the provincial towns for all the horrors of a servile rising in the champaign flight to rome was impossible since all the villainy and desperate crime of the land was afloat and every where beyond the outposts of antonius head quarters the roads were infested with banditti runaway slaves and rustic robbers to the camp therefore had all the patricians of the district flocked the men as volunteers with such of their clients as they could trust and such of their wealth as was portable the women as suppliants tearful and terrified for romes powerful protection meanwhile for leagues around by day the open country was seen blackened by numberless columns of smoke by night flashing with numberless pyres of flame the blaze of country seats and villas and terror was on all sides murder and rape havoc and desolation the minds of the roman soldiery were inflamed therefore to the utmost the sight of the ravaged country the charms the tears the terrors of the suppliant ladies had kindled all that was patriotic all that was generous all that was manly in their nature and it was with deeprecorded vows of vengeance that they had buckled on their armor and grinded their thirsty swords for the conflict but throughout all that ardent host there was not one so determined so calm in his resolved ire so deadly bent on vengeance as paullus arvina julia was in the camp for no means had occurred of sending her to rome in safety and her high counsels her noble feminine courage would have given birth alone to contagious valor in her lovers spirit had he been weak and faltering as of old between his principles and his passions but it was not so the stern trials to which his constancy had been subjected the fearful strife of the hottest passions which had raged so long in his bosom had hardened him like steel thrice tempered in the furnace and he was now no longer the impulsive enthusiastic changeful stripling in whom todays imagination swept away yesterdays resolve but a cool resolute thoughtful man it is events not years which make men old or young it is adversity and trial not ease and prosperity which make men from dwarfs giants and events had so crowded on the boy in the last few months that those months had matured his wisdom more than all the years of his previous life adversity and trial had so swelled his mental stature that aged men might have been proud to cope with him in counsel strong men to rival him in execution the sun was already high in heaven when the cavalry of the seventh legion which had been selected to act as the generals escort in addition to the prtorian cohort of infantry swept forth from the gates following petreius who although holding the second rank only in the army was actually in command antonius on the pretext of a fit of the gout having declined to lead that day the men were already marshalled at the base of the ascent leading to the narrow plain on which as in the amphitheatre the fight was to be fought out hand to hand with little room for generalship or intricate manoeuvring but every opportunity for the display of mortal strength and desperate gallantry here they had halted on the verge of the broken ground awaiting the arrival of their general in chief to reform their array and complete their preparations before advancing to the attack the lines of the enemy were concealed from them by the abrupt acclivity and the level space on the top of the plateau which intervened between the hosts and it seemed probable that an officer of catilines intuitive eye and rapid resource would not fail to profit by the difficulties of the ground in order to assail the consular troops while struggling among the rocks and thickets which encumbered the ascent it behoved therefore to hold the men well in hand to fortify the heads of the advancing columns with the best soldiers and to be ready with reinforcements at all points and to this end petreius had ordered a brief halt before attacking so eager were the spirits of the men however and so hot for the encounter that they were murmuring already almost angrily and calling on their centurions and tribunes to lead them at once to the shock the fierce acclamations of the rebels consequent on the address of catiline had kindled not daunted the brave indignation which possessed them and stung as it were by some personal insult each soldier of the array burned to be at it so stood the case when escorted by the magnificent array of the legionary horse petreius gallopped through the ranks a military man by habit as by nature who had served for more than thirty years as tribune prfect of allies commander of a legion and lastly prtor all with exceeding great distinction he knew nearly all the men in his ranks by sight was acquainted with their services and honors had led them oftentimes to glory and was their especial favorite he made no set speech therefore to his legions but as he gallopped through the lines called to this man or that by name bidding him recollect this skirmish or think upon that storm fight as he did in this pitched battle or win a civic crown as in that sally and finally shouted to them all in a high voice entreating them to remember that they were roman soldiers fighting against a rabble of unarmed banditti for their country their wives their children their hearths and their altars one fullmouthed shout replied to his brief address lead on petreius we will conquer he waved his hand toward the trumpeters and nodded his high crested helmet and instant there pealed forth that thrilling brazen clangor that bids the romans close nor less sonorously did the war music of the rebels make reply ringing among the hills their bold defiance then onward rolled that bright array with a long steady sweep like that of an unbroken line of billows rushing in grand and majestical upon some sandy cape in vain did the sinuosities of the broken ground in vain did crag and thicket ravine and torrents bed impede their passage closing their files or serrying them as the nature of the ascent required now wheeling into solid column deploying now into extended line still they rolled onward unchecked irresistible a long array of helmets bright a long array of spears the glorious eagles glittered above them in the unclouded sunshine the proud initials which had gleamed from their crimson banners over one half the world shone out conspicuous spqr as the broad folds streamed to their length upon the frosty air a solitary trumpet spoke at times to order their slow terrible advance there was no hum of voices no shout no confusion only the solemn and continuous tramp of their majestic march shaking the earth like an incessant roll of thunderonly the clang of their brazen harness as buckler clashed with buckler all the stern discipline all the composed and orderly manoeuvres all the cold steadiness of modern war was there combined with all the gorgeousness and glitter of the chivalric ages contrary to all expectation no opposition met them as they scaled that abrupt hill side fearful of exposing his flanks catiline wisely held his men back collecting all their energies for the dread onset in superb order regular and even petreius infantry advanced upon the plateau their solid front filling the whole space with a mass of brazen bucklers ten deep and thrice ten hundred wide without an interval or break or bend in that vast line behind these came the cavalry about a thousand strong and the prtorian cohort with the general in person forming a powerful reserve whereby he proposed to decide the day so soon as the traitors should be shaken by his first onset once more the line was halted once more petreius gallopped to the van and passed from left to right across the front reconnoitering the dispositions of the enemy then taking post at the right he unsheathed his broadsword and waved it slowly in the air pointing to the impassive ranks of catiline then the shrill trumpets flourished once again and the dense mass bore onward steady and slow the enemy still motionless and silent until scarce sixty yards intervened between the steadfast ranks and every man might distinguish the features and expression of his personal antagonist there was a pause no word was given no halt ordered but intuitively as if by instinct every man stopped and drew a deep breath unconscious that he did so collecting himself for the dread struggle the point was reached from which it was customary to hurl the tremendous volley of ponderous steelheaded pila which invariably preceded the sword charge of the legions and for the most part threw the first rank of the enemy into confusion and left them an easy conquest to the short stabbing sword and sturdy buckler but now not a javelin was raised on either sidethe long stern swell of the trumpets ordering the charge was drowned by a deep solemn shout which pealed wilder and higher yet into a terrible soulstirring cheer and casting down their heavy missiles both fronts rushed forward simultaneously with their stout shields advanced and their short broadswords levelled to the charge from flank to flank they met simultaneous with a roar louder than that of the most deafening thunder a shock that made the earth tremble the banners flap upon their staves the streams stand still as if an earthquake had reeled under them then rose the clang of blades on helm and buckler clear keen incessant and charging shouts and dying cries and patriotic acclamations and mad blasphemies and ever and anon the piercing clangor of the screaming brass lending fresh frenzy to the frantic tumult from right to left the plain was one vast arena full of single combatsthe whole first ranks on both sides had gone down at the first shock the second and the third had come successively to hand to hand encounter and still as each man fell stabbed to death by the pitiless sword another leaped into his place and still the lines though bent on each side and waving like a bow were steadfast and unbroken and still the clang of brazen bucklers and steel blades rang to the skies rendering all commands all words inaudible officers fought like privates skirmishers hand to hand like legionaries blood flowed like water and so fierce was the hatred of the combatants so deadly the nature of the tremendous stabbing broadswords of the romans that few wounds were inflicted and few men went down till they were slain outright the dust stood in a solid mass over the reeling lines nor could the wind though it blew freshly disperse the dense wreaths so constantly did they surge upward from the trampling feet of those inveterate gladiators at times the waving of a banner would be seen at times a gleamy brazen radiance as some rank wheeled forward or was forced back in some desperate charge but for the most part all was dim and dark and the battle still hung balanced wherever the fight was the fiercest there rang the warshout catiline catiline to the darkened skies and there ever would the roman army waver so furiously did he set on with his best soldiers still bringing up reserves to the weakest points of his army still stabbing down the fiercest of the consular host fearless unwearied and unwounded but his reserves were now all engaged and not one point of the roman line was broken manlius had fallen in the front rank playing a captains and a soldiers part the florentine had fallen in the front rank battling with gallantry worthy a better cause all the most valiant officers all the best veterans had fallen in the first rank all with their faces to the foe all with their wounds in front all lying on the spot which they had held living grimvisaged and still terrible in death paullus arvina exclaimed petreius at this juncture after having observed the equal strife long and intently and having discerned with the eagle eye of a generals instinct what had escaped all those around him that catilines last reserves were engaged the time is come ride to the tribune of the horse and bid him dismount his men horse cannot charge here command the tribune of the prtorian cohort to advance we will strike full at the centre i go petreius and bowing his head till his crimson crest mingled with his chargers mane he spurred furiously to the rear and had delivered his message and returned while the shouts with which the reserve had greeted the command to charge were yet ringing in the air when he returned the general had dismounted and one of his freedmen was unbuckling the spurs from his steel greaves his sword was out and it was evident that he was about to lead the last onset in person a boon noble petreius cried the youth leaping from his horseby all the gods by all your hopes of glory grant me one boon petreius ha what returned the general quicklyspeak out be briefwhat boon be it mine to head the charge art thou so greedy of fame boy or so athirst to die so greedy of revenge petreius i have a vow in heaven and in hell to slay that parricide if he should die by any hand but mine i am forsworn and infamous thou boy and to slay catiline even i petreius thou art mad to say it not mad not mad indeed petreius he will slay him petreius cried an old veteran of arvinas troop the gods thundered when he swore it we all heard it grant his prayer general we will back him to the death but be sure he will slay him be it so said petreius struck despite himself by the confidence of the youth and the conviction of the veterans be it so if ye will but remember when we have broken through the centre wheel to the right with the dismounted horsethe prtorians must charge to the left ho we are all in line forward ho victory and rome and with the word he rushed forward himself a spears length in front of his best men who with a long triumphant shout dashed after him passing right through the wearied troops who had sustained the shock and brunt of the whole day and who now opened their ranks gladly to admit the reinforcement these fresh and splendid soldiers fell like a thunderbolt upon the centre of catilines army weakened already by the loss of its best men and clove their way clean through it solid and unbroken trampling the dead and dying under foot and hurling a small body of the rebels still combating in desperation into the trenches of their camp wherein they perished to a man refusing to surrender and undaunted then wheeling to the left and right they fell on the naked flanks of the reeling and disordered mass while the troops whom they had relieved reforming themselves rapidly pressed forward with tremendous shouts of victory eager to share the triumph which their invincible steadiness had done so much to win it was a battle no longer but a route but a carnage yet still not one of the rebels turned to fly not one laid down his arms or cried for quarter broken pierced through surrounded overwhelmed by numbers they fought in single lines in scattered groups in twos or threes back to back intrepid to the last and giving mortal wounds in their extreme agony more of the consular troops fell after the field was won than during all the previous combat no lances no long weapons no missiles were at hand wherewith to overwhelm the desperadoes no horse wherewith to tread them under foot hand to hand man to man it was fought out with those short stabbing blades against which the stoutest corslet was but as parchment the hardest shield of brassbound bulls hide but as a striplings wicker target still in the front abreast still with the bravest veterans shouting himself hoarse with cries of to me to me catiline to me paul arvina the young man had gone through the whole of that dreadful melee striking down a man at every blow and filling the soldiers mouths with wonder at the boys exploitshe had gone through it all without a scratch unwounded more than once had his mortal enemy been almost within arms length of him their eyes had glared mutual hatred on each other their blades had crossed once but still the throng and rush of combatants and flyers had forced them asunder and now the strife was almost ended the tide of slaughter had receded toward the rebel camp the ramparts of which the legionaries were already storming weary and out of breath and disappointed paullus arvina halted alone among piles of the dying and the dead with groans and imprecations in his ears and bitterness and vexation at his heart his comrades had rushed away on the track of the retreating rebels and their shouts as they stormed the palisades reached him but failed to awake any respondent note of triumph in his spirit he had no share in the vulgar victory he cared not to strike down and slaughter the commoners of the rebellion catiline was the quarry at which he flew and with no game less noble could he rest contented catiline it would seem had escaped him for the moment and he stood leaning on his red sword doubtful instinctively he felt assured that his enemy had not retreated almost he feared that his death had crowned some other hand with glory when suddenly a mighty clatter arose in the rear toward the roman camp and turning swiftly toward the sound he perceived a desperate knot of rebels still charging frantically onward although surrounded by thrice their numbers of inveterate and ruthless victors by the gods he is there and with the speed of the hunted deer he rushed toward the spot bounding in desperate haste over the dying and the dead blaspheming or unconscious he reached the mele he dashed headlong into the thick of it the romans were giving way before the fury of a gory madman as he seemed who bore down all that met him at the swords point catiline catiline and at the cry the boldest of the consular army recoiled horomans ho who will slay sergius catiline ho romans ho his head is worth the winning who will slay sergius catiline and still at every shout he struck down and stabbed and maimed and trampled even amid defeat and ruin victorious unsubdued a terror to his victors who will slay sergius catiline and as arvina rushed upon the scene the veteran who had so confidently announced his coming triumph crossed swords with the traitor and went down in a moment stabbed a full span deep in his thigh ho romans ho who will slay sergius catiline paullus arvinacried the youth springing forward and dealing him with the word a downright blow upon the head which cleft his massive casque asunder i will i even i paullus arvina but he shouted too soon and soon rued the imprudence of raising his arm to strike when at swords point with such a soldier as his own blow fell on the casque of the traitor his shortened blade aimed with a deadly thrust tore through the sturdy shield tore through the strong cuirass and pierced his side with a ghastly wound arvina staggeredhe thought he had received his death blow and had not the blade of catiline bent by the violence of his own effort stuck in the cloven shield resisting every attempt to withdraw it the next blow must have found him unprepared must have destroyed him but ere the desperado could recover his weapon arvina rallied and closed with him grasping him by the throat and shouting lucia vengeance brave as he was and strong not for a single moment could arvina have maintained that deathgrapple had his foe been unwounded but the arch traitor was bleeding at every pore gashed in every limb of his body he had received three mortal wounds already he was fast failing when arvina grappled him and at the name of his injured child his conscience conquered his sword at length came away extricated when too late from the tough bullhide but ere he could nerve his arm to strike again arvinas point had torn his thigh had gored his breast had pierced his naked throat with three wounds the least of them mortal but even in that agony he struck home he could not even curse but he struck home and a fierce joyous smile illuminated his wan face as he saw his slayer stumble forward and fall beside him on the bloody greensward in a moment however paullus rallied recovered his feet drew from his bosom the long black ringlet of poor lucia and bathed it in the life blood of her slayer lucia ho lucia rejoice my vow my vow is kept thou art avenged avenged ah luciajulia and he fell sick and swooning upon the yet living bleeding body of his mortal foeman chapter xxii a night of horror rider and horse friend foe in one red burial blent childe harold the battle was at an end the sun had set the calm and silvery moon was sailing through the azure skies as peaceful as though her pure light shone upon sights of happiness alone and quiet the army of the commonwealth had returned to their camp victorious but in sadness not triumph of the magnificent array which had marched out that morning from the prtorian gate scarce twothirds had returned at sunset and the missing were the best the bravest the most noble of the host for all the most gallant had fallen dead in that desperate struggle or had sunk down faint with wounds and bloodshed beside the bodies of their conquered foemen of the rebels there was not a remnant left some had escaped from that dread route and of that mighty power which at the close of day was utterly exterminated it is on record that neither in the combat while it lasted nor in the slaughter which followed it was any free born citizen takena living captive for the numbers engaged on both sides it is probable that never in the annals of the world was there the like carnage nor is this wonderful when the nature of the ground which rendered flight almost impossible to the vanquished the nature of the weapons which rendered almost every wound surely mortal and the nature of the strife which rendered the men of either party pitiless and desperate are all taken into consideration in long ranks like grass in the mowers swathes the rebel warriors lay with their grim faces and glazed eyes set in that terrible expression of ferocity which is always observed on the lineaments of those who have died from wounds inflicted by a stabbing weapon and under them or near them in ghastly piles were heaped scarce less in number the corpses of their slaughtered conquerors so equal was the havoc so equal the value which the men had set on their own lives and on those of their enemies never perhaps had there been such or so signal a retribution they who had taken to the sword had perished by the sword not figuratively but in the literal meaning of the words stabbers by trade they had fallen stabbed by the hands of those whom they had destined to like massacre with the exception of the five chiefs who had already wrestled out their dark spirits in the tullianum slavishly strangled there was no traitor slain save by the steel blades edge the field of pistoria was the tribunal the ruthless sword the judge and executioner by which to a man the conspirators expiated their atrocious crimes no chains no scaffolds followed that tremendous field none had survived on whom to wreak the vengeance of the state never was victory so complete or final but in that victory there was no triumph no joy no glory to the victors so long and so desperate had been the battle so furiously contested the series of single combats into which it was resolved after the final and decisive charge of the prtorian cohort that the shades of the early winter night were already falling over the crimson field when weak and shattered sorrowful and gloomy the roman host was recalled by the wailing notes of the brazen trumpets from that tremendous butchery the watches were set as usual and the watch fires kindled but no shouts of the exulting soldiers were to be heard hailing their general imperator no songs of triumph pealed to the skies in honor of the great deeds done the deathless glory won no prizes of valor were distributed no triumphnot an oration evenwas to be hoped for by the victorious leader of that victorious host which had conquered indeed for the liberties of rome but had conquered not on foreign earth in no legitimate warfare against no natural foe but on the very soil of the republic at the very gates of rome in an unnatural quarrel against romans citizens and brothers the groans of the wounded the lamentations of friends the shrieks of women went up the livelong night from that woful camp to hear that grievous discord one would have judged it rather the consequences of defeat than of victory however sad and bloody no words can express the anguish of the ladies with whom the camp was crowded as rushing forth to meet the returning legions they missed the known faces altogether or met them gashed and pallid borne home perhaps to die after long suffering upon the shields under which they had so boldly striven enquiries were fruitless none knew the fate of his next neighbor save in so much as this that few of those who went down in such a mele could be expected ever again to greet the sunrise or hail the balmy breath of morning averted heads and downcast eyes were the sole replies that met the wives the mothers the betrothed maidens widowed ere wedded as with rent garments and dishevelled hair and streaming eyes they rushed into the sorrowful ranks shrieking where are they and were answered only by the short echo where such was the fate of julia no one could tell her aught of her arvina until at a late hour of the night remembering her solitary situation and high birth and taking a deep interest in her sorrows petreius himself visited her not to instil false hope but to console if possible her wounded spirit by praises of her lost lovers conduct he fought beside my right hand julia through the whole of that deadly struggle and none with more valor or more glory he led the last bloody onset and was the first who cut his way through the rebel centre julia you must not weep for him you must not envy him such glory julia he was a hero was replied the poor girl with clasped hands and streaming eyesthen he is no longer i do not know but fear it said the stout soldier he had vowed himself to slay catiline with his own hands such vows are not easy julia nor safe of performance and catiline asked juliathe parricidethe monster has not survived the strife none of the traitors have survived it replied petreius but how he fell or where as yet we know not paullus hath slain him my own my noble paullus i think so julia answered the general i know it she said slowlybut what availeth that to meto me who had rather hear one accent of his noble voice meet one glance of his glorious eyealas alas my paullus my lord my life but i will not survive him hold julia hold i would not nurse you to false hopes but he may yet be living many are wounded doubtless who shall be saved tomorrow tomorrow she exclaimed a gleam of hope bursting upon her soul like the dayspring why not tonightpetreius i say why not tonight it is impossible the men are all worn out with wounds and weariness and must have daylight to the task dear girl it is impossible i will go forth myself alone unaided i will save him you must not julia who shall prevent me who dare to part a betrothed maiden from her true lovertrue alas in death in death i will replied petreius firmly you know not the perils of such a night as this the gaunt wolves from the appennines the foul and carrion vultures the plundering disbanded soldiers the horrid unsexed women who roam the field of blood more cruel than the famished wolf more sordid than the loathsome vulture i will prevent you julia but with the earliest dawn tomorrow i will myself go with you fare you well try to sleep and hope hope for the best poor julia and with a deep sigh at the futility of his consolation the noble roman left the tent giving strict orders to the peasant girls who had been pressed into her service and to arvinas freedmen who were devoted to her on no account to suffer her to leave the camp that night and even if need were to use force to prevent her meanwhile the frost wind had risen cold and cutting over the field of blood its chilly freshness checking the flow of blood and fanning the brow of many a maimed and gory wretch awoke him to so much at least of life as to be conscious of his tortures and loud groans and piercing shrieks and agonizing cries for water might beheard now on all sides where before the wind rose there had been but feeble wailings and halfunconscious lamentations then came a long wild howl from the mountain side another and another and then the snarling fiendish cry of the fell wolfpack gods what a scream of horrid terror rose from each helpless sufferer unanimous as that accursed sound fell on their palsied ears and tortured them back into life but cries were of no avail nor prayers nor struggles nor even the shouts and trumpet blasts and torches of the legionaries from the camp who hoped thus to scare the bloodthirsty brutes from their living prey of friend and foe real comrade and false traitor it was all vain and ere long to the longdrawn howls and fierce snarls of the hungry wolves battening upon their horrid meal were added the flapping wings and croaking cries of innumerable night birds flocking to the carnage and these were blended still with the sharp outcries and faint murmurs that told how keener than the mortal sword were the beak and talon the fang and claw of the wild beast and the carrion fowl such conquerors such a thing is glory that frost wind among others awakened paullus to new life and new horrors though gashed and weak from loss of blood none of his wounds were mortal and yet he felt that unaided he must die there past doubt even if spared by the rending beak and lacerating talon as he raised himself slowly to a sitting posture and was feeling about for his sword which had fallen from his grasp as he fainted he heard his name called feebly by some one near him who calls arvina he replied faintly i am here i caius pansa answered the voice it was that of the old legionary horseman who had predicted so confidently the fall of catiline by the hand of paullus i feared thou wert dead we shall both be dead soon caius pansa replied the young man hark to those wolves it makes my very flesh creep on my bones they are sweeping this way too no no cheer up brave heart replied the veteran we will not die this bout by hercules only crawl to me thou my thigh is broken and i cannot stir i have wine here a warming draught in a good leather bottle trust to old caius for campaigning i have life enough in me to beat off these howling furies come paullus come brave youth we will share the wine you shall not die this time i saw you kill that dogi knew that you would kill him courage i say crawl hitherward cheered by the friendly voice the wounded youth crept feebly and with sore anguish to the old troopers side and shared his generously proffered cup and animated by the draught and deriving fresh courage from his praises endured the horrors of that awful night until the day breaking in the east scared the foul beasts and night birds to their obscene haunts in the mountain peaks and caverns many times the gory wings had flapped nigh to them and the fierce wolfhowls had come within ten feet of where they sat half recumbent propped on a pile of dead but still their united voices and the defensive show which they assumed drove off the savages and now daylight and new hopes dawned together and rescue was at hand and certain already the roman trumpets were heard sounding and the shouts of the soldiers as they discerned some friend living or some leader of the rebels dead or dying came swelling to their ears laden with rapture on the fresh morning air at this moment some groans broke out so terribly acute and bitter from a heap of gory carcasses hard by arvina and the old trooper that after calling several times in vain to enquire who was there the veteran said it were pity paullus that after living out such a mele as this and such a night as the last any poor fellow should die now cannot you crawl to him with the flask and moisten his lips try my paullus i will try caius but i am stiffer than i was and my hurts shoot terribly but i will try and with the word holding the leathern bottle in his teeth he crawled painfully and wearily toward the spot whence the sounds proceeded but ere he reached it creeping over the dead he came suddenly on what seemed a corpse so hideous and so truculently savage so horribly distorted in the death pang that involuntarily he paused to gaze upon it it was catiline although at first he recognised him not so frightfully was his face altered his nether lip literally gnawed halfthrough by his own teeth in the death agony and his other features lacerated by the beak and talons of some halfgorged vulture but while he gazed the heavy lids rose and the glazed eyes stared upon him in ghastly recognition paullus knew him at the same moment and started back a little drawing a deep breath through his set teeth and murmuring ah catiline the dying traitors lips were convulsed by a fearful sardonic grin and he strove hard to speak but the words rattled in his throat inarticulate and a sharp ruckling groan was the only sound that he uttered but with a mighty effort he writhed himself up from the ground and drove his sword which he still clasped in his convulsed fingers by a last desperate exertion through paullus massive corslet and deep into his bosom with a sharp cry the youth fell prone and after two or three struggles to arise lay on his face motionless and senseless catiline dropped back with a fiendish grin and eyes rolling in a strange mixed expression of agony and triumph while old pansa after crying twice or thrice paullus ho noble paullus exclaimed mournfully alas he is dead he is dead and i it is who have slain him within half an hour petreius and his guards with several mounted officers and a lady upon a white palfrey came riding slowly toward the fatal spot pausing from time to time to examine every pile of carcasses and after causing his men to dismount and turn over the bodies in the hope of finding him they sought their search had hitherto been fruitless and unrewarded even by the discovery of any wounded friends or comrades for this was the place in which the battle had been most desperately contested and few had fallen here but to die almost on the instant but now a weak voice was heard calling to the general petreius he is here here he is here noble petreius the immortal gods be praised cried julia interpreting the casual words at once to signify arvina and giving her palfrey the rein she gallopped to the spot followed by petreius shaking his head gloomily for he was not so deceived who who is here exclaimed the general ha my stout pansa right glad am i to find you living see to him quickly postumus and capito but whom do you mean who is here catiline paullus arvina slew him by all the gods exclaimed petreius leaping down from his horse and gazing at the hideous mutilated carcase still breathing a little and retaining in its face that ferocity of soul which had distinguished it while living but swifter yet than he julia sprang from her saddle and rushed heedless and unconscious through pools of blood ancle deep treading on human corpses in her wild haste and cast herself down on the well known armor the casque crested and the cloak embroidered by her own delicate hands which could alone be distinguished of her lovers prostrate form aye me aye me dead dead my own arvina alas alascried petreius raise her up raise them both this is most lamentable never heed me said the veteran pansa eagerly to the officers who were busy raising him from the ground help the poor girl help the brave youth he may be living yet though i fear me not it is my fault alas that he is not living now thy fault old pansa how can that be my friendwho slew him once more the rigid features of catiline relaxed into a horrid smile the glaring eyes again opened and starting half upright he shook his hand aloft and with a frightful effort half laugh half groan half words articulate sneered fiendishlyi i ha ha i did ha ha ha ha but at the same instant there was a joyous cry from the officers who had lifted paullus and a rapturous shriek from julia he is not dead his hurts are not mortal lady it is but loss of blood he lives he lives curses curcurha hathisthis ishades the fierce sneer died from the lips a look of horror glared from the savage eyes the jaw gibbered and fell a quick spasm shook the strong frame and in a paroxysm of frustrated spite and disappointed fury the dark spirit which had never spared or pitied went to its everlasting home it was the dead of winter when the flame of rebellion was thus quenched in rebel blood cicero still was consul but it was blithesome springtide and the great orator had long since sworn that he had saved his country among the acclamations of a people for once grateful had long since retired into the calm serenity of private life and literary leisure when paullus was sufficiently recovered from his wounds to receive the thanks of his friend and benefactor to receive in the presence of the good and great consular his best reward in the hand of his sweet julia it was balmy italian june and all in rome was peace and prosperity most suitable to the delicious season when on the sacred day of venus clad in her snowwhite bridal robe with its purple ribands and fringes her blushing face concealed by the saffroncolored nuptial veil the lovely girl was borne a willing bride over the threshold of her noble husbands mansion amid the merry blaze of waxen torches and the soft swell of hymeneal music and the congratulations of such a train of consuls consulars senators and patricians as rarely had been seen collected at any private festival in a clear voice though soft and gentle she addressed paullus with the solemn formula where thou art caius i am caia thenceforth their trials ceased their happiness began and thenceforth they two were one for ever and for years afterward when roman maidens called blessings down upon a kindred bride they had no fairer fate to wish her than to be happy as arvinas julia and how should any man be blessed in this transitory life if not by the love of such a girl as julia the friendship of such a man as cicero the fame of such a deed as the death of the roman traitor the end notes to the roman traitor it is perhaps hardly necessary to state that the oration of cicero in the th page of the second volume those of csar and cato in the th and d pages and that of catiline in the th page of the same are all literal translations from the actual speeches delivered on those occasions and recorded by cicero and sallust it was absolutely necessary for the truth and spirit of the romance that these speeches should be inserted and the author considered that it would be equally vain and absurd to attempt fictitious orations when these masterpieces of ancient eloquence were extant this brief explanation made no farther notes will i believe be found necessary as the few latin words which occur in the body of the work are explained therein and the costumes and customs are described so much in detail that they will be readily comprehended even by the unclassical reader a table is appended containing the roman and english calendars of the three months during which all the events of the conspiracy occurred illustrating the complicated and
