the roman traitor or the days of cicero cato and cataline a true tale of the republic by henry william herbert author of cromwell marmaduke wyvil brothers etc why not a borgia or a catilinepope volume i this is one of the most powerful roman stories in the english language and is of itself sufficient to stamp the writer as a powerful man the dark intrigues of the days which caesar sallust and cicero made illustrious when cataline defied and almost defeated the senate when the plots which ultimately overthrew the roman republic were being formed are described in a masterly manner the book deserves a permanent position by the side of the great bellum catalinarium of sallust and if we mistake not will not fail to occupy a prominent place among those produced in america philadelphia t b peterson no chestnut street entered according to act of congress in the year by tb peterson in the clerks office of the district court of the united states in and for the eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia stereotyped by george charles no sansom street preface a few words are perhaps needed as an introduction to a work of far more ambitious character than any which i have before attempted in venturing to select a subject from the history of rome during its earlier ages undeterred by the failure or at the best partial success of writers far more eminent than i can ever hope to become i have been actuated by reasons which in order to relieve myself from the possible charge of presumption i will state briefly it has long been my opinion then that there lay a vast field rich with a harvest of material almost virgin for the romancers use in the history of classic ages and this at a period when the annals of every century and nation since the christian era have been ransacked and reproduced in endless variety for the entertainment of the hourly increasing reading world is no small advantage again i have fancied that i could discover a cause for the imperfect success of great writers when dealing with classic fiction in the fact of their endeavoring to be too learned of their aiming too much at portraying greeks and romans and too little at depicting men forgetful that under all changes of custom and costume in all countries ages and conditions the human heart is still the human heart convulsed by the same passions chilled by the same griefs burning with the same joys and in the main actuated by the same hopes and fears with these views i many years ago deliberately selected this subject for a novel which has advanced by slow steps to such a degree of completeness as it has now attained having determined on trying my success in classical fiction the conspiracy of cataline appeared to me a theme particularly well adapted for the purpose as being an actual event of vast importance and in many respects unparalleled in history as being partially familiar to every one thoroughly understood perhaps by no one so slender are the authentic documents concerning it which have come down to us and so dark and mysterious the motives of the actors it possessed therefore among other qualifications as the groundwork of a historical romance one almost indispensablethat of indistinctness which gives scope to the exercise of imagination without the necessity of falsifying either the truths or the probabilities of history of the execution i have of course nothing to say but that i have sedulously avoided being overlearned that few latin words will be found in the worknone whatsoever in the conversational parts and none but the names of articles which have no direct english appellation and that it is sufficiently simple and direct for the most unclassical reader i hope that the costume the manners of the people and the antiquarian details will be found sufficiently correct if they be not it is not for want of pains or care for i have diligently consulted all the authorities to which i could command access to the history of the strange events related in this tale i have adhered most scrupulously and i believe that the dates facts and characters of the individuals introduced will not be found in any material respect erroneous or untrue and here i may perhaps venture to observe that on reading the most recently published lectures of niebuhr which never fell in my way until very lately i had the great satisfaction of finding the view i have always taken of the character and motives of cataline and his confederates confirmed by the opinion of that profound and sagacious critic and historian i will only add that it is hardly probable that the roman traitor would ever have been finished had it not been for the strenuous advice of a friend in whose opinion i have the utmost confidence mr benjamin to whom some of the early chapters were casually shown two or three years ago and who almost insisted on my completing it it is most fitting therefore that it should be as it is introduced to the world under his auspices since but for his favourable judgment and for a feeling on my own part that to fail in such an attempt would be scarce a failure while success would be success indeed it would probably have never seen the light of day with these few remarks i submit the roman traitor to the candid judgment of my friends and the public somewhat emboldened by the uniform kindness and encouragement which i have hitherto met and with some hope that i may be allowed at some future day to lay another romance of the most famous before the citizens of the youngest republic the cedars contents volume i chapter

but bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs marino faliero midnight was over rome the skies were dark and lowering and ominous of tempest for it was a sirocco and the welkin was overcast with sheets of vapory cloud not very dense indeed or solid but still sufficient to intercept the feeble twinkling of the stars which alone held dominion in the firmament since the young crescent of the moon had sunk long ago beneath the veiled horizon the air was thick and sultry and so unspeakably oppressive that for above three hours the streets had been entirely deserted in a few houses of the higher class lights might be seen dimly shining through the casements of the small chambers hard beside the doorway appropriated to the use of the atriensis or slave whose charge it was to guard the entrance of the court but for the most part not a single ray cheered the dull murky streets except that here and there before the holy shrine or vaster and more elaborate temple of some one of romes hundred gods the votive lanthorns though shorn of half their beams by the dense fogwreaths burnt perennial the period was the latter time of the republic a few years after the fell democratic persecutions of the plebeian marius had drowned the mighty city oceansdeep in patrician gore after the awful retribution of the avenger sylla had rioted in the destruction of that guilty faction he who was destined one day to support the laurelled diadem of universal empire on his bald brows stood even now among the noblest the most ambitious and the most famous of the state though not as yet had he unfurled the eagle wings of conquest over the fierce barbarian hordes of gaul and germany or launched his galleys on the untried waters of the great western sea a dissipated spendthrift and luxurious youth devoted solely as it would seem to the pleasures of the table or to intrigues with the most fair and noble of romes ladies he had yet amid those unworthy occupations displayed such gleams of overmastering talent such wondrous energy such deep sagacity and above all such uncurbed though illdirected ambition that the perpetual dictator had already years before exclaimed with prescient wisdomin yon unzoned youth i perceive the germ of many a marius at the same time the magnificent and princely leader who was to be thereafter his great rival was reaping that rich crop of glory the seeds of which had been sown already by the wronged lucullus in the broad kingdoms of the effeminate east meanwhile as rome had gradually rendered herself by the exertion of indomitable valor the supreme mistress of every foreign power that bordered on the mediterranean wealth avarice and luxury like some contagious pestilence had crept into the inmost vitals of the commonwealth until the very features which had once made her famous no less for her virtues than her valor were utterly obliterated and for ever instead of a paternal poor brave patriotic aristocracy she had now a nobility valiant indeed and capable but dissolute beyond the reach of mans imagination boundless in their expenditures reckless as to the mode of gaining wherewithal to support them oppressive and despotical to their inferiors smoothtongued and hypocritical toward each other destitute equally of justice and compassion toward men and of respect and piety toward the gods wealth had become the idol the god of the whole people wealthand no longer service eloquence daring or integritywas held the requisite for office wealth now conferred upon its owner all magistracies all guerdonsrank power commandconsulships provinces and armies the senateonce the most grave and stern and just assembly that the world had seenwas now with but a few superb exceptions a timid faithless and licentious oligarchy whilename whilome so majestical and mightythe people the great roman people was but a mob a vile colluvion of the offscourings of all climes and regionsgreeks syrians africans barbarians from the chilly north and eunuchs from the vanquished orient enfranchised slaves and liberated gladiatorsa factious turbulent fierce rabble such was the state of rome when it would seem that the gods wearied with the guilt of her aggrandisement sick of the slaughter by which she had won her way to empire almost universal had judged her to destructionhad given her up to perish not by the hands of any foreign foe but by her own not by the wisdom conduct bravery of others but by her own insanity and crime but at this darkest season of the state one hope was left to romeone safeguard the united worth of cicero and cato the statesmanship the eloquence the splendid and unequalled parts of the former the stern selfdenying virtue the unchanged constancy the resolute and hard integrity of the latter these singular and severally might have availed to prop a falling dynastyunited might have preserved a world the night was such as has already been described gloomy and lowering in its character as was the aspect of the political horizon and most congenial to the fearful plots which were even now in progress against the lives of romes best citizens against the sanctity of her most solemn temples the safety of her domestic hearths the majesty of her inviolable laws the very existence of her institutions of her empire of herself as one among the nations of the earth most suitable indeed was that dim murky night most favorable the solitude of the deserted streets to the measures of those parricides of the republic who lurked within her bosom thirsty for blood and panting to destroy nor had they overlooked the opportunity but a few days remained before that on which the consular elections fixed for the eighteenth of october were to take place in the campus martiuswhereat it was already understood that sergius cataline frustrated the preceding year by the election of the great orator of arpinum to his discomfiture was about once more to try the fortunes of himself and of the popular faction it was at this untimely hour that a man might have been seen lurking beneath the shadows of an antique archway decorated with halfobliterated sculptures of the old etruscan school in one of the narrow and winding streets which lying parallel to the suburra ran up the hollow between the viminal and quirinal hills he was a tall and wellframed figure though so lean as to seem almost emaciated his forehead was unusually high and narrow and channelled with deep horizontal lines of thought and passion across which cut at right angles the sharp furrows of a continual scowl drawing the corners of his heavy coalblack eyebrows into strange contiguity beneath these situated far back in their cavernous recesses a pair of keen restless eyes glared out with an expression fearful to beholda jealous and unquiet everwandering glanceso sinister and ominous and above all so indicative of a perturbed and anguished spirit that it could not be looked upon without suggesting those wild tales which speak of fiends dwelling in the revivified and untombed carcasses of those who die in unrepented sin his nose was keenly roman with a deep wrinkle seared as it would seem into the sallow flesh from either nostril downward his mouth grimly compressed and his jaws for the most part firmly clinched together spoke volumes of immutable and iron resolution while all his under lip was scarred in many places with the trace of wounds inflicted beyond doubt in some dread paroxysm by the very teeth it covered the dress which this remarkable looking individual at that time wore was the penula as it was called a short loose straightcut overcoat reaching a little way below the knees not fitted to the shape but looped by woollen frogs all down the front with broad flaps to protect the arms and a square cape or collar which at the pleasure of the wearer could be drawn up so as to conceal all the lower part of the countenance or suffered to fall down upon the shoulders this uncouth vestment which was used only by men of the lowest order or by others solely when engaged in long and toilsome journeys or in cold wintry weather was composed of a thick loosenapped frieze or serge of a dark purplish brown with loops and fibulae or frogs of a dull dingy red the wearers legs were bare down to the very feet which were protected by coarse shoes of heavy leather fastened about the ancles by a thong with a clasp of marvellously illcleaned brass upon his head he had a petasus or broadbrimmed hat of gray felt fitting close to the skull with a long fall behind not very unlike in form to the southwester of a modern seaman this article of dress was like the penula although peculiar to the inferior classes oftentimes worn by men of superior rank when journeying abroad from these therefore little or no aid was given to conjecture as to the station of the person who now shrunk back into the deepest gloom of the old archway now peered out stealthily into the night grinding his teeth and muttering smothered imprecations against some one who had failed to meet him the shoes however of rude illtanned leather of a form and manufacture which was peculiar to the lowest artizans or even slaves were such as no man of ordinary standing would under any circumstances have adopted yet if these would have implied that the wearer was of low plebeian origin this surmise was contradicted by several rings decked with gems of great price and splendorone a large deeplyengraved signetwhich were distinctly visible by their lustre on the fingers of both his hands his air and carriage too were evidently in accordance with the nobility of birth implied by these magnificent adornments rather than with the humble station betokened by the rest of his attire his motions were quick irritable and incessant his pace as he stalked to and fro in the narrow area of the archway was agitated and uneven now he would stride off ten or twelve steps with strange velocity then pause and stand quite motionless for perhaps a minutes space and then again resume his walk with slow and faltering gestures to burst forth once again as at the instigation of some goading spirit to the same shortlived energy and speed meantime his color went and came he bit his lip till the blood trickled down his clean shorn chin he clinched his hands and smote them heavily together and uttered in a harsh hissing whisper the most appalling imprecationson his own headon him who had deceived himon rome and all her myriads of inhabitantson earth and sea and heavenon everything divine or human the black plague light on the fat sleepy gluttonnay rather all the fiends and furies of deep erebus pursue mememe who was fool enough to fancy that aught of bold design or manly daring could rouse up the dull adipose luxurious loiterer from his wineshis concubineshis slumbersand nowthe dire ones hunt him to perdition now the seventh hour of night hath passed and all await us at the house of laeca and this foul sluggard sottishly snores at home while he was cursing yet and smiting his broad chest and gnashing his teeth in impotent malignity suddenly a quick step became audible at a distance the sound fell on his ear sharpened by the stimulus of fiery passions and of conscious fear long ere it could have been perceived by any ordinary listener tis he he said tis he at lastbut no he continued after a pause of a second during which he had stooped and laid his ear close to the ground no tis too quick and light for the gross cassius by all the gods there are two can he then have betrayed me no no by heavens he dare not at the same time he started back into the darkest corner of the arch pulled up the cape of his cassock and slouched the widebrimmed hat over his anxious lineaments then pressing his body flat against the dusky wall to which the color of his garments was in some sort assimilated he awaited the arrival of the newcomers perhaps hoping that if foreign to his purpose they might pass by him in the gloom as the footsteps now sounded nearer he thrust his right hand into the bosom of his cassock and drew out a long broad twoedged dagger or stiletto and as he unsheathed it ready he muttered to himself ready for either fortune nearer and nearer came the footsteps and the blent sounds of the two were now distinctly audibleone a slow listless tread as of one loitering along as if irresolute whether to turn back or proceed the other a firm rapid and decided step ha it is well resumed the listener cassius it is and with him comes cethegus though where they have joined company i marvel and as he spoke he put his weapon back into his girdle where it was perfectly concealed by the folds of the penula hostand he whispered as the two men whose steps he had heard entered the archway stand friends and brethren hail sergius replied the foremost a tall and splendidly formed man with a dark quick eye and regular features nobly chiselled and in all respects suchhad it not been for the bitter and ferocious sneer which curled his haughty lip at every wordas might be termed eminently handsome he wore his raven hair in long and flowing curls which hung quite down upon his shouldersa fashion that was held in rome to the last degree effeminate indeed almost infamouswhile his trim whiskers and close curly beard reeked with the richest perfumes impregnating the atmosphere through which he passed with odors so strong as to be almost overpowering his garb was that of a patrician of the highest order though tinctured like the arrangement of his hair with not a little of that soft luxurious taste which had of latter years begun so generally to pervade romes young nobility his under dress or tunic was not of that succinct and narrow cut which had so well become the sturdy fathers of the new republic butbeside being wrought of the finest spanish wool of snowy whiteness with the broad crimson facings indicative of his senatorial rank known as the laticlavefell in loose folds half way between his knee and ancle it had sleeves too a thing esteemed unworthy of a manand was fringed at the cuffs and round the hem with a deep passmenting of crimson to match the laticlave his toga of the thinnest and most gauzy texture and whiter even than his tunic flowed in a series of classical and studied draperies quite to his heels where like the tunic it was bordered by a broad crimson trimming his feet were ornamented rather than protected by delicate buskins of black leather decked with the silver sigma in its old crescent shape the proud initial of the high term senator a golden bracelet fashioned like a large serpent exquisitely carved with horrent scales and forked tail was twined about the wrist of his right arm with a huge carbuncle set in the head and two rare diamonds for eyes a dozen rings gemmed with the clearest brilliants sparkled upon his white and tapering fingers in which to complete the picture he bore a handkerchief of fine egyptian cambric or byssus as the romans styled it embroidered at the edges in arabesques of golden thread his comrade was if possible more slovenly in his attire than his friend was luxurious and expensive he wore no toga and his tunicwhich without the upper robe was the accustomed dress of gladiators slaves and such as were too poor to wear the full and characteristic attire of the roman citizenwas of dark brownish woollen threadbare and soiled with spots of grease and patched in many places his shoes were of coarse clouted leather and his legs were covered up to the knees by thongs of illtanned cowhide rolled round them and tied at the ancles with straps of the same material a plague on both of you replied the person who had been so long awaiting them in answer to their salutation two hours have ye detained me here and now that ye have come in pretty guise ye do come oh by the gods a well assorted pair cassius more filthy than the vilest and most base tatterdemalion of the stews and with him rare cethegus a senator in all his bravery wise judgment excellent disguises i know not whether most to marvel at the insane and furious temerity of this one or at the idiotic foolery of that well fitted are ye both for a great purpose and nowmay the dark furies hunt you to perditionwhat hath delayed you why what a coil is here replied the gay cethegus delighted evidently at the unsuppressed anger of his confederate in crime and bent on goading to yet more fiery wrath his most ungovernable temper methinks o pleasant sergius the moisture of this delectable night should have quenched somewhat the quick flames of your most amiable and placid humor keep thy hard words i prithee cataline for those who either heed or dread them i thou well knowest do neither peace peace cethegus plague him no farther interrupted cassius just as the fierce conspirator exclaiming in a deep harsh whisper the one word boy strode forth as if to strike him and thou good cataline listen to reasonwe have been dogged hitherward and so came by circuitous byeways dogged said yedogged and by whomdoth the slave live who dared it by a slave as we reckon answered cassius for he wore no toga and his tunic was filthyvery filthy by the godsmost like thine own good cassius interposed cethegus but in good sooth he was a slave my sergius he passed us twice before i thought much of it once as we crossed the sacred way after descending from the palatineand once again beside the shrine of venus in the cyprian street the second time he gazed into my very eyes until he caught my glance meeting his own and then with a quick bounding pace he hurried onward tush answered cataline tush was that all the knave was a chance nightwalker and frightened ye ha ha by hercules it makes me laughfrightened the rash and overbold cethegus it was not all replied cethegus very calmly it was not all cataline and but that we are joined here in a purpose so mighty that it overwhelms all private interests all mere considerations of the individual you my good sir should learn what it is to taunt a man with fear who fears not anythingleast of all thee but it was not all for as we turned from a side lane into the wicked street that scales the summit of the esquiline my eye caught something lurking in the dark shadow cast over an angle of the wall by a large cypress i seized the arm of cassius to check his speech ha did the fat idiot speakwhat said he interrupted cataline nothing replied the other nothing at least of any moment well i caught cassius by the arm and was in the act of pointing when from the shadows of the tree out sprang this selfsame varlet whereon i rushed on him dragged him into the light and smote him thus and thus and thus didst thou not excellent cethegus cataline exclaimed fiercely in a hard stern whisper making three lounges while he spoke as if with a stiletto i did not any of these things answered the other and why not i say why not why not cried cataline with rude impetuosity that shall i answer when you give me time said cethegus coolly because when i rushed forth he fled with an exceeding rapid flight leaped the low wall into the graveyard of the base plebeians and there among the cypresses and overthrown sepulchres escaped me for a while i beat about most warily and at length started him up again from the jaws of an obscene and broken catacomb i gained on him at every step heard the quick panting of his breath stretched out my left to grasp him while my right held unsheathed and ready the good stiletto that neer failed me and nownowby the great jove his tunics hem was fluttering in my clutch when my feet tripped over a prostrate column that i was hurled five paces at the least in advance of the fugitive and when i rose again sore stunned and bruised and breathless the slave had vanished and where i prithee during this wellconcerted chase was valiant cassius enquired cataline with a hoarse sneering laugh during the chase i knew not answered cethegus but when it was over and i did return i found him leaning on the wall even in the angle whence the slave fled on our approach asleep i warrant meby the great gods asleep exclaimed the other but comecome let us onwardi trow we have been waited forand as we go tell me i do beseech thee what wast that cassius said when the slave lay beside ye nay but i have forgottensome trivial thing or otheroh now i do bethink me he said it was a long walk to marcus laecas fool fool double and treble fool and dost thou call this nothing nothing to tell the loitering informer the very head and heart of our design by erebus but i am sicksick of the fools with whom i am thus wretchedly assorted well well upon your own heads be it and instantly recovering his temper he walked on with his two confederates now in deep silence at a quick pace through the deserted streets towards their perilous rendezvous noiseless with stealthy steps they hurried onward threading the narrow pass between the dusky hills until they reached a dark and filthy lane which turning at right angles led to the broad thoroughfare of the more showy though by no means less illfamed suburra into this they struck instantly walking in single file and keeping as nearly as possible in the middle of the causeway the lane which was composed of dwellings of the lowest order tenanted by the most abject profligates was dark as midnight for the tall dingy buildings absolutely intercepted every ray of light that proceeded from the murky sky and there was not a spark in any of the sordid casements nor any votive lamp in that foul alley the only glimpse of casual illumination and that too barely serving to render the darkness and the filth perceptible was the faint streak of lustre where the suburra crossed the far extremity of the byepath scarce had they made three paces down the alley ere the quick eye of cataline for ever roving in search of aught suspicious caught the dim outline of a human figure stealing across this pallid gleam hist hist he whiskered in stern low tones which though inaudible at three yards distance completely filled the ears of him to whom they were addressedhist hist cethegus seest thou notseest thou not there if it be he he scapes us not againout with thy weapon man and strike at once if that thou have a chance but if not do thou go on with cassius to the appointed place leave him to me and say i follow ye see he hath slunk into the darkness separate ye and occupy the whole width of the street while i dislodge him and as he spoke unsheathing his broad poignard but holding it concealed beneath his cassock he strode on boldly affecting the most perfect indifference and even insolence of bearing meanwhile the halfseen figure had entirely disappeared amid the gloom yet had the wary eye of the conspirator in the one momentary glance he had obtained been able to detect with something very near to certainty the spot wherein the spy if such he were lay hidden as he approached the placewhereat a heap of rubbish the relics of a building not long ago as it would seem consumed by fire projected far into the streetseeing no sign whatever of the man who he was well assured was not far distant he paused a little so as to suffer his companions to draw near then as they came up with him skilled in all deep and desperate wiles he instantly commenced a whispered conversation a tissue of mere nonsense with here and there a word of seeming import clearly and audibly pronounced nor was his dark manoeuvre unsuccessful for as he uttered the word cicero watching meanwhile the heap of ruins as jealously as ever tiger glared on its destined prey he caught a tremulous outline and in a seconds space a small round object like a mans head was protruded from the darkness and brought into relief against the brighter back ground thenthenwith all the furyall the lythe agile vigor all the unrivalled speed and concentrated fierceness of that tremendous beast of prey he dashed upon his victim but at the first slight movement of his sinewy form the dimly seen shape vanished impetuously he rushed on among the piles of scattered brick and rubbish and ere he saw the nature of the place plunged down a deep descent into the cellar of the ruin lucky was it for cataline and most unfortunate for rome that when the building fell its fragments had choked three parts of the depth of that subterranean vault so that it was but from a height of three or four feet at the utmost that the fierce desperado was precipitated still to a man less active the accident might have been serious but with instinctive promptitude backed by a wonderful exertion of muscular agility he writhed his body even in the act of falling so that he lighted on his feet and ere a second had elapsed after his fall was extricating himself from the broken masses of cement and brickwork and soon stood unharmed though somewhat stunned and shaken on the very spot which had been occupied scarcely a minute past by the suspected spy at the same point of time in which the conspirator fell the person whosoever he was in pursuit of whom he had plunged so heedlessly into the ruins darted forth from his concealment close to the body and within arms length of the fierce cethegus whose attention was for the moment distracted from his watch by the catastrophe which had befallen his companion dodging by a quick movementso quick that it seemed almost the result of instinctso to elude the swift attempt of his enemy to arrest his progress the spy was forced to rush almost into the arms of cassius yet this appeared not to cause him any apprehension for he dashed boldly on till they were almost front to front when notwithstanding his unwieldy frame and inactivity of habit spurred into something near to energy by the very imminence of peril the wornout debauchee bestirred himself as if to seize him if such however were his intention widely had he miscalculated his own powers and fatally underrated the agility and strength of the strangera tall thin wiry man well nigh six feet in height broad shouldered and deep chested and thin flanked and limbed like a greek athlete on he dashedonright on till they stood face to face and then with one quick blow into which as it seemed he put but little of his strength he hurled the burly cassius to the earth and fled with swift and noiseless steps into the deepest gloom perceiving on the instant the necessity of apprehending this now undoubted spy the fiery cethegus paused not one instant to look after his discomfited companions but rushed away on the traces of the fugitive who had perhaps gained at the very utmost a dozen paces start of him in that wild midnight racethat race for life and death the slave for such from his dark tunic he appeared to me was evidently both a swift and practised runner and well aware how great a stake was on his speed he now strained every muscle to escape while scarce less fleet and straining likewise every sinew to the utmost cethegus panted at his very heels before however they had run sixty yards one swifter than cethegus took up the race and bruised although he was and stunned and almost breathless when he started ere he had overtaken his staunch friend which he did in a space wonderfully brief he seemed to have shaken off every ailment and to be in the completest and most firm possession of all his wonted energies as he caught up cethegus he relaxed somewhat of his speed and ran on by his side for some few yards at a sort of springy trot speaking the while in a deep whisper hist he said histi am more swift of foot than thou and deeper winded leave me to deal with this dog back thou to him thou knowest of sore is he hurt i warrant me comfort him as thou best mayest and hurry whither we were now going tis late even nowtoo late i fear me much and doubtless we are waited for i have the heels of this same gallowsbird that can i see already leave me to deal with him and an he tells tales on us then call me liar already well nigh out of breath himself while the endurance of the fugitive seemed in nowise affected and aware of the vast superiority of his brother conspirators powers to his own cethegus readily enough yielded to his positive and reiterated orders and turning hastily backward gathered up the bruised and groaning cassius and led him with all speed toward the wellknown rendezvous in the house of laeca meanwhile with desperate speed that headlong race continued the gloomy alley was passed through the wider street into which it debouched vanished beneath their quick beating footsteps the dark and shadowy arch wherein the chief conspirator had lurked was threaded at full speed and still although he toiled till the sweat dripped from every pore like gouts of summer rain although he plied each limb till every overwrought sinew seemed to crack the hapless fugitive could gain no ground on his inveterate pursuer who cool collected and unwearied without one drop of perspiration on his dark sallow brow without one panting sob in his deep breath followed on at an equable and steady pace gaining not any thing nor seeming to desire to gain any thing while yet within the precincts of the populous and thicklysettled city but now they crossed the broad virbian street the slave distinctly visible for such as he glanced by a brightly decorated shrine girt by so many brilliant lamps as shewed its tenant idol to have no lack of worshippers darted up a small street leading directly towards the esquiline now now lisped cataline between his hardset teeth now he is mine past rescue up the dark filthy avenue they sped the fierce pursuer now gaining on the fugitive at every bound till had he stretched his arm out he might have seized him till his breath hot and strong waved the disordered elflocks that fell down upon the bare neck of his flying victim and now the low wall of the plebeian burying ground arose before them shaded by mighty cypresses and overgrown with tangled ivy at one wild bound the hunted slave leaped over it into the trackless gloom at one wild bound the fierce pursuer followed him scarcely a yard asunder they alighted on the rank grass of that charnel grove and not three paces did they take more ere cataline had hurled his victim to the earth and cast himself upon him choking his cries for help by the compression of his sinewy fingers which grasped with a tenacity little inferior to that of an iron vice the miserable wretchs gullet he snatched his poniard from his sheath reared it on high with a well skilled and steady hand down it came noiseless and unseen for there was not a ray of light to flash along its polished blade down it came with almost the speed and force of the electric fluid a deep dull heavy sound was heard as it was plunged into the yielding flesh and the hot gushing blood spirted forth in a quick jet into the very face and mouth of the fell murderer a terrible convulsion a fierce writhing spasm followedso strong so muscularly powerful that the stern gripe of cataline was shaken from the throat of his victim and from his daggers hilt in the last agony the murdered man cast off his slayer from his breast started erect upon his feet tore out from the deep wound the fatal weapon which had made it hurled it farfar as his remaining strength permittedinto the rayless night burst forth into a wild and yelling cry half laughter and half imprecation fell headlong to the earthwhich was no more insensible than he what time he struck it to any sense of mortal pain or sorrowand perished there alone unpitied and unaided habethe hath it muttered cataline quoting the wellknown expression of the gladiatorial strife he hath itbut all the plagues of erebus light on itmy good stiletto lies near to him in the swart darkness to testify against me nor by great hecate is there one chance to ten of finding it well be it so he added turning upon his heel be it so for most like it hath fallen in the deep long grass where none will ever find it and if they do i care not and with a reckless and unmoved demeanor well pleased with his success and casting not one retrospective thought toward his murdered victim not one repentant sigh upon his awful crime he too hurried away to join his dread associates at their appointed meeting chapter ii the measures for what then do they pause an hour to strike marino faliero the hours of darkness had already well nigh passed and but for the thick stormclouds and the drizzling rain some streaks of early dawn might have been seen on the horizon when at the door of marcus laeca in the low grovelling street of the scythemakersstrange quarter for the residence of a patrician one of the princely porciithe archconspirator stood still and glared around with keen suspicious eyes after his hurried walk it was however yet as black as midnight nor in that wretched and base suburb tenanted only by poor laborious artizans was there a single artificial light to relieve the gloom of nature the house of laeca how little would the passerby who looked in those days on its walls decayed and mossgrown even then and moulderinghow little would he have imagined that its fame would go down to the latest ages imperishable through its owners infamy the house of laeca the days had been while rome was yet but young when it stood far aloof in the gay green fields the suburban villa of the proud porcian house time passed and fashions changed low streets and squalid tenements supplanted the rich fields and fruitful orchards which had once rendered it so pleasant an abode its haughty lords abandoned it for a more stately palace nigh the forum and for long years it had remained tenantless voiceless desolate but dice and wine and women mad luxury and boundless riot had brought its owner down to indigence and infamy and sin the palace passed away from its inheritor the ruin welcomed its last lord and here meet scene for orgies such as it beheld romes parricides were wont to hold their murderous assemblies with a slow stealthy tread that woke no echo cataline advanced to the door there was no lamp in the cell of the atriensis no sign of wakefulness in any of the casements yet at the first slight tap upon the stout oaken pannel although it was scarce louder than the plash of the big raindrops from the eaves another tap responded to it from within so faint that it appeared an echo of the other the rebel counted as fast as possible fifteen and then tapped thrice as he had done before meeting the same reply a repetition of his own signal after a moments interval a little wicket opened in the door and a low voice asked who in the same guarded tone the answer was returned cornelius again the voice asked which and instantly as cataline replied the third the door flew open and he entered the atrium or wide hall in which he stood was all in utter darkness there was no light on the altar of the penates which was placed by the impluviuma large shallow tank of water occupying the centre of the hall in all roman housesnor any gleam from the tablinum or closed gallery beyond parted by heavy curtains from the audience chamber there were no stars to glimmer through the opening in the roof above the central tank yet the quick eye of the conspirator perceived upon the instant that two strong men with naked swords their points within a hands breadth of his bosom stood on each side of the doorway the gate was closed as silently as it had given him entrance was barred and bolted and till then no word was interchanged when all however was secure a deep rich voice suppressed into a whisper exclaimed sergius ay answered cataline come on and without farther parley they stole into the most secret chambers of the house fearful as it appeared of the sounds of their own footsteps much more of their own voices thus with extreme precaution when they had traversed several chambers among which were an indoor triclinium or dining parlor and a vast picture gallery groping their way along in utter darkness they reached a small square court surrounded by a peristyle or colonnade containing a dilapidated fountain passing through this they reached a second dining room where on the central table they found a small lamp burning and by the aid of this though still observing the most scrupulous silence quickly attained their destinationa low and vaulted chamber entirely below the surface of the ground accessible only by a stair defended by two doors of unusual thickness that was a fitting place for deeds of darkness councils of desperation such as they held who met within its gloomy precincts the moisture which dripped constantly from its groined roof of stone had formed stalactites of dingy spar whence the large gouts plashed heavily on the damp pavement the walls were covered with green slimy mould the atmosphere was close and foetid and so heavy that the huge waxen torches four of which stood in rusty iron candelabra on a large slab of granite burned dim and blue casting a faint and ghastly light on lineaments so grim and truculent or so unnaturally excited by the dominion of all hellish passions that they had little need of anything extraneous to render them most hideous and appalling there were some twentyfive men present variously clad indeed and of all ages but evidentlythough many had endeavoured to disguise the fact by poor and sordid garmentsall of the higher ranks six or eight were among them who feared not nor were ashamed to appear there in the full splendor of their distinctive garb as senators prominent among whom was the most rash and furious of them all cethegus he at the moment when the archconspirator accompanied by laeca and the rest of those who had admitted him entered the vault was speaking with much energy and even fierceness of manner to three or four who stood apart a little from the rest with their backs to the door listening with knitted brows clenched hands and lips compressed and bloodless to his tremendous imprecations launched at the heads of all who were for any even the least delay in the accomplishment of their dread scheme of slaughter one among them was a large stately looking personage somewhat inclined to corpulence but showing many a sign of giant strength and vigor unimpaired by years or habit his head was large but well shaped with a broad and massive forehead and an eye keen as the eagles when soaring in his pride of place his nose was prominent but rather aquiline than roman his mouth wide and thicklipped with square and fleshy jaws was the worst feature in his face and indicative of indulged sensuality and fierceness if not of cruelty combined with the excess of pride this man wore the plain toga and white tunic of a private citizen but never did plebeian eye and lip flash with such concentrated haughtiness curl with so fell a sneer as those of that fallen consular of that degraded senator the haughtiest and most ambitious of a race never deficient in those qualities he who drunk with despairing pride and deceived to his ruin by the doubletongued sibylline prophecies aspired to be that third cornelius who should be master of the worlds mistress rome the others were much younger men for lentulus was at that period already past his prime and thesetwo more especially who looked mere boyshad scarcely reached youths threshold though their pale withered faces and brows seared deeply by the scorching brand of evil passions showed that in vice at least if not in years they had lived long already those two were senators in their full garniture the sons of servius sylla both beautiful almost as women with soft and feminine features and long curled hair and lips of coral from which in flippant and affected accents fell words and breathed desires that would have made the blood stop and turn stagnant at the heart of any one not utterly polluted and devoid of every humane feeling this little knot seemed fierce for action fiery and panting with that wolfish thirst to quench which blood must flow but all the rest seemed dumb and tonguetied and crestfallen the sullenness of fear brooded on every other face the torpor of despairing crime already in its own fancy baffled and detected had fallen on every other heart for at the farther end of the room whispering to his trembling hearers dubious and dark suspicions with terror on his tongue stood cassius exaggerating the adventures of the night such was the scene when cataline stalked into that bad conclave the fires of hell itself could send forth no more blasting glare than shot from his dark eyes as he beheld and read at half a glance their consternation bitter and blighting was the sneer upon his lip as he stood motionless gazing upon them for a little space then flinging his arm on high and striding to the table he dashed his hand upon it that it rang and quivered to the blow what are ye he said slowly in tones that thrilled to every heart so piercing was their emphasis menno by the gods men rush on death for glorywomen they risk it for their own their childrens or their lovers safetyslavesnay even these things welcome it for freedom or meet it with revenge less then than men than women slaves or beastsperish like cattle if ye will unbound but unresisting all armed but unavengedand yegreat gods i laugh to see your terrorblanched blank visages i laugh but loathe in laughing the destined dauntless sacrificers who would imbue your knives in senatorial consular gore kindle your altars on the downfallen capitol and build your temples on the wreck of empire ha do you start and does some touch of shame redden the sallow cheeks that courage had left bloodless and do ye grasp your daggers and rear your drooping heads are ye men once again why should ye not what do ye see what hear whereat to falter what oracle what portent now by the gods methought they spoke of victory and glory once more what do ye fear or wish what in the name of hecate and hades what do ye wait for a leader answered the rash cethegus excited now even beyond the bounds of ordinary rashness a day a place a signal have them then all replied the other still half scornfully lo i am here to lead the field of mars will give a place the consular elections an occasion the blood of cicero a signal be it so instantly replied cethegus be it so thou hast spoken as the times warrant boldly and upon my head be it that our deeds shall respond to thy daring words with equal daring and a loud hum of general assent succeeded to his stirring accents and a quick fluttering sound ran through the whole assemblage as every man released from the constraint of deep and silent expectation altered his posture somewhat and drew a long breath at the close but the conspirator paused not he saw immediately the effect which had been made upon the minds of all by what had passed he perceived the absolute necessity of following that impulse up to action before by a revulsion no less sudden than the late change from despondency to fierceness their minds should again subside into the lethargy of doubt and dismay but say thou sergius he continued how shall it be and who shall strike the blow that is to seal romes liberty our vengeance first swear we answered cataline laeca the eagle and the bowl lo they are here my sergius answered the master of the house drawing aside a piece of crimson drapery which covered a small niche or recess in the wall and displaying by the movement a silver eagle its pinions wide extended and its talons grasping a thunderbolt placed on a pedestal under a small but exquisitely sculptured shrine of parian marble before the image there stood a votive lamp fed by the richest oils a mighty bowl of silver half filled with the red massic wine and many paterae or sacrificial vessels of a yet richer metal hear bird of mars and of quirinuscried cataline without a pause stretching his hands toward the glittering effigyhear thou and be propitious thou who didst alltriumphant guide a yet greater than quirinus to deeds of might and glory thou who wert worshipped by the charging shout of marius and consecrated by the gore of cimbric myriads thou who wert erst enshrined on the capitoline what time the proud patricians veiled their haughty crests before the conquering plebeian thou who shalt sit again sublime upon those ramparts meet aery for thine unvanquished pinion shalt drink again libations boundless libations of rich roman lifeblood hot from patrician hearts smoking from every kennel hear and receive our oathslisten and be propitious he spoke and seizing from the pedestal a sacrificial knife which lay beside the bowl opened a small vein in his arm and suffered the warm stream to gush into the wine while the red current was yet flowing he gave the weapon to cethegus and he did likewise passing it in his turn to the conspirator who stood beside him and he in like manner to the next till each one in his turn had shed his blood into the bowl which now mantled to the brim with a foul and sacrilegious mixture the richest vintage of the massic hills curdled with human gore then filling out a golden goblet for himself hear god of war cried cataline unto whose minister and omen we offer daily worship hear mighty mars the homicide and the avenger and thou most ancient goddess hear nemesis and hecate and hades and all ye powers of darkness furies and fates hear ye for unto ye we swear never to quench the torch never to sheath the brand till all our foes be prostrate till not one drop shall run in living veins of romes patricians till not one hearth shall warm one roof shall shelter till rome shall be like carthage and we like mighty marius lords and spectators of her desolation we swear we taste the consecrated cup and thus may his blood flow who shall for pity or for fear forgive or fail or falterhis own blood and his wifes and that of all his race forever may vultures tear their eyes yet fluttering with quick vision may wolves tug at their heartstrings yet strong with vigorous life may infamy be their inheritance and tartarus receive their spirits and while he spoke he sipped the cup of horror with unreluctant lips and dashed the goblet with the residue over the pedestal and shrine and there was not one there who shrank from that foul draught with ashy cheeks indeed but knitted brows and their lips reeking red with the abomination but fearless and unfaltering they pledged in clear and solemn tones each after each that awful imprecation and cast their goblets down that the floor swam in blood and grasped each others hands sworn comrades from that hour even to the gates of hell a long and impressive silence followed for every heart there even of the boldest recoiled as it were for a moment on itself not altogether in regret or fear much less in anything approaching to compunction or remorse but in a sort of secret horror that they were now involved beyond all hope of extrication beyond all possibility of turning back or halting and cataline endowed with almost superhuman shrewdness and himself quite immovable of purpose perceived the feelings that actuated all the otherswhich he felt not nor cared forand called on laeca to bring wine wine comrades he exclaimed pure generous noble wine to wash away the rank drops from our lips that are more suited to our blades to make our veins leap cheerily to the blythe inspiration of the god and last not least to guard us from the damps of this sweet chamber which alone of his bounteous hospitality our porcius has vouchsafed to us and on the instant the masterfor they dared trust no slavesbore in two earthen vases one of strong chian from the greek isle of the egean the other of falernian the fruitiest and richest of the italian wines not much unlike the modern sherry but having still more body and many cyathi or drinking cups but he brought in no water wherewith the more temperate ancients were wont to mix their heady wines even in so great a ratio as nine to one of the generous liquor fill now fill all cried cataline and with the word he drained a brimming cup rare liquor this my marcus he continued whence hadst thou this falernian tis of thine inmost brand i doubt not in whose consulship did it imbibe the smoke the first of caius marius fortyfour years a ripe age said cethegus but twill be better forty years hence strange by the gods that of the two best things on earth women and wine the nature should so differ the wine is crude still when the girl is mellow but it is ripe long after she is rotten by venusinterposed caeparius swearing the harlots oath rotten and in the lap of lamia but heard ye not asked cataline or hearing did ye not accept the omenin whose first consulship this same falernian jar was sealed marius by hercules an omen oh may it turn out well exclaimed the superstitious lentulus sayest thou my sura well drink we to the omen and may we to the valour and the principles of marius unite the fortunes of his rivalof alltriumphant sylla a burst of acclamations replied to the happy hit and seeing now his aim entirely accomplished cataline checked the revel their blood was up no fear of chilling counsels now then he said before we drink like boon companions let us consult like men there is need now of counsel that once finished fulvia awaits me interrupted cassius fulvia worth fifty revels and me sempronia lisped the younger and more beautiful of the twin sylla meanwhile exclaimed autronius let us comprehend so shall we need no farther meetingseach of which risks the awakening of suspicion and it may well be of discovery let us now comprehend that when the time comes we may all perform our duty speak to us therefore sergius no farther exhortation was required for coolly the conspirator arose to set before his desperate companions the plans which he had laid so deeply that it seemed scarcely possible that they should fail and not a breath or whisper interrupted him as he proceeded were i not certain of the men he said to whom i speak i could say many things that should arouse you so that you should catch with fiery eagerness at aught that promised a more tolerable position i could recount the luxuries of wealth which you once knew the agonies of poverty beneath which to no purpose you lie groaning i could point out your actual inability to live however baselydeprived of character and creditdevoid of any relics of your fortunes weighed to the very earth by debts the interest alone of which has swallowed up your patrimonies and gapes even yet for more fettered by bailbonds to fly which is infamy and to abide them ruin shunned scorned despised and hated if not feared by all men i could paint to your very eyes ourselves in rags or fetters our enemies in robes of office seated on curule chairs swaying the fate of nations dispensing by a nod the wealth of plundered provinces i could reverse the picture but as it is your present miseries and your past deeds dissuade me your hopelessness and daring your wrongs and valor your injuries and thirst of vengeance warn me alike that words are weak and exhortation needless now understand with me how matters stand the stake for which we play is fair before your eyeslearn how our throw for it is certain the consular elections as you all well know will be held as proclaimed already on the fifteenth day before the calends of november my rivals are sulpicius muraena and silanus antonius and cicero will presidethe first my friend a bold and noble roman he waits but an occasion to declare for us now mark me caius manliusyou all do know the man an old and practised soldier a scarseamed veteran of syllawill on that very day display yon eagle to twenty thousand men well armed and brave and desperate as ourselves at fiesole septimius of camerinum writes from the picene district that thirty thousand slaves will rise there at his bidding while caius julius sent to that end into apulia has given out arms and nominated leaders to twice five thousand there ere this they have received my mandate to collect their forces and to march on that same day toward rome three several armies to meet which there is not one legion on this side of cisalpine gaul what then even if all were peace in rome what then could stand against us but there shall be that done here here in the very seat and heart as i may say of empire that shall dismay and paralyse all who would else oppose us cethegus when the centuries are all assembled in the field of mars with fifteen hundred gladiators well armed and exercised even now sets on the guard in the janiculum and beats their standard down then while all is confusion statilius and gabinius with their householdswhom his work done cethegus will join straightwaywill fire the city in twelve several places break open the prison doors and crying liberty to slaves and abolition of all debtsrush diverse throughout the streets still gathering numbers as they go meanwhile with lentulus and cassius the clients of your houses being armed beneath their togas with swords and breastplates and casques ready to be donned i will make sure of cicero and the rest havoc and slaughter and flames every where will make the city ours then ye who have no duty set hear and mark this always to kill is to do something the more and nobler so much the better deed remembering this that sons have ready access to their sires who for the most part are their bitterest foes and that to spare none we are swornhow and how deeply it needs not to remind you more words are bootless since to all here it must be evident that these things planned thus far with deep and prudent council once executed with that dauntless daring which alone stands for armor and for weapons and by the gods for bulwarks of defence must win us liberty and glory more over wealth and luxury and power in which names is embraced the sum of all felicity therefore now i exhort you not for if the woes which you would shun the prizes which you shall attain exhort you not all words of man all portents of the gods are dumb and voiceless and in vain mark the day only and remember that if not ye at least your sires were romans and were men bravely my sergius hast thou spoken and well done cried at once several voices of the more prominent partisans by the gods what a leader whispered longinus cassius to his neighbor fabius in council cried cethegus marcellus in the field moreover fellowsoldiers exclaimed lentulus hear this although he join not with us now through policy antonius the consul is in heart ours and waits but for the first success to declare himself for the cause in arms crassus the richcaesar the peoples idolhave heard our counsels and approve them the first blow struck their influence their names their riches and their popularity strike with ustrustier friends by pollux and more potent than fifty thousand swordsmen a louder and more general burst of acclamation and applause than that which had succeeded catalines address burst from the lips of all as those great names dropped from the tongue of lentulus and one voice cried aloudit was the voice of curius intoxicated as it were with present triumph by all the gods rome is our own our own even now to portion out among our friends our mistresses our slaves not romebut romes inheritance the world exclaimed another if we win all the universe is oursand see how small the stake when if we fail by hades well not fail cataline interrupted him in his deep penetrating tones we cannot and we will not and now for i wax somewhat weary we will break up this conclave we meet at the comitia and the slave whispered cethegus with an inquiring accent in his earthe slave my sergius will tell no tales of us replied the other with a hoarse laugh unless it be to lamia thus they spoke as they left the house and ere the day had yet begun to glimmer with the first morning twilightso darkly did the clouds still muster over the mighty citywent on their different ways toward their several homes unseen and as they fondly fancied unsuspected chapter iii the lovers fair lovers ye are fortunately met midsummer nights dream on the same night and almost at the same hour of the night wherein that dreadful conclave was assembled at the house of laeca a small domestic group consisting indeed only of three individuals was gathered in the tablinum or saloon of an elegant though modest villa situate in the outskirts of the city fronting the street that led over the mulvian bridge to the aemilian way and having a large garden communicating in the rear with the plebeian cemetery on the esquiline it was a gay and beautiful apartment of small dimensions but replete with all those graceful objects those manifold appliances of refined taste and pleasure for which the romans austere and poor no longer had since their late acquaintance with athenian polish and oriental luxury acquired a predilectionominous as their sterner patriots fancied of personal degeneracy and national decay divided from the hall of reception by thick soft curtains woven from the choice wool of calabria and glowing with the richest hues of the tyrian crimson and curtained with hangings of the same costly fabric around the windows both of which with the doorway opened upon a peristyle that little chamber wore an air of comfort that charmed the eye more even than its decorations yet these were of no common order for the floor was tesselated in rare patterns of mosaic work showing its exquisite devices and bright colors where they were not concealed by a footstool of embroidered tapestry the walls were portioned out into compartments each framed by a broad border of gilded scrollwork on a crimson ground and containing an elaborately finished fresco painting which could they have been seen by any critical eye of modern days would have set at rest for ever the question as to the state of this art among the ancients the subject was a favorite one with all artists of all agesfrom the worldfamous iliad the story of the goddessborn achilles here tutored by the wise centaur chiron in horsemanship and archery and all that makes a hero here tearing off the virgin mitre to don the glittering casque proffered with sword and buckler among effeminate wares by the disguised ulysses there wandering in the despondent gloom of injured pride along the stormy sea meet listener to his haughty sorrows while in the distance turning her tearful eyes back to her lord briseis went unwilling at the behest of the unwilling heralds again he was presented mourning with frantic grief over the corpse of his beloved patroclusgrief that called up his nereid mother from the blue depths of her native element and in the last chasing with unexampled speed the flying hector who stunned and destined by the gods to ruin dared not await his onset while priam veiled his face upon the ramparts and hecuba already tore her hair presaging the destruction of troys invincible unshaken column a small wood fire blazed cheerfully upon the hearth round which were clustered in uncouth attitudes of old etruscan sculpture the grim and grotesque figures of the household gods two lamps of bronze each with four burners placed on tall candelabra exquisitely carved in the same metal diffused a soft calm radiance through the room accompanied by an aromatic odor from the perfumed vegetable oil which fed their light upon a circular table of darkgrained citrean wood inlaid with ivory and silver were several rolls of parchment and papyrus the books of the day some of them splendidly emblazoned and illuminated a lyre of tortoiseshell and near to it the slender plectrum by which its cords were wakened to melody two or three little flasks of agate and of onyx containing some choice perfumes a tuscan vase full of freshgathered flowers and several articles yet more decidedly feminine were scattered on the board needles and thread of various hues and twine of gold and silver and some embroidery half finished and as it would seem but that instant laid aside such was the aspect of the saloon wherein three persons were sitting on that night who though they were unconscious nay even unsuspicious of the existence of conspiracy and treason were destined ere many days should elapse to be involved in its desperate mazes to act conspicuous parts and undergo strange perils in the dread drama of the times they were of different years and sexone a magnificent and stately matron such as romes matrons were when rome was at the proudest already well advanced in years yet still possessing not merely the remains of former charms but much of real beauty and that too of the noblest and most exalted order her hair which had been black in her youth as the ravens wing was still though mixed with many a line of silver luxuriant and profuse as ever simply and closely braided over her broad and intellectual temples and gathered into a thick knot behind it displayed admirably the contour of her head and suited the severe and classic style of her strictly roman features the straightcut eyebrows the clear and piercing eye the aquiline nose and the firm thin lips spoke worlds of character and decision yet that which might have otherwise seemed stern and even harsh was softened by a smile of singular sweetness and by a lighting up of the whole countenance which at times imparted to those high features an expression of benevolence gentle and feminine in the extreme her stature was well suited to the style of her lineaments majestically tall and stately and though attenuated something by the near approach of old age preserving still the soft and flowing outlines of a form which had in youth been noted for roundness and voluptuous symmetry she wore the plain white robes bordered and zoned with crimson of a patrician lady but save one massive signet on the third finger of her right hand she had no gem or ornament whatever and as she sat a little way aloof from her younger companions drawing the slender threads with many a graceful motion from the revolving distaff into the basket by her side she might have passed for her whose proud prayer that she might be known not as the daughter of the scipios but as the mother of the gracchi was but too fatally fulfilled in the deathearned celebrity of those her boasted jewels the other lady was smaller slighter fairer and altogether so different in mien complexion stature and expression that it was difficult even for those who knew them well to believe that they were a mother and her only child for even in her flush of beauty the elder lady while in the full splendor of italian womanhood must ever have been calculated to inspire admiration not all unmixed with awe rather than tenderness or love the daughter on the other hand was one whose every gesture smile word glance bespoke that passion latent in itself which it awakened in the bosom of all beholders slightly above the middle stature and with a waist of scarce a spans circumference her form was exquisitely full and rounded the sweeping outlines of her snowwhite and dimpled arms bare to the shoulders and set off by many strings of pearl which were themselves scarcely whiter than the skin on which they rested the swanlike curvature of the dazzling neck the wavy and voluptuous development of her bust shrouded but not concealed by the plaits of her white linen stola fastened on either shoulder by a clasp of golden fillagree and gathered just above her hips by a gilt zone of the grecian fashion the small and shapely foot which peered out with its jewelled sandal under her goldfringed draperies combined to present to the eye a very incarnation of that ideal loveliness which haunts enamored poets in their dreams the girl just bursting out of girlhood the glowing hebe of the soft and sunny south but if her form was lovely how shall the pen of mortal describe the wild romantic beauty of her soulspeaking features the rich redundancy of her dark auburn hair black where the shadows rested on it as the sable locks of night but glittering out wherever a wandering ray glanced on its glossy surface like the bright tresses of aurora the broad and marble forehead the pencilled brows and the large liquid eyes fraught with a mild and lustrous languor the cheeks pale in their wonted mood as alabaster yet eloquent at times with warm and passionate blushes the lips redder than aught on earth which shares both hue and softness and more than all the deep and indescribable expression which genius prints on every lineament of those who claim that rarest and most godlike of endowments she was a thing to dream of not describe to dream of in some faint and breathless eve of early summer beside the margin of some haunted streamlet beneath the shade of twilight boughs in which the fitful breeze awakes that whispering melody believed by the poetic ancients to be the chorus of the woodnymph to dream of and adoreeven as she was adored by him who sat beside her and watched each varying expression that swept across her speaking features and hung upon each accent of the low silvery voice as if he feared it were the last to which his soul should thrill responsive he was a tall and powerful youth of twentyfour or five years yet though his limbs were sinewy and lithe and though his deep round chest thin flanks and muscular shoulders gave token of much growing strength it was still evident that his stature having been prematurely gained he lacked much of that degree of power of which his frame gave promise for though his limbs were well formed they were scarcely set or furnished as we should say in speaking of an animal and the strength which he in truth possessed was that of elasticity and youthful vigor capable rather of violent though brief exertion than that severe and trained robustness which can for long continuous periods sustain the strongest and most trying labor his hair was dark and curlinghis eye bright clear and penetrating yet was its glance at times wavering and undetermined such as would indicate perhaps a want of steadiness of purpose not of corporeal resolution for that was disproved by one glance at the decided curve of his bold cleancut mouth and the square outlines of his massive jaw which seemed almost to betoken fierceness there was a quick short flash at times keen as the falcons in the unsteady eye that told of energy enough within and stirring spirit to prompt daring deeds the momentary irresolution conquered there was a frank and cheery smile that oftentimes belied the auguries drawn from the other features and more than all there was a tranquil sweet expression which now and then pervaded the whole countenance altering for the better its entire character and betokening more mind and deeper feelings than would at first have been suspected from his aspect his dress was the ordinary tunic of the day of plain white woollen stuff belted about the middle by a girdle which contained his ivory tablets and the metallic pencil used for writing on their waxed surface together with his handkerchief and purse but nothing bearing the semblance of a weapon not so much even as a common knife his legs and arms were bare his feet being protected merely by sandals of fine leather having the clasps or fibulae of gold as was the buckle of his girdle and one huge signet ring which was his only ornament his toga which had been laid aside on entering the saloon as was the custom of the romans in their own families or among private friends hung on the back of an armed chair of ample size and fine material but undistinguished by the marks of senatorial or equestrian rank such was the aspect such the bearing of the youth who might be safely deemed the girls permitted suitor from his whole air and manner as he listened to the soft voice of his beautiful mistress for as they sat there side by side perusing from an illuminated scroll the elegies of some longperished longforgotten poet now reading audibly the smooth and honeyed lines now commenting with playful criticism on the style or carrying out with all the fervor and romance of young poetical temperament the half obscure allusions of the bard no one could doubt that they were lovers especially if he marked the calm and wellpleased smile that stole from time to time across the proud features of that patrician lady who sitting but a little way apart watchedwhile she reeled off skein after skein of the fine byssine flax in silencethe quiet happiness of the young pair thus had the evening passed not long nor tediously to any of the party and midnight was at hand when there entered from the atrium a greyheaded slave bearing a tray covered with light refreshmentsfresh herbs endive and mallows sprinkled with snow ripe figs eggs and anchovies dried grapes and cakes of candied honey while two boys of rare beauty followed one carrying a flagon of chian wine diluted with snow water the other a platter richly chased in gold covered with cyathi or drinking cups some of plain chrystal some of that unknown myrrhine fabric which is believed by many scholars to have been highly vitrified and halftransparent porcelain a second slave brought in a folded stand like a camp stool in shape on which the tray was speedily deposited while on a slab of parian marble near which the two boys took their stand the wine and goblets were arranged in glittering order so silently however was all this done that their preparations made the elder slaves had retired with a deep genuflexion leaving the boys only to administer at that unceremonious banquet ere the young couple whose backs were turned towards the table perceived the interruption the brilliant smile which has been mentioned beamed from the features of the elder lady as she perceived how thoroughly engrossed even to the unconsciousness of any passing sound they were whom rising for the purpose and laying by her work she now proceeded to recall to sublunary matters paullus she said and you my julia ye are unconscious how the fleeting hours have slipped away the night hath far advanced into the third watch i would not part ye needlessly nor over soon especially when you must so soon perforce be severed but we must not forget how long a homeward walk awaits our dear arvina come then and partake some slight refreshment before you say farewell how thoughtless in me to have detained you thus and with a mile to walk this murky and unpleasant night they say too that the streets are dangerous of late haunted by dissolute nightrevellersthat villain clodius and his infamous comates i tremble like a leaf if i but meet them in broad dayand what if you should fall in with them when flushed with wine and ripe for any outrage fie dear one fie answered the young man with a smilea sorry soldier wouldst thou make of me who am within so short a space to meet the savages of pontus under our mighty pompey there is no danger julia here in the heart of rome and my stout freedman thrasea awaits me with his torch nor is it so far either to my house for those who cross as i shall do the cemetery on the esquiline tis but a step across the sumptuous carinae to the caelian but surely surely paul exclaimed the lovely girl laying her hand upon his arm thou wouldst not cross that fearful buryingground haunted by all things awful and obscene thus at the dead of night oh do not dearest she continued thou knowest not what wild terrible tales are rife of sounds and sights unnatural and superhuman encountered in those loathsome precincts tis a mere tempting of the dark ones to brave the horrors of that place the gods my julia replied the youth unmoved by her alarm the gods are never absent from their votaries so they be innocent and pure of spirit for me i am unconscious of a wilful fault and fear not anything well said paullus arvina exclaimed the elder lady and worthily of your descent from the caeciliifor from that noble house his family indeed derived its origin but although i she added counsel you not to heed our julias girlish terrors i love you not to walk by night so slenderly accompanied ho boy go summon me the steward and bid him straightway arm four of the thracian slaves no by the gods hortensia the young man interrupted her his whole face flushing with excitement you do shame to my manhood by your caution there is in truth no shadow of danger besides he added laughing at his own impetuosity i shall be far beyond the esquiline ere excellent old davus could rouse those sturdy knaves of yours or find the armory key for lo i will but tarry to taste one cup of your choice of chian to my julias health and then straight homeward have a care my fair boy that flagon is too heavy to be lifted safely by such small hands as thine and its contents too precious to be wasted soh thats well done thoult prove a second ganymede health julia and good dreamsmay all fair things attend thee until we meet again and when shall that be paul whispered his mistress a momentary flush shooting across brow neck and bosom as she spoke and leaving her a second afterward even paler than her wont between anxiety and fear and the pain even of this temporary partingwhen shall that be tomorrow surely tomorrow fairest he replied clasping her little hand with a fond pressure unless which may the gods avert anything unforeseen prevent me give me my toga boy he added and see if thrasea waits and if his torch be lighted bid him come hither geta hortensia interposed addressing the boy as he left the room and tell old davus to accompany him bringing the keys of the peristyle and of the garden gate so shalt thou gain the esquiline more easily her orders were obeyed as soon as they were spoken and but few moments intervened before the aged steward and the freedman with his staff and torch the latter so prepared by an art common to the ancients as to set almost any violence of wind or rain at defiance stood waiting their commands familiar and kind words were interchanged between those highborn ladies and the trustworthy follower of young arvina for those were days when no cold etiquette fettered the freedom of the tongue and when no rank how stately or how proud soever induced austerity of bearing or haughtiness toward inferiors and these concluded greetings briefer but far more warm followed between the master and his intended bride sweet slumbers julia and a happy wakening attend you farewell hortensia both of ye farewell and passing into the colonnade through the door which davus had unlocked he drew the lappet of his toga over his head after the fashion of a hood to shield it from the drizzling rainfor except on a journey the hardy romans never wore any hat or headgearand hastened with a firm and regular step along the marble peristyle this portico or rather piazza enclosed by a double row of tuscan columns a few small flower beds and a fountain springing high in the air from the conch of a triton and falling back into a large shell of white marble which it was so contrived as to keep ever full without at any time overflowing beyond this was a summer triclinium or dining room facing the north and provided with the threesided couch from which it took its name embracing a circular table through this they passed into a smaller court adorned like the other by a jet deau surrounded by several small boudoirs and bed chambers luxuriously decorated which were set apart to the use of the females of the family and guarded night and day by the most trusty of the slaves hence a strong door gave access to a walled space throughout the length of which on either hand ran a long range of offices and above them the dormitories of the slaves with a small porters lodge or guard room by the gate opening on the orchard in the rear therein were stationed the four thracians mentioned by hortensia whose duty it was to keep watch alternately over the safety of the postern although the key was not entrusted to their charge and he whose watch it was started up from a bench on which he had been stretched and looked forth torch in hand at the sound of approaching footsteps seeing however who it was and that the steward attended him he lent his aid in opening the postern and reverently bowed the knee to arvina as he departed from the hospitable villa the orchard through which lay his onward progress occupied a considerable extent of ground laid out in terraces adorned with marble urns and statues long bowery walks sheltered by vineclad trellices and rows of fruit trees interspersed with many a shadowy clump of the rich evergreen holmoak the tufted stonepine the clustering arbutus and smoothleaved laurestinus this lovely spot was separated from the plebeian cemetery onlyas has been said alreadyby a low wall and therefore in those days of universal superstition of the lower orders and the slaves and many too of their employers would have eschewed it as a place ominous of evil if not unsafe and perilous the mind of paul however if not entirely free from any touch of superstitious awe which at that period of the world would have been a thing altogether unnatural and impossible was at least of too firm a mould to shake at mere imaginary terrors and he strode on lighted by his torchbearer through the dark mazes of the orchard with all his thoughts engrossed by the pleasant reminiscences of the past evening thoughtless however as he was and bold he yet recoiled a step and the blood rushed tumultuously to his heart as a loud yelling cry protracted strangely and ending in a sound midway between a groan and a burst of horrid laughter rose awfully upon the silent night and it required an effort to man his heart against a feeling which crept through him nearly akin to fear but with the freedman thrasea it was a very different matter for he shook so much with absolute terror that he had well nigh dropped the torch while drawing nearer to his masters side with teeth that chattered as if in an ague fit and a face deserted by every particle of color he besought him in faltering accents by all the gods to turn back instantly lest evil might come of it his entreaties were however of no avail with the brave youth who in a moment had shaken off his transitory terror and was now resolute not only to proceed on his homeward route but to investigate the cause and meaning of the outcry silence he said somewhat sternly in answer to the reiterated prayers of the trembling servitor silence and follow idiot that was no superhuman voiceno yell of nightly lemures but the deathcry if i err not more widely of some frail mortal like ourselves there may be time however yet to save him and i so truly marked the quarter whence it rose that i doubt not we may discover him advance the light lo we are at the wall lower thy torch now that i may undo the wicket give me thy club and keep close at my heels bearing the flambeau high and with the words he strode out rapidly into the wide desolate expanse of the plebeian grave yard it was a broad bleak space comprising the whole table land and southern slope of the esquiline hill broken with many deep ravines and gulleys worn by the wintry rains covered with deep rank grass and stunted bushes with here and there a grove of towering cypresses or dark funereal yews casting a deeper shadow over the gloomy solitude so rough and broken was the surface of the ground so numerous the low mounds which alone covered the ashes of the humbler dead that they were long in reaching the vicinity of the spot where that fell deed had been done so recently when they had come however to the foot of the descent where it swept gently downward to the boundary wall the young man took the torch from his attendant and waving it with a slow movement to and fro surveyed the ground with close and narrow scrutiny he had not moved in this manner above a dozen paces before a bright quick flash seemed to shoot up from the long thick herbage as the glare of the torch passed over it another step revealed the nature and the cause of that brief gleam a ray had fallen full on the polished blade of catalines stiletto which lay where it had been cast by the expiring effort of the victim hilt downward in the tangled weeds he seized it eagerly but shuddered as he beheld the fresh dark gore curdling on the broad steel and clotted round the golden guard of the rich weapon ha he exclaimed i am right thrasea foul murder hath been done here let us look farther several minutes now were spent in searching every foot of ground and prying even into the open vaults of several broken graves for at first they had taken a wrong direction in the gloom quickly however seeing that he was in error arvina turned upon his traces and was almost immediately successful for there scarce twenty feet from the spot where he had found the dagger with his grim gory face turned upward as if reproachfully to the dark quiet skies the black deathsweat still beaded on his frowning brow and a sardonic grin distorting his pale lips lay the dead slave flat on his back with his arms stretched out right and left his legs extended close together to their full length he lay even as he had fallen for not a struggle had convulsed his limbs after he struck the earth life having actually fled while he yet stood erect battling with all the energies of soul and body against mans latest enemy the bosom of his gray tunic rent asunder displayed the deep gash which had let out the spirit whence the last drops of the thick crimson lifeblood were ebbing with a slow halfstagnant motion on this dread sight paul was still gazing in that motionless and painful silence with which the boldest cannot fail to look upon the body of a fellow creature from which the immortal soul has been reluctantly and forcefully expelled when a loud cry from thrasea who having lagged a step or two behind was later in discovering the corpse aroused him from his melancholy stupor alas alas ah me cried the halfsobbing freedman my friend my more than friend my countryman my kinsman medon ha dost thou recognize the features didst thou know him who lies so coldly and inanimately here before us cried the excited youth whose slave was he speak thrasea on thy life this shall be looked to straightway and by the gods avenged as i would recognize mine own in the polished brass as i do know my fathers sisters son for such was he who lies thus foully slaughtered alas alas my countryman wo wo for thee my medon many a day alas many a happy day have we two chased the elk and urus by the darkwooded danube the same roof covered us the same board fed the same fire warmed us nay the same fatal battlefield robbed both of liberty and country yet were the great gods merciful to the poor captives thy father did buy me arvina and a few years of light and pleasant servitude restored the slave to freedom medon was purchased by the wise consul cicero and was to have received his freedom at the next saturnalia alas and wo is me he is now free forever from any toils on earth from any mortal master nay weep not so my thrasea exclaimed the generous youth laying his left hand with a friendly pressure on the freedmans shoulder thou shalt have all means to do all honor to his name all that can now be done by mortals for the revered and sacred dead aid me now to remove the body lest those who slew him may return and carry off the evidences of their crime thus speaking he thrust the unlighted end of the torch into the ground and lifting up the shoulders of the carcase while thrasea raised the feet bore it away a hundred yards or better and laying it within the open archway of an old tomb covered the mouth with several boughs torn from a neighboring cypress then satisfied that it would thus escape a nearer search than it was likely would be made by the murderers when they should find that it had been removed he walked away very rapidly toward his home before he left the burial ground however he wiped the dagger carefully in the long grass and hid it in the bosom of his tunic no more words were exchangedthe master buried in deep thought the servant stupified with grief and terroruntil they reached the house of paullus in a fair quarter of the town near to the street of carinae the noblest and most sumptuous in rome a dozen slaves appeared within the hall awaiting the return of their young lord but he dismissed them all and when they had departed taking a small night lamp and ordering thrasea to waken him betimes tomorrow that he might see the consul he bade him be of good cheer for that medons death should surely be avenged since the gay dagger would prove a clue to the detection of his slayer then passing into his own chamber he soon lost all recollection of his hopes joys cares in the sound sleep of innocence and youth chapter iv the consul therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people coriolanus the morning was yet young when paullus arvina leaving his mansion on the caelian hill by a postern door so to avoid the crowd of clients who even at that early hour awaited his forthcoming in the hall descended the gentle hill toward the splendid street called carinae from some fanciful resemblance in its shape lying in a curved hollow between the bases of the esquiline caelian and palatine mounts to the keel of a galley this quarter of the city was at that time unquestionably the most beautiful in rome although it still fell far short of the magnificence it afterward attained when the favourite mecaenas had built his splendid palace and laid out his unrivalled gardens on the now woody esquiline and it would have been difficult indeed to conceive a view more sublime than that which lay before the eyes of the young patrician as he paused for a moment on the highest terrace of the hill to inhale the breath of the pure autumnal morning the sun already risen though not yet high in the east was pouring a flood of mellow golden light through the soft medium of the half misty atmosphere over the varied surface of the great city broken and diversified by many hills and hollows and bringing out the innumerable columns arches and aqueducts that adorned almost every street and square in beautiful relief the point at which the young man stood looking directly northward was one which could not be excelled if it indeed could be equalled for the view it commanded embracing nearly the whole of rome which from its commanding height inferior only to the capitol and the quirinal hill it was enabled to overlook before him in the hollow at his feet on which the morning rays dwelt lovingly streaming in through the deep valley to the right over the city walls lay the long street of the carinae the noblest and most sumptuous of rome adorned with many residences of the patrician order and among others those of pompey caesar and the great latin orator this broad and noble thoroughfare from its great width and the long rows of marble columns which decked its palaces all glittering in the misty sunbeams shewed like a waving line of light among the crowded buildings of the narrower ways that ran parallel to it along the valley and up the easy slope of the caelian mount with the minervium in which arvina stood leading directly downward to its centre beyond this sparkling line rose the twin summits oppius and cispius of the esquiline hill still decked with the dark foliage of the ancestral groves of oak and sweetchesnut said to derive their origin from servius tullius the sixth king of rome and green with the long grass and towering cypresses of the plebeian cemetery across which the young man had come home from the villa of his ladylove but a few hours before beyond the double hilltops a heavy purple shadow indicated the deep basin through which ran the illfamed suburra and the wickedstreet so named from the tradition that therein tullia compelled her trembling charioteer to lash his reluctant steeds over the yet warm body of her murdered father and beyond this again the lofty ridge of the quirinal mount stood out in fair relief with all its gorgeous load of palaces and columns and the great temple of the citys founder the god romulus quirinus and the stupendous range of walls and turrets along its northern verge flashing out splendidly to the newrisen sun so lofty was the post from which paullus gazed as he overlooked the mighty town that his eye reached even beyond the citywalls on the quirinal and passing over the broad valley at its northern base all glimmering with uncertain lights and misty shadows rested upon the collis hortulorum or mount of gardens now called monte pincio which was at that time covered as its name indicates with rich and fertile shrubberies the glowing hues of these could be distinctly made out even at this great distance by the naked eye for it must be remembered that there was in those days no seacoal to send up its murky smokewreaths blurring the bright skies with its inky pall no factories with tall chimnies vomiting forth like mimic etnas their pestilential breath fatal to vegetable life not a cloud hung over the great city and the charcoal sparingly used for cookery sent forth no visible fumes to shroud the daylight so that as the thin purplish haze was dispersed by the growing influence of the sunbeams every line of the far architecture even to the carved friezes of the thousand temples and the rich foliage of the marble capitals could be observed distinct and sharp as in a painted picture nor was this all the charm of the delicious atmosphere for so pure was it that the odours of that flowery hill wafted upon the wings of the light northern breeze blent with the coolness which they caught from the hundreds of clear fountains plashing and glittering in every public place came to the brow of the young noble more like the breath of some enchanted garden in the farfamed hesperides than the steam from the abodes of above a million of busy mortals before him still though inclining a little to the left hand lay a broader hollow presenting the long vista of the sacred way leading directly to the capitol and thence to the campus martius the green expanse of which bedecked with many a marble monument and brazen column and already studded with quick moving groups hurling the disc and javelin or reining the fierce warhorse with strong gaulish curbs lay soft and level for half a league in length till it was bounded far away by a gleaming reach of the blue tiber still to the left of this uprose the palatine the earliest settled of the hills of rome with the old walls of romulus and the low strawbuilt shed wherein that mighty son of mars dwelt when he governed his wild robberclan and the bidental marking the spot where lightning from the monarch of olympus called on by undue rites consumed hostilius and his house were still preserved with reverential worship and on its eastern peak the timehonoured shrine of stator jove the ragged crest of this antique elevation concealed it is true from sight the immortal space below once occupied by the marsh of the velabrum but now filled by the grand basilicae and halls of justice surrounding the great roman forum with all their pomp of golden shields and monuments of mighty deeds performed in the earliest ages but it was far too low to intercept the view of the grand capitol and the tarpeian rock the gilded gates of bronze and the goldplated roof of the vast national templegoldplated at the enormous cost of twentyone thousand talents the rich spoil of carthagethe shrine of jupiter capitoline and juno and minerva sent back the sunbeams in lines too dazzling to be borne by any human eye and all the pomp of statues grouped on the marble terraces and guarding the ascent of the celebrated hundred steps glittered like forms of indurated snow such was the wondrous spectacle more like a fairy show than a real scene of earthly splendour to look on which arvina paused for one moment with exulting gladness before descending toward the mansion of the consul nor was that mighty panorama wanting in moving crowds and figures suitable to the romantic glory of its scenery here through the larger streets vast herds of cattle were driven in by mounted herdsmen lowing and trampling toward the forum here a concourse of men clad in the graceful toga the clients of some noble house were hastening along to salute their patron at his morning levee there again danced and sang with saffron colored veils and flowery garlands a band of virgins passing in sacred pomp toward some favourite shrine there in sad order swept along with mourners and musicians with women wildly shrieking and tearing their long hair and players and buffoons and liberated slaves wearing the cap of freedom a funeral procession bearing the body of some young victim as indicated by the morning hour to the funereal pile beyond the city walls and far off filing in with the spear heads and eagles of a cohort glittering above the dust wreaths by the flaminian way the train of some ambassador or envoy sent by submissive monarchs or dependent states to sue the favour and protection of the great roman people the blended sounds swept up in a confused sonorous murmur like the sea the shrill cry of the watercarriers and the wild chant of the choral songs and the keen clangour of the distant trumpets ringing above the din until the ears of the youth as well as his eyes were filled with present proofs of his native citys grandeur and his whole soul was lapped in the proud conscious joy arising from the thought that he too was entitled to that boastful name higher than any monarchs style of roman citizen fairest and noblest city of the universe cried the enthusiastic boy spreading his arms abroad over the glorious view which kindling all the powers of his imaginative mind had awakened something of awe and veneration long may the everliving gods watch over thee long may they guard thy liberties intact thy hosts unconquered long may thy name throughout the world be synonymous with all that is great and good and glorious long may the roman fortune and the roman virtue tread side by side upon the neck of tyrants and the whole universe stand mute and daunted before the presence of the sovereign people the sovereign slaves said a deep voice with a strangely sneering accent in his ear and as he started in amazement for he had not imagined that any one was near him cataline stood at his elbow under the mingled influence of surprise and bashfulness at being overheard and something not very far removed from alarm at the unexpected presence of one so famed for evil deeds as the man beside him arvina recoiled a pace or two and thrust his hand into the bosom of his toga disarranging its folds for a moment and suffering the eye of the conspirator to dwell on the hilt of a weapon which he recognized instantly as the stiletto he had lost in the struggle with the miserable slave on the esquiline no gleam in the eye of the wily plotter betrayed his intelligence no show of emotion was discoverable in his dark paleness but a grim smile played over his lips for a moment as he noted not altogether without a sort of secret satisfaction the dismay caused by his unexpected presence how now he said jeeringly before the smile had yet vanished from his illomened facewhat aileth the bold paullus that he should start like an unruly colt scared by a shadow from the approach of a friend a friend answered the young man in a half doubtful tone but instantly recovering himself ha cataline i was surprised and scarce saw who it was thou art abroad betimes this morning whither so early but what saidst thou about slaves i thought thou didst not know me replied the other and for the rest i am abroad no earlier than thou and am perhaps bound to the same place with thee by hercules i fancy not said paullus wherefore i pray thee not who knoweth perchance i go to pay my vows to jupiter upon the capitol perchance he added with a deep sneer to salute our most eloquent and noble consul a crimson flush shot instantly across the face and temples of arvina perceiving that he was tampered with and sounded only yet he replied calmly and with dignity thither indeed go i but i knew not that thou wert in so much a friend of cicero as to go visit him men sometimes visit those who be not their friends answered the other i never said he was a friend to me or i to him by the gods no i had lied else but what was that asked the youth moved by an inexplicable curiosity and excitement to learn something more of the singular being with whom chance had brought him into contact which thou didst say but now concerning slaves that all these whom we see before us and around us and beneath us are but a herd of slaves gulled and vainglorious slaves the roman people exclaimed paullus every tone of his voice every feature of his fine countenance expressing his unmitigated horror and astonishment the great unconquered roman people the lords of earth and sea from frosty caucasus to the twin rocks of hercules the tramplers on the necks of kings the arbiters of the whole world the roman people slaves most abject and most wretched to whom then cried the young man much excited to whom am i art thou a slave for we are also of the roman people the roman people and thou as one of them and i paullus caecilius are slaves one and all abject and base and spiritfallen slaves lacking the courage even to spurn against our fetters to the proud tyrannous rich aristocracy by the gods we are of it but not the less for that slaves to it answered cataline see from the lowest to the highest each petty pelting officer lords it above the next below him and if the tribunes for a while at rare and singular moments uplift a warning cry against the corrupt insolence of the patrician houses gold buys them back into vile treasonable silence patricians be we and not slaves sayest thou come tell me then did the patrician blood of the grand gracchi preserve them from a shameful doom because they dared to speak as freeborn men aloud and freely did his patrician blood save fulvius flaccus were publius antonius and cornelius sylla the less ejected from their offices that they were of the highest blood in rome the lawful consuls by the suffrage of the people was i the heir of sergius silos glory the less forbidden even to canvass for the consulship that my great grandsires blood was poured out like water upon those fields that witnessed romes extremest peril trebia and the ticinus and thrasymene and cannae was lentulus the noblest of the noble patrician of the eldest houses a consular himself expelled the less and stricken from the rolls of the degenerate senate for the mere whining of a mawkish wench because his name is cornelius tush tush these be but dreams of poets or imaginings of childrenthe commons be but slaves to the nobles the nobles to the senate the senate to their creditors their purchasers their consuls the last at once their tools and their tyrants go young man go salute cringe fawn upon your consul nathless for thou hast mind enough to mark and note the truth of what i tell thee thou wilt think upon this and perchance one day when the time shall have come wilt speak act strike for freedom and as he finished speaking he turned aside with a haughty gesture of farewell and wrapping his toga closely about his tall person stalked away slowly in the direction neither of the capitol nor of the consuls house turning his head neither to the right hand nor to the left and taking no more notice of the person to whom he had been speaking than if he had not known him to be there and gazing toward him halfbewildered in anxiety and wonder wonderful by the gods he said at last truly he is a wonderful man and wise withal i fain would know if all that be true which they say of himhis bitterness his impiety his bloodthirstiness by hercules he speaks well and it is true likewise yea true it is that we patricians and free as we style ourselves may not speak any thing or act against our order no nor indulge our private pleasures for fear of the proud censors is this then freedom true we are lords abroad our fleets our hosts everywhere victorious and not one land wherein the eagle has unfurled her pinion but bows before the majesty of romebut yetis it is it indeed true that we are but slaves sovereign slaves at home the whole tenor of the young mans thoughts was altered by the few words let fall for that very purpose by the arch traitor ever espying whom he might attach to his party by operating on his passions his prejudices his weakness or his pride a most sagacious judge of human nature reading the character of every man as it were in a written book cataline had long before remarked young arvina he had noted several points of his mental constitution which he considered liable to receive such impressions as he wouldhis proneness to defer to the thoughts of others his want of energetic resolution and not least his generous indignation against every thing that savored of cruelty or oppression he had resolved to operate on these whenever he might find occasion and should he meet success in his first efforts to stimulate his passions minister to his voluptuous pleasures corrupt his heart and make him in the end body and soul his own such were the intentions of the conspirator when he first addressed paullus his desire to increase the strength of his party to whom the accession of any member however humble of the great house of caecilii could not fail to be useful alone prompting him in the first instance but when he saw by the young mans startled aspect that he was prepossessed against him and had listened probably to the damning rumors which were rife everywhere concerning him a second motive was added in his pride of seduction and sophistry by which he was wont to boast that he could bewilder the strongest minds and work them to his will when by the accidental disarrangement of arvinas gown and the discovery of his own dagger he perceived that the intended victim of his specious arts was probably cognizant in some degree of his last nights crime a third and stronger cause was added in the instinct of selfpreservation and as soon as he found out that paullus was bound for the house of cicero he considered his life in some sort staked upon the issue of his attempt on arvinas principles no part could have been played with more skill or with greater knowledge of his character whom he addressed he said just enough to set him thinking and to give a bias and a colour to his thoughts without giving him reason to suspect that he had any interest in the matter and he had withdrawn himself in that careless and half contemptuous manner which naturally led the young man to wish for a renewal of the subject and in fact paul while walking down the hill toward the house of the consul was busied in wondering why cataline had left so much unsaid departing so abruptly and in debating with himself upon the strange doctrines which he had then for the first time heard broached it was about the second hour of the roman day corresponding nearly to eight oclock before noonas the winter solstice was now passedwhen arvina reached the magnificent dwelling of the consul in the carinae at the angle of the caerolian place hard by the foot of the sacred way this splendid building occupied a whole insula as it was called or space between four streets intersecting each other at right angles and was three stories in height the two upper supported by columns of marble with a long range of glass windows at that period an unusual and expensive luxury the doors stood wide open and on either hand the vestibule were arranged the lictors leaning upon their fasces while the whole space of the great corinthian hall within lighted from above and adorned with vast black pillars of lucullean marble was crowded with the white robes of the consuls plebeian clients tendering their morning salutations not unmixed with the crimson fringes and broad crimson facings of senatorial visitors many were there with gifts of all kinds countrymen from his sabine farm and his tusculan retreat some bringing lambs some cages full of doves cheeses and bowls of fragrant honey and robes of fine white linen the produce of their daughters looms for whom perchance they were seeking dowers at the munificence of their noble patron artizans of the city with toys or pieces of furniture lamps writing cases cups or vases of rich workmanship courtiers with manuscripts rarely illuminated the work of their most valuable slaves travellers with gems and bronzes offerings known to be esteemed beyond all others by the highminded lover of the arts and unrivalled scholar to whom they were presented these presents after being duly exhibited to the patron himself who was seated at the farther end of the hall concealed from the eyes of paullus by the intervening crowd were consigned to the care of the various slaves or freedmen who stood round their master and borne away according to their nature to the storerooms and offices or to the library and gallery of the consul while kind words and a courteous greeting and a consideration most ample and attentive even of the smallest matters brought before him awaited all who approached the orator whether he came empty handed or full of gifts to require an audience after a little while arvina penetrated far enough through the crowd to command a view of the consuls seat and for a time he amused himself by watching his movements and manner toward each of his visitors perhaps not altogether without reference to the conversation he had recently held with catiline and certainly not without a desire to observe if the tales he had heard of shameless bribery and corruption as practiced by many of the great officers of the republic had any confirmation in the conduct of cicero but he soon saw that the courtesies of that great and virtuous man were regulated neither by the value of the gifts offered nor by the rank of the visitors and that his personal predilections even were not allowed to interfere with the division of his time among all worthy of his notice thus he remarked that a young noble famed for his dissoluteness and evil courses although he brought an exquisite sculpture of praxiteles was received with the most marked and formal coldness and his gift which could not be declined consigned almost without eliciting a glance of approbation to the hand of a freedman while the next moment as an old whiteheaded countryman plainly and almost meanly clad although with scrupulous cleanliness approached his presence the consul rose to meet him and advancing a step or two took him affectionately by the hand and asked after his family by name and listened with profound consideration to the garrulous narrative of the good farmer who involved in some petty litigation had come to seek the advice of his patron until he sent him away happy and satisfied with the promise of his protection by and by his own turn arrived and although he was personally unknown to the orator and the assistance of the nomenclator who stood behind the curule chair was required before he was addressed by name he was received with the utmost attention the noble house to which the young man belonged being as famous for its devotion to the common weal as for the ability and virtue of its sons after a few words of ordinary compliment paullus proceeded to intimate to his attentive hearer that his object in waiting at his levee that morning was to communicate momentous information the thoughtful eye of the great orator brightened and a keen animated expression came over the features which had before worn an air almost of lassitude and he asked eagerly momentous to the republicto rome my good friendfor all his mind was bent on discovering the plots which he suspected even now to be in process against the state momentous to yourself consul answered arvina then will it wait returned the other with a slight look of disappointment and i will pray you to remain until i have spoken with all my friends here it will not be very long for i have seen nearly all the known faces if you are in the mean time addicted to the humane arts davus here will conduct you to my library where you shall find food for the mind or if you have not breakfasted my syrian will shew you where some of my youthful friends are even now partaking a slight meal accepting the first offer partly perhaps from a sort of pardonable hypocrisy desiring to make a favourable impression on the great man with whom he had for the first time spoken arvina followed the intelligent and civil freedman to the library which was indeed the favourite apartment of the studious magistrate and if he half repented as he went by the chamber wherein several youths of patrician birth one or two of whom nodded to him as he passed were assembled conversing merrily and jesting around a well spread board he ceased immediately to regret the choice he had made when the door was thrown open and he was ushered into the shrine of ciceros literary leisure the library was a small square apartment for it must be remembered that books at this time being multiplied by manual labor only and the art being comparatively rare and very costly the vast collections of modern times were utterly beyond the reach of individuals and a few scores of volumes were more esteemed than would be as many thousands now in these days of multiplying presses and steam power but although inconsiderable in size not being above sixteen feet square the decorations of the apartment were not to be surpassed or indeed equalled by anything of modern splendor for the walls divided into compartments by mouldings exquisitely carved and overlaid with burnished gilding were set with panels of thick plate glass glowing in all the richest hues of purple ruby emerald and azure through several squares of which the light stole in gorgeously tinted from the peristyle there being no distinction except in this between the windows and the other compartments of the wainscot if it may be so styled and of the ceiling which was finished in like manner with slabs of stained glass between the intersecting beams of gilded scroll work the floor was of beautiful mosaic partially covered by a footcloth woven from the finest wool and dyed purple with the juice of the cuttlefish and all the furniture corresponded both in taste and magnificence to the other decorations of the room a circular table of cedar wood inlaid with ivory and brass so that its value could not have fallen far short of ten thousand sesterces stood in the centre of the floorcloth with a bisellium or double settle wrought in bronze and two beautiful chairs of the same material not much dissimilar in form to those now used and to conclude a bookcase of polished maple wood one of the doors of which stood open displayed a rare collection of about three hundred volumes each in its circular case of purple parchment having the name inscribed in letters of gold silver or vermilion a noble bust in bronze of the phidian jupiter with the sublime expanse of brow the ambrosian curls and the beard loosely waving as when he shook olympus by his nod and the earth trembled and the depth of tartarus stood on a marble pedestal facing the bookcase and on the table beside writing materials leaves of parchment an ornamental lettercase a double inkstand and several reed pens were scattered many gems and trinkets signets and rings engraved in a style far surpassing any effort of the modern graver vases of onyx and cut glass and above all the statue of a beautiful boy holding a lamp of bronze suspended by a chain from his left hand and in his right the needle used to refresh the wick nurtured as he had been from his youth upward among the magnates of the land accustomed to magnificence and luxury till he had almost fancied that the world had nothing left of beautiful or new that he had not witnessed paul stood awhile after the freedman had departed gazing with mute admiration on the richness and taste displayed in all the details of this the scholars sanctum the very atmosphere of the chamber filled with the perfume of the cedar wood employed as a specific against the ravages of the moth and bookworm seemed to the young man redolent of midnight learning and the superb front of the presiding god calm in the grandeur of its ineffable benignity who appeared to his excited fancy to smile serene protection on the pursuits of the blameless consul inspired him with a sense of awful veneration that did not easily or quickly pass away for some moments as he gradually recovered the elasticity of his spirits he amused himself by examining the exquisitely wrought gems on the table but after a little while when cicero came not he crossed the room quietly to the bookshelves and selecting a volume of homer drew it forth from its richly embossed case and seating himself on the bronze settle with his back toward the door had soon forgotten where he was and the grave business which brought him thither in the sublime simplicity of the blind rhapsodist an hour or more elapsed thus yet paul took no note of time nor moved at all except to unroll with his right hand the lower margin of the parchment as he read while with the left he rolled up the top so that nearly the same space of the manuscript remained constantly before his eyes although the reader was continually advancing in the poem at length the door opened noiselessly and with a silent foot shod in the light slippers which the romans always wore when in the house cicero entered the apartment the consul was at this time in the very prime of intellectual manhood it having been decreed about a century before that no person should be elected to that highest office of the state who should not have attained his fortythird year he was a tall and elegantly formed man with nothing especially worthy of remark in his figure if it were not that his neck was unusually long and slender though not so much so as to constitute any drawback to his personal appearance which without being what would exactly be termed handsome was both elegant and graceful his features were not indeed very bold or striking but intellect was strongly and singularly marked in every line of the face and the expressioncalm thoughtful and serenethough it had not the quick and restless play of evervarying lights and shadows which belongs to the quicker and more imaginative temperaments among men of the highest geniuscould not fail to impress any one with the conviction that the mind which informed it must be of eminent capacity and depth and power he entered as i have said silently and although there was nothing of stealthiness in his gait which being very light and slow was yet both firm and springy nor any of that cunning in his manner which is so often coupled to a prowling footstep he yet advanced so noiselessly over the soft floorcloth that he stood at arvinas elbow and overlooked the page in which he was reading before the young man was aware of his vicinity ha he exclaimed after standing a moment and observing with a soft pleasant smile the abstraction of his visitor so thou readest greek and art thyself a poet a little of the first my consul replied arvina arising quickly to his feet with the ingenuous blood rushing to his brow at the detection but wherefore shouldst thou believe me the second we statesmen answered the consul are wont to study other mens characters as other men are wont to study books and i have learned by practice to draw quick conclusions from small signs but in this instance the light in your eye the curl of your expanded nostril the half frown on your brow and the flush on your cheek told me beyond a doubt that you are a poet and you are so young man i care not whether you have penned as yet an elegy or nonevertheless you are in soul in temperament in fantasy a poet do you love homer beyond all other writers i have ever met in my small course of reading there is a majesty a truth an everburning fire lustrous yet natural and most beneficent like the suns glory on a summer day in his immortal words that kindles and irradiates yet consumes not the soul a grand simplicity that never strains for effect a sweet pathos that elicits tears without evoking them a melody that flows on like the harmony of the eternal sea or if we may call fancy to our aid the music of the spheres telling us that like these the blind bard sang because song was his naturewas within and must outnot bound by laws or measured by pedantic rules but free unfettered and spontaneous as the billows which in its wild and manycadenced sweep it most resembles ah said i not replied cicero that you were a poet and you have been discoursing me most eloquent poetry though not attuned to metre rythmical withal and full of fancy ay and you judge aright he is the greatest as the first of poets and surpassed all his followers as much in the knowledge of the human heart with its ten thousands of conflicting passions as in the structure of the kingly verse wherein he delineated character as never man did saving only he but hold arvina though i could willingly spend hours with thee in converse on this topic the state has calls on me which must be obeyed tell me therefore i pray you as shortly as may be what is the matter you would have me know shortly i pray you for my time is short and my duties onerous and manifold laying aside the roll which he had still held open during that brief conversation and laying aside with it his enthusiastic and passionate manner the young man now stated simply and briefly the events of the past night the discovery of the murdered slave and the accident by which he had learned that he was the consuls property and in conclusion laid the magnificently ornamented dagger which he had found on the board before cicero observing that the weapon might give a clue to poor medons death cicero was moved deeplymoved not simply as arvina fancied by sorrow for the dead but by something approaching nearly to remorse he started up from the chair which he had taken when the youth began his tale and clasping his hands together violently strode rapidly to and fro the small apartment alas and wo is me poor medon faithful wert thou and true and very pleasant to mine eyes alas that thou art gone and gone too so wretchedly and wo is me that i listened not to my own apprehensions rather than to thy trusty boldness alas that i suffered thee to go for they have murdered thee ay thine own zeal betrayed thee but by the gods that govern in olympus they shall rue it after this burst of passion he became more cool and resuming his seat asked paullus a few shrewd and pertinent questions concerning the nature of the ground whereon he had found the corpse the traces left by the mortal struggle the hour at which the discovery was made and many other minute points of the same nature the answers to which he noted carefully on his waxed tablets when he had made all the inquiries that occurred to him he read aloud the answers as he had set them down and asked if he would be willing at any moment to attest the truth of those things at any moment and most willingly my consul the youth replied i would do much myself to find out the murderers and bring them to justice were it only for my poor freedman thraseas sake who is his cousingerman fear not young man they shall be brought to justice answered cicero in the meantime do thou keep silence nor say one word touching this to any one that lives carry the dagger with thee wear it as ostentatiously as may beperchance it shall turn out that some one may claim or recognise it whatever happeneth let me know privately thus far hast thou done well and very wisely go on as thou hast commenced and hap what hap count cicero thy friend but above all doubt noti say doubt not one momentthat as there is one eye that seeth all things in all places that slumbereth not by day nor sleepeth in the watches of night that never waxeth weak at any time or wearyas there is one hand against which no panoply can arm the guilty from which no distance can protect nor space of time secure him so surely shall they perish miserable who did this miserable murder and their souls rue it everlastingly beyond the portals of the grave which are but the portals of eternal life and admit all men to wo or bliss for ever and for ever he spoke solemnly and sadly and on his earnest face there was a deep and almost awful expression that held arvina mute and abashed he knew not wherefore and when the great man had ceased from speaking he made a silent gesture of salutation and withdrew thus gravely warned scarce conscious if the statesman noted his departure for he had fallen into a deep reverie and was perhaps musing on the mysteries yet unrevealed of the immortal soul so totally careless did he now appear of all sublunary matters chapter v the campus eques ipso melior bellerophonte neque pugno neque segni pede victus simul unctos tiberinis humeros lavit in undis horace od iii what ho my noble paullus exclaimed a loud and cheerful voice whither afoot so early and with so grave a face arvina started for so deep was the impression made on his mind by the last words of cicero that he had passed out into the sacred way and walked some distance down it toward the forum in deep meditation from which he was aroused by the clear accents of the merry speaker looking up with a smile as he recognised the voice he saw two young men of senatorial rankfor both wore the crimson laticlave on the breast of their tunicson horseback followed by several slaves on foot who had overtaken him unnoticed amid the din and bustle which had drowned the clang of their horses feet on the pavement nay i scarce know aurelius replied the young man laughing i thought i was going home but it seems that my back is turned to my own house and i am going toward the marketplace although the gods know that i have no business with the brawling lawyers with whom it is alive by this time come with us then replied the other aristius here and i have made a bet upon our coursers speed he fancies his numidian can outrun my gallic beauty come with us to the campus and after we have settled this grave matter we will try the quinquertium or a foot race in armor if you like it better or a swim in the tiber until it shall be time to go to dinner how can i go with you seeing that you are well mounted and i afoot and encumbered with my gown you must consider me a second achilles to keep up with your fleet coursers clad in this heavy toga which is a worse garb for running than any panoply that vulcan ever wrought we will alight cried the other youth who had not yet spoken and give our horses to the boys to lead behind us or hark you why not send geta back to your house and let your slaves bring down your horse too if they make tolerable speed coming down by the back of the coelian and thence beside the aqua crabra to the carmental gate they may overtake us easily before we reach the campus aurelius has some errand to perform near the forum which will detain us a few moments longer what say you he will come he will come certainly cried the other springing down lightly from the back of his beautiful courser which indeed merited the eulogium as well as the caresses which he now lavished on it patting his favorites higharched neck and stroking the soft velvet muzzle which was thrust into his hand with a low whinnying neigh of recognition as he stood on the raised foot path holding the embroidered rein carelessly in his hand i will said arvina gladly i have nothing to hinder me this morning and for some days past i have been detained with business so that i have not visited the campus or backed a horse or cast a javelinby hercules not since the ides i fancy you will all beat me in the field that is certain and in the river likewise but come fuscus aristius if it is to be as you have planned it jump down from your numidian and let your geta ride him up the hill to my house i would have asked aurelius but he will let no slave back his white notus not i by the twin horsemen nor any free man eitherplebeian knight or noble since first i bought him of the blueeyed celt who wept in his barbarian fondness for the colt no leg save only mine has crossed his back nor ever shall while the light of day smiles on aurelius victor without a word fuscus leaped from the back of the fine bloodbay barb he bestrode and beckoning to a confidential slave who followed him here he said geta take nanthus and ride straightway up the minervium to the house of arvina thou knowest it beside the alban mansions and do as he shall command you tell him my paullus carry this signet my good geta said the young man drawing off the large sealring which adorned his right hand and giving it to him to thrasea my trusty freedman and let him see that they put the housings and gallic wolfbit on the black horse aufidus and bring him thou with one of my slaves down the slope of scaurus and past the great circus to the carmental gate where thou wilt find us make good speed geta ay do so interposed his master but see that thou dost not blow nanthus thou wert better be a dead slave geta than let me find one drop of sweat on his flank nay never grin thou hangdog or i will have thee given to my congers the last which came out of the fish pond were but ill fed and a fat german such as thou would be a rare meal for them the slave laughed knowing well that his master was but jesting mounted the horse and rode him at a gentle trot up the slope of the caelian hill from which arvina had but a little while before descended in the mean time aristius gave the rein of his dappled grey to one of his followers desiring him to be very gentle with him and the three young men sauntered slowly on along the sacred way toward the forum conversing merrily and interchanging many a smile and salutation with those whom they met on their road skirting the base of the palatine hill they passed the old circular temple of remus to the right hand and the most venerable relic of romes infancy the ruminal fig tree beneath which the shewolf was believed to have given suck to the twin progeny of mars and the hapless ilia a little farther on the mouth of the sacred grotto called lupercal surrounded with its shadowy grove the favourite haunt of pan lay to their left and fronting them the splendid arch of fabius surnamed allobrox for his victorious prowess against that savage tribe gave entrance to the great roman forum immediately at their left hand as they entered the archway was the superb comitium wherein the senate were wont to give audience to foreign embassies of suppliant nations with the gigantic portico three columns of which may still be seen to testify to the splendor of the old city in the far days of the republic facing them were the steps of the asylum with the mamertine prison and the grand facade of the temple of concord to the right and left and higher above these the portico of the gallery of records and higher yet the temple of the thundering jupiter and glittering above all against the dark blue sky the golden dome and white marble columns of the great capitol itself around in all directions were basilicae or halls of justice porticoes filled with busy lawyers bankers shops glittering with their splendid wares and bedecked with the golden shields taken from the samnites statues of the renowned of ages accius naevius who cut the whetstone with the razor horatius cocles on his thunderstricken pedestal halting on one knee from the wound which had not hindered him from swimming the swollen tiber claelia the hostage on her brazen steed and many another handed down inviolate from the days of the ancient kings here was the rostrum beaked with the prows of ships a fluent orator already haranguing the assembled people from its platformthere the seat of the city praetor better known as the puteal libonis with that officer in session on his curule chair his six lictors leaning on their fasces at his back as he promulgated his irrevocable edicts it was a grand sight surely and one to gaze on which men of the present day would do and suffer much and judge themselves most happy if blessed with one momentary glance of the heart as it were of the old worlds mistress but these young men proud as they were and boastful of the glories of their native rome had looked too often on that busy scene to be attracted by the gorgeousness of the place crowded with buildings the like of which the modern world knows not and thronged with nations of every region of the earth each in his proper dress each seeking justice pleasure profit fame as it pleased him free and fearless and secure of property and person casting a brief glance over it they turned short to the left by a branch of the sacred way which led skirting the market place between the comitium or hall of the ambassadors and the abrupt declivity of the palatine past the end of the atrium of liberty and the cattle mart toward the carmental gate methought you said my fuscus that our aurelius had some errand to perform in the forum how is this is it a secret inquired paullus laughing no secret by the gods said aurelius it is but to buy a pair of spurs in voleros shop hard by vestas shrine he will need them cried fuscus he will need them i will swear in the race not to beat nanthus said aurelius but oh jove walk quickly i beseech you how hot a steam of cooked meats and sodden cabbage reeks from the door of yon cookshop now by the gods it well nigh sickened me ha volero he exclaimed as they reached the door of a booth or little shop with neat leathern curtains festooned up in front glittering with polished cutlery and wares of steel and silver to a middle aged man who was busy burnishing a knife within what ho my volero some spursi want some spurs show me some of your sharpest and brightest i have a pair noble aurelius which i got only yesterday in trade with a turbaned moor from the deserts beyond cyrenaica by mulciber my patron god the fairest pair my eyes ever looked upon right loath was the swart barbarian to let me have them but hunger hunger is a great tamer of your savage and the steam of good furbos cookshop yonder was suggestive of savory chops and greasy sausagesandandin short aurelius i got them at a bargain while he was speaking he produced the articles in question from a strong brassbound chest and rubbing them on his leather apron held them up for the inspection of the youthful noble truly cried victor catching them out of his hand truly they are good spurs good spurs good spurs cried the merchant half indignantly i call them splendid glorious inimitable only look you here it is all virgin silver and observe i beseech you this dragons neck and the sibilant head that holds the rowels they are wrought to the very life with horrent scales and erected crest beautiful beautifuland the rowels too of the best spanish steel that was ever tempered in the cold bilbilis good spurs indeed they are well worth three aurei but i will keep them as i meant to do at first for caius caesar he will know what they are worth and give it too didst ever hear so pestilent a knave said victor laughing one would suppose i had disparaged the accursed things but as i said before they are good spurs and i will have them but i will not give thee three aurei master volero two is enough in all conscience or sixty denarii at the most ho davus davus bring my purse hither davus he called to his slaves without and as the pursebearer entered he continued without waiting for an answer give volero two aurei and ten denarii and take these spurs no no exclaimed volero you shall notno by the gods they cost me more than that ye gods what a lie cost theeand to a barbarian i dare be sworn thou didst not pay him the ten denarii alone by hercules i did though said the other and thou shouldst not have them for three aurei either but that it is drawing near the calends of november and i have moneys to pay then sixtyfive i will give theesixtyfive denarii give me my spurs what art thou turning miser in thy youth aurelius there give him the gold davus he is a regular usurer give him three aurei and then buckle these to my heel ha that is well my paullus here come your fellows with black aufidus and our friend geta on the numidian they have made haste yet not sweated nanthus either aristius your groom is a good one i never saw a horse that shewed his keeping or condition better now then arvina doff your toga you will not surely ride in that indeed i will not replied paullus if master volero will suffer me to leave it here till my return willingly willingly but what is this exclaimed the cutler as arvina unbuckling his toga and suffering it to drop on the ground stood clad in his succinct and snowwhite tunic only girded about him with a zone of purple leather in which was stuck the sheathless dirk of cataline what is this noble paullus that you carry at your belt with no scabbard if you go armed you should at least go safely see if you were to bend your body somewhat quickly it might well be that the keen point would rend your groin give it me i can fit it with a sheath in a moment i do not know but it were as well to do so answered paullus extricating the dagger from his belt if you will not detain us a long time not even a short time said the cutler give it to me i can fit it immediately and he stretched out his hand and took it but hardly had his eye dwelt on it for a moment when he cried but this is not yoursthis iswhere got you this arvina nay it is nought to thee perhaps i bought it perhaps it was given to me do thou only fit it with a scabbard buy it thou didst not paullus ill be sworn and i think it was never given thee and see see here what is this ithere has been blood on the blade folly exclaimed the young man turning first very red and then pale so that his comrades gazed on him with wonder folly i say it is not blood but water that has dimmed its shineand how knowest thou that i did not buy it how do i know itthus answered the artizan drawing from a cupboard under his counter a weapon precisely the facsimile in every respect of that in his hand there never were but two of these made and i made them the scabbard of this will fit that see how the very chased work fits i sold this but not to you arvina and i do not believe that it was given to you filth that thou art and carrion exclaimed the young man fiercely striking his hand with violence upon the counter darest thou brave a nobleman i tell thee i doubt not at all that there be twenty such in every cutlers shop in romebut to whom didst thou sell this that thou art so certain paullus caecilius replied the mechanic gravely but respectfully i brave no man least of all a patrician but mark my wordsi did sell this dagger here is my own mark on its back if it was given to thee thou must needs know the giver for the rest this is blood that has dimmed it and not water you cannot deceive me in the matter and i would warn you youthnoble as you are and plebeian ithat there are laws in rome one of them called cornelia de sicariis which you were best take care that you know not more nearly meantime you can take this scabbard if you will handing to him as he spoke the sheath of the second weapon the price is one sestertium it is the finest silver chased as you see and overlaid with pure gold thou hast the money returned paullus casting down on the counter several golden coins stamped with a helmed head of mars and an eagle on the reverse grasping a thunderbolt in its talonsand the sheath is mine then thou wilt not disclose to whom it was sold why should i since thou knowest without telling wilt thou or not not to thee paullus then will i find some one to whom thou wilt fain disclose it he answered haughtily and who may that be i beseech you asked the mechanic half sneeringly for my part i fancy you will let it rest altogether some one was hurt with it last night as you and he we both know can tell if you will but i knew not that you were one of his men there was an insolent sneer on the cutlers face that galled the young nobleman to the quick and what was yet more annoying there was an assumption of mutual intelligence and equality about him that almost goaded the patricians blood to fury but by a mighty effort he subdued his passion to his will and snatching up the weapon returned it to his belt left the shop and springing to the saddle of his beautiful black horse rode furiously away it was not till he reached the carmental gate giving egress from the city through the vast walls of cyclopean architecture immediately at the base of the dread tarpeian rock overlooked and commanded by the outworks and turrets of the capitol that he drew in his eager horse and looked behind him for his friends but they were not in sight and a moments reflection told him that being about to start their coursers on a trial of speed they would doubtless ride gently over the rugged pavement of the crowded streets he doubted for a minute whether he should turn back to meet them or wait for their arrival at the gate by which they must pass to gain the campus but the fear of missing them instantly induced him to adopt the latter course and he sat for a little space motionless on his wellbitted and obedient horse beneath the shadow of the deep gateway here his eye wandered around him for awhile taking note indeed of the surrounding objects the great temple of jupiter stator on the palatine the splendid portico of catulus adorned with the uncouth and grisly spoils of the cimbric hordes slaughtered on the plains of vercellae the house of scaurus toward which a slow wain tugged by twelve powerful oxen was even then dragging one of the pondrous columns which rendered his hall for many years the boast of roman luxury and on the other tall buildings that stood every where about him although in truth he scarce observed what for the time his eye dwelt upon at length an impatient motion of his horse caused him to turn his face toward the black precipice of the huge rock at whose base he sat and in a moment it fastened upon his mind with singular vividnesssingular for he had paused fifty times upon that spot before without experiencing such feelingsthat he was on the very pavement which had so often been bespattered with the blood of despairing traitors the noble manlius tumbled from the very rock which his single arm had but a little while before defended seemed to lie there even at his feet mortally maimed and in the agony of death yet even so too proud to mix one groan with the curses he poured forth against romes democratic rabble then by a not inapt transition the scene changed and caius marcius was at hand with the sword drawn in his right that won him the proud name of coriolanus and the same rabble that had hurled caius manlius down yelling and hooting to the rock with him to the rock but at a safe and respectful distance their factious tribunes goading them to outrage and new riot it was strange that these thoughts should have occurred so clearly at this moment to the excited mind of the young noble and he felt that it was strange himself and would have banished the ideas but they would not away and he continued musing on the inconstant turbulence of the plebeians and the unerring doom which had overtaken every one of their idols from the hands of their own partizans until his companions at length rode slowly up the street to join him there was some coldness in the manner of aristius fuscus as they met again and even aurelius seemed surprised and not well pleased for they had in truth been conversing earnestly about the perturbation of their friend at the remarks of the artizan and the singularity of his conduct in wearing arms at all and he heard victor say just before they joined company no that is not so odd fuscus in these times it was but two nights since as i was coming home something later than my wont from terentias that i fell in with clodius reeling along frantically drunk and furious with half a dozen torchbearers before and half a score wolfish looking gladiators all armed with blade and buckler and all halfdrunk behind him i do assure you that i almost swore i would go out no more without weapons they would have done you no good man said aristius if some nineteen or twenty had set upon you but an they would i care not it is against the law and no good citizen should carry them at all carry arms i suppose you mean aristius interrupted paullus boldly ye are talking about me i fancyis it not so ay it is replied the other gravely you were disturbed not a little at what stout volero said i was i was answered arvina very quickly because i could not tell him and it is not pleasant to be suspected the truth is that the dagger is not mine at all and that it is blood that was on it for last nightbut lo he added interrupting himself i was about to speak out and tell you all and yet my lips are sealed i am sorry to hear it said aristius i do not like mysteries and this seems to me a dark one it isas dark as erebus said paullus eagerly and as guilty too but it is not my mystery so help me the god of good faith and honour that is enough said surely that is enough for you aristius exclaimed the warmer and more excitable aurelius for you it may be replied the noble youth with a melancholy smile you are a boy in heart my aurelius and overflow so much with generosity and truth that you believe all others to be as frank and candid i alas have grown old untimely and having seen what i have seen hold mens assertions little worth the hot blood mounted fiercely into the cheek of paullus and striking his horses flank suddenly with his heel he made him passage half across the street and would have seized aristius by the throat had not their comrade interposed to hinder him you are both mad i believe so mad that all the hellebore in both the anticyras could not cure you thou fuscus for insulting him with needless doubts thou paullus for mentioning the thing or shewing the dagger at all if you did not choose to explain i do choose to explain replied caecilius but i cannot i have explained it all to marcus tullius to cicero exclaimed aristius why did you not say so before i was wrong then i confess my error if cicero be satisfied it must needs be all well that name of cicero is like the voice of an oracle to fuscus ever said aurelius victor laughing i believe he thinks the new man from arpinum a very god descended from olympus no not a god replied aristius fuscus only the greatest work of god a wise and virtuous man in an age which has few such to boast but come let us ride on and conclude our race and thou arvina forget what i said i meant not to wrong thee i have forgotten answered paullus and with the word they gave their horses head and cantered onward for the field of mars the way for some distance was narrow lying between the fortified rock of the capitol with its stern lines of immemorial ramparts on the right hand and on the left the long arcades and stately buildings of the vegetable mart on the river bank now filled with sturdy peasants from the sabine country eager to sell their fresh green herbs and blooming girls from tibur and the banks of anio with garlands of flowers and cheeks that outvied their own brightest roses beyond these still concealing the green expanse of the level plain and the famous river stood side by side three temples sacred to juno matuta piety and hope each with its massy colonnade of doric or corinthian or ionic pillars the latter boasting its frieze wrought in bronze and that of piety its tall equestrian statue so richly gilt and burnished that it gleamed in the sunlight as if it were of solid gold onward they went still at a merry canter their generous and high mettled coursers fretting against the bits which restrained their speed and their young hearts elated and bounding quickly in their bosoms with the excitement of the gallant exercise and now they cleared the last winding of the suburban street and clothed in its perennial verdure the wide field lay outspread like one sheet of emerald verdure before them with the bright tiber flashing to the sun in many a reach and ripple and the gay slope of the collis hortulorum glowing with all its terraced gardens in the distance a few minutes more brought them to the flaminian way whereon nearly midway the plain stood the diribitorium or payoffice of the troops the porticoes of which were filled with the soldiers of metellus creticus and quintus marcius rex who lay with their armies encamped on the low hills beyond the river waiting their triumphs and forbidden by the laws to come into the city so long as they remained invested with their military rank around this stately building were many colonnades and open buildings adapted to the exercises of the day when winter or bad weather should prevent their performance in the open mead and stored with all appliances and instruments required for the purpose and to these paullus and his friends proceeded answering merely with a nod or passing jest the salutations of many a helmed centurion and gorgeous tribune of the soldiery a grand ionic gateway gave them admittance to the hippodrome a vast oval space adorned with groups of sculpture and obelisks and columns in the midst on some of which were affixed inscriptions commemorative of great feats of skill or strength or daring while others displayed placards announcing games or contests to take place in future and challenges of celebrated gymnasts for the cestus fight the wrestling match or the footrace around the outer circumference were rows of seats shaded by plane trees overrun with ivy and there were already seated many young men of noble birth chatting together or betting with their waxed tablets and their styli in their hands some waiting the commencement of the race between fuscus and victor others watching with interest the progress of a sham fight on horseback between two young men of the equestrian order denoted by the narrow crimson stripes on their tunics who were careering to and fro armed with long staves and circular bucklers in all the swift and beautiful movements of the mimic combat among those most interested in this spectacle the eye of arvina fell instantly on the tall and gaunt form of catiline who stood erect on one of the marble benches applauding with his hands and now and then shouting a word of encouragement to the combatants as they wheeled by him in the mazes of their half angry sport it was not long however before their strife was brought to a conclusion for almost as the friends entered the hindmost horseman of the two made a thrust at the other which taking effect merely on the lower rim of his antagonists parma glanced off under his outstretched arm and made the striker in a great measure lose his balance as quick as light the other wheeled upon him feinted a pass at his breast with the point of the staff and then as he lowered his shield to guard himself reversed the weapon with a swift turn of the wrist dealt him a heavy blow with the trunchon on the head and then while the whole place rang with tumultuous plaudits circled entirely round him to the left and delivered his thrust with such effect in the side that it bore his competitor clear out of the saddle euge euge well done shouted catiline in ecstacy by hercules i never saw in all my life better skirmishing it is all over with titus varus and in truth it was all over with him but not in the sense which the speaker meant for as he fell the horses came into collision and it so happened that the charger of the conqueror excited by the fury of the contest laid hold of the others neck with his teeth and almost tore away a piece of the muscular flesh at the very moment when the riders spur as he fell cut a long gash in his flank with a wild yelling neigh the tortured brute yerked out his heels viciously and as ill luck would have it both took effect on the person of his fallen master one striking him a terrible blow on the chest the other shattering his collar bone and shoulder a dozen of the spectators sprang down from the seats and took him up before paullus could dismount to aid him but as they raised him from the ground his eyes were already glazing marcius has conquered me he muttered in tones of deep mortification unconscious as it would seem of his agony and wounded only by the indomitable roman pride and with the words his jaw dropped and his last strife was ended the fool exclaimed cataline with a bitter sneer what had he got to do that he should ride against caius marcius when he could not so much as keep his saddle the fool he is gone cried another game to the last brave varus he came of a brave race said a third but he rode badly at least not so well as marcius replied yet a fourth but who does to be foiled by him does not argue bad riding who does why paullus here cried aurelius victor ill match him if he will ride for a thousand sestercesten thousand if you will no ill not bet about it i lost by this cursed chance answered the former speaker but varus did not ride badly i maintain it he added with the steadiness of a discomfited partisan ay but he did most pestilently interposed catiline almost fiercely but come come why dont they carry him away we are losing all the morning i thought he was a friend of yours sergius said another of the bystanders apparently vexed at the heartlessness of his manner why ay so he was replied the conspirator but he is nothing now nor can my friendship aught avail him it was his time and his fate ours it may be will come tomorrow nor do i see at all wherefore our sports should not proceed because a man has gone hence fifty men every day die somewhere while we are dining drinking kissing our mistresses or wives but do we stop for that ho bear him hence we will attend his funeral when it shall be soever and we will drink to his memory today what comes next comrades arvina it is true was for a moment both shocked and disgusted at the heartless and unfeeling tone but few if any of the others evinced the like tenderness for it must be remembered in the first place that the romans inured to sights of blood and torture daily in the gladiatorial fights of the arena were callous to human suffering and careless of human life at all times and in the second that stoicism was the predominant affectation of the day not only among the rude and coarse but among the best and most virtuous citizens of the republic few therefore left the ground when the corpse decently enveloped in the toga he had worn when living was borne homewards except the involuntary homicide who could not even at that day in decency remain and a few of his most intimate associates who covering their faces in the lappets of their gowns followed the bearers in stern and silent sorrow scarcely then had the sad procession threaded the marble archway before catiline again asked loudly and imperiously what is to be the next i pray you are we to sit here like old women by their firesides croaking and whimpering till dinner time no by the gods cried aurelius we have a race to come off which i propose to win fuscus aristius here and iwe will start instantly if no one else has the ground away with you then answered the other come sit by me arvina i would say a word with you giving his horse to one of his grooms the young man followed him without answer for although it is true that catiline was at this time a marked man and of no favorable reputation yet squeamishness in the choice of associates was never a characteristic of the romans and persons the known perpetrators of the most atrocious crimes so long as they were unconvicted mingled on terms of equality unshunned by any except the gravest and most rigid censors arvina too was very young and very young men are often fascinated as it were by great reputations even of great criminals with a passionate desire to see them more closely and observe the stuff they are made of so that in fact catiline being looked upon in those days much as a desperate gambler a celebrated duellist or a famous seducer of our own time whom no one shuns though every one abuses it was not perhaps very wonderful if this rash ardent and inexperienced youth should have conceived himself flattered by such notice from one of whom all the world was talking and should have followed him to a seat with a sense of gratified vanity blended with eager curiosity the race which followed differed not much from any other race except that the riders having no stirrups that being a yet undiscovered luxury much less depended upon jockeyshipthe skill of the riders being limited to keeping their seats steadily and guiding the animals they bestrodeand much more upon the native powers the speed and endurance of the coursers so much however was arvina interested by the manner and conversation of the singular man by whose side he sat and who was indeed laying himself out with deep art to captivate him and take his mind as it were by storm now with the boldest and most daring paradoxes now with bursts of eloquent invective against the oppression and aristocratic insolence of the cabal which by his shewing governed rome and now with sarcasm and pungent wit that he saw but little of the course which he had come especially to look at do you indeed ride so well my paullus asked his companion suddenly as if the thought had been suggested by some observation he had just made on the competitors as they passed in the second circuit so well i mean as aurelius victor said and would you undertake the combat of the horse and spear with caius marcius truly i would said arvina blushing slightly i have interchanged many a blow and thrust with young varro whom our masteratarms holds better with the spear than marcius and i feel myself his equal i have been practising a good deal of late he added modestly for though perhaps you know it not i have been elected decurio and as first chosen leader of a troop and am to take the field with the next reinforcements that go out to pontus to our great pompey the next reinforcements replied catiline with a meditative air ha that may be some time distant not so by jupiter my sergius we are already ordered to hold ourselves in readiness to march for brundusium where we shall ship for pontus i fancy we shall set forth as soon as the consular comitia have been held it may be so said the other but i do not think it there may fall out that which shall rather summon pompey homeward than send more men to join him that is a very handsome dagger he broke off interrupting himself suddenlywhere did you get it i should like much to get me such an one to give to my friend cethegus who has a taste for such things i wonder however at your wearing it so openly taken completely by surprise arvina answered hastily i found it last night and i wear it hoping to find the owner by hercules said the conspirator laughing i would not take so much pains were i you but do you hear i have partly a mind myself to claim it no you were better not said paullus gravely besides you can get one just like this without risking any thing volero the cutler in the sacred way near vestas temple has one precisely like to this for sale he made this too he tells me though he will not tell me to whom he sold it but that shall soon be got out of him notwithstanding ha are you so anxious in the matter it would oblige you then if i should confess myself the loser well i dont want to buy another i want this very one i believe i must claim it he spoke with an emphasis so singular impressive and at the same time halfderisive and with so strangelymeaning an expression that paullus indeed scarcely knew what to think but in the mean time he had recovered his own selfpossession and merely answered i think you had better not it would perhaps be dangerous dangerous ha that is another motive i love danger verily i believe i must yes i must claim it what exclaimed paullus turning pale from excitement is it yours do you say that it is yours look look exclaimed catiline springing to his feet here they come here they come now this is the last round by the gods but they are gallant horses and well matched see how the bay courser stretches himself and how quickly he gathers the bay the bay has it for five hundred sesterces i wager you said a dissolutelooking longhaired youth i wager you five hundred catiline i say the gray horse wins be it so then shouted catiline the bay the bay spur spur aristius fuscus aurelius gains on you spur spur the gray the gray there is not a horse in rome can touch aurelius victors gray southwind replied the other and in truth victors gallic courser repaid his masters vaunts for he made though he had seemed beat so desperate a rally that he rushed past the bay arab almost at the goal and won by a clear length amidst the roars of the glad spectators i have lost plague on it exclaimed catiline and here is clodius expects to be paid on the instant ill be sworn and as he spoke the debauchee with whom he had betted came up holding his left hand extended tapping its palm with the forefinger of the right i told you so he said i told you so where be the sesterces you must needs wait a while i have not my purse with me catiline began but paullus interrupted him i have i have my sergius permit me to accommodate you and suiting the action to the word he gave the conspirator several large gold coins adding you can repay me when it suits you that will be never said clodius with a sneer you dont know lucius catiline i see young man ay but he does replied the other with a sarcastic grin for catiline never forgets a friend or forgives a foe can clodius say the same but clodius merely smiled and walked off clinking the money he had won tauntingly in his hand what now i wonder is the day destined to bring forth said the conspirator making no more allusion to the dagger a contest now between myself aristius and aurelius in the five games of the quinquertium and then a foot race in the heaviest panoply ha can you beat them asked catiline regarding arvina with an interest that grew every moment keener as he saw more of his strength and daring spirit i can try shall i bet on you if you please i can beat them in some i think and as i said i will try in all more words followed for paullus hastened away to strip and anoint himself for the coming struggle and in a little while the strife itself succeeded to describe this would be tedious but suffice it that while he won decidedly three games of the five paullus was beat in none and that in the armed foot race the most toilsome and arduous exercise of the campus he not only beat his competitors with ease but ran the longest course carrying the most ponderous armature and shield in shorter time than had been performed within many years on the field of mars catiline watched him eagerly all the while inspecting him as a purchaser would a horse he was about to buy and then muttering to himself we must have him walked up to join him as he finished the last exploit will you dine with me paullus he said today and meet the loveliest women you can see in rome and no prudes either willingly he replied but i must swim first in the tiber be it so there is time enough i will swim also and they moved down in company toward the river chapter vi the false love fie fie upon her theres a language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body troilus and cressida about three hours later than the scene in the campus martius which had occurred a little after noon catiline was standing richly dressed in a bright saffron robe something longer than the ordinary tunic flowered with sprigs of purple in the inmost chamber of the womans apartments in his own heavily mortgaged mansion his wife aurelia orestilla sat beside him on a low stool a woman of the most superb and queenly beautyfor whom it was believed that he had plunged himself into the deepest guiltand still although past the prime of italian womanhood possessing charms that might well account for the most insane passion a slave was listening with watchful and half terrified attention to the injunctions of his lordfor catiline was an unscrupulous and severe masterand as he ceased speaking he made a deep genuflexion and retired no sooner had he gone than catiline turned quickly to the lady whose lovely face wore some marks of displeasure and said rather shortly you have not gone to her my aurelia there is no time to lose the young man will be here soon and if they meet ere you have given her the cue all will be lost i do not like it my sergius said the woman rising but making no movement to leave the chamber and why not i beseech you madam he replied angrily or what is there in that which i desire you to tell the girl to do that you have not done twenty times yourself and fulvia and sempronia and half romes noblest ladies tush i say tush go do it she is my daughter sergius answered aurelia in a tone of deep tenderness a daughters honor must be something to every mother and a sons life to every father said catiline with a fierce sneer i had a son once i remember you wished to enter an empty house on the day of your marriage feast i do not think you found him in your way besides for honorif i read lucias eyes rightly there is not much of that to emperil when he spoke of his son she covered her face in her richly jewelled hands and a slight shudder shook her whole frame when she looked up again she was pale as death and her lips quivered as she asked must i then oh be merciful my sergius you must aurelia he replied sternly and that now our fortunes nay our lives depend on it allmust she give all lucius all that he asks but fear not he shall wed her when our plans shall be crowned with triumph will you swear it by all the gods he shall by all the furies if you will by earth and heaven and hades i will go she replied something reassured and prepare her for the task the task he muttered with his habitual sneer daintily worded fair one but it will not i fancy prove a hard one paullus is young and handsome and our soft lucia has methinks something of her mothers yielding tenderness do you reproach me with it sergius nay rather i adore thee for it loveliest one but go and prepare our lucia then as she left the room the dark scowl settled down on his black brow and he clinched his hand as he said she waxes stubbornlet her beware she is not half so young as she was and her beauty wanes as fast as my passion for it let her beware how she crosses me while he was speaking yet a slave entered and announced that paullus caecilius arvina had arrived and curius and the noble fulvia and as he received the tidings the frown passed away from the brow of the conspirator and putting on his mask of smooth smiling dissimulation he went forth to meet his guests they were assembled in the tablinum or saloon arvina clad in a violet colored tunic sprinkled with flowers in their natural hues and curiusa slight keenlooking man with a wild proud expression giving a sort of interest to a countenance haggard from the excitement of passion in one of rich crimson fringed at the wrists and neck with gold fulvia his paramour a woman famed throughout rome alike for her licentiousness and beauty was hanging on his arm glittering with chains and carcanets and bracelets of the costliest gems in her fair bosom all too much displayed for a matrons modesty on her round dazzling arms about her swanlike neck wreathed in the profuse tresses of her golden hairfor she was that unusual and much admired being an italian blondeand spanning the circumference of her slight waist she was indeed a creature exquisitely bright and lovely with such an air of mild and angelic candor pervading her whole face that you would have sworn her the most innocent the purest of her sex alas that she was indeed almost the vilest that she was that rare monster a woman who linked with every crime and baseness that can almost unsex a woman preserves yet in its height one eminent and noble virtue one halfredeeming trait amidst all her infamy in her proud love of country name honor virtue conscience womanhood truth piety all all were sacrificed to her rebellious passions but to her love of country she could have sacrificed those very passions that frail abandoned wretch was still a romanmight have been in a purer age a heroine of romes most glorious welcome most lovely fulvia exclaimed the host gliding softly into the room by mars the most favored of immortals you must have stolen aphrodites cestus saw you her ever look so beautiful my paullus you do well to put those sapphires in your hair for they wax pale and dim besides the richer azure of your eyes and the dull gold in which they are enchased sets off the sparkling splendor of your tresses what fulvia know you not young arvinaone of the great caecilii by hercules my curius he won the best of the quinquertium from such competitors as victor and aristius fuscus and ran twelve stadii with the heaviest breastplate and shield in the armory quicker than it has been performed since the days of licinius celer i prithee know and cherish him my friends for i would have him one of us in truth i would my paullus the flattering words of the tempter and the more fascinating smiles and glances of the bewitching siren were not thrown away on the young noble and these with the soft perfumed atmosphere the splendidly voluptuous furniture of the saloon and the delicious music which was floating all the while upon his ears from the blended instruments and voices of unseen minstrels conspired to plunge his senses into a species of effeminate and luxurious languor which suited well the ulterior views of catiline one thing alone has occurred resumed the host after some moments spent in light jests and trivial conversation to decrease our pleasure cethegus was to have dined with us today and decius brutus with his inimitable wife sempronia but they have disappointed us and save aurelia only and our poor little lucia there will be none but ourselves to eat my umbrian boar have you a boar my sergius exclaimed curius eagerly who was addicted to the pleasures of the table almost as much as the charms of women by pan the god of hunters we are in luck today but wherefore comes not sempronia inquired fulvia not very much displeased by the absence of a rival beauty brutus is called away it appears suddenly to tarentum upon business and she prefers entertaining our cethegus alone in her own house i fancy interrupted fulvia exactly so replied catiline with a smile of meaning happy cethegus said arvina do you think her so handsome asked fulvia favoring him with one of her most melting glances the handsomest woman he replied with but one exception i ever had the luck to look upon indeedand pray who is the exception asked the lady very tartly there happened to be lying on a marble slab near to the place where they were standing a small round mirror of highly polished steel set in a frame of tortoiseshell and gold paullus had noticed it before she spoke and taking it up without a moments pause he raised it to her face look he said look into that and blush at your question prettily said my paullus thy wit is as fleet as thy foot is speedy said the conspirator flatterer whispered the lady evidently much delighted and then in a lower voice she added do you indeed think so else may i never hope but at this moment the curtains were drawn aside and orestilla entered from the gallery of the peristyle accompanied by her daughter lucia the latter was a girl of about eighteen years old and of appearance so remarkable that she must not be passed unnoticed in person she was extremely tall and slender and at first sight you would have supposed her thin until the wavy outlines of the loose robe of plain white linen which she wore undulating at every movement of her form displayed the exquisite fulness of her swelling bust and the voluptuous roundness of all her lower limbs her arms which were bare to the shoulders where her gown was fastened by two studs of gold were quite unadorned by any gem or bracelet and although beautifully moulded were rather slender than full her face did not at first sight strike you more than her person as being beautiful for it was singularly still and inexpressive when at restalthough all the features were fine and classically regularand was almost unnaturally pale and hueless the mouth only had any thing of warmth or color or expression and what expression there was was not pleasing for although soft and winning it was sensual to the last degree her manner however contradicted this for she slided into the circle with downcast eyes the long dark silky lashes only visible in relief against the marble paleness of her cheek as if she were ashamed to raise them from the ground her whole air being that of a girl oppressed with overwhelming bashfulness to an extent almost painful why what is this aurelia exclaimed catiline as if he were angry although in truth the whole thing was carefully preconcerted wherefore is lucia thus strangely clad is it i pray you in scorn of our noble guests that she wears only this plain morning stola pardon her i beseech you good my sergius answered his wife with a painfully simulated smile you know how overtimid she is and bashful she had determined not to appear at dinner had i not laid my commands on her her very hair you see is not braided ha this is ill done my girl lucia answered catiline what will my young friend arvina think of you who comes hither today for the first time for curius and our lovely fulvia i care not so much seeing they know your whims but i am vexed indeed that paullus should behold you thus in disarray with your hair thus knotted like a slave girls on your neck like a dryads rather or shy oreads of dianas trainbeautiful hair replied the youth whose attention had been called to the girl by this conversation and who having thought her at first unattractive rather than otherwise had now discovered the rare beauties of her lythe and slender figure and detected as he thought a world of passion in her serpentlike and sinuous motions she raised her eyes to meet his slowly as he spoke gazed into them for one moment and then as if ashamed of what she had done dropped them again instantly while a bright crimson flush shot like a stream of lava over her pallid face and neck and arms yes her arms blushed and her hands to the finger ends it was but one moment that those large lustrous orbs looked full into his swimming in liquid oriental languor yet flashing out beams of consuming fire yet paullus arvina felt the glance like an electrical influence through every nerve and artery of his body and trembled at its power it was a minute before he could collect himself enough to speak to her for all the rest had moved away a little and left them standing together and when he did so his voice faltered and his manner was so much agitated that she must have been blind indeed and stupid not to perceive it and lucia was not blind nor stupid no by the god of love an universe of wild imaginative intellect an ocean of strange whirling thoughts an etna of fierce and fiery passions lay buried beneath that calm bashful almost awkward manner many bad thoughts were there many unmaidenly imaginings many ungoverned and most evil passions but there was also much that was partly good much that might have been all good and high and noble had it been properly directed but alas as much pains had been taken to corrupt and deprave that youthful understanding and to inflame those nascent passions as are devoted by good parents to developing the former and repressing the growth of the latter as it was self indulged and indulged by others she was a creature of impulse entirely ill regulated and ungovernable intended from the first to be a tool in his own hands whenever he might think fit to use her she had in no case hitherto run counter to the views of catiline because so long as his schemes were agreeable to her inclinations and favorable to her pleasures she was quite willing to be his tool though by no means unconscious of the fact that he meant her to be such what might be the result should his wishes cross her own the arch conspirator had never given himself the pains to enquire for like the greater part of voluptuaries regarding women as mere animals vastly inferior in mind and intellect to men he had entirely overlooked her mental qualifications and fancied her a being of as small moral capacity as he knew her to be of strong physical organization he was mistaken as wise men often are and deeply perhaps fatally there was not probably a girl in all italy in all the world who would so implicitly have followed his directions as long as to do so gratified her passions and clashed not with her indomitable will to the sacrifice of all principle and with the most total disregard of right or wrong as lucia orestilla but certainly there was not one who would have resisted commands threats violence more pertinaciously or dauntlessly than the same lucia should her will and his councils ever be set at twain while paullus was yet conversing in an under tone with this strange girl and becoming every moment more and more fascinated by the whole tone of her remarks which were free and even bold as contrasted with the bashful air and timid glances which accompanied them the curtains of the tablinum were drawn apart and a soft symphony of flutes stealing in from the atrium announced that the dinner was prepared my curius exclaimed catiline i must entreat you to take charge of fulvia i had proposed myself that pleasure intending that you should escort sempronia and decius my own orestilla but as it is we will each abide by his own lady and paullus here will pardon the youth and rawness of my lucia by heaven i would wish nothing better said curius taking fulvia by the hand and leading her forward should you arvina not i indeed replied paullus if lucia be content and he looked to catch her eye as he took her soft hand in his own but her face remained cold and pale as marble and her eye downcast as they passed out however into the fauces or passage leading to the diningroom catiline added as we are all i may say one family and party i have desired the slaves to spread couches only the ladies will recline with us instead of sitting at the board at this moment did paullus fancy it or did that beautiful pale girl indeed press his fingers in her own he could not be mistaken and yet there was the downcast eye the immoveable cheek and the unsmiling aspect of the rosy mouth but he returned the pressure and that so significantly that she at least could not be mistaken nor was she for her eye again met his with that deep amorous languid glance was bashfully withdrawn and then met his again glancing askance through the dark fringed lids and a quick flashing smile and a burning blush followed and in a seconds space she was again as cold as impassive as a marble statue they reached the triclinium a beautiful oblong apartment gorgeously painted with arabesques of gold and scarlet upon a deep azure ground work a circular table covered with a white cloth bordered with a deep edge of purple and deeper fringe of gold stood in the centre and around it three couches nearly of the same height with the board each the segment of a circle the three forming a horseshoe the couches were of the finest rosewood inlaid with tortoiseshell and ivory and brass strewed with the richest tapestries and piled with cushions glowing with splendid needlework and over all upheld by richly moulded shafts of corinthian bronze was a canopy of tyrian purple tasselled and fringed with gold the method of reclining at the table was that the guests should place themselves on the left side propped partly by the left elbow and partly by a pile of cushions each couch being made to contain in general three persons the head of the second coming immediately below the right arm of the first and the third in like manner the body of each being placed transversely so as to allow space for the limbs of the next below in front of him the middle place on each couch was esteemed the most honorable and the middle couch of the three was that assigned to guests of the highest rank the master of the feast for the most occupying the central position on the third or left hand sofa the slaves stood round the outer circuit of the whole with the cupbearers but the carver and steward if he might so be termed occupied that side of the table which was left open to their attendance on this occasion there being but six guests in all each gentleman assisted the lady under his charge to recline with her head comfortably elevated near the centre of the couch and then took his station behind her so that if she leaned back her head would rest on his bosom while he was enabled himself to reach the table and help himself or his fair partner as need might be to the delicacies offered in succession curius and fulvia he as of senatorial rank and she as a noble matron occupied the highest places paullus and lucia reclined on the right hand couch and catiline with orestilla in his bosom as the phrase ran on the left no sooner were they all placed and the due libation made of wine with an offering of salt to the domestic godsa silver group of statues occupying the centre of the board where we should now place the plateau and epergne than a louder burst of music ushered in three beautiful female slaves in succinct tunics like that seen in the sculptures of diana with half the bosom bare dancing and singing and carrying garlands in their hands of roses and myrtle woven with strips of the philyra or inner bark of the linden tree which was believed to be a specific against intoxication circling around the board in time to the soft music they crowned each of the guests and sprinkled with rich perfumes the garments and the hair of each and then with more animated and eccentric gestures as the note of the flute waxed shriller and more piercing they bounded from the banquet hall and were succeeded by six boys with silver basins full of tepid water perfumed with costly essences and soft embroidered napkins which they handed to every banqueter to wash the hands before eating this done the music died away into a low faint close and was silent and in the hush that followed an aged slave bore round a mighty flask of chian wine diluted with snow water and replenished the goblets of stained glass which stood beside each guest while another dispensed bread from a lordly basket of wrought gilded scroll work and now the feast commenced in earnest as the first course consisting of fresh eggs boiled hard with lettuce radishes endive and rockets olives of venafrum anchovies and sardines and the choicest luxury of the dayhot sausages served upon gridirons of silver with the rich gravy dripping through the bars upon a sauce of syrian prunes and pomegranate berrieswas placed upon the board for a time there was little conversation beyond the ordinary courtesies of the table and such trifling jests as were suggested by occurrences of the moment yet still in the few words that passed from time to time paullus continued often to convey his sentiments to lucia in words of double meaning keenly marked it is true but seemingly unobserved by the wily plotter opposite and more than once in handing her the goblet or loading her plate with dainties he took an opportunity again and again of pressing her not unwilling hand and still at every pressure he caught that soft momentary glance was it of love and passion or of mere coquetry and girlish wantonness succeeded by the fleeting blush pervading face neck arms and bosom never had paullus been so wildly fascinated his heart throbbed and bounded as if it would have burst his breast his head swam with a sort of pleasurable dizziness his eyes were dim and suffused and he scarce knew that he was talking though he was indeed the life of the whole company voluble witty versatile and at times eloquent so far as the topics of the day gave room for eloquence and now to the melody of lydian lutes two slaves introduced a huge silver dish loaded by the vast brawn of the umbrian boar garnished with leaves of chervil and floating in a rich sauce of anchovies the dregs of coan wine white pepper vinegar and olives the carver brandished his knife in graceful and fantastic gestures proud of his honorable task and as he plunged it into the savory meat and the delicious savor rushed up to his nostrils he laid down the blade spread out his hands in an ecstacy and cried aloud ye gods how glorious excellent well my glycon cried curius delighted with the expressive pantomine of the well skilled greek smells it so savory i have carved many a boar from lucania and from umbria also to say nothing of those from the laurentian marshes which are bad seeing that they are fed on reeds only and marsh grass most noble curius and never put i knife into such an one as this there are two inches on it of pure fat softer than marrow he was fed upon holm acorns ill be sworn and sweet chesnuts and caught in a mild south wind fewer words you scoundrel exclaimed catiline laughing at the fellows volubility and quicker carving if you wish not to visit the pistrinum you have set curius mouth watering so that he will be sped with longing before you have helped fulvia and your mistress fill up you knaves fill up nay not the chian now the falernian from the faustian hills or the caecuban which shall it be my curius the caecuban by all the gods i hold it the best vintage ever and yours is curious besides the falernian is too dry to drink before the meat afterward if as glycon says the boar hath a flavor of the south it will be excellent indeed are as you as constant paullus in your love for the boar as these other epicures cried fulvia who despite the depreciating tone in which she spoke had sent her own plate for a second slice no by the gods fulvia he replied i am but a sorry epicure and i love the boar better in his reedy fen or his wild thicket on the umbrian hills with his eye glaring red in rage and his tusks white with foam than girt with condiments and spices upon a golden dish a strange taste said curius i had for my part rather meet ten on the dining table than one in the oak woods commend me to the boar upon the table likewise said catiline still with my friend arvina at my side and a good boarspear in my hand i would like well to bide the charge of a tusker it is rare sport by hercules wonderful beings you men are said fulvia mincing her words affectedly ever in search of danger ever on the alert to kill to shed blood even if it be your own by juno i cannot comprehend it i can i can cried lucia raising her voice for the first time so that it could be heard by any others than her nearest neighbor right well can i comprehend it were i a man myself i feel that i should pant for the battle the triumph would be more than rapture and strife for its own sake maddening bliss heavens to see the gladiators wheel and charge to see their swords flash in the sun and the red blood gush out unheeded and the grim faces flushed and furious and the eyes greedily devouring the wounds of the foeman but all unconscious of their own and the play of the muscular strong limbs and the terrible death grapple and then the dull hissing sound of the death stroke and the voiceless parting of the bold spirit ye gods ye gods it is a joy to live and almost to die for paullus arvina looked at her in speechless wonder the eyes so wavering and downcast were now fixed and steady and burning with a passionate clear light there was a fiery flush on her cheek not brief and evanescent her ripe red mouth was half open shewing the snow white teeth biting the lower lip in the excitement of her feelings her whole form seemed to be dilated and more majestic than its wont bravo my girl well said my quiet lucia exclaimed catiline i knew not that she had so much of mettle in her you must have thought then that i belied my race replied the girl unblushingly for it is whispered that you are my father and i think you have looked on blood and shed it before now boars blood ha lucia but you are blunt and brave tonight is it that paullus has inspired you nay i know not she replied half apathetically but i do know that if i ever love it shall be a hero a man that would rather lie in wait until dawn to receive the fierce boar rushing from the brake upon his spear than until midnight to enfold a silly girl in his embrace then will you never love me lucia answered curius never indeed said she it must be a man whom i will love and there is nothing manly about thee save thy vices it is for those that most people love me replied curius nothing disconcerted now cato has nothing of the man about him but the virtues and i should like to know who ever thought of loving cato i never heard of any body loving cato said fulvia quietly but i have answered the girl almost fiercely none of you love him nor do i love him because he is too high and noble to be dishonored by the love of such as i am but all the good and great and generous do love him and will love his memory for countless ages i would to god i could love him what fury has possessed her whispered catiline to orestilla what ails her to talk thus first to proclaim herself my daughter and now to praise cato do not ask me replied aurelia in the same tone she was a strange girl ever and i cannot say if she likes this task that you have put upon her more wine ho bring more wine drink we each man to his mistress each lady to her lover in secrecy and silence cried the master of the revel fill up fill up let it be pure and sparkling to the brim but fulvia irritated a little by what had passed would not be silent although she saw that catiline was annoyed at the character the conversation had assumed and ere the slave had filled up the beakers she addressed lucia and wherefore dearest would you love cato i could as soon love the statue of accius naevius with his long beard on the steps of the comitium he were scarce colder or less comely than your cato because to love virtue is still something if we be vicious even and if i am not virtuous myself at least i have not lost the sense that it were good to be so i never knew that you were not virtuous my lucia interposed her mother affectionate and pious you have ever been and obedient added catiline with strong emphasis your mother my lucia and myself return thanks to the gods daily for giving us so good a child do you replied the girl scornfully the gods must have merry times then for that must needs make them laugh but good or bad i respect the great and if i ever love it will be as i said a great and a good man i fear you will never love me lucia whispered paullus in her ear unheard amid the clash of knives and flagons and the pealing of a fresh strain of music which ushered in the king of fish the grand conger garnished with prawns and soused in pungent sauce wherefore not she replied meeting his eye with a furtive sidelong glance because i for one had rather watch till midnight fifty times in the hope only of clasping lucia once in my embrace than once until dawn to kill fifty boars of umbria she made no answer but looked up into his face as if to see whether he was in earnest with an affectionate and pleading glance and then pressed her unsandalled foot against his a moment or two afterward he perceived the embroidered table cover had been drawn up with the intent of protecting her dress from the sauces of the fish which she was eating in such a manner as to conceal the greater part of her person observing this and excited beyond all restraint of ordinary prudence by the consciousness of her manner he profited by the chance to steal his arm about her waist and to his surprise almost as much as his delight he felt his hand clasped instantly in hers and pressed upon her throbbing heart the blood gushed like molten fire through his veins the fascinations of the siren had prevailed the voice of the charmer had been heard charming him but too wisely and for the moment fool that he was he fancied he loved lucia and his own pure and innocent and lovely julia was forgotten forgotten and for whom catiline had not lost one word one movement of the young couple and he perceived that although there was clearly something at work in the girls bosom which he did not comprehend she had at least obeyed his commands in captivating paullus and he now doubted not but she would persevere from vanity or passion and bind him down a fettered captive to her will determined to lose nothing by want of exertion the traitor circulated now the fiery goblet as fast as possible till every brain was heated more or less and every cheek flushed even of the women by the inspiring influence of the wine cup all dainties that were known in those days ministered to his feast oysters from baiae pheasantsa rarity but lately introduced since pompeys conquests in the easthad been brought all the way from phasis upon the southern shores of the black sea and woodcock from the valleys of ionia and the watery plains of troas to load the tables of the luxurious masters of the world livers of geese forced to an unnatural size by cramming the unhappy bird with figs and turbot fricasseed in cream and peacocks stuffed with truffles were on the board of catiline that day as on the boards of many another noble roman and the wines by which these rare dainties were diluted differed but little as wisest critics say from the madeiras and the sherries of the nineteenth century for so true is it that under the sun there is nothing new that in the foix gras of strasburg in the turbot a la creme and in the dindons aux truffes of the french metropolis the gastronomes of modern days have only reproduced the dishes whereon lucullus and hortensius feasted before the christian era the day passed pleasantly to all but to paullus arvina it flew like a dream like a delirious trance from which could he have consulted his own will he would never have awakened with the dessert and the wine cup the myrtle branch and the lute went round and songs were warbled by sweet voices full of seductive thoughts and words of passion at length the lamps were lighted and the women arose to quit the hall leaving the ruder sex to prolong the revel but as lucia rose she again pressed the fingers of arvina and whispered a request that he would see her once more ere he left the house he promised but as he did so his heart sank within him for dearly as he wished it he believed he had promised that which would prove impossible but in a little while chance as he thought it favored him for seeing that he refused the wine cup catiline after rallying him some time good humoredly said with a laugh come my arvina we must not be too hard on you you have but a young head though a stout one curius and i are old veterans of the camp old revellers and love the wine cup better than the bright eyes of beauty or the minstrels lute thou i will swear it wouldst rather now be listening to lucias lyre and may be fingering it thyself than drinking with us roisterers come never blush boy we were all young once confess if i am right the women you will find if you choose to seek them in the third chamber on the left beyond the inner peristyle we all love freedom here nor are we rigid censors curius and i will drain a flagon or two more and then join you muttering something not very comprehensible about his exertions in the morning and his inability to drink any more paullus arose delighted to effect his escape on terms so easy and left the triclinium immediately in quest of his mistress as he went out catiline burst into one of his sneering laughs and exclaimed he is in by pan the hunters god he is in the deathtoil already may i perish ill if he escape it why in the name of all the gods do you take so much pains with him said curius he is a stout fellow and i dare say a brave one and will make a good legionary or an officer perhaps but he is raw and a fool to boot raw but no fool i can assure you answered catiline no more a fool than i am and we must have him he is necessary he will be necessary soon to that girl of yours she has gone mad i think for love of him i never did believe in philtres but this is well nigh enough to make one do so pshaw answered catiline it is thou that art raw now and a fool curius she is no more in love with him than thou art it was all actingright good acting for it did once well nigh deceive me who devised it but still only acting i ordered her to win him at all hazards at all hazards aye at all i wish you would give her the like orders touching me if she obey so readily i would if it were necessary which it is not first because i have you as firmly mine as need be and secondly because fulvia would have her hearts blood ere two days had gone and that would ill suit me for the sly jade is useful take care she prove not too sly for you sergius she may obey your orders in this thing but she does so right willingly she loves the boy i tell you as madly as venus loved adonis or phaedra hyppolitus she would pursue him if he fled from her she loves him no more than she loves the musty statue of my stout grandsire sergius silo you will see one day meanwhile look that she fool you not while they were speaking paullus had reached the entrance of the chamber indicated and opening the door had entered expecting to find the three women assembled at some feminine sport or occupation but fortune again favored himopportune fortune for lucia was alone expecting him prepared for his entrance at any moment yet when he came how unprepared how shocked how terrified for she had unclasped her stola upon both her shoulders and suffered it to fall down to her girdle which kept it in its place about her hips but above those she was dressed only in a tunic of that loose fabric a sort of silken gauze which was called woven air and was beginning to be worn very much by women of licentious character this dressif that indeed could be called a dress which displayed all the outlines of the shape all the hues of the glowing skin every minute blue vein that meandered over the lovely bosomwas wrought in alternate stripes of white and silver and nothing can be imagined more beautiful than the effect of its semitransparent veil concealing just enough to leave some scope for the imagination displaying more than enough for the most prodigal of beauty she was employed in dividing her long jetblack hair with a comb of motherofpearl as he entered but she dropped both the hair and comb and started to her feet with a simulated scream covering her beautiful bust with her two hands as if she had been taken absolutely by surprise but paullus had been drinking freely and paullus saw moreover that she was not offended and if surprised surprised not unpleasantly by his coming he sprang forward caught her in his arms and clasping her to his bosom almost smothered her with kisses but shame on her fast and furiously as he kissed she kissed as closely back lucia sweet lucia do you then love me more than my lifemore than my countrymore than the gods my brave my noble paullus and will you then be mineall mine my lucia yours paul she faltered panting as if with agitation upon his bosom am i not yours already but no no no she exclaimed tearing herself from his embrace no no i had forgotten my father no i cannot my father what mean you lucia your father what of your father you are his enemy you have discovered will betray him no by the great gods you are mad lucia i have discovered nothing nor if i knew him to be the slayer of my father would i betray him never never will you swear that swear what never whatever you may learn to betray him to any living man never to carry arms or give evidence against him but faithfully and stedfastly to follow him through virtue and through vice in life and unto death to live for him and die with him unless i release you of your oath and restore you to freedom which i will never do by all the powers of light and darkness by jupiter omnipotent and pluto the avenger i swear lucia may i and all my house and all whom i love or cherish wretchedly perish if i fail you then i am yours she sighed all and for ever and sank into his arms half fainting with the violence of that prolonged excitement chapter vii the oath into what dangers would you lead me cassius julius caesar the evening had worn on to a late hour and darkness had already fallen over the earth when paullus issued stealthily like a guilty thing from lucias chamber no step or sound had come near the door no voice had called on either though they had lingered there for hours in endearments which as he judged the spirit of his host would have cost him his life if suspected and though he never dreamed of connivance he did think it strange that a man so wary and suspicious as catiline was held to be should have so fallen from his wonted prudence as to betray his adopted daughters honor by granting this most fatal opportunity he met no member of the family in the dimlighted peristyle the passages were silent and deserted no gay domestic circle was collected in the tablinum no slaves were waiting in the atrium and as he stole forth cautiously with guarded footsteps arvina almost fancied that he had been forgotten and that the master of the house believed him to have retired when he left the dining hall it was not long however before he was undeceived for as he entered the vestibule and was about to lay his hand on the lock of the outer door a tall dark figure which he recognized instantly to be that of his host stepped forward from a sidepassage and stretched out his arm in silence forbidding him by that imperious gesture to proceed ha you have tarried long he said in a deep guarded whisper our lucia truly is a most soft and fascinating creature you found her so is it not true my paullus there was something singular in the manner in which these words were uttered half mocking and half serious something between a taunting and triumphant assertion of a fact and a bitter question but nothing that betokened anger or hostility or offended pride in the speaker still paullus was so much taken by surprise and so doubtful of his entertainers meaning and the extent of his knowledge that he remained speechless in agitated and embarrassed silence what have the girls kisses clogged your lips so that they can give out no sound by the gods they were close enough to do so catiline he exclaimed starting back in astonishment and half expecting to feel a dagger in his bosom tush tush young manthink you the walls in the house of catiline have no ears nor eyes paullus arvina i know all all faltered the youth now utterly aghast ay all replied the conspirator with a harsh triumphant laugh lucia has given herself to you and you have sold yourself to catiline by all the fiends of hades better it were for you rash boy that you had neer been born than now to fail me arvina trembling with the deep consciousness of hospitality betrayed and feeling the first stings of remorse already stood thunderstricken and unable to articulate speak thundered catiline speak art thou not minemine soul and bodysworn to be mine forever alas the fatal oath sworn in the heat of passion flashed on his soul and he answered humbly and in a faint low voice how different from his wonted tones of high and manly confidence i am sworn catiline see then that thou be not forsworn little thou dreamst yet unto what thou art sworn or unto whom but know this that hell itself with all its furies would fall short of the tortures that await the traitor i am at least no traitor no traitor ha cried catiline is it an honest deed to creep into the bosom of a daughter of the house which entertained thee as a friendno traitorha ha ha thou shalt ere long learn betterha ha ha and he laughed with the fearful sneering mirth which was never excited in his breast but by things perilous and terrible and hateful in a moment however he repressed his merriment and added give me that poniard thou didst wear this morning it is mine thine cried the unhappy youth starting back as if he had received a blow thine catiline aye he replied in a hoarse voice looking into the very eyes of paul i am the slayer of the slave and regret only that i slew him without torture know you whose slave he was by any chance he was the consuls slave answered arvina almost mechanicallyfor he was utterly bewildered by all that had passedmedon my freedman thraseas cousin the consuls hawhich consuls speak fool speak ere i tear it from your throat ciceros ha ciceros catiline here is a coil and knows he of this matter i mean cicero he knows it that is to say you told him aye this morning after i spoke with you i comprehend and you shewed him the poniard so so so well give it to me i will tell you what to do hereafter i have it not with me sergius he replied thoroughly daunted and dismayed see that you meet me then bringing it with you at egerias cave as fools call it in the valley of muses at the fourth hour of night tomorrow in the meantime beware that you tell no man aught of this nor that the instrument was bought of volero ha dost thou hear me i hear catiline and wilt obey and will obey so shall it go well with thee and we shall be fast friends forever good repose to thee good my paullus and lucia he replied but in a voice of inquiry for all that he had heard of the tremendous passions and vindictive fury of the conspirator flashed on his mind and he fancied that he knew not what of vengeance would fall on the head of the soft beauty hath played her part rarely answered the monster as he dismissed him from the door which he opened with his own hand be true and you shall see her when you will betray us and both you and she shall live in agonies that shall make you call upon death fifty times ere he relieve you and with a menacing gesture he closed and barred the door behind him played her part rarely the words sank down into his soul with a chilling weight that seemed to crush every energy and hope played her part then he was a dupethe very dupe of the fiends arch mock to lip a wanton and believe her chastethe dupe of a designing harlot the sworn tool and slave of a murderera monster who had literally sold his own childs honor for all the world well knew that although lucia passed for his adopted daughter only she was his natural offspring by aurelia orestilla before their impious marriage well might he gnash his teeth and beat his breast and tear his dark hair by handfulls from his head well might he groan and curse but oh the inconsistency of man while he gave vent to all the anguish of his rage in curses against her the soft partner of his guilt and at the same time its avenger against the murderer and the traitor now his tyrant he utterly forgot that his own dereliction from the paths of rectitude and honor had led him into the dark toils in which he now seemed involved beyond any hope of extrication he forgot that to satisfy an insane and unjustifiable love of adventure and a false curiosity he had associated himself with a man whom he believed if he did not actually know to be infamous and capable of any crime he forgot that admitted into that mans house in friendship he had attempted to undermine his daughters honor and had felt no remorse till he learned that his success was owing to connivancethat his own treason had been met and repaid by deeper treason he forgot that for a wantons love he had betrayed the brightest and the purest being that drew the breath of life from the far alps to the blue waters of the far tarentumthat he had broken his souls plighted faiththat he was himself first a liar perjurer and villain alas it is the inevitable consequence the first fruit as it were of crime that guilt is still prolific that the commission of the first ill deed leads almost surely to the commission of a second of a third until the soul is filed and the heart utterly corrupted and the wretch given wholly up to the dominion of foul sin and plunged into thorough degradation arvina had thought lightly if at all of his first luxurious sin but now to the depth of his secret soul he felt that he was emmeshed and entangled in the deepest villainy all that he ever had yet heard hinted darkly or surmised of catilines gigantic schemes of wickedness rushed on him all at once he doubted nothing any longer it was clear to him as noonday distinct and definite as if it had been told to him in so many words the treason to the state concealed by individual murder and he a sworn accomplicenay a sworn slave to this murderer and traitor nor was this all his peril was no less than his guilt equal on either sidesure ruin if he should be true to his country and scarce less sure if he should join its parricides for though he had not dared say so much to catiline he had already sent the poniard to the house of cicero and a brief letter indicating all that he had learned from volero this he had done in the interval between the campus and his unlucky visit to the house of catiline whom he then little deemed to be the man of whom he was in quest doubtless ere this time the cutler had been summoned to the consuls presence and the chief magistrate of the republic had learned that the murderer of his slave was the very person whom he had bound himself by oaths so strong that he shuddered at the very thought of them to support and defend to the utmost what was he then to do how to proceed since to recede appeared impossible how was he to account to the conspirator for his inability to produce the poniard at their appointed meeting how should he escape the pursuit of his determined vengeance if he should shun the meeting and then lucia the recollection guilty and degraded as he knew her to be of her soft blandishments of her rare beauty of her wild and inexplicable manner adding new charms to that forbidden bliss yet thrilled in every sense and must he give her up no madness was in the very thought so strangely had she spread her fascinations round him and yet did he love her no perish the thought love is a high a holy a pure feelingthe purest our poor fallen nature is capable of experiencing no this fierce desperate guilty passion was no more like true love than the whirlwind that upheaves the tortured billows and hurls the fated vessel on the treacherous quicksands is like to the beneficent and gentle breeze that speeds it to the haven of its hopes in peace and honor after a little while consumed in anxious and uneasy thoughts he determinedas cowards of the mind determine everto temporise to await events to depend upon the tide of circumstance he would he thought keep the appointment with his masterfor such he felt that catiline now was indeedhowever he might strive to conceal the fact endeavor to learn what were his real objects and then determine what should be his own course of action doubtful and weak of principle and most infirm of purpose he shrunk alike from breaking the oath he had been entrapped into taking and from committing any crime against his country his countryto the roman patriotism stood for religionpride habit education honor interest all were combined in that word country and could he be untrue to rome his better spirit cried out no from every nerve and artery of his body and then his evil genius whispered lucia and he wavered meantime had no thought crossed him of his own pure and noble julia deserted thus and overlooked for a mere wanton many times many times that day had his mind reverted to her when first he went to catalines house he went with the resolution of leaving it at an early hour so soon as the feast should be over and seeking her while there should yet be time to ramble among the flowerbeds on the hill of gardens or perchance to drive out in his chariot which he had ordered to be held in readiness toward the falls of the anio or on the proud emilian way afterward in the whirl of his mad intoxication for the fascinating lucia all memory of his true love was lost as the chaste moonlight may be dimmed and drowned for a while by the red glare of the torches brandished in some licentious orgy nor did he think of her again till he found himself saddened and selfdisgusted plunged into perilperhaps into ruin by his own guilty conduct and then when he did think it was with remorse and selfreproach and consciousness of disloyalty so bitterly and keenly painfulyet unaccompanied by that repentance which steadily envisages past wrong and determines to amend in futurethat he shook off the recollection whenever it returned with wilful stubbornness and resolved on forgetting for the present the being whom a few short hours before he would have deemed it impossible that he should ever think of but with joy and rapturous anticipation occupied in these fast succeeding moods and fancies paullus had made his way homeward from the house of catiline so far as to the cerolian place at the junction of the sacred way and the carinae he paused here a moment and grasping his fevered brow with his hand recalled to mind the strange occurrences most unexpected and unfortunate which had befallen him since he stood there that morning each singly trivial each unconnected as it seemed with the rest and of little moment yet all when united forming a chain of circumstances by which he was now fettered hand and foothis casual interview with catiline on the hill his subsequent encounter of victor and aristius fuscus the recognition of his dagger by the stout cutler volero the death of varus in the hippodrome his own victorious exercises on the plain the invitation to the feast the sumptuous banquet and last alas and most fatal the too voluptuous and seductive lucia just at this moment the doors of ciceros stately mansion were thrown open and a long train came sweeping out in dark garments with blazing torches and music doleful and piercing and women chanting the shrill funereal strain and then upon a bier covered with black the rude wooden coffin peculiar to the slave of the murdered medon behind him followed the whole household of the consul and last to the extreme astonishment of paullus preceded by his lictors and leaning on the arm of his most faithful freedman came cicero himself doing unusual honor for some cause known to himself alone to the manes of his slaughtered servant as they passed on toward the capuan gate of the city the consuls eyes fell directly on the form of arvina where he stood revealed in the full glare of the torchlight and as he recognised him he made a sign that he should join him which under those peculiar circumstances he felt that he could not refuse to do sadly and silently they swept through the splendid streets and under the arched gate and filed along the celebrated appian way passing the tomb of the proud scipios on the left hand with its superb sarcophagifor that great house had never from time immemorial been wont to burn their deadand on the right a little farther on the noble temple and the sacred slope of mars and the old statue of the god which had once sweated blood prescient of thrasymene on they went frightening the echoes of the quiet night with their wild lamentations and the clapping of their hands sending the glare of their funereal torches far and wide through the cultured fields and sacred groves and rich gardens until they reached at length the pile hard by the columbarium or slaveburyingplace of ciceros household then the rites performed duly the dust thrice sprinkled on the body and the farewell pronounced the corpse was laid upon the pile and the tall spire of bloodred flame went up wavering and streaming through the night rich with perfumes and gums and precious ointment so noble was the liberality of the good consul even in the interment of his more faithful slaves no words were uttered to disturb the sound of the ceremony until the flames died out and the smouldering embers quenched with wine thrasea as the nearest relative of the deceased gathered the ashes and inurned them when they were duly labelled and consigned to their niche in the columbarium and then the final ilicet pronounced the sad solemnity was ended then though not until then did cicero address the young man but then as if to make up for his previous silence he made him walk by his side all the way back to the city conversing with him eagerly about all that had passed thanking him for the note and information he had sent concerning volero and anticipating the immediate discovery of the perpetrators of that horrid crime i have not had the leisure to summon volero before me he added i wished also that you arvina should be present when i examine him i judge that it will be best when we shall have dismissed all these except the lictors to visit him this very night he is a thrifty and laborious artisan and works until late by lamp light we will go thither if you have naught to hinder you at once arvina could do no otherwise than assent but his heart beat violently and he could scarcely frame his words so dreadful was his agitation yet by dint of immense exertion he contrived to maintain the outward appearance of composure which he was very far from feeling and even to keep up a connected conversation as they walked along returning home at a much quicker pace than they had gone out it was comparatively but a short time before they arrived at the house of cicero and there dismissed their followers many of the slaves and freedmen of arvina having joined the procession in honour of their fellowservant thrasea thence reserving two lictors only of the twelve the consul with his wonted activity hurried directly forward by the sacred way to the arch of fabius and then as the young men had gone in the morning through the forum toward the cutlers shop taking the shortest way and evidently well acquainted with the spot beforehand i caused the funeral to take place this night he said to arvina instead of waiting the due term of eight days on purpose that i might create no suspicion in the minds of the slayers they never will suspect him we have buried even now to be the man they slew last night and will fancy it may be that the body is not discovered even it will be well if it prove so replied paullus feeling that he must say something and fearful of committing himself by many words it will and i think probably it may answered cicero but see i was right there shines the light from voleros shop though all the other booths have been closed long ago and the streets are already silent there are but few men even in this great city of whom i know not something beyond the mere names think upon that young man and learn to do likewise cultivate memory above all things except virtue i should have thought such things too mean to occupy a place even in the mind of cicero answered arvina nothing young man that pertains to our fellow men is too mean to occupy the mind of the noblest why should it since it doth occupy the mind of the gods who are all great and omnipotent you lean not then to the creed of epicurus which teaches who i interrupted cicero almost indignantly no by the immortal gods nor i trust my young friend do you believe mebut ha he added in a quick and altered tone what have we here there is some villainy in the windaway away there lictors apprehend that fellow for as they came within about a bowshot of the booth of volero the sound of a slight scuffle was heard from within and the light of the lamp became very dim and wavering as if it had been overset and in a moment went out altogether but its last glimmering ray shewed a tall sinewy figure making out of the door and bounding at a great pace up the street toward the carmental gate arvina caught but a momentary glance of the figure yet was that glance enough he recognized the spare but muscular form all brawn and bone and sinew he recognized the long and pardlike boundsit was his tyrant and as he thought his fate the lictors rushed away upon his track but there seemed little chance that encumbered with their heavy fasces they would overtake so swift a runner as by the momentary sight they had of him the fugitive appeared to be arvina and the consul speedily reached the booth volero volero but there came forth no answer volero what ho volero they listened eagerly painfully with ears sharpened by excitement there came a sounda plash as of a heavy drop of water falling on the stone floor another and anotherthe trickling of a continuous stream all was dark as a moonless midnight yet cicero took one step forward and laid his hand upon the counter it splashed into a pool of some warm liquid now may the gods avert he cried it is blood there has been murder here run my arvina run to furbos cookshop across the way there opposite they sit up there all nightcry murder ho help murder a minute had scarcely passed before the heavy knocking of the young man had aroused the housethe neighborhood and at the cry of murder many men some who had not retired for the night and some half dressed as they had sprung up from their couches came rushing with their weapons snatched at random and with torches in their hands it was but too true the laborious artizan was dead murdered that instant at his own counter at his very work he had not moved or risen from his seat but had fallen forward with his head upon the board and from beneath the head was oozing in a continuous stream the dark red blood which had overflowed the counter and trickled down and made the paved floor one great pool ye gods what blood what blood exclaimed the first who came in poor volero alas cried furbo it is not an hour since he supped on a pound of sausages at my table and now all is over they raised his head his eyes were wide open and the whole face bore an expression neither of agony or terror so much as of wild surprise the throat was cut from ear to ear dividing the windpipe the carotid arteries and jugular veins on both sides and so strong had been the hand of the assassin and so keen the weapon that the neck was severed quite to the back bone among the spectators was a gladiator he whose especial task it was to cut the throats of the conquered victims on the arena he looked eagerly and curiously at the wound for a moment and then said a back stroke from behinda strong hand and a broadbacked knifethe man has been slain by a gladiator or one who knows the gladiators trick the man said the consul calmly has been killed by an acquaintance a friend or a familiar customer he had not even risen from his seat to speak with him and see the burnisher is yet grasped in his hand with which he was at work ha he exclaimed as his lictors entered panting and tired by their fruitless chase could you not overtake him we never saw him any more my consul replied both men in one breath let his head down my friend said cicero turning much disappointed as it seemed to furbo let it lie as it was when we found it clear the shop lictors take the names of the witnesses one of you keep watch at the door until you are relieved lock it and give the key to the praetor when he shall arrive the other go straightway and summon cornelius lentulus he is the praetor for this ward go to your homes my friends and make no tumult in the streets i pray you this shall be looked to and avenged your consul watches over you live live the consul the good consul the man of the people shouted the crowd as they dispersed quietly to their homes arvina come with me to whom told you that you had found and volero sold this dagger he asked very sternly to no one cicero marcus aurelius victor and aristius fuscus were with me when he recognized it for his work no one else no one save our slaves and they he added in a breath could not have heard what passed hath no one else seen it as i was stripping for the contests on the campus catiline saw it in my girdle and admired its fabric catiline ay consul and you told him that volero had made it consul no but with the word he turned as white as marble had it been daylight his face had betrayed him as it was cicero observed that his voice trembled catiline is the man he said solemnly the man who slew medon yesternight who has slain volero now catiline is the man but this craves wary walking young man young man beware methinks you are on the verge of great danger get thee home to thy bed and again i say beware chapter viii the true love dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief julius caesar the sun rose clear and bright on the following morning the air was fresh and exhilarating and full of mirthful inspiration but paullus arvina rose unrefreshed and languid with his mind ill at ease for the reaction which succeeds ever to the reign of any vehement excitement had fallen on him with its depressing weight and not that only but keen remorse for the past and if possible anxiety yet keener for the future disastrous dreams had beset his sleeping hours and at his waking they and the true occurrences of the past day seemed all blended and confused into one horrible and hideous vision now he envisaged the whole dark reality of his past conduct of his present situation lucia the charming siren of the previous evening appeared in her real colors as the immodest passionate wanton catiline as the monster that indeed he was and yet alas alas as the clear perception of the truth dawned on him it was but coupled with a despairing sense that to these he was linked inevitably and forever the oath the awful oath which he had sworn in the fierce whirl of passion registered by the archtraitorthe oath involving not alone his own temporal and eternal welfare but that of all whom he loved or cherished his own pure beautiful inimitable julia to whom his heart now reverted with a far deeper and more earnest tenderness after its brief inconstancy as he compared her strong yet maidenly and gentle love with the wild and ungovernable passions of the wanton for whom he had once sacrificed her paullus arvina was not naturally not radically evil far from it his impulses were naturally virtuous and correct his calm sober thoughts always honorable and upright but his passions were violent and unregulated his principles of conduct not definitively formed and his mind wavering unsettled and unsteady his passions on the previous day had betrayed him fatally through the dark machinations of the conspirator and the strange fascinations of his lovely daughter into the perpetration of a great crime he had bound himself by an oath too dreadful to be thought of without shuddering to the commission of yet darker crimes in future and now the mists of passion had ceased to bedim his mental vision his eyes were opened that he saw and repented most sincerely the past guilt how was he to avoid the future to no man in these days could there be a doubt even for a momenthowever great the sin of swearing such an oath no one in these days knowing and repenting of the crime would hesitate a moment or fancy himself bound because he had committed one vile sin in pledging himself thus to guilt to rush on deeper yet into the perpetration of wickedness the sin were in the swearing not in the breaking of an oath so vile and shameful but those were days of dark heathenish superstition and it was far beyond the reach of any intellect perhaps of that day to arrive at a conclusion simple as that to which any mind would now leap as it were instinctively in those days an omitted rite an error in the ceremonial tribute paid to the marble idol was held a deeper sin than adultery incest or blood shedding and the bare thought of the vengeance due for a broken oath would often times keep sleepless with mere dread the eyes of men who could have slumbered calmly on the commission of the deadliest crimes such then was the state of arvinas mind on that morninggrieving with deep remorse for the faults of which he confessed himself guilty trembling at the idea of rushing into yet more desperate guilt and at the same time feeling bound to do so in despite of his better thoughts by the fatal oath which bound him to the arch traitor while he was sitting in his lonely chamber with his untasted meal of ripe figs and delicate white bread and milk and honeycomb before him devouring his own heart in his fiery anguish and striving with all his energies of intellect to devise some scheme by which he might escape the perils that seemed to hem him round on every side his faithful freedman entered bearing a little billet on which his eye had scarcely fallen before he recognized the shapely characters of julias wellknown writing he broke the seal which connected the flaxen band and with a trembling eye and a soul that feared it knew not what from the very consciousness of guilt he read as follows a day has passed my paullus and we have not met the first day in which we have not met and conversed together since that whereon you asked me to be yours i would not willingly my paul be as those miserable and most foolish girls of whom my mother has informed me who given up to jealousy and doubt torment themselves in vain and alienate the noble spirits which are bound to them by claims of affection only not of compulsion or restraint nor am i so unreasonable as to think that a man has no duties to perform other than to attend a womans leisure the gods forbid it for whom i love i would see great and famous and esteemed in the worlds eyes as highly as in mine the house it is true is our spherethe forum and the campus the great world with its toils its strifes and its honors yours all this i speak to myself often i repeated it many many times yesterdayit ought to have satisfied meit did satisfy my reason paul but it spoke not to my heart that whispers ever he came not yesterday to see me he promised yet he came not and it will not be answered are you sick paullus that you came not surely in that case you had sent for me hortensia would have gone with me to visit you no you are not sick else most surely i had known it are you then angry with me or offended unconscious am i dearest of any fault against you in word thought or deed yet will i humble myself if you are indeed wroth with me have i appeared indifferent or cold oh paul believe it not if i have not expressed the whole of my deep tenderness which is poured out all all on thee alonemy yearning and continued love that counts the minutes when thou art not near me it is not that i cease ever to think of thee to adore thee but that it were unmaidenly and overbold to tell thee of it see now if i have not done so here and my hand trembles and my cheek burns and almost i expect to see the pallid paper blush to find itself the bearer of words so passionate as these but you will pardon me and come to me forthwith and tell me if anything in what i have displeased thee it is a lovely morning and hortensia has just learned from caius bibulus that at high noon the ambassadors of the wild allobroges will march in with their escort over the mulvian bridge she wishes much to see the pomp for we are told that their stature is gigantic and their presence noble and their garb very wild yet magnificent withal and martial shall we go forth and see them hortensia will carry me in her carpentum and you can either ride with us on horseback or if you be not over proud take our reins yourself as charioteer or what will perhaps be the best of all come in your own car and escort us i need not say that i wish to see you now for that i wish always come then and quickly if you would pleasure your own julia sweet girl he exclaimed as he finished reading it pure as the snow upon soracte yet warm and tender as the dove inimitable julia and iioh ye gods ye gods that beheld it and he smote his brow heavily with his hand and bit his lip till the blood almost sprang beneath the pressure of his teeth but recovering himself in a moment he turned to thraseawho brought this billet doth he wait phaedon hortensias greek boy brought it noble paullus he waits for your answer in the atrium quick then quick thrasea give me a reed and paper and snatching the materials he wrote hastily chance only evil chance most lovely julia and business of some weight restrained me from you most unwilling yesterday more i shall tell you when we meetindeed all for what can i wish to conceal from you the better portion of my soul need i say that i comenot alas on the wings of my love or i should be beside you as i write but as quickly as the speed of horses may whirl me to your presence until then fare you well and confide in the fidelity of paullus give it to phaedon he said tossing the note to thrasea and say to him if he make not the better haste i shall be at hortensias house before him and then hark ye tell some of those knaves in the hall without to make ready with all speed my light chariot and yoke the two black horses aufidus and acheron with all speed mark ye and then return good thrasea for i have much to say to you before i go when he was left alone he arose from his seat walked three or four times to and fro his chamber in anxious and uneasy thought and then saying yes yes i will not betray him but i will take no step in the business any farther and i will tell him so tonight i will tell him moreover that cicero has the dagger for now that volero is slain i see not well how it can be identified the gods defend me from the dark ones whom i have invoked i will not be untrue to rome nor to julia any moreperish the whole earth rather ay and let us too perish innocent better than to live guilty as he made up his mind by a great effort to the better course the freedman returned and announcing that the car would be ready forthwith inquired what dress he should bring him never mind that what i have on will do well enough with a petasus for the sun shines so brightly that it will be scarce possible to drive bare headed but i have work for you of more importance you know the cave of egeria as men call it in the valley of the muses surely my paullus i know i know but have you ever marked the ground especially around the cavewhat opportunities there be for concealment or the like not carefully he answered but i have noticed that there is a little gorge just beyond the grotto broken with crags and blocks of tufo and overgrown with much brushwood and many junipers and ivy that will do then i warrant me replied arvina now mark what i tell you thrasea for it may be that my life shall depend on your acting as i direct at the fourth hour of the night i am to meet one in the grotto on very secret business whom i mistrust somewhat who it is i may not inform you but as i think my plans will not well suit his councils i should not be astonished were he to have slaves or even gladiators with him to attack mebut not dreaming that i suspect anything he will not take many now i would have you arm all my freedmen and some half dozen of the trustiest slaves so as to have in all a dozen or fifteen with corslets under their tunics and boarspears and swords you must be careful that you are not seen going thither and you were best send them out by different roads so as to meet after nightfall hide yourselves closely somewhere not far from the caverns mouth whence you may see unseen yourselves whatever passes i will carry my light hunting horn and if you hear its blast rush down and surround the cave but hurt no man nor strike a blow save in selfdefence until i bid you do you comprehend me i comprehend and will obey you to the letter paullus answered the grave freedman but will not you be armed i will my thrasea leave thou a leathern hunting helmet here on the table and light scaled cuirass which i will do on under my toga i shall be there at the fourth hour precisely but it were well that ye should be on your posts by the second hour or soon after for it may be he too will lay an ambuscade and so all may be discovered it shall be done most noble master and see that ye take none but trustworthy men and that ye all are silentto would be ruin as silent as the grave my paullus answered the freedman the car and horses are prepared paullus exclaimed a slave entering hastily who goes with me to hold the reins asked his master the boy myron it is well fetch me a petasus and lay the toga in the chariot i may want it now thrasea i rely on you rememberbe prudent sure and silent else may i perish ill replied the faithful servitor as his master throwing the broad brimmed hat carelessly on his curly locks rushed out as if glad to seek relief from his own gloomy thoughts in the excitement of rapid motion and scarcely pausing to observe the condition or appearance of his beautiful black coursers sprang into the low car of bronze shaped not much differently from an old fashioned arm chair with its back to the horses seized the reins and drove rapidly away standing erectfor the car contained no seatswith the boy myron clinging to the rail behind him a few minutes brought him through the cyprian lane and the suburra to the virbian slope by which he gained the viminal hill and the hortensian villa at the door of which in a handsome street leading through the quirinal gate to the flaminian way or great northern road of italy stood the carpentum drawn by a pair of noble mules awaiting its fair freight this was a twowheeled covered vehicle set apart mostly for the use of ladies and though without springs was as comfortable and luxurious a carriage as the art of that day could produce nor was there one in rome with the exception of those kept for public use in the sacred processions that could excel that of the rich and elegant hortensia the pannels were beautifully painted and the arched top or tilt supported by gilded caryatides at the four corners its curtains and cushions were of fine purple cloth and altogether though far less convenient it was a much gayer and more sumptuous looking vehicle than the perfection of modern coach building the ladies were both waiting in the atrium when the young man dismounted from his car and never had his julia he thought looked more lovely than she did this morning with the redundant masses of her rich hair confined by a net of green and gold and a rich pallium or shawl of the same colors gracefully draped over her snowy stola and indicating by the soft sweep of its outlines the beauties of a figure which it might veil but could not conceal joyously in the frank openness of her pure nature she sprung forward to meet him with both her fair hands extended and the ingenuous blood rising faintly to her pale cheeks dear dearest pauli am so happy so rejoiced to see you nothing could be more tender more affectionate than all her air her words her manner love flashed from her bright eyes irrepressible played in the dimples of her smiling mouth breathed audible in every tone of her soft silvery voice yet was there nothing that the gravest and most rigid censor could have wished otherwisenothing that he could have pronounced even for a moment too warm or too free for the bearing of the chariest maiden the very artlessness of her emotions bore evidence to their purity their holiness she was rejoiced to see her permitted lover she felt no shame in that emotion of chaste joy and would no more have dreamed of concealing it from him whom she loved so devotedly than of masking her devotion to the gods under a veil of indifference or coldness here was the very charm of her demeanor as here was the difference between her manner and that of her rival lucia in julia every thought that sprang from her heart was uttered by her lips in frank and fearless innocence she had no thought she was ashamed of no wish she feared to utter her clear bright eyes dwelt unabashed and fondly on the face of him she loved and no scrutiny could have detected in their light one glance of unquiet or immodest passion her manner was warm and unreserved toward paul because she had a right to love him and cared not who knew that she did so lucias was as cold as snow on the contrary yet it required no second glance to perceive that the coldness was but the cover superinduced to hide passions too warm for revelation her eye was downcast yet did its stolen glances speak things the secret consciousness of which would have debased the other in her own estimation beyond the hope of pardon her tongue was guarded and her words slow and carefully selected for her imaginations would have made the brazen face of the world blush for shame could it have heard them spoken hortensia smiled to witness the manifest affection of her sweet child but the smile was she knew not why half mournful as she said you are unwise my julia to show this truant how much you prize his coming how painfully his absence depresses you sages declare that women should not let their lords guess even how much they are loved why mother replied julia her bright face gleaming radiantly with the pure lustre of her artless spirit i am glad to see him i do prize his coming i do love paullus why then should i dissemble when to do so were dishonest and were folly likewise you should not tell him so my child replied the mother i fear you should not tell him so men are not like us women who love but the more devotedly the more fondly we are cherished there is i fear something of the hunters of the conquerors ardour in their passion the pursuit is the great allurement the winning the great rapture and the prize once securely won too often cast aside and disregarded no no returned the girl eagerly fixing her eyes on her lovers features as if she would read therein the outward evidences of that nobility of soul which she believed to exist within i will not believe it it were against all gratitude all honor all hearttruth no i will not believe it and if i did hortensia by all the gods i had rather live without love than hold it on so vile a tenure of deceit what treasure up the secrets of your soul from your souls lord no no i would as soon conceal my devotion from the powers of heaven as my affections from their rightful master i for one never will believe that all men are selfish and unfaithful may the gods grant my julia that sad experience shall never teach you that they are so i at least will believe and pray that what his sex may be soever our paullus will prove worthy ever of that best gift of god a pure womans pure and unselfish love oh may it be so answered paullus clasping his hands fervently together may i die ere i wrong my julia and be you sure sweet girl that your simple trust is philosophy far truer than the sages lore base must his nature be and his heart corrupt who remains unsubdued to artlessness and love such as yours my julia but tell us now said the elder lady what was it that detained you and where were you all the day we expected you till the seventh hour of the night yet you came not i will tell you hortensia he replied as we drive along for i had rather do so where there be no ears to overhear us you must let me be your charioteer today and your venerable greyheaded coachman shall ride with my wild imp myron in the car if you will permit it willingly she replied then something strange has happened is it not so i knew it exclaimed julia clasping her snowy hands together i knew it i have read it in his eye this half hour what can it be it is something fearful i am certain nay nay be not alarmed if there were danger it is passed already but come let me assist you to the carriage i will tell you all as we go but if we do not make good speed the pomp will have passed the bridge before we reach it the ladies made no more delay but took their places in the carriage paul occupying the front seat and guiding the sober mules with far more ease than hortensias aged charioteer experienced in restraining the speed of arvinas fiery coursers and keeping them in their place behind the heavier carpentum the narrow streets were now passed and threading the deep arch of the quirinal gate they struck into a lane skirting the base of the hill of gardens on the right hand by which they gained the great flaminian way just on the farther confines of the campus when they drove rapidly toward the milvian bridge built a few years before by aemilius scaurus and esteemed for many a year the masterpiece of roman architecture as soon as they had cleared the confines of the busy city within which the throng of vehicles and the passengers as well on foot as on horseback compelled arvina to give nearly the whole of his attention to the guidance of the muleshe slackened the reins and leaving the docile and wellbroken animals to choose their own way giving only an occasional glance to their movements commenced the detail of his adventures at the point where he parted from them on the night before the last many were the emotions of fear and pity and anxiety which that tale called forth and more than once the tears of julia were evoked by sympathy first with her lovers daring then with the grief of thrasea but not a shade of distrust came to cloud her pure spirit for paullus mentioned nothing of his interview with catiline on the caelian or in the campus much less of his dining with him or detecting in him the murderer of the hapless volero still he did not attempt to conceal that both cicero and himself had suspicions of the identity of the double murderer or that he was about to go forth that very evening for the purpose of attemptingas he represented itto ascertain beyond doubt the truth of his suspicions and here it was singular that julia evinced not so much alarm or perturbation as her mother whether it was that she underrated the danger he was like to run or overrated the prowess and valor of her lover but so it was for though she listened eagerly while he was speaking and gazed at him wistfully after he had become silent she said nothing her beautiful eyes it is true swam with big teardrops for a moment and her nether lip quivered painfully but she mastered her feelings and after a short space began to talk joyously about such subjects as were suggested by the pleasant scenery through which their road lay or the various groups of people whom they met on the way ere long the shrill blast of a cavalry trumpet was heard from the direction of the bridge and a cloud of dust surging up in the distance announced the approach of the train there was a small green space by the wayside covered with short mossy turf and overshadowed by the spreading branches of a single chesnut beneath which paullus drew up the mules of hortensias carriage directing the old charioteer who seemed hard set to manage his highbred and fiery steeds to wheel completely off the road and hold them well in hand on the green behind him by this time the procession had drawn nigh and two mounted troopers glittering in casques of highly polished bronze with waving crests of horsehair corslets of burnished brass and cassocks of bright scarlet cloth dashed by as hard as their fiery gallic steeds could trot their harness clashing merrily from the rate at which they rode before these men were out of sight a troop of horse rode past in serried order five abreast with a square crimson banner bearing in characters of gold the wellknown initials s p q r and surmounted by a gilded eagle nothing could be more beautifully accurate than the ordered march and exact discipline of this little band their horses stepping proudly out as if by one common impulse in perfect time to the occasional notes of the lituus or cavalry trumpet by which all their manoeuvres were directed and the men hardy and finelooking figures in the prime of life bestriding with an air of perfect mastery their fiery chargers and bearing the weight of their heavy panoply beneath the burning sunshine of the italian noon as though a march of thirty miles were the merest childs play about half a mile in the rear of this escort so as to avoid the dust which hung heavily and was a long time subsiding in the breathless atmosphere came the train of the ambassadors from the gaulish highlands and on these men were the eyes of the roman ladies fixed with undisguised wonder not unmixed with admiration for their giant stature strong limbs and wild barbaric dresses were as different from those of the wellordered legionaries as were their long light tresses their blue eyes keen and flashing as a falcons and their fair ruddy skins from the clear brown complexions dark locks and black eyes of the italian race the first of these wild people was a young warrior above six feet in height mounted on a superb grey charger which bore his massive bulk as if it were unconscious of his burthen his large blue eyes wandered around him on all sides with a quick flashing glance that took in everything yet seemed surprised at nothing though almost everything which he beheld must have been strange to him his long red hair flowed down in wavy masses over his neck and shoulders and his upper lip though his cheeks and his chin were closely shaven was clothed with an immense moustache the ends of which curled upward nearly to his eyes upon his head he wore a casque of bronze covered with studs of silver and crested by two vast polished horns the spoil of the fiercest animal of europes foreststhe gigantic and indomitable urus a coat of mail composed of bright steel rings interwoven in the gaulish fashion covered his body from the throat downward to the hips leaving his strong arms bare to the shoulder though they were decorated with so many chains bracelets and armlets and broad rings of gold and silver as would have gone far to protect them from a sword cut his legs were clothed unlike those of any southern people in tightlysitting pantaloonsbraccae as they were calledof gaily variegated tartans precisely similar to the trews of the scottish highlandera much more ancient part of the costume by the way than the kilt or short petticoat now generally wornand these trews as well as the streaming plaid which he wore belted gracefully about his shoulders shone resplendent with checkers of the brightest scarlet azure and emerald and white interspersed here and there with lines and squares of darker colors giving relief and harmony to the general effect a belt of leather studded with bosses and knobs of coral and polished mountain pebbles girded his waist and supported a large purse of some rich fur with a formidable dirk at the right side and at the left suspended by gilt chains from the girdle a long straight cutting broadsword with a basket hiltthe genuine claymore or great swordto resist the sweep of which marcellus had been fain nearly five hundred years before to double the strength of the roman casque and to add a fresh layer of wrought iron to the tough fabric of the roman buckler this ponderous blade constituted with the dagger the whole of his offensive armature but there was slung on his left shoulder a small round targe of the hide of the mountain bull bound at the rim and studded massively with bronze and having a steel pike projecting from the centrein all respects the same instrument as that with which the clans received the british bayonet at preston pans and falkirk the charger of this gallantlyattired chief was bedecked like his rider with all the martial trappings of the day his bridle mounted with bits of ponderous spanish fabric was covered with bosses gemmed with amber and unwrought coral his housings of variegated plaid were elaborately fringed with embroideries of gold and his rich scarlet poitrel was decked in the true taste of the western savage with tufts of human hair every tuft indicating a warrior slain and a hostile head embalmed in the coffers of the valiant rider see julia see whispered arvina as he passed slowly by their chariot that must be one of their great chiefs and a man of extraordinary prowess look at the horns of the mighty urus on his helmet a brute fiercer and well nigh as large as a numidian elephant he must have slain it singlehanded in the forest else had he not presumed to wear its trophies which belong only to the greatest of their champions for every stud of silver on his casque of bronze he must have fought in a pitched battle and for each tuft of hair upon his chargers poitrel he must have slain a foe in handtohand encounter there are eighteen tufts on this side and i warrant me as many on the other doubtless he has already stricken down thirtysix foemen and he numbers not himself as yet so many years ye gods what monsters exclaimed julia shuddering at the idea of human hair used as a decoration are they not anthropophagi the gauls my paullus no by the gods julia answered arvina laughing but very valiant warriors and hospitable beyond measure to those who visit their native mountains admirers too of women whom they regard as almost divine beyond all things i see that stout fellow looking wild admiration at you now from his clear blue eyes though he would fain be thought above the reach of wonder are they believers in the gods or atheists as well as barbarous by jupiter neither barbarous to speak the truth nor atheists they worship mercury and jove mars and apollo and diana as we do and though their tongues be something wild and their usages seem strange to us it cannot be denied that they are a brave and noble race and at this time good friends to the roman people mark that old chieftain he is the headman of the tribe and leader of the embassy i doubt not while he was speaking a dozen other chiefs had ridden by accompanied by the chiefs of the roman escort some men in the prime of life some grizzled and weatherbeaten and having the trace of many a hardfought field in the scars that defaced their sunburnt visages but the last was an old man with long silver hair and eyebrows and mustachios white as the snow on his native jura the principal personage evidently of the band for his casque was plated with gold and his shirt of mail richly gilded and the very plaid which he wore alternately checked with scarlet black and gold he also as he passed turned his deep grey eye toward the little group on the green and his face lightened up as he surveyed the athletic form and vigorous proportions of the young patrician and he leaned toward the officer who rode beside him a high crested tribune of the tenth legion and enquired his name audibly the soldier who had been nodding drowsily over his chargers neck tired by the long and dusty ride looked up half bewildered for he had taken no note of the spectators but as his eyes met those of arvina he smiled and waved his hand for they were old companions and he laughed as he gave the required information to the ancient warrior the gaze of the old man fell next on the lovely lineaments of julia and dwelt there so long that the girl lowered her eyes abashed but when she again raised them supposing that he had passed by she still met the firm penetrating quiet gaze rivetted on her face for he had turned half round in the saddle as he rode along a milder light came into his keen hawklike eye and a benignant smile illuminated his gray weatherbeaten features as he surveyed and marked the ingenuous and artless beauty of her whole form and face and he whispered into the tribunes ear something that made him too turn back and wave his hand to paul and laugh merrily now drive us homeward paullus said hortensia as the cohort of infantry which closed the procession marched steadily along dusty and dark with sweat yet proud in their magnificent array and solid in their iron discipline drive us homeward as quickly as you may you will dine with us and if you must need go early to your meeting we will not hinder you gladly will i dine with you but i must say farewell soon after the third hour they soon arrived at the hospitable villa and shortly afterward the pleasant and social meal was served but paul was not himself though the lips he loved best poured forth their fluent music in his ear and the eyes which he deemed the brightest laughed on him in their speaking fondness still he was sad silent and abstracted and julia marked it all and when he rose to say farewell just as the earliest shades of night were falling she arose too and as she accompanied him to the door leaning familiarly on his arm she said you have not told me all paullus i thought so while you were yet speaking but now i am sure of it i will not vex you at this time with questions but will devour my anxiety and grief but tomorrow tomorrow paullus if you love me indeed you will tell me all that disturbs you true love has no concealment from true love do not i pray you answer me but fare you well and good fortunes follow you chapter ix the ambush my friends that is not so sir we are your enemies two gentlemen of verona it was already near the fourth hour of the roman night or about a quarter past eight of our time when paullus issued from the capuan gate in order to keep his appointment with the conspirator and bold as he was and fearless under ordinary circumstances it would be useless to deny that his heart beat fast and anxiously under his steel cuirass as he strode rapidly along the appian way to the place of meeting the sun had long since set and the moon which was in her last quarter had not as yet risen so that although the skies were perfectly clear and cloudless there was but little light by which to direct his footsteps toward the valley of the muses had he not been already familiar with the way stepping out rapidly for he was fearful now of being too late at the place appointed he soon passed the two branches of the beautiful and sparkling almo wherein the priests of cybele were wont to lave the statue of their goddess amid the din of brazen instruments and sacred song and a little further on arrived at the crossroad where the way to ardea in the latin country branched off to the right hand from the great appian turnpike at this point there was a small temple sacred to bacchus and a little grove of elms and plane trees overrun with vines on which the ripe clusters consecrated to the god were hanging yet though the season of the vintage had elapsed safe from the hand of passenger or truant schoolboy turning around the angle of this building arvina entered a dim lane overshadowed by the tall trees of the grove which wound over two or three little hillocks and then sweeping downward to the three kindred streamlets which form the sources of the almo followed their right bank up the valley of the muses had the mind of arvina been less agitated than it was by dark and ominous forebodings that walk had been a pleasant one in the calm and breezeless evening the stars were shining by thousands in the deep azure sky the constant chirrup of the shrillvoiced cicala not mute as yet although his days of tuneful life were well nigh ended rose cheerfully above the rippling murmurs of the waters and the mysterious rustling of the herbage rejoicing to drink up the copious dew and heard by fits and starts from the thick clumps of arbutus on the hills or the thorn bushes on the waters brink the liquid notes of the nightingale gushed out charming the ear of darkness for the first half mile of his walk the young patrician met several persons on the waytwo or three pairs of lovers as they seemed of the lower orders strolling affectionately homeward a party of rural slaves returning from their labours on some suburban farm to their masters house and more than one loaded chariot but beyond this all was lonely and silent with the exception of the stream the insects and the vocal nightbird there was no sound or sight that would seem to indicate the vicinity of any human being as arvina passing the mouth of a small gorge or hollow scooped out of the bosom of a soft green hill paused at the arch of a low but richly ornamented grotto hollowed out of the face of the rock and supported by a vault of reticulated brickwork decorated elegantly with reliefs of marble and rich stucco the soft green mosses and dark tendrils of the waving ivy which drooped down from the rock and curtained well nigh half the opening rendered the grotto very dark within and it was a moment or two before paullus discovered that he was alone in that secluded place or in the company only of the old marble god who reclining on a couch of the same material at the farther end of the cave poured forth his bright waters from an inverted jar into the clear cool basin which filled the centre of the place he was surprised not a little at finding himself the first at the place of meeting for he was conscious that he was behind his time and had indeed come somewhat late on purpose with a view of taking his stand as if naturally during the interview between the conspirator and the cave mouth it was not however altogether a matter of regret to him that he had gained a little time for the folds of his toga required some adjustment in order to enable him to get readily at the hilt of his sword and the mouthpiece of his huntinghorn which he carried beneath his gown and he applied himself to that purpose immediately congratulating himself as he did so on the failure of his first project and thinking how much better it would be for him to stand as far as possible from the entrance so as to avoid even the few rays of dim starlight which crept in through the tangled ivy this was soon done and in accordance with his afterthought he sat down on a projecting angle of the statues marble couch in the inmost corner of the vault facing the door and having the pool of the fountain interposed between that and himself for a few moments he sat thinking anxiously about the interview which he believed not without cause was likely to prove embarrassing at least if not perilous but when he confessed to himself which he was very soon compelled to do that he could shape nothing of his own course until he should hear what were the plans in which catiline desired his cooperation and when time fled and the man came not his mind began to wander and to think about twenty gay and pleasant subjects entirely disconnected with the purpose for which he had come thither then he fell gradually into a sort of waking dream or vision as it were of wandering fancies made up partly of the sounds which he actually heard with his outward ears though his mind took but little note of them and partly of the occurrences in which he had been mixed up and the persons with whom he had been brought into contact within the last two or three days the gory visage of the murdered slave the sweet and calm expression of his own julia the truculent eyes and sneering lip of catiline and the veiled glance and voluptuous smile of his too seductive daughter whirled still before him in a strange sort of human phantasmagoria with the deep searching look of the consul orator the wild glare of the slaughtered volero and the stern face grand and proud in his last agony of the dying varus in this mood he had forgotten altogether where he was and on what purpose when a deep voice aroused him with a start and though he had neither heard his footstep nor seen him enter catiline stood beside his elbow what ho he exclaimed paullus have i detained you long in this dark solitude nay i know not how long replied the other for i had fallen into strange thoughts and forgotten altogether the lapse of time but here have i been since the fourth hour and it is now already past the fifth said cataline but come we must make up for the loss of time some friends of mine are waiting for us to whom i wish to introduce you that you may become altogether one of us and take the oaths of fidelity give me the dagger now and let us be going on our way i have it not with me catiline have it not with you wherefore not wherefore not i say boy cried the conspirator very savagely by all the furies in deep hell you were better not dally with me because it is no longer in my possession and therefore i could not bring it with me he replied firmly for the threats of the other only inflamed his pride and so increased his natural courage by the gods you brave me then exclaimed catiline fool fool beware how you tamper with your fate speak instantly speak out to whom have you dared give it there was no daring in the matter catiline he answered steadily keeping an eye on the archtraitors movements before i knew that it was yours i sent it as i had promised to cicero with word that volero could tell him who was the owner of it ha didst thou so said the other mastering instantly his fury in his desire to make himself fully acquainted with all that had passed when was all this has he seen volero and learned the secret of him then i sent it catiline within an hour of the time i left the campus yesterday before coming to my house to dinner before going to thy house to dinner sergius before seducing lucia orestilla again sneered the desperate villain before yielding answered the young man who was now growing angry for his temper was not of the meekest to her irresistible seduction ha yieldingwell we will speak of that hereafter hath the consul seen volero he hath seen him dead and how dead catiline best knoweth it was then thou whom i saw in the feeble lamplight with the accursed wretch that crosses my path everywhere the dastard drivelling dotard of arpinum thou that despite thine oath didst lead him to detect the man thou hadst sworn to obey and follow thou it is thou then that houndest mine enemies upon my track by the great gods i know not whether most to marvel at the sublime unrivalled folly which could lead thee to fancy that thou a mere boy and tyro couldst hoodwink eyes like mine or at the daring which could prompt thee to rush headlong on thine own ruin in betraying me boy thou hast but one course left to join us heart and hand to go and renew thine oath in such fashion as even thou premeditated perjurer wilt not presume to break and then to seal thy faith by the blood of whom of this new man this pendant consul of arpinum aye exclaimed paullus as if half tempted to accede to his proposal and if i do so what shall i gain thereby lucia i might say answered catiline butseeing that possession damps something at all times the fierceness of pursuitwhat if i should reply the second place in rome in rome when we have beaten down the proud patricians to our feet and raised the conquering ensign of democratic sway upon the ramparts of the capitol when rome and all that she contains of bright and beautiful shall be our heritage and spoil the second place i say in regenerated rome linked too to everlasting glory and the first place by mars the great avenger dost soar so high a pitch already ho boy the first is mine by right as by daring how say you are you mine if i say no thou diest on the instant i think not replied arvina quietly and i do answer no then perish fool in thy folly and leaping forward he dealt him a blow with a long twoedged dagger which he had held in his hand naked during the whole discussion in readiness for the moment he anticipated and at the same instant uttered a loud clear whistle to his astonishment the blade glanced off the breast of the young man and his arm was stunned nearly to the shoulder by the unexpected resistance of the stout corslet the whistle was answered however the very moment it was uttered and just as he saw paullus spring to the farther side of the cavern and set his back against the wall unsheathing a heavy broadsword of the short roman fashion three stout men entered the mouth of the cave heavily armed with weapons of offence although they wore no defensive armor give me a sword shouted the fierce conspirator furious at being foiled and perceiving that his whole enterprise depended on the young mans destruction he is armed under his gown with a breastplate give me a sword and then set on him all at once so that will do now on hold sergius catiline exclaimed arvina hold or by all the gods you will repent it if you have three men at your back i have full five times three within call call them then answered the other making at him call them think you again to fool me ho geta and arminius get round the fountain and set on him make haste i saykillkill and with the word he rushed at him aiming a fierce blow at his head while the others a moment afterward charged on him from the other side but during the brief parley arvina had disengaged the folds of his gown from his light shoulder and wrapped it closely about his left arm and when catiline rushed in he parried the blow with his sword and raising the little horn he carried to his lips blew a long piercing call which was answered by a loud shout close at hand and by the rush of many feet without the grotto catiline was himself astonished at the unexpected aid for he had taken the words of the young patrician for a mere boast but his men were alarmed and fell back in confusion while paul profiting by their hesitation sprang with a quick active bound across the basin of the fountain and gained the caverns mouth just as his stout freedman thrasea showed himself in the entrance with a close casque and cuirass of bronze and a boar spear in his hand the heads and weapons of several other ablebodied men appearing close behind at the head of these arvina placed himself instantly having his late assailants hemmed in by a force against which they now could not reasonably hope to struggle but paullus showed no disposition to take undue advantage of his superiority for he said in a calm steady voice i leave you now my friend and it will not be my fault if aught that has passed here is remembered any farther none here have seen you or know who you are and you may rest assured that for her sake and mine own honor if i join not your plans i will not betray you or reveal your counsels to that i am sworn and come what may my oath shall not be broken tush cried the other maddened by disappointment and filled with desperate apprehensions men trust not avowed traitors upon them i say you dogs let there be forty of them but four can stand abreast in the entrance and we can front them four as good as they and he again dashed at arvina without waiting to see if his gladiators meant to second his attack but they hung back reluctant to fight against such odds for though brave men and accustomed to risk their lives without quarrel or excitement for the gratification of the brute populace of rome they had come to the cave of egeria prepared for assassination not for battle and their antagonists were superior to them as much in accoutrement and armsfor their bronze headpieces were seen distinctly glimmering in the rays of the rising moonas in numbers the blades of the leaders clashed together and several quick blows and parries had been interchanged during which thrasea had he not been restrained by his young masters orders might easily have stabbed the conspirator with his boarspear but he held back at first waiting a fresh command until seeing that none came and that the unknown opponent was pressing his lord hard while the gladiators apparently encouraged by his apathy were beginning to handle their weapons he shifted his spear in his hands and stepping back a pace so as to give full scope to a sweeping blow he flourished the butt which was garnished with a heavy ball of metal round his head in a figure of eight and brought it down so heavily on the felt skullcap of the conspirator that his teeth jarred audibly together a quick flash sprang across his eyes and he fell stunned and senseless at the feet of his intended victim hold thrasea hold cried paullus by the gods you have slain him no i have not no no his head is too hard for that answered the freedman i felt my staff rebound from the bone which it would not have done had the skull been fractured no he is not dead though he deserved to die very richly i am glad of it replied paullus i would not have him killed for many reasons now hark ye ye scoundrels and gallowsbirds most justly are your lives forfeit whether it seem good to me to take them here this moment or to drag you away and hand you over to the lictors of the citypraetor as common robbers and assassins that you cannot do whilst we live most noble answered the boldest of the gladiators sullenly and you cannot i think take our lives without leaving some of your own on our swords points brave me not cried the young man sternly lest you drive me to do that i would not your lives i say are forfeit but seeing that i love not bloodshed i leave you for this time unpunished take up the master whom you serve and bear him home and when he shall be able to receive it tell him paullus arvina pardons his madness pities his fears and betrays no mans trustleast of all his for the rest let him choose between enmity and friendship i care not which it be i can defend my own life and assail none beware how you follow us if you do by all the gods you die see he begins to stir come thrasea call off your men we will go ere he come to his senses lest worse shall befal and with the words he turned his back contemptuously on the crestfallen gladiators and strode haughtily across the threshold leaving the fierce conspirator as he was beginning to recover his scattered senses to the keen agony of conscious villainy frustrated and the stings of defeated pride and disappointed malice the night was well advanced when he reached his own house having met no interruption on the way proud of his wellplanned stratagem elated by success and flattered by the hope that he had extricated himself by his own energy from all the perils which had of late appeared so dark and difficult to shun chapter x the wanton duri magno sed amore dolores pollute notumque furens quid femina possit aen v virgil it was not till a late hour on the following day that catiline awoke from the heavy and half lethargic slumber which had fallen upon him after the severe and stunning blow he received in the grotto of egeria his head ached fearfully his tongue clove to his palate parched with fever and all his muscular frame was disjointed and unstrung so violently had his nerves been shattered for some time after he awoke he lay tossing to and fro on his painful couch scarce conscious of his own identity and utterly forgetful of the occurrences of the past evening by slow degrees however the truth began to dawn upon him misty at first and confused until he brought to his mind fairly the attack on arvina and the affray which ensued with something of an indistinct consciousness that he had been stricken down and frustrated in his murderous attempt as soon as the certainty of this was impressed on him he sprang up from his bed with his wonted impetuosity and inquired vehemently of a freedman who sat in his chamber motionless as a statue in expectation of his waking how came i home chaerea and at what hour of night grievously wounded catiline and supported in the arms of the sturdy germans geta and arminius and for the time it was past the eighth hour the eighth hour impossible cried the conspirator why it was but the fifth when that occurred what said i my good chaerea what said the germans be they here now answer me quick i pray you there was but one word on your lips catiline a constant cry for water water so long as you were awake and after we had given you of it as much as you would take and you had fallen into a disturbed and feverish sleep you still muttered in your dreams water the germans answered nothing though all the household questioned them and in good truth catiline it was not very long that they were capable of answering for as soon as you were in bed they called for wine and in less than an hour were thoroughly besotted and asleep they are here yet i think sleeping away the fumes of their potent flagons call me arminius hither hold what is the time of day the sun is high already it must be now near the fourth hour so late you did ill chaerea to let me lie so long call me arminius hither and send me one of the boys or rather go yourself chaerea and pray cornelius lentulus the praetor to visit me before he take his seat on the puteal libonis it is his day i think to take cognizance of criminal matters begone and do my bidding within a moment the athenian freedman for he was of that proud though fallen city returned conducting the huge german gladiator whose bewildered air and bloodshot eyes seemed to betoken that he had not as yet recovered fully from the effect of his last nights potations no finer contrast could be imagined by poet or painter than was presented by those three men each eminently striking in his own style and characteristic of his nation the tall spare militarylooking roman with his hawk nose and eagle eye and close shaved face and short black hair his every attitude and look and gesture full of pride and dominion the versatile and polished greek beautiful both in form and face as a marble of praxiteles beaming with intellect and having every feature eloquent of poetry and imagination and something of contempt for the sterner and harder type of mind to which he and his countryman were subjugated and last the wild stronglimbed yet stolidlooking german glaring out with his bright blue eyes full of a sort of stupid fierceness from the long curls of his auburn hair a type of man in his most primitive state the hunter and the warrior of the forest enslaved by romes insatiate ambition catiline looked at him fiercely for a moment and then nodded his head as if in assent to some of his own meditations then muttering to himself the boar the mastfed german boar he turned to the greek saying sharply art thou not gone to lentulus methought thou hadst been thither and returned ere this time yet tarry since thou art here still are any of my clients in the atriumany i mean of the trustiest rufinus surnamed lupus is without and several others stolo whom you preserved from infamy when accused of dolus malus in the matter of assault with arms on publius natro is waiting to solicit you i fancy for some favor the very manthe wolf is the very man and your suitor for favors cannot refuse to confer what he requests stay my chaerea send glycon to summon lentulus and go yourself and find out what is stolos suit assure him of my friendship and support and hark you have him and rufinus into an inner chamber and set bread before them and strong wine and return to me presently now then arminius he continued as the greek left the room what did we do last night and what befel usfor i can remember nothing clearly the giant shook his tawny locks away from his brow and gazed into his employers face with a look of stolid inquiry and then answered do we did nothing that i know we followed thee as in duty bound to that cave by the almo and when we had stayed there awhile we brought thee back again seeing thou couldst not go alone what can i tell you know yourself why you took us thither thou stupid brute retorted catiline or worse than brute ratherfor brutes augment not their brutishness by gluttony and winebibbingthou art asleep yet see if this will awaken thee and with the word he snatched up a large brazen ewer full of cold water which stood on a slab near him and hurled it at his head the gladiator stood quite still and merely bent his neck a little to avoid the heavy vessel which almost grazed his temples and then shook himself like a water spaniel as the contents flashed full into his face and eyes do not do that again he grunted unless you want to have your throat squeezed by pollux the pugilist he threatens exclaimed catiline laughing at his dogged anger do you not know cutthroat that one word of mine can have your tough hide slashed with whips in the common gaol till your very bones are bare and do you know what difference it makes whether my hide be slashed with dogwhips in the gaol or with broadswords in the amphitheatre a man can only die and it were as well in my mind to die having killed a roman in his own house as a countryman on the arena by all the gods cried catiline he is a philosopher but look you here my german solon you were better regard me and attend to what i tell you so may you escape both gaol and amphitheatre tell me briefly distinctly and without delay what fell out last evening you led us to assault that younker whom you know and when we would have set upon him and finished his business easily he blew a hunting horn and fifteen or sixteen stout fellows in full armor came down the bank from behind and shut up the caves mouthyou know as well as i do so far i do most certainly replied the conspirator but what then why then thou wouldest not hear reason but though the youth swore he would not betray thee must needs lay on one man against sixteen and so as was like gottest thine head broken by a blow of a boarspear from a great doublehanded thracian for my part i wondered he did not put the spearhead through and through you it was a great pity that he did not it would have saved us all and you especially a world of trouble and you cowardly dogs forsook me and held back when by a bold rush we might easily have slain him and cut our way through the dastard slaves no no we could not they were all thracians dacians and pannonians and were completely armed too we might have killed him very likely but we could never have escaped ourselves and he he what became of him when i had fallen he bade us take you up replied the german and carry you home and tell you to fear nothing he would betray no man least of all you he is a fine young fellow in my judgment for he might just as well have killed us all as not if he had been so minded and i cant say but that it would have served us rightly for taking odds of four to one upon a single man that is i know what you romans call fighting beyond the rhine we style it cowardly and murder then after that he went off with his men leaving us scratching our heads and looking as dastardly and crestfallen as could be and then we brought you home hither after it had got late enough to carry you through the streets without making an uproar and then lydon and chaerea put you to bed and i and geta and ardaric as for us we got drunk seeing there was no more work to do last night and not knowing what might be to do today and so it is all well very well as i see it well call you it when he has got off unscathed and lives to avenge himself and betray me but he swore he would do neither catiline answered the simpleminded son of the forest swore replied the conspirator with a fell sneer ay did he master swore by all that was sacred he would never betray any man and you least of all and i believe he will keep his promise so do i answered catiline bitterly i swear he shall not for the lack of will but of means to do otherwise you are a stupid brute arminius but useful in your way i have no need of you today so go and tell the butler to give you wine enough to make all three of you drunk again but mind that ye are sound clearheaded and alert at daybreak tomorrow but will he give it to me at my bidding if not send him to me for orders now begone i ask for nothing better replied the gladiator and withdrew without any word or gesture of salutation in truth despising the roman in his heart as deeply for what he deemed his overcraftiness and overcivilization as the more polished greek did for what on his side he considered the utter absence of both scarce had the german left the room before the greek returned smiling and seemingly well satisfied with the result of his mission catiline looked at him steadily and nodding his head asked him quietly are they prepared chaerea to do anything you would have them catiline stolo it seems is again emperilledanother charge of attempt to murderand he wants you to screen him and so i will and will do more i will make him rich and great if he do my bidding now go and make them understand this they must swear that they came hither this morning to claim my aid in bringing them to speech with lentulus the praetor and then thou must be prepared to swear chaerea that i have had no speech or communication with them at allwhich is quite true that is a pity answered the greek coolly for any one can swear steadily to the truth but it requires genius to carry out a lie bravely oh never fear thou shalt have lies enough to swear to now mark me when lentulus comes hither they must accuse to him paullus caecilius arvina whose person if they know him not you must describe to themhim who dined with me you know the day before yesterdayof subornation to commit murder the place where he did so the top of the caelian hill the time sunrise on that same day the person whom he desired them to slay volero the cutler who dwelt in the sacred way they must make up the tale their own way but to these facts they must swear roundly do you understand me perfectly they shall do it well and both be in one tale i will help them to concoct it and dress it up with little truthful incidents that will tell but are you sure that he cannot prove he was not there quite sure chaerea for he was there and no witnesses who can prove to whom he spoke only one witness and he will say nothing unless called upon by paullus and if so called upon will most reluctantly corroborate the tale of stolo and rufinus ha ha laughed the freedman thou shouldst have been a greek catiline thou art too shrewd to be a mere roman a mere roman hangdog answered catiline but thou knowest thine opportunity and profitest by it so let it pass now as for thee seeing thou dost love lying thou shalt have thy part thou shalt swear that the night before that same morning at a short time past midnight thou wert returning by the wicked street from the house of autronius upon the quirinal whither i sent thee to bid him to dinner the next dayhe shall confirm the talewhen thou didst hear a cry of murder from the plebeian graveyard on the esquiline and hurrying to the spot didst see arvina with his freedman thrasea bearing a torch conceal a fresh bleeding body in a broken grave and hidden by the stem of a great tree thyself didst hear him say as he left the ground that dog will tell no tales thou must swear likewise that thou didst tell me the whole affair the next morning and that i bade thee wait for farther proof ere speaking of the matter and again that we visited the spot where thou sawst the deed and found the grass trampled and bloody but could not find the body canst thou do this thinkest thou surely i can said the athenian rubbing his hands as if well pleased so that no one shalt doubt the truth of it and thou wilt confirm the truth by chiding thee for speaking out of place see that thou blurt it out abruptly as if unable to keep silence any longer as soon as the others have finished their tale begone and be speedy lentulus will be here anon the freedman withdrew silently and catiline was left alone in communion with his own bad and bitter thoughts and painful as it seemed and terrible even to himself was that communion for he rose up from his seat and paced the room impetuously to and fro gnashing and grinding his teeth and biting his lips till the blood sprang out after a while however he mastered his passions and began to dress himself which he did by fits and starts in a manner perfectly characteristic of the man uttering hideous imprecations if the least thing ran counter to his wishes and flinging the various articles of his attire about the chamber with almost frantic violence by the time he had finished dressing himself lentulus was announced and entered with his dignified and haughty manner not all unmixed with an air of indolence all hail my sergius he exclaimed as he crossed the threshold what hast thou of so grave importance that thou must intercept me on my way to the judgment seat nothing has gone wrong in our councilsha nothing that i know answered catiline but here are two of my trustiest clients stolo and rufinus have been these three hours waiting for my awakening that i might gain your ear for them they sent me word they had a very heavy charge to make to you but for my part i have not seen them and know not what it is tush tush man never tell me that replied lentulus with a grim smile do you think i will believe you have sent for me all the way hither this morning without some object of your own to serve no no my friend with whomsoever that may pass it will not go current with cornelius lentulus just as you please said the traitor you may believe me or not exactly as you choose but it is true nevertheless that i have neither seen the men nor spoken with them nor do i know at all what they want i would then you had not sent for me answered the other come let us have the knaves in i suppose they have been robbing some ones henroost and want to lay the blame on some one else what ho chaerea and as he spoke the word the curtain which covered the doorway was withdrawn and the keenwitted freedman made his appearance admit those fellows stolo and rufinus the praetor is prepared to give them a hearing it would have been difficult perhaps to have selected from the whole population of rome at that day a more murderous looking pair of scoundrels well sirrahs what secrets of the state have you that weigh so ponderously on your wise thoughts asked lentulus with a contemptuous sneer murder most noble lentulusor at least subornation thereof answered one of the ruffians most natural indeed i should have thought as much well tell us in a wordfor it is clear that nobody has murdered either of youwhom have you murdered if we have murdered no one it was not for the lack of prompting or of bribes either indeed i should have thought a moderate bribe would have arranged the matter easily but come come to the point whom were ye bribed or instigated to get rid of speak i am in haste the cutler caius volero volero ha cried lentulus starting indeed indeed that may well be by whom then were you urged to the deed and when paullus caecilius arvina tempted us to the deed by the offer of ten thousand sesterces we met him by appointment upon the caelian hill at the head of the minervium a little before sunrise the day before yesterday ha and for a moment or two lentulus fixed his eyes upon the ground and pondered deeply on what he had just heard have ye seen volero since no praetor nor heard anything concerning him nothing said stolo but he spoke with a confused air and in an undecided tone which satisfied the judge that he was speaking falsely rufinus interposed however saying but i have noble lentulus i heard say that he was murdered in his own booth that same night and having heard this you told it not to stolo i never thought about it any more answered rufinus doggedly seeing that he had got into a scrape that was unfortunate and somewhat strange too seeing that you came hither together to speak about the very man now mark me volero was that night murdered and it appears to me that you are bringing this accusation against a young patrician in order to conceal your own base handiwork in the deed fellows i grievously suspect you wrongfully then you do so answered stolo who was the bolder and more ready witted of the two rufinus ever was a forgetful fool and i trow i am not to be brought into blame for his folly well for you if you be not brought into more than blame now mark me well can you prove where you were that night of the murder excellent stolo ay can i answered the man boldly i was with stout balatro the fisherman helping to mend his nets until the fourth hour and all his boys were present helping us and then we went to a cookshop to get some supper in the ox forum and thence at the sixth hour we passed across to lydias house in the cyprian lane and spent a merry hour or two carousing with her jolly girls will that satisfy you lentulus ay if it can be proved returned the praetor and you rufinus can you also show your whereabout that evening i can replied the fellow for i was sick abed and that my wife can show and themison the druggist who lives in the sacred way for she went to get me an emetic at the third hour and i was vomiting all night a poor hand should i have made that night at murder so far then replied lentulus you have cleared yourselves from suspicion but your charge on arvina needs something more of confirmation ere i dare cite a patrician to plead to such a crime have you got witnesses was any one in sight when he spoke with you on the minervium there was one but i know not if he will choose to speak of it who was it exclaimed lentulus growing a little anxious on the subject for though he cared little enough about arvina he was yet unwilling to see a patrician arraigned for so small a matter as was in his eyes the murder of a mechanic why should he not speak i warrant you i will find means to make him it was my patron lentulus your patron man he cried much astonished what catiline here catiline it was my praetor and have you consulted with him ere you spoke with me not so most noble for he would not admit us speak sergius is this so did you behold these fellows in deep converse with caecilius arvina in the minervium but no it must be folly for what should you have been doing there at sunrise i prithee do not ask me lentulus answered catiline with an air of well feigned reluctance i hate law suits and judicial inquiries and i love young arvina then you did see them nay nay you must speak out i do adjure you catiline by all the gods were you at sunrise on the caelian and did you see arvina and these two i was at sunrise on the caelian and i did see them and heard you what they said no but their faces were grave and earnest and they seemed angry as they separated ha in itself only this were a little thing but when it turns out that the man was slain that same night the thing grows serious you therefore i shall detain here as witnesses and partially suspected some of your slaves must guard them catiline and i will send a lictor to cite paullus that he appear before me after the session at the puteal libonis i am in haste farewell me me hear me good lentulushear me exclaimed chaerea springing forward all vehemence and eagerness to speak as it would seem ere he should be interrupted chaerea cried catiline looking sternly at him and shaking his finger remember no no replied chaereano no i will not hold my peace no catiline you may kill me if you choose but i will speak to keep this secret any longer would kill me i tell you if it do not i will answered his master angrily this must not be my sergius interposed lentulus let the man speak if he have any light to throw on this mysterious business say on my good fellow and i will be your mediator with your master the freedman needed no more exhortation but poured out a flood of eager anxious narrative as had been preconcerted between himself and catiline speaking with so much vehemence and displaying so much agitation in all his air and gestures that he entirely imposed his story upon lentulus and that catiline had much difficulty in restraining a smile at the skill of the greek ha it is very clear said lentulus he first slew the slave with his own hand and then would have compassednay i should rather say has compassedvoleros slaughter who must some how or other have become privy to the deed i must have these detained and him arrested there can be no doubt of his guilt and the people will be i think disposed to make an example there have of late been many cases of assassination as soon as they were left alone lentulus looked steadily into the face of his fellowconspirator for a moment and then burst into a hoarse laugh why all this mummery my sergius he added as soon as he had ceased from laughing or wherefore would you have mystified me too i might have wished to see whether the evidence was like to seem valid to the judices from its effect upon the praetor answered the other and are you satisfied i am you may be so my sergius for of a truth until chaerea swore as he did touching medon i was myself deceived you believe then that this will be sufficient to secure his condemnation beyond doubt he will be interdicted fire and water if these men stick to their oaths only it would be well perhaps to convict one of arvinas slaves of the actual death of volero that might be done easily enough but there must be care taken that you select one who shall not be able to prove any alibi but wherefore are you so bent on destroying this youth and by the law too which is ever both perilous and uncertain he knows too much to live without endangering others what knows he who slew medonwho slew volerowhat we propose to do ere long in the campus answered catiline steadily by all the gods cried lentulus turning very pale and remaining silent for some moments after which he said with a thoughtful manner it would be better to get rid of him quietly that has been tried too well it failed he is now on his guard he is brave strong wary it cannot be done save thus he will denounce us he will declare the whole ere we can spring the mine beneath him no he will not he dares not he is bound by oaths which oaths interrupted lentulus with a sneer and in tones of contemptuous ridicule what are oaths did they ever bind you i do not recollect answered catiline perhaps they did when i was a boy and believed in lemures and lamia but paullus arvina is not lucius catiline nor yet cornelius lentulus and i say that his oaths shall bind him until and i say they shall not a clear high voice interrupted him coming apparently through the wall of the chamber lentulus startedhis very lips were white and his frame shook with agitation if it were not with fear catiline grew pale likewise but it was rage not terror that blanched his swarthy brow he dashed his hand upon the table furies of hell while the words were yet trembling on his lips the door was thrown violently open the curtains which concealed it torn asunder and with her dark eyes gleaming a strange fire and two hard crimson spots gleaming high up on her cheek bonesthe hectic of fierce passionher bosom throbbing and her whole frame dilated with anger and excitement young lucia stood before them and i say she repeated that they shall not bind him by all the gods i swear it by my own love my own dishonor i swear that they shall not fool fool did you think to outwit me to blind a woman whose every fear and passion is an undying eye go to go to you shall not do it audacious as he was the traitor was surprised almost daunted and while lentulus a little reassured when he saw who was the interlocutor gazed on him in unmitigated wonder he faltered out in tones strangely dissimilar to his accustomed accents of indomitable pride and decision you mistake girl you have not heard aright if you have heard at all i would say you are deceived lucia then would you lie she answered for i am not deceived though you would fain deceive me not heard not heard she continued think you the walls in the house of catiline have no eyes nor ears using the very words which he had addressed to her lover lucius catiline i know all you know all exclaimed lentulus aghast and will prevent all replied the girl firmly if you dare cross my purposes dare dare replied catiline who now recovering from his momentary surprise had regained all his natural haughtiness and vigor who are you wanton that dare talk to us of daring wanton replied the girl turning fiery red ay but who made me the wanton that i am who fed my youthful passions who sapped my youthful principles who reared me in an atmosphere whose very breath was luxury voluptuousness pollution till every drop of my wholesome blood was turned to liquid flame till every passion in my heart became a fettered earthquake fool fool you thought in your impotence of crime to make lucia orestilla your instrument your slave you have made her your mistress you dreamed in your insolence of fancied wisdom that like the huntercat of the persian despots so long as you fed the wantons appetite and basely pandered to her passions she would leap hoodwinked on the prey you pointed her thou fool that hast not half read thy villain lesson thou shouldst have known that the very cat thou thoughtest me will turn and rend the huntsman if he dare rob her of her portion i tell you lucius catiline you thought me a mere wanton a mere sensual thing a soulless animal voluptuary fool i say double fool look into thine own heart remember what blood runs in these female veins man father vitiator my spirit is not female my blood my passions my contempt of peril my will indomitable and immutable are like my mortal body your begetting my crimes and my corruption are your teaching beware then as you know the heat of your own appetites how you presume to hinder mine beware as you know your own recklessness in doing and contempt in suffering how you stir me your child to do and suffer likewise beware as you know the extent of your own crimes the depth of your own pollution how you drive me your pupil to outdo her master beware i say beware this man is mine harm but one hair upon his head and you shall die like a dog with the dogs who snarl at your bidding and your name perish with you i have spoken there needed not one tenth part of the wisdom which the archtraitor really possessed to shew him how much he had miscalculated the range of his daughters intellect the fierce energies of her powerful but misdirected mind he felt for a moment as the daring archimage whose spells too potent for their masters safety have evoked and unchained a spirit that defies their guidance but like that archimage conscious that all depends on the exertion of his wonted empire he struggled hard to regain his lost authority girl he replied in those firm deep tones of grave authority which he deemed the best calculated to control her excitement you are mad mad and ungrateful and like a frantic dog would turn and rend the hand that feeds you for a shadow i never thought of making you an instrument fool indeed had i been to think i could hoodwink such an intellect as yours if i have striven to clear away the mists of prejudice from before your eyes which in your senseless anger you now call corrupting you it was because i saw in you a kindred spirit to mine own capable to soar fearless and undazzled into the very noon of reason if i have taught you to indulge your passions opened a universe of pleasures to your ken it was that i saw in you a woman of mind so manly that all the weaknesses which fools call affections would be but powerless to warp it from its purpose i would have made you the worlds scorn she interrupted him bitterly but he went on without noticing the interruption the equal of myself in intellect in energy and wisdom else how had you dared to brave me thus whom never man yet braved and lived to boast of it and now for a mere girlish fancy a weak feminine caprice for a man who cares not for you who has betrayed you who idiot and inconsistent that he is fresh from your fiery kisses was whimpering within an hour at the feet of his cold julia who has i doubt not boasted of your favors while he deplored his own infatuation to her his promised wifefor a fond frivolous liking of a moment you would forego gratification rank greatness power and vengeance is this just toward me wise toward yourself is this like lucia orestilla you would preserve a traitor who deserts you nay scorns you in his easy triumph you would destroy all those who love you you would destroy yourself to make the traitor and his minion happy awake awake my lucia from this soft foolish fancy awake and be yourself once more awake to wisdom to ambition to revenge his words were spirited and fiery but they struck on no kindred chord in the bosom of his daughter on the contrary the spark had faded from her eye and the flush from her cheek and her looks were dispirited and downcast but as he ceased she raised her eye and met his piercing gaze firmly and replied in a sorrowful yet resolute tone eloquent aye you are eloquent catiline would i had never learned it to my cost but it is too late now it is all too late for the rest i am awake and so far at least am wise that i perceive the folly of the past and decipher clearly the sophistry of your false teaching as for the future hope is dead and ambition revenge i seek not if i did so thou art there on whom to wreak it for saving thou and myself only none have wronged me more words are needless see that thou lay aside thy plans and dare not to harm him or her he shall not betray thee or thine for that will i be his surety and hostage injure them by deed or by word and one and all you perish i ask no promise of youpromises bind you notbut let fear bind you for i promise you and be sure that my plight will be kept can this be lucia orestilla exclaimed catiline this puling lovesick girl this timorous repentanti had nearly called theemaiden why thou fool what wouldst thou with the man farther dost think to be his wife wife cried the wretched girl clasping her hands together and looking piteously in her destroyers face wife wife and mealas alas that holy that dear honored namenever never for me the sweet sacred rites never for me the pure chaste kiss the seat by the happy hearth the loving children at the knee the proud approving smile ofoh ye gods ye just godsa loved and loving husbandwife wife she continued lashing herself as she proceeded into fresh anger there is not in the gaols of rome the slave so base as to call lucia orestilla wife and wherefore wherefore notman man if that thou be a man and not a demon but for thee and thy cursed teachings i might have known all thispure bliss and conscious rectitude and the respect and love of men i might have been the happy bride of an honorable suitor the cherished matron of a respected lord the proud glad mother of children that should not have blushed to be sprung from the wanton lucia thou it is thou thou only that hast done all thisand why i say why should i not revenge beware tempt me no farther do my bidding thou slave that thoughtst but now to be the master obey my bidding to the letter and she stamped her foot on the ground with the imperious air of a despotic queen and in truth crestfallen and heavy in spirit were the proud men whom she so superbly threatened she gazed at them contemptuously for a moment and then shaking her fore finger menacingly i leave ye she said i leave ye but imagine not that i read not your councils me you cannot deceive with yourselves only it remains to succeed or to perish for if ye dare to disobey me the gods themselves shall not preserve you from my vengeance i fear you not my girl cried catiline for all that you are now mad with disappointment and with anger so you may go and listen if you will he added pointing to the secret aperture concealed in the mouldings of the wall we shall not speak the less freely for your hearing us there is no need to listen now she answered for i know everything already every thing that we have said lucia everything that you will do sergius catiline aye aye and everything that i shall do likewise and with the word she left the room a perilous girl by all the gods said lentulus in greek as she disappeared will she do as she threatens tush replied catiline in latin she speaks greek like an athenian i am not sure however that she could understand such jargon as that is no she will do none of that she is the cleverest and best girl living only a little passionate for which i love her all the more dearly no she will do none of that because she will not be alive to do it this time tomorrow he added putting his mouth within half an inch of the ear of lentulus and speaking in the lowest whisper lentulus bold as he was and unscrupulous started in horror at his words and his lips were white as he falteredyour own daughter lucius ha ha laughed the fierce conspirator aloud ha ha yes she is my own daughter in everything but beauty she is the loveliest creature in all rome but we must yield i suppose to her wishes the women rule us after all is said and i suppose i was alarmed needlessly doubtless arvina will be silent come i will walk with you so far on your way to the forum what ho chaerea see that rufinus and stolo lack nothing i will speak with them when i return home and hark you in your ear suffer not lucia orestilla to leave the house a moment use force if it be needed but it will not tell her it is my orders and watch her very closely come lentulus it is drawing toward noon they left the house without more words and walked side by side in silence for some distance when catiline said in a low voice this is unpleasant and may be dangerous we must however trust to fortune till tomorrow when my house shall be void of this pest then will we proceed as we had proposed lentulus looked at him doubtfully and asked with a quick shudder running through his limbs as he spoke and will you really and there he paused unable to complete the question remove her added catiline completing the sentence which he had left unfinished ay will i just as i would a serpent from my path and that done what is to follow lentulus inquired with an assumption of coolness which in truth he did not feel we will get rid of arvina and then as it wants but four days of the elections we may keep all things quiet till the time be it so answered the other when do we meet again to settle these things finally tomorrow at the house of laeca at the sixth hour of night will all be there all the most faithful until then farewell farewell and they parted lentulus hurrying to the forum to take his seat on the praetors chair and there preside in judgmentfit magistrateon men the guiltiest of whom were pure as the spotless snow when compared with his own conscious guilt and catiline to glide through dark streets visiting discontented artizans debauched mechanics desperate gamblers scattering dark and ambiguous promises and stirring up that worthless rabblewho with all to gain and nothing to lose by civil strife and tumult abound in all great citiesto violence and thirst of blood three or four hours at least he spent thus and well satisfied with his progress delighted by the increasing turbulence of the fierce and irresponsible democracy and rejoicing in having gained many new and fitting converts to his creed he returned homeward ripe for fresh villainy chaerea met him on the threshold with his face pale and haggard from excitement catiline he exclaimed she had gone forth already before you bade me watch her shewho slave who and knowing perfectly who was meant yet hoping in his desperation that he heard not aright he caught the freedman by the throat and shook him furiously lucia orestilla faltered the trembling menial and has not returned thundered the traitor catiline no liar and fool cried the other gnashing his teeth with rage as he gave way to his ungovernable fury and hurling him with all his might against the marble doorpost the freedman fell like a dead man with the blood gushing from his nose and mouth and catiline striding across the prostrate body retired sullenly and slowly to muse on the disappointment of this his most atrocious project in the darkness and solitude of his own private chamber whither none dared intrude unsummoned chapter xi the release and for that right is right to follow right were wisdom in the scorn of consequence tennyson oenone paullus arvina sat alone in a small chamber of his own house books were before him his favorites the authors whose words struck chords the most kindred in his soul but though his eye rested on the fair manuscripts it was evident that his mind was absent the slender preparations for the first roman meal were displayed temptingly on a board not far from his elbow but they were all untouched his hair was dishevelled his face pale either from watching or excitement and his eye wild and haggard he wore a loose morning gown of colored linen and his bare feet were thrust carelessly into unmatched slippers it was past noon already nor though his favorite freedman thrasea had warned him several times of the lateness of the hour had he shewn the least willingness to exert himself so far even as to dress his hair or put on attire befitting the business of the day it could not but be seen at a glance that he was ill at ease and in truth he was much perturbed by what had passed on the preceding night and very anxious with regard to the future nor was it without ample cause that he was restless and disturbed within the last three days he had by his own instability of purpose and vacillating tastes and temper brought himself down from as enviable a position as well can be imagined to one as insecure unfortunate and perilous that he had made to himself in catiline an enemy as deadly as persevering as relentless as any man could have upon his track an enemy against whom force and fraud would most likely be proved equally unavailing he entertained no doubt but brave as he was and fearless both by principle and practice he cared less for this even while he confessed to himself that he must be on his guard now alway against both open violence and secret murder than he did for the bitter feeling that he was distrusted that he had brought himself into suspicion and illodor with the great man in whose eyes he would have given so much to stand fairly and whose goodwill and good opinion but two little days before he flattered himself that he had conciliated by his manly conduct again when he thought of julia there was no balm to his heart no unction to his wounded conscience what if she knew not nor suspected anything of his disloyalty did not he know it feel it in every nerve did he not read tacit reproaches in every beam of her deep tranquil eye did he not fancy some allusion to it in every tone of her low sweet voice did he not tremble at every air of heaven lest it should waft the rumor of his infidelity to the chaste ears of her whom alone he loved and honored did he not know that one whisper of that disgraceful truth would break off and forever the dear hopes on which all his future happiness depended and was it not most possible most probable that any moment might reveal to her the fatal tidingsthe rage of catiline frustrated in his foul designs the revengeful jealousy of lucia the vigilance of the distrustful consul might each or all at any moment bring to light that which he would have given all but life to bury in oblivion for a long time he had sat musing deeply on the perils of his false position but though he had taxed every energy and strained every faculty to devise some means by which to extricate himself from the toils into which he had so blindly rushed he could think of no scheme resolve upon no course of action which should set him at liberty as he had been before his unlucky interview with the conspirator at times he dreamed of casting himself at the feet of cicero and confessing to that great and generous statesman all his temptations all his trials all his errors of linking himself heart and soul with the determined patriots who were prepared to live or die with the constitution and the liberties of the republic but the oaththe awful imprecation by which he had bound himself by which he had devoted all that he loved to the infernal gods recurred to his mind and shook it with an earthquakes power and he the bold free thinker the daring and unflinching soldier bound hand and foot by a silly superstition trembledaye trembled and confessed to his secret soul that there was one thing which he ought to do yet dared not anon maddened by the apparent hopelessness of ever being able to recur to the straight road of ever more regaining his own selfesteem or the respect of virtuous citizensforced as he seemed to be to play a neutral partthe meanest of all partsin the impending struggleof ever gaining eminence or fame under the banners of the commonwealth he dreamed of giving himself up as fate appeared to have given him already up to the designs of catiline he pictured to himself rank station power wealth to be won under the ensigns of revolt and asked himself as many a selfdeluded slave of passion has asked himself before if eminence however won be not glory if success in the worlds eyes be not fame and rectitude and excellence but patriotism the old roman virtue clear and undying in the hardest and most corrupt hearts roused itself in him to do battle with the juggling fiends tempting him to his ruin and whenever patriotism halfdefeated appeared to yield the ground the image of his juliahis julia never to be won by any indirection never to be deceived by any sophistry never to be deluded into smiling for one moment on a traitorrose clear and palpable before him and the mists were dispersed instantly and the foes of his better judgment scattered to the winds and routed thus wavering he sat infirm of purpose ungovernedwhence indeed all his errorsby any principle or unity of action when suddenly the sound of a faint and hesitating knock of the bronze ring on the outer door reached his ear the chamber which he occupied was far removed from the vestibule divided from it by the whole length of the atrium and fauces yet so still was the interior of the house and so inordinately sharpened was his sense of hearing by anxiety and apprehension that he recognized the sound instantly and started to his feet fearing he knew not what the footsteps of the slave though he hurried to undo the door seemed to the eager listener as slow as the pace of the dull tortoise and the short pause which followed after the door had been opened he fancied to be an hour in duration long as he thought it however it was too short to enable him to conquer his agitation or to control the tumultuous beating of his heart which increased to such a degree as he heard the freedman ushering the new comer toward the room in which he was sitting that he grew very faint and turned as pale as ashes had he been asked what it was that he apprehended he could assuredly have assigned no reasonable cause to his tremors yet this man was as brave as elastic in temperament as tried steel oppose him to any definite and real peril not a nerve in his frame would quiver yet here he was by imaginary terrors and the disquietude of an uneasy conscience reduced to more than womans weakness the door was opened and thrasea appeared alone upon the threshold with a mysterious expression on his blunt features how now asked paullus what is thisdid i not tell you that i would not be disturbed this morning yes master answered the sturdy freedman but she said that it was a matter of great moment and that she would shewho exclaimed arvina starting up from the chair which he had resumed as his servant entered whom do you mean by she the girl who waits in the tablinum to know if you will receive her the girlwhat girl do you know her no master she is very tall and slender yet round withal and beautifully formed her steps are as light as the does upon the haemus and as graceful she has the finest foot and ancle mine eyes ever looked upon i am sure too that her face is beautiful though she is closely wrapped in a long white veil her voice though exquisitely sweet and gentle is full of a strange command half proud and half persuasive i could not for my life resist her bidding well well admit her though i would fain be spared the trouble i doubt not it is some soft votary of flora and i am not in the vein for such dalliance now no paullus no it is a patrician lady i will wager my freedom on it although she is dressed plainly and as i told you closely veiled not julia by the gods it is not julia serena exclaimed the young man in tones of inquiry blent with wonder but as he spoke the door was opened once more and the veiled figure entered realizing by her appearance all the good freedmans eulogies it seemed that she had overheard the last words of arvina for without raising her veil she said in a soft low voice full of melancholy pathos alas no paullus it is not your julia but it is one who has perhaps some claim to your attention and who at all events will not detain you long on matters most important to yourself i have intruded thus fearing you were about to deny me because that which i have to say will brook no denial the freedman had withdrawn abruptly the very moment that the lady entered and closing the door firmly behind him stood on guard out of earshot lest any one should break upon his young lords privacy but paullus knew not this scarce knew indeed that they were alone when as she ceased he made two steps forward exclaiming in a piercing voice ye gods ye gods lucia orestilla aye paul replied the girl raising her veil and showing her beautiful face no longer burning with bright amorous blushes her large soft eyes no longer beaming unchaste invitation but pale and quiet and suffused with tender sadness it is indeed lucia but wherefore this surprise i might say this terror you were not i remember so averse the last time we were alone together her voice was steady and her whole manner perfectly composed as she addressed him there was neither reproach nor irony in her tones nor anything that betokened even the sense of injury endured yet was arvina more unmanned by her serene and tranquil bearing than he would have been by the most violent reproaches alas alas what shall i say to you he faltered lucia lucia whom i dare not call mine say nothing paullus arvina she replied thou art a noble and generous soulsay nothing for i know what thou wouldst say i have said it to myself many times already oh wo is me too late too late but i have come hither now upon a brief and a pleasant errand for it is pleasant let them scoff who will i say it is pleasant to do right let what may come of it would god that i had always thought so would god indeed answered the young man then had we not both been wretched wretched aye most most wretched cried the girl a large bright tear standing in either eye and art thou wretched paullus utterly wretched he said with a deep groan and buried his face for a moment in his hands even before i looked upon you thought of you i was miserable and now nowwords cannot paint my anguish my selfdegradation aye is it so she said a faint sad smile flitting across her pallid lips why i should feel abased and selfdegraded i can well comprehend i who have fallen from the high estate the purity the wealth the consciousness of chaste and virtuous maidenhood i the despised the castaway the fallen but thou thoufrom thee i looked but for reproachesthe just reproaches i have earned by my faithless folly i thought indeed to have found you wretched writhing in the dark bonds which i most miserable cast around you and cursing her who fettered you cursing myself he answered rather cursing my own insane and selfish passion which alone trammelled me which alone ruined one better and brighter fifty fold than ialas alas lucia and forgetful of all that he had heard to her disparagement from her bad fathers lips or if he half remembered discrediting all in that moment of excitement he flung himself at her feet and grovelled like a crushed worm on the floor in the degrading consciousness of guilt arise arise for shame young arvina she said the ground at a womans feet is no place for a man ever least of all such a womans arise and mark me when i tell you that which to tell you only i came hither arise i say and make me not scorn the man whom i admire whomwo is me i love paullus regained his feet slowly and abashed it seemed that all the pride and haughtiness of his character had given way at once mute and humiliated he sank into a chair while she continued standing erect and selfsustained before him by conscious though new rectitude of purpose mark me i say arvina when i tell you that you are as free as air from the oath with which i bound you that wicked vow compels you only so long as i hold you pledged to its performance lo it is nothing any morefor i to whom alone of mortals you are bound now and forever release you the gods above and below whom you called to witness it are witnesses no more against you for i annul it here i give you back your plight it is as though it never had been spoken indeed indeed am i freegood noble generous dear lucia is it true can it be i am free and at thy bidding free as the winds of heaven paullus that come whence no man knoweth and go whither they will soever and no mortal hindereth them as free as the winds paullus she repeated and i trust soon to be as happy but wherefore added the young man have you done this you said you would release me never and now all unsolicited you come and say you are free paullus almost before the breath is cold upon my lips that swore obedience this is most singular and inconsistent what in the wide world is consistent paullus except virtue that indeed is immutable eternal one the same on earth as in heaven present and past and forever but what else i beseech you is consistent or here or anywhere that you should dream of finding me a weak wild wanton girl of firmer stuff than heroes are you even in your own imagination are you i say consistent she spoke eagerly perhaps wildly for the very part of selfdenial which she was playing stirred her mind to its lowest depths and the great change which had been going on within for many hours and was still in powerful progress excited her fancy and kindled all her strongest feelings and as is not unfrequently the case all the profound vague thoughts which had so long lain mute and dormant found light at once and eloquent expression paullus gazed at her in astonishment almost in awe could this be the sensual passionate voluptuary he had known two days sincethe strange unprincipled impulsive being who yielded like the reed to every gust of passionthis deep clear vigorous thinker it was indeed a change to puzzle sager heads than that of arvina a transformation sudden and beautiful as that from the torpid earthy grub to the swiftwinged etherial butterfly he gazed at her until she smiled in reply to his look of bewilderment and then he met her smile with a sad heavy sigh and answered most inconsistent i alas that i should say it far worse than inconsistent most false to truth and virtue most recreant to honor have not i whose most ardent aspirations were set on glory virtuously won whose soul as i fancied was athirst for knowledge and for truth have not i bound myself by the most dire and dreadful oaths to find my good in evil my truth in a lie my glory in black infamyhave not i loving another better than my own life won thee to love poor lucia and won thee by base falsehood to thy ruin no no she interrupted him this last thing you have not done arvina awake you shall deceive yourself no longer of this last wrong you are as innocent as the unspotted snow and i i only own the guilt as i shall bear the punishment hear first why i release you from your oath and then if you care to listen to a sad tale you shall know by what infamy of others one who might else have been both innocent and happy has been made infamous and foul and vile and wretched a thing hateful to herself and loathsome to the world a being with but one hope left to expiate her many crimes by one act of virtue and then to die to die young very young unwept unhonored friendless and an orphanaye from her very birth more than an orphan say on replied the young man say on lucia and would to heaven you could convince me that i have not wronged you say on then first if you will why you have released me but above all speak of yourselfspeak freely and oh if i can aid or protect or comfort you believe me i will do it at my lifes utmost peril i do believe you paullus i did believe that ere you spoke it first then i set you freeand free you are henceforth forever but wherefore because you are betrayed because i know all that fell out last night because i know darker villainy plotted against you yet to come villainy from which tramelled by this oath no earthly power can save you because i know not altogether why or how my mind has been changed of late completely and i will lend myself no more to projects which i loathe and infamy which i abhor becausebecausebecause in a word i love you paullus better than all i have or hope to have on earth but you must not he replied gravely yet tenderly because you love another she interrupted him very quickly you love julia serena hortensias lovely daughter and she loves you and you are to be wedded soon you see she added with a faint painful smile that i know everything about you i knew it long since long long before i gave myself to you even before i loved you paulfor i have loved you also long loved me long he exclaimed in astonishment how can that be when you never saw me until the day before yesterday oh yes i have she answered sadly i have seen you and known you many years though you have forgotten me if even which i doubt you ever noticed me at all but i can bring it to your mind have you forgotten how six summers since as you were riding down the collis hortulorum you passed a little girl weeping by the wayside over a wounded kid no i remember very well a great country boor had hurt it with a stone and you exclaimed the girl with her eyes flashing fire you sprang down from your horse and chastised him till he whined like a beaten hound though he was twice as big as you were and then you bound up the kids wound and wiped away the tearsinnocent tears they wereof the little girl and parted her hair and kissed her on the forehead that little girl was i and i have kept that kiss upon my brow aye and in my heart too until now no lips of man or woman have ever touched that spot which your lips hallowed from that day forth i have loved you i have adored you paullus from that day forth i have watched all your ways unseen and unsuspected i have seen you do fifty kind and generous and gallant actions but never saw you do one base or tyrannous or cowardly or cruel until that fatal night he said with a deep groan may the gods pardon me i never shall forgive my self no no i tell you no cried the girl impetuously i tell you that i was not deceived if i fell but i did not fall then i knew that you loved julia years ago i knew that i never could be yours in honor and that put fire and madness in my brain and despair in my heart and my home was a hell and those who should have been my guides and saviours were my destroyers and i amwhat i am but in that you had no share on that night i but obeyed the accursed bidding of the blackest and most atrocious monster that pollutes joves pure air by his breath bidding he exclaimed starting back in horror catilines bidding my fathers answered the miserable girl my own fathers bidding ye gods ye gods his own daughters purity purity she replied with a smile of sad bitter irony do you think purity could long exist in the same house with catiline and orestilla paullus arvina the scenes i have beheld the orgies i have shared the atmosphere of voluptuous sin i have breathed almost from my cradle had changed the cold heart of the virgin huntress into the fiery pulses of the wanton venus since i was ten years old i have been wo is me familiar with all luxury all infamy all degradation great nemesis he cried turning up his indignant eyes toward heaven but in the name of all the gods wherefore wherefore even to the worst the most debased of wretches their childrens honor is still dear nothing is dear to catiline but riot and debauchery and murder sin for its own sake even more than for the rewards its offers to its votaries paullus men called me beautiful but what cared i for beauty that charmed all but him whom alone i desired to fascinate men called me beautiful i say and in my fathers sight that beauty became precious when he foresaw that it might prove a means of winning followers to his accursed cause then was i educated in all arts all graces all accomplishments that might enhance my charms and as those fatal charms could avail him nothing so long as purity remained or virtue i was taught ah too easily to esteem pleasure the sole good passion the only guide taught thus by my own parents curses curses and shame upon them pity me pity me paullus oh you are bound to pity me for had i not loved you fatally desperately loved and known that i could not win you perchanceperchance i had not fallen oh pity me and pardon pardon you lucia he interrupted her what have you done to me or who am i that you should crave my pardon what have i done do you ask in mockery have not i made you the partaker of my sin have not i lured you into falsehood momentary falsehood it is true yet still falsehood to your julia have i not tangled you in the nets of this most foul conspiracy betrayed you a bound slave to the monsterthe souldestroyer arvina groaned aloud but made no answer so deeply did his own thoughts afflict so terribly did her strong words oppress him but it is overit is over now she exclaimed exultingly his reign of wickedness is over the tool which he moulded for his own purposes shall be the instrument to quell him the pitfall which he would have digged in the way of others shall be to them a door whereby they shall escape his treason and his ruin you are saved my arvina by all the gods you are saved and if it lost me once it has preserved me nowmy wild unchangeable and undying love for you alone of men for it has made me think has quenched the insane flames that burned within me has given me new views new principles new hopes evil no more shall be my good nor infamy my pride if myself i am most unhappy i will live henceforth while i do live to make others happy i will live henceforth for two thingsrevenge and retribution by all the gods julia and you my paullus shall be happy by all the gods he who destroyed me for his pleasure shall be destroyed in turn for mine lucia think think he is your father perish the monster i have notnever had father or home orspeak not to me speak not of him or i shall lose what poor remains of reason his vile plots have left me perishby all the powers of hell he shall perish miserablymiserably and you you paullus must be the weapon that shall strike him never the weapon in a daughters hand to strike a father answered paullus no though he were himself a parricide he ishe is a parricidethe parricide of rome itselfthe murderer of our common motherthe sacrilegious stabber of his holy country hear me and tremble it lacks now two days of the consular election if catiline go not down ere that day cometh then rome goes down on that day and forever you are mad girl to say so you are mad youth if you discredit me do not i know am not i the sharer the tempter to the guilt myself and am not i the mistress of its secrets was it not for this that i gave myself to you was it not unto this that i bound you by the oath which now i restore to you was it not by this that i would have held you my minion and my paramour and is it not to reveal this that i now have come i tell you i discovered how he would yesternight have slain you by the gladiators sword discovered how he now would slay you by the perverted sword of justice as medons as voleros murderer convicting you of his own crimes as he hath many men before by his suborned and perjured clientshis comrades on the praetors chair i tell you i discovered but just now that me too he will cut off in the flower of my youth in the heat of the passions he fomented in the rankness of the soft sins he taught mecut me offme his own ruined and polluted childby the same poisoned chalice which made his house clear for my wretched mothers nuptials can these things be cried paullus and the gods yet withhold their thunder sometimes i think the girl answered wildly that there are no gods paullus do you believe in mars and venus in gods whose worship were adultery and murder said arvina not i indeed poor lucia if these be gods there is no truth no meaning in the name of virtue if not these what is god all things replied the young man solemnly whatever moves whatever is is god the universe is but the body that clothes his eternal spirit the winds are his breath the sunshine is his smile the gentle dews are the tears of his compassion time is the creature of his hand eternity his dwelling place virtue his law his oracles the soul of every living man beautiful cried the girl beautiful if it were but true it is trueas true as the sun in heaven as certain as his course through the changeless seasons how how she asked eagerly what makes it certain the certainty of death he answered ah death death that is a mystery indeed and after that everlasting life ha do you believe that too they tell me all that is a fable a folly and a falsehood perchance it would be well for them it were so yes she replied yes but who taught you plato immortal plato ha i will read him i will read plato what do you understand greek too lucia how else should i have sung anacreon and learned the lesbian arts of sappho but we have strayed wide of our subject and time presses will you denounce me catiline not i i will perish sooner you will do so and all rome with you prove that to me andbut it is impossible prove that to you will you denounce him i will save rome will you denounce him if otherwise i may preserve my country no otherwise you cannot speak will you i must know all you shall mark me then judge and rapidly concisely clearly she revealed to him the dread secret she concealed nothing neither the ends of the conspiracy nor the names of the conspirators she asseverated to him the appalling fact that half the noblest eldest families of rome were either active members of the plot sworn to spare no man or secret wellwishers content at first to remain neutral and then to share the spoils of empire according to her shewing the curii the portii the syllae the cethegi the great cornelian house the vargunteii the autronii and the longini were all for the most part implicated although some branches of the portian and cornelian houses had not been yet approached by the seducers crassus she told him too the richest citizen of rome and caius julius caesar the most popular awaited but the first success to join the parricides of the republic he listened thoughtfully earnestly until she had finished her narration and then shook his head doubtfully i think he said you must be deceived poor lucia i do not see how these things can be these men whom you have named are all of the first houses of the state have all of them either themselves or their forefathers bled for the commonwealth how then should they now wish to destroy it they are men too of all parties and all factions the syllae the proudest and haughtiest aristocrats of rome your father also belonged to the dictators faction while the cornelii and the curii have belonged ever to the tribunes party how should this be or how should those whose pride whose interest whose power alike rest on the maintenance of their order desire to mow down the patrician houses like grass beneath the scythe and give their honors to the rabble how above all should crassus whose estate is worth seven thousand talents consisting too of buildings in the heart of rome join with a party whose watchwords are fire and plunder partition of estates and death to the rich you see yourself that these things cannot be that they are not consistent you must have been deceived by their insolent and drunken boasting consistent she replied with vehement and angry irony still harping on consistency are virtuous men then consistent that you expect vicious men to be so oh the false wisdom the false pride of man you tell me these things cannot beperhaps they cannot but they are i know iti have heard seen partaken all but if you can be convinced only by seeing that the plans of men whose every action is insanity and frenzy are wise and reasonable perish yourself in your blindness and let rome perish with you i can no more farewell i leave you to your madness hold hold he cried moved greatly by her vehemence are you indeed so sure of this what in the name of all the gods can be their motive sure sure she answered scornfully i thought i was speaking to a capable and clever man of action i see that it is a mere dreamer to whose waking senses i appeal vainly if you be not sure also you must be weaker than i can conceive why if there was no plot would catiline have slaughtered medon lest it should be revealed why would he else have striven to bind you by oaths and to what if not to schemes of sacrilege and treason why would he else have murdered volero why planted ambushes against your life why would he now meditate my death his own childs death that i am forced to fly his house oh in the wide world there is no such folly as that of the over wise motivemotive enough have they while the patrician senate and the patrician consuls hold with firm hands the government full well they know that in vain violence or fraud may strive to wrest it from them let but the people hold the reins of empire and the first smoothtongued slippery demagogue the first bloody conquering soldier grasps them and is the king dictator emperor of rome never yet in the history of nations has despotism sprung out of oligarchic sway never yet has democracy but yielded to the first despots usurpation they have not read in vain the annals of past ages if you have done so paullus ha he exclaimed look they so far ahead ambition then it is but a new form of ambition will you denounce them paullus at least i will warn the consul you must denounce them or he will credit nothing i will save rome enough enough i am avenged and thou shalt be happy go to the consul straightway make your own terms ask office rank wealth power he will grant all and now farewell me you will see no more forever farewell paullus arvina fare you well forever and sometimes when you are happy in the chaste arms of julia sometimes think paullus of poor unhappy loving lost lost lucia whither by all the gods i adjure you whither would you go lucia far hence far hence my paullus where i may live obscure in tranquil solitude where i may die when my time comes in peace and innocence in rome i were not safe an hour tell me where tell me lucia how i may aid how guard console or counsel you you can do none of these things paullus all is arranged for the best within an hour i shall be journeying hence never to pass the gates to hear the turbulent roar to breathe the smoky skies to taste the maddening pleasures of glorious guilty rome there is but one thing you can do which will minister to my wellbeingbut one boon you can grant me will you and do you ask lucia will you swear she inquired with a faint melancholy smile nay it concerns no one but myself you may swear safely i do by the god of faith never seek then by word or deed to learn whither i have gone or where i dwell look i am armed and she drew out a dagger as she spoke if i am tracked or followed whether by friend or foe this will free me from persecution and it shall do so by the living lights of heaven this after all is the one true the last friend of the wretched all hail to thee healer of all intolerable anguish and she kissed the bright blade before she consigned it to the sheath and then stretching out both hands to paullus she cried you have swornremember and you promise me he replied that if at any time you need a friend a defender one who would lay down life itself to aid you you will call on me wheresoever i may be fearless and undoubting for from the festive board or the nuptial bed from the most sacred altar of the gods or from the solemn funeral pyre i will come instant to thy bidding lucia needs paullus shall be words shriller than the wartrumpets summons to my conscious soul i promise you she said willingly most willingly and now kiss me paullus julia herself would not forbid this last sad pious kiss not my lips not my lips part my hair on my brows and kiss me on the forehead where your lips years ago shed freshness and hope that has not yet died all away sweet sweet it is pure and sweet it allays the fierce burning of my brain fare you well paul and rememberremember lucia orestilla she withdrew herself from his arm modestly as she spoke lowered her veil turned and was gone many a day and week elapsed and weeks were merged in months ere any one who knew her again saw catilines unhappy guilty daughter chapter xii the forge i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on anvil cool king john it was the evening of the sixteenth day before the calends of november or according to modern numeration the eighteenth of october the eve of the consular elections when a considerable number of rough hardylooking men were assembled beneath the wide lowbrowed arch of a blacksmiths forge situated near the intersection of the cyprian lane with the sacred way and commanding a full view of the latter noble thoroughfare it was already fast growing dark and the natural obscurity of the hour was increased by the thickness of the lowering clouds which overspread the whole firmament of heaven and seemed to portend a tempest but from the jaws of the semicircular arch of roman brick within which the group was collected a broad and wavering sheet of light was projected far into the street and over the fronts of the buildings opposite rising and falling in obedience to the blast of the huge bellows which might be heard groaning and laboring within the whole interior of the roomy vault was filled with a lurid crimson light diversified at times by a brighter and more vivid glare as a column of living flame would shoot up from the embers or long trains of radiant sparks leap from the bounding anvil against this clear back ground the moving figures of the strong limbed grimy giants who plied their mighty sledges with incessant zeal on the red hot metal were defined sharply and picturesquely while alternately red lights and heavy shadows flickered across the forms and features of many other men who stood around watching the progress of the work and occasionally speaking rapidly and with a good deal of gesticulation at intervals when the preponderant din of hammers ceased and permitted conversation to be carried on audibly at this moment however there was no such pause for the embers in the furnace were at a white heat and flashes of lambent flame were leaping out of the chimney top and vanishing in the dark clouds overhead a dozen bars of glowing steel had been drawn simultaneously from the charcoal and thrice as many massive hammers were forging them into the rude shapes of weapons on the anvils which notwithstanding their vast weight appeared to leap and reel under the blows that were rained upon them faster than hail in winter but high above the roar of the blazing chimney above the din of the groaning stithy high pealed the notes of a wild alcaic ode to which chaunted by the stentorian voices of the powerful mechanics the clanging sledges made a stormy but appropriate music strike strike the iron thus echoed the stirring strain strike strike the iron children o mulciber hot from the charcoal cheerily glimmering swing swing my boys high swing the sledges heave at it heave at it all together great mars the war god watches ye laboring joyously joyous watches the gleam o the bright sparkles upsoaring the faster faster as our merry blows revive them well knoweth he that clang it arouses him heard far aloof he laughs on us hammering the sword the clear harness of iron armipotent paramour o venus red glows the charcoal bend to the task my boys time flies apace and speedily night cometh when we no more may ply the anvil fate cometh eke i the murky midnight mark ye the pines which rooted i rocky ground brave euroclydons onset at evening day dawns the tree which stood the tallest preeminent i the leafy greenwood now lies the lowest safely the arbutus which bent before him flourishes and the sun wakens the thrush which slept securely nestled in its emerald asylum so when the warshout peals i the noon o night rousing the sleepers fearful in ecstacy when slaves avenge their wrongs arising strong i the name o liberty new born when fury spares not beauty nor innocence first flame the grandest domes i the massacre first fall the noblest lowly virtue haply the shade o poverty defends forge then the broad sword quickly the night cometh when red the streets with gore o the mightiest shall fiercely flow like tiber in flood rise then avenger the time it hath come wake bloody tyrants from merry banquetting from downy couches snowybosomed women and ruby winecups wakethe avenger springs to his arms for the time it hath come the wild strain ceased and with it the clang of the hammers the bars of steel being already beaten into the form of those short massive twoedged blades which were the romans national and all victorious weapon but as it ceased a deep stern hum of approbation followed elicited probably by some real or fancied similitude between the imagery of the song and the circumstances of the auditors who were to a man of the lowest order of plebeians taught from their cradles to regard the nobles and perhaps with too much cause as their natural enemies and oppressors when the brief applause was at an end one of the elder bystanders addressed the principal workman at the forge in a low voice you are incautious caius crispus to sing such songs as this and at such a time too tush bassus answered the other it is you who are too timid what harm is there i should like to know in singing an old greek song done into latin words i like the rumbling measure for my part it suits well with the clash and clang of our rude trade for the song there is no offence in it and for the time it is a very good time and to poor men like us a better time is coming oh well said may it be so exclaimed several voices in reply to the stout smiths sharp words but the old man was not so easily satisfied for he answered at once if any of the nobles heard it they would soon find offence in it my caius oh the noblesthe nobles and the fathers i am tired of hearing of the nobles for my part i do not see what makes them noble are they a whit stronger or braver or better man than i or marcus here or any of us i trow not wiserthey are at least wiser caius said the old man once more in this if in nothing else that they keep their own councils and stand by their own order aye in oppressing the poor replied a new speaker right marcus said a second let them wrangle as much as they may with one another for their dice their women or their wine in this at least they all agree in trampling down the poor there is a good time coming replied the smith and it is very near at hand now niger he continued addressing one of his workmen carry these blades down to the lower workshop let rufus fit them instantly with horn handles and then see you to their grinding never heed polishing them very much but give them right keen edges and good stabbing points i do not know answered the other man to the first part of the smiths speech i am not so sure of that you dont know what i mean said crispus scornfully yes i doright well but i am not so confident as you are in these new leaders the smith looked at him keenly for a moment and then said significantly do you know aye do i said the other and a moment afterward when the eyes of the bystanders were not directly fixed on him he drew his hand edgewise across his throat with the action of one severing the windpipe caius crispus nodded assent but made a gesture of caution glancing his eye toward one or two of the company and whispering a moment afterward i am not sure of those fellows i see i see but they shall learn nothing from what i say then raising his voice he added what i mean caius is simply this that i have no so very great faith in the promises of this sergius catiline even if he should be elected he was a sworn friend to sylla the peoples worst enemy and never had one associate of the old marian party believe me he only wants our aid to set himself up on the horse of state authority and when he is firm in the saddle he will ride us down under the hoofs of patrician tyranny as hard as any cato or pompey of them all six or seven of the foremost group immediately about the anvil when this discourse was going on interchanged quick glances as the man used the word elected on which he laid a strong and singular emphasis and nodded slightly as indicating that they understood his more secret meaning all however except crispus the owner of the forge seemed to be moved by what he advanced and the foreman of the anvil after musing for a moment as he leaned on his heavy sledge said i believe you are right no one but a plebeian can truly mean well or be truly fitted for a leader to plebeians you are no wiser than crispus interposed the old man who had spoken first in a low angry whisper do you want to discourage these fellows from rising to the cry when it shall be set up if this be all that you can do it were as well to close the forge at once which i shall do forthwith said caius crispus for i have got through my work and my lads are weary but do not you go away my gossips nor you either he added speaking to the man whom he had at first suspected tarry you under one pretext or other we will have a cup of wine as soon as i have got rid of these fellows here aulus turning to his foreman take some coin out of my purse there it hangs by my clean tunic in the corner and go round to the wine shop and bring thence a skinful of the best sabine vintage and some of you bar up the door all but the little wicket and now my friends good night it is very late and i am going to shut up the shop good night and remember that the only hope of us working men lies in the election of catiline tomorrow be in the campus early with all your friends and hark ye you were best take your knives under your tunics lest the proud nobles should attempt to drive us from the ballot we will we will exclaimed several voices we will not be cozened out of our votes or bullied out of them either but how is this do not you vote in your class i vote with my class with my fellow plebeians and mechanics i would say what if i be one of the armorers of the first class think you that i will vote with the proud senators and insolent knights no brethren not one of us nor of the carpenters either nor of the trumpeters or hornblowers plebeians we are and plebeians we will vote and let me tell you to look sharp to me on the campus and whatever i do so do ye be sure that good will come of it to the people we will we will responded all his hearers now unanimous brave heart stout caius crispus we will have you a tribune one of these days but good night good night and with the words all left the forge except the smith and his peculiar workmen and two or three others all clients of the praetor lentulus and all in some degree associates in the conspiracy none of them however were initiated fully except caius himself his foreman aulus the aged bassus and the stranger who though unknown to any one present had given satisfactory evidence that he was privy to the most atrocious portions of the plot the wine was introduced immediately and after a deep draught circulated more than once the conversation was resumed by the initiated who were now left alone and do you believe said the stranger addressing caius crispus that catiline and his companions have any real view to the redress of grievances the regeneration of the state or the equalization of conditions not in the least i answered the swordsmith do you i did once i never did then in the name of all the gods why did you join with them because by the ruin of the great and noble the poor must be gainers because i owe what i can never pay because i lust for what i can never winluxury beauty wealth and power and if there come a civil strife with proscription confiscation massacre it shall go hard with caius crispus if he achieve not greatness and you said the man turning short round without replying to the smith and addressing the aged bassus why did you join the plotters you who are so crafty so sagacious and yet so earnest in the cause because i have wrongs to avenge answered the old man fiercely a fiery flush crimsoning his sallow face and his eye beaming lurid rage wrongs to repay which all the blood that flows in patrician veins were but too small a price ha said the other in a tone half meditative and half questioning but in truth thinking little of the speaker and reflecting only on the personal nature of the motives which seemed to instigate them all ha is it indeed so man cried the old conspirator springing forward and catching him by the arm have you a wife a child a sister if so listen you can understand me i am as you see old very old i have scars also all in front honorable scars of wounds inflicted by the moorish assagays of jugurthas desert horsemenby the huge broad swords of the teutones and cimbri my son my only son fell as an eaglebearer in the front rank of the hastati of the brave tenth legionfor we had wealth in those days and both fought and voted in the centuries of the first class but our fields were uncultivated while we were shedding our best blood for the state and to complete the ruin my rural slaves broke loose and joined spartacus the gladiator taken they died upon the cross and i was quite undone law suits and usury ate up the rest and for these eight years past old bassus has been penniless and often cold and always hungry but if this had been all it is a soldiers part to bear cold and hungerbut not to bear disgrace man there have been gyves on these legsthe whip has scarred these shoulders ye great gods the whip for what have the poor to do with their portian or valerian laws nor was this allthe eaglebearer left a child a sweet fair gentle girl the image of my gallant boy the only solace of my famishing old age i told you she was fairfatally fairtoo fair for a plebeians daughter a plebeians wife her beauty caught the lustful eyes inflamed the brutal heart of a patrician one of the great cornelii it is enough she was torn from my house dishonored and sent home to die by her own hand that would not pardon that involuntary sin she died the censors heard the tale and scoffed at the teller of it and that cornelius yet sits in the senate those censors who approved his guilt yet livei say live is not that cause enough why i should join the plotters i cannot answer no replied the other and you aulus what is your reason i would win me a noble paramour hortensias julia is very soft and beautiful the stranger looked at him steadily for a moment and an expression of disgust and horror crept over his bold face alas he said at length speaking it would seem to himself rather than to the others poor rome unhappy country but as he spoke the strong smith whose suspicion would seem to have been excited stepped forward and laid his hand upon the strangers shoulder look you he said master none of us know you here i think and we should all of us be glad to know both who you are and if indeed you be of the faction wherefore you joined it that you so closely scrutinize our motives because i was a fool caius crispus because i believed that for a great stake romans might yet forget self base and sordid self and act as becomes patriots and men because i dreamed smith till morning light came back and i awakened and and the dream asked the smith eagerly grasping the handle of his heavy hammer firmly and setting his teeth hard had vanished replied the other calmly and looking him full in the eye bar the door aulus cried the smith hastily this fellow must die here or he will betray us and he caught him by the throat as he spoke with an iron grip to prevent him from calling out or giving the alarm but the stranger though not to be compared in bulk or muscular proportions with the gigantic artizan shook off his grasp with contemptuous ease and answered with a scornful smile betray youtush i am fulvius flaccus had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the smith he could not have recoiled with wilder wonder what fulvius flaccus to whose great wrongs all injuries endured by us are but as fleabites fulvius the grandson of that fulvius flaccus who was murdered by opimius while striving for the liberties of romans but what is this by mars and quirinus there is something afoot without and as he uttered the words he sprang to the wicket which aulus had not fastened and gazed out earnestly into the darkness through which the regular and steady tramp of men advancing in ordered files could now be heard distinctly the others were beside him in an instant with terror and amazement on their faces they had not long to wait before the cause of their alarm became visible it was a band of some five hundred stout young men of the upper classes well armed with swords and the oblong bucklers of the legion though wearing neither casque nor cuirass led by a curule aedile who was accompanied by ten or twelve of the equestrian order completely armed and preceded by his apparitores or beadles and half a dozen torchbearers these men passed swiftly on in treble file marching as fast as they could down the sacred way until they reached the intersection of the street of apollo by which they proceeded straight up the ascent of the palatine whereon they were soon lost to view among the splendid edifices that covered its slope and summit by all the gods cried caius crispus this is exceedingly strange an armed guard at this time of night hist here is something more and as old bassus spoke antonius the consul who was supposed to be attached to the faction of catiline came down a byestreet from the lower end of the carinae preceded by his torchbearers and followed by a lictor with his fasces he was in full dress too as one of the presiding magistrates of the senate and bore in his hand his ivory sceptre surmounted by an eagle as soon as he had passed the door of the forge crispus stepped out into the street motioning his guests to follow him and desiring his foreman to lock the door let us follow the consul at a distance he exclaimed my bassus for as our fulvius says there is assuredly something afoot and it may be that it shall be well for us to know it come let us follow quickly they hurried onward as he proposed and keeping some twenty or thirty paces in the rear of the consuls train soon reached the foot of the street of apollo at this point however antonius paused with his lictor for in the opposite direction coming up from the cerolian place toward the forum another line of torches might be seen flaming through the darkness and even at that distance the axe heads of the lictors were visible as they flashed out by fits in the red torchlight by all the gods whispered bassus it is the other consul the new man from arpinum believe me my friends this bodes no good to us the senate must have been convoked suddenlyand lo here come the fathers look look this is stern cato and almost as he said the words a powerfully made and very noble looking man passed so near as to brush the person of the mechanic with the folds of his toga his face which was strongly marked was stern certainly but it was with the sternness of gravity and deep thought coupled perhaps with something of melancholyfor it might be that he despaired at times of mans condition in this world and of his prospects in the nextnot of austerity or pride his garb was plain in the extreme and although his tunic displayed the broad crimson facings and his robe the passmenting of senatorial rank both were of the commonest materials and the narrowest and most simple cut hail noble cato said the mechanic as the senator passed by but his voice faltered as he spoke and there was something hollow and heartless in the tones which conveyed the greeting cato raised his eyes which had been fixed on the ground in meditation and perused the features of the speaker with a severe and scrutinizing gaze and then shaking his head sternly as if dissatisfied with the result of his observation this is no time of night sirrah smith he said for thee or such as thou to be abroad thy daily work done thou shouldst be at home with thy wife and children not seeking profligate adventures or breeding foul sedition in the streets go home go home for shame on thee thou art known and marked and the severe and virtuous noble strode onward unattended he by any torchbearer or freedman and soon joined his worthy friend the great latin orator who had come up and having united his train to that of the other consul was moving up the palatine in the meantime senator after senator arrived some alone with their slaves or freedmen lighting them along the streets others in groups of two or three all hurrying toward the palatine the smith and his friends who had been at first the sole spectators of the shew were now every moment joined by more and more of the rabble until a great concourse was assembled through which the nobles had some difficulty in forcing their way toward the temple of apollo in which their order was assembling wherefore as yet they knew not at first the crowd was orderly enough and quiet but gradually beginning to ferment and grow warm as it were by the closeness of its packing cheers were heard and loud acclamations as any member of the popular faction made his way through it and groans and yells and even curses succeeded as any of the leaders of the aristocratic party strove to part its reluctant masses and now a louder burst of acclamations than any which had yet been heard rang through the streets causing the very roofs to tremble what foolery have we here said the smith very sullenly who though he responded nothing to it had by no means recovered from the rebuke of cato oh yes i see i see and he too added the power of his stentorian lungs to the clamor as a young senator splendidly dressed and of an aspect that could not fail to attract attention entered the little space which had been kept open at the corner of the two streets by the efforts of an aedile and his beadles who had just arrived on the ground he was not much if at all above the middle size but admirably proportioned whether for feats of agility and strength or for the lighter graces of society but it was his face more especially and the magnificent expression of his features that first struck the beholderthe broad imaginative brow the keen large lustrous eye pervading clear undazzled as the eagles the bold roman nose the resolute curve of the cleancut mouth full of indomitable pride and matchless energyall these bespoke at once the versatile and various genius of the great statesman orator and captain who was to be thereafter at this time however although he was advancing toward middle age and had already shaken off some of the trammels which luxurious vice and heedless extravagance had cast around his young puissant intellect he had achieved nothing either of fame or power he had it is true given signs of rare intellect but as yet they were signs only though his friends looked forward confidently to the time when they should see him the first citizen of the republic and it is more than possible that in his own heart he contemplated even now the attainment of a more glorious if more perilous elevation the locks of this noble looking personage though not arranged in that effeminate fashion which has been mentioned as characteristic of cethegus and some others were closely curled about his browfor he as yet exhibited no tendency to that baldness for which in after years he was remarkableand reeked with the choicest perfumes he wore the crimsonbordered toga of his senatorial rank but under it as it waved loosely to and fro might be observed the gaudy hues of a violet colored banqueting dress sprinkled with flowers of gold as if he had been disturbed from some festive board by the summons to council as he passed through the crowd from which loud rose the shout following him as he moved alonghail caius caesar long live the noble caesarhis slaves scattered gold profusely among the multitude who fought and scrambled for the glittering coin still keeping up their clamorous greeting while the dispenser of the wasteful largesse appearing to know every one and to forget no face or name even of the humblest had a familiar smile and a cheery word for each citizen ha bassus my old hero he exclaimed it is long since thou hast been to visit me that proves i hope that things go better nowadays at home but come and see me bassus i have something for thee to keep the cold from thy hearth this freezing weather and he paused not to receive an answer but moved forward a step or two till his eye fell upon the swordsmith what caius he said sturdy caius absent from his forge so earlybut i forgot i forgot you are a politician perhaps you can tell me why they have roused me from the best cup of massic i have tasted this ten years what is the coil caius crispus nay i know not replied the mechanic i was about to ask the same of you noble caesar i am the worst man living of whom to inquire replied the patrician with a careless smile i cannot even guess unless perchancebut as he spoke he discovered standing beside the smith the man who had called himself fulvius flaccus and interrupting himself instantly he fixed a long and piercing gaze upon him and then exclaimed ha is it thou with an expression of astonishment not all unmixed with vexation the next moment he stepped close up to him whispered a word into his ear and hurried with an altered air up the steep street which scaled the palatine a minute or two afterward crispus turned to address this man but he too was gone in quick succession senator after senator now came up the gentle slope of the sacred way until almost all the distinguished men in rome whether for good or for evil had undergone the scrutiny of the group collected around caius crispus but it was not till among the last that catiline strode by gnawing his nether lip uneasily with his wild sunken eyes glaring suspiciously about him he spoke to no one until he came opposite the smith on whom he frowned darkly exclaiming what do you here go home sirrah go home and as caius dropped his bold eyes crestfallen and abashed he added in a lower tone so that save bassus only none of the crowd could hear him wait for me at my house evil is brewing not a word more was spoken crispus and the old man soon extricated themselves from the throng and went their way and in a little time afterward the multitude was dispersed rather summarily by a band of armed men under the praetor pomptinus who cleared with very little delicacy the confines of the palatine whereon it was announced that the senate were now in secret session chapter xiii the disclosure maria montesque polliceri caepit minari interdum ferro nisi obnoxia foret sallust a woman master loves labour lost among all those of senatorial rankand they were very manywho were participants of the intended treason one alone was absent from the assemblage of the order on that eventful night the keen unquiet eye of the archtraitor missed curius from his place as it ran over the known faces of the conspirators on whom he reckoned for support curius was absent nor did his absence although it might well be although indeed it was accidental diminish anything of catilines anxiety for though he fully believed him trusty and faithful to the end though he felt that the man was linked to him indissolubly by the consciousness of common crimes he knew him also to be no less vain than he was daring and while he had no fear of intentional betrayal he apprehended the possibility of involuntary disclosures that might be perilous if not fatal in the present juncture it has been left on record of this curius by one who knew him well and was himself no mean judge of character that he possessed not the faculty of concealing any thing he had heard or even of dissembling his own crimes and catiline was not one to overlook or mistake so palpable a weakness but the truth was that knowing his man thoroughly he was aware that with the bane he bore about with him in some degree its antidote for so vast and absurd were his vain boastings and so needless his exaggerations of his own recklessness bloodthirstiness and crime that hitherto his vaporings had excited rather ridicule than fear the time was however coming when they were to awaken distrust and lead to disclosure it was perfectly consistent with the audacity of catilinean audacity which though natural stood him well in stead as a mask to cover deep designsthat even now when he felt himself to be more than suspected instead of avoiding notoriety and shunning the companionship of his fellow traitors he seemed to covet observation and to display himself in connection with his guilty partners more openly than heretofore but neither lentulus nor vargunteius nor the syllae nor any other of the plotters had seen curius or could inform him of his whereabout and ere they separated for the night amid the crash of the contending elements above and the roar of the turbulent populace below doubt and almost dismay had sunk into the hearts of several the most daring so far as mere mortal perils were to be encountered but the most abject when superstition was joined with conscious guilt to appal and confound them catiline left the others and strode away homeward more agitated and unquiet than his face or words or anything in his demeanor except his irregular pace and fitful gestures indicated dark curses quivered unspoken on his tonguethe pains of hell were in his heart already had he but known the whole how would his fury have blazed out into instant action at the very moment when the senate was so suddenly convoked on the palatine a woman of rare loveliness waited alone in a rich and voluptuous chamber of a house not far removed from the scene of those grave deliberations the chamber in which she reclined alone on a pile of soft cushions might well have been the shrine of that bland queen of love and pleasure of whom its fair tenant was indeed an assiduous votaress for there was nothing which could charm the senses or lap the soul in luxurious and effeminate ease that was not there displayed the walls glowed with the choicest specimens of the italian pencil and the soft tones and harmonious colouring were well adapted to the subjects which were the same in allvoluptuous and sensual love here venus rose from the crispsmiling waves in a rich atmosphere of light and beautythere leda toyed with the wreathed neck and ruffled plumage of the enamoured swanin this compartment danae lay warm and languid impotent to resist the blended power of the gods passion and his goldin that ariadne clung delighted to the bosom of the rosy winegod the very atmosphere of the apartment was redolent of the richest perfumes which streamed from four censers of chased gold placed on a tall candelabra of wrought bronze in the corners of the room a bowl of stained glass on the table was filled with musk roses the latest of the year and several hyacinths in full bloom added their almost overpowering scent to the aromatic odours of the burning incense armed chairs with downy pillows covered with choice embroidered cloths of calabria soft ottomans and easy couches tables loaded with implements of female luxury musical instruments drawings and splendidly illuminated rolls of the amatory bards and poetesses of the egean islands completed the picture of the boudoir of the roman beauty and on a couch piled with the tyrian cushions which yielded to the soft impress of her lovely form well worthy of the splendid luxury with which she was surrounded lay the unrivalled fulvia awaiting her expected lover if she was lovely in her rich attire as she appeared at the board of catiline with jewels in her bosom and her bright ringlets of luxuriant gold braided in fair array far lovelier was she now as she lay there reclined with those bright ringlets all dishevelled and falling in a flood of wavy silken masses over her snowy shoulders and palpitating bosom with all the undulating outlines of her superb form unadorned and but scantily concealed by a loose robe of snowwhite linen her face was slightly flushed with a soft carnation tinge her blue eyes gleamed with unusual brightness and by the fluttering of her bosom and the nervous quivering of her slender fingers as they leaned on a tripod of parian marble which stood beside the couch it was evident that she was labouring under some violent excitement he comes not she said and it is waxing late he has again failed me and if he haveruinruindebts pressing me in every quarter and no hope but from him alfenus the usurer will lend no moremy farms all mortgaged to the utmost a hundred thousand sesterces of interest due these last calends and unpaid as yet what can i dowhat hope for in him there is no helpnone nay it is vain to think of it for he is amorous as ever and could he raise the money would lavish millions on me for one kiss no he is bankrupt too and all his promises are but wild empty boastings what then is left to me she cried aloud in the intensity of her perturbation most miserable me my creditors will seize on allallall and povertyhard chilling bitter poverty is staring in my face even now ye gods ye gods and i can notcan not live poor no more rich dainties and rare wines no downy couches and soft perfumes no music to induce voluptuous slumbers no fairyfingered slaves to fan the languid brow into luxurious coolness no revelry no mirth no pleasure pleasure that is so sweet so enthralling pleasure for which i have lived only without which i must die die by the great gods i will die what avails life when all its joys are gone or what is death but one momentary pang and thenquiet yes i will die and the world shall learn that the soft epicurean can vie with the cold stoic in carelessness of living and contempt of deaththat the warm votaress of aphrodite can spend her glowing lifeblood as prodigally as the stern follower of virtue lucretia died and was counted great and noble because she cared not to survive her honour fulvia will perish wiser as soon as she shall have outlived her capacity for pleasure she spoke enthusiastically her bright eyes flashing a strange fire and her white bosom panting with the strong and passionate excitement but in a moment her mood was changed a smile as if at her own vehemence curled her lip her glance lost its quick sharp wildness she clapped her hands together and called aloud ho aegle aegle and at the call a beautiful greek girl entered the chamber voluptuous as her mistress in carriage and demeanor and all too slightly robed for modesty in garments that displayed far more than they concealed of her rare symmetry bring wine my girl cried fulvia the richest massic and hark thee fetch thy lyre my soul is dark tonight and craves a joyous note to kindle it to life and rapture the girl bowed and retired but in a minute or two returned accompanied by a darkeyed ionian bearing a tuscan flask of the choice wine and a goblet of crystal embossed with emeralds and sapphires imbedded by a process known to the ancients but now lost in the transparent glass a lyre of tortoiseshell was in the hands of aegle and a golden plectrum with which to strike its chords she had cast loose her abundant tresses of dark hair and decked her brows with a coronal of myrtle mixed with roses and as she came bounding with sinuous and graceful gestures through the door waving her white arms with the dazzling instruments aloft she might have represented well a young priestess of the cyprian queen or the light muse of amorous song the other girl filled out a goblet of the ambercoloured wine the fragrance of which overpowered for a moment as it mantled on the goblets brim the aromatic perfumes which loaded the atmosphere of the apartment and fulvia raised it to her lips and sipped it slowly and delightedly suffering it to glide drop by drop between her rosy lips to linger on her pleased palate luxuriating in its soft richness and dwelling long and rapturously on its flavour after a little while the goblet was exhausted a warmer hue came into her velvet cheeks a brighter spark danced in her azure eyes and as she motioned the ionian slavegirl to replenish the cup and place it on the tripod at her elbow she murmured in a low languid tone sing to me nowsing to me aegle and in obedience to her word the lovely girl bent her fair form over the lute and after a wild prelude full of strange thrilling melodies poured out a voice as liquid and as clear aye and as soft withal as the nightingales in a soft sapphic lovestrain full of the glorious poetry of her own lovely language where in umbrageous shadow of the greenwood buds the gay primrose i the balmy spring time where never silent philomel the wildest minstrel of ether pours her high notes and caroling delighted in the cool sunproof canopy of the ilex hung with ivy green or a bloomy dogrose idly redundant charms the fierce noon with melody in the moonbeam where the coy dryads trip it unmolested all the night long to merry dithyrambics blissfully timing their rapid steps which flit across the knot grass lightly nor shake one flower of the bluebell where liquid founts and rivulets o silver sweetly awaken clear forest echoes with unearthly laughter there will i dearest on a bank be lying where the wild thyme blows ever and the pine tree fitfully murmurs slumber inspiring come to me my dearest on the fresh greensward as a downy bridebed languid unzoned and amorous reclining like ariadne when the blythe winegod from olympus hoary wooed the soft mortal tremulously yielding all her enchantments to the mighty victor happy ariadne there will i dearest every frown abandon nor do thou fear nor hesitate to press me since if i chide tis but a girls reproval faintly reluctant doubt not i love thee whether i return thy kisses in delight or avert demurely lips that in truth burn to be kissed the closer eyes that avoid thee loth to confess how amorously glowing pants the fond heart oh tarry not but urge me coy to consent and if a blush alarm thee shyly revealing sentiments deep as the profound of ocean if a sigh faltered in an hour of anguish seem to implore theepity not the maiden often adores thee most if offending never oh believe me did the fainthearted win a girls devotion nor the true girl frown when a youth disarmed her dainty denial while she was yet singing the curtains which covered the door were put quietly aside and with a noiseless step curius entered the apartment unseen by the fair vocalist whose back was turned to him and made a sign to fulvia that she should not appear to notice his arrival the haggard and uneasy aspect which was peculiar to this manthe careworn expression halfanxious and halfjaded which has been previously described was less conspicuous on this occasion than ever it had been before since the light lady loved him there was a feverish flush on his face a joyous gleam in his dark eye and a selfsatisfied smile lighting up all his features which led her to believe at first that he had been drinking deeply and secondly that by some means or other he had succeeded in collecting the vast sum she had required of him as the unworthy price of future favours in a minute or two the voluptuous strain ended and ere she knew that any stranger listened to her amatory warblings the arm of curius was wound about her slender waist and his halflaughing voice was ringing in her ear well sung my lovely greek and daintily advisedby my faith sweet one i will take thee at thy word no no cried the girl extricating herself from his arms by an elastic spring before his lips could touch her cheek no no you shall not kiss me kiss fulvia she is handsomer than i am and loves you too come myrrha let us leave them and with an arch smile and coquettish toss of her pretty head she darted through the door and was followed instantly by the other slavegirl well trained to divine the wishes of her mistress aegle is right by venus exclaimed curius drawing nearer to his mistress you are more beautiful tonight than ever flatterer murmured the lady suffering him to enfold her in his arms and taste her lips for a moment but the next minute she withdrew herself from his embrace and said halfsmiling halfabashed but flattery will not pay my debts have you brought me the moneys for alfenus my sweet curius the hundred thousand sesterces you promised me perish the dross cried curius fiercely out on it when i come to you burning with love and passion you cast cold water on the flames by your incessant cry for gold by all the gods i do believe that you love me only for that you can wring from my purse if it be so replied the lady scornfully i surely do not love you much seeing it is three months since you have brought me so much as a ring or a jewel for a keepsake but you should rather speak the truth out plainly curius she continued in an altered tone and confess honestly that you care for me no longer if you loved me as once you did you would not leave me to be goaded by these harpies know you notwhy do i ask you do know that my house my slaves nay that my very jewels and my garments are mine but upon sufferance it wants but a few days of the calends of november and if they find the interest unpaid i shall be cast forth shamed and helpless into the streets of rome be it so answered curius with an expression which she could not comprehend be it so fulvia and if it be you shall have any house in rome you will for your abode what say you to ciceros in the carinae or the grand portico of quintus catulus rich with the cimbric spoils or better yet that of crassus with its hymettian columns on the palatine aye aye the speech of marcus brutus was prophetic who termed it the other day the house of venus on the palatine and you my love shall be the goddess of that shrine it shall be yours tomorrow if you willso you will drive away the clouds from that sweet brow and let those eyes beam forthby all the godshe interrupted himselfi will kiss thee by all the gods thou shalt notnow nor for evermore she replied in her turn growing very angrythou foolish and mendacious boaster what dost thou deem me mad or senseless to assail me with such drivelling folly begone fool or i will call my slavesi have slaves yet and if it be the last deed of service they do for me they shall spurn thee like a dog from my doorsart thou insane or only drunken curius she added breaking off from her impetuous railing into a cool sarcastic tone that stung him to the quick you shall see whether of the two harlot he replied furiously thrusting his hand into the bosom of his tunic as if to seek a weapon harlot she exclaimed springing to her feet the hot blood rushing to her brow in torrentsdare you say this to me dare do you call this daring answered the savage this what would you call it then to devastate the streets of rome with flame and falchionto hurl the fabric of the state headlong down from the blazing capitolto riot in the gore of senators patricians consularswhat to aspire to be the lords and emperors of the universe what mean you she exclaimed moved greatly by his vehemence and beginning to suspect that this was something more than his mere ordinary boasting and exaggeration what can you mean oh tell me if you do love me as you once did tell me curius and with rare artifice she altered her whole manner in an instant all the expression of eye lip tone and accent from the excess of scorn and hatred to blandishment and fawning softness no he replied sullenly i will not tell youno you doubt me distrust me scorn meno i will tell you nothing i will have all i wish or ask for on my own termsyou shall grant all or die and he unsheathed his dagger as he spoke and grasping her wrist violently with his left hand offered the weapon at her throat with his rightyou shall grant all or die nevershe answerednever looking him steadily yet softly in the face with her beautiful blue eyes to fear i will never yield whatever i may do to love or passion strike if you willstrike a weak woman and so prove your daringit will be easier if not so noble as slaying senators and consuls perdition cried the fierce conspirator i will kill her and with the word he raised his arm as if to strike and for a moment the guilty and abandoned sensualist believed that her hour was come yet she shrunk not nor quailed before his angry eye nor uttered any cry or supplication she would have died that moment as carelessly as she had lived she would have died acting out her character to the last sand of life with the smile on her lip and the soft languor in her melting eye in all things an epicurean but the fierce mood of curius changed irresolute and impotent of evil in a scarce less degree than he was sanguinary rash unprincipled and fearless it is not one of the least strange events connected with a conspiracy the whole of which is strange and much almost inexplicable that a man so wise so sagacious so deepsighted as the arch traitor should have placed confidence in one so fickle and infirm of purpose his knitted brow relaxed the hardness of his eye relented he cast the dagger from him the next moment suffering the scarf to fall from her white and dazzling shoulders the beautiful but bad enchantress flung herself upon his bosom in the abandonment of her dishevelled beauty winding her snowy arms about his neck smothering his voice with kisses a moment more and she was seated on his knee with his left arm about her waist drinking with eager and attentive ears that suffered not a single detail to escape them the fullest revelation of that atrocious plot the days the very hours of action the numbers names and rank of the conspirators a womans infamy rewarded the base villains double treason a womans infamy saved rome two hours later the crash and roar of the hurricane and earthquake cut short their guilty pleasures curius rushed into the streets headlong almost deeming that the insurrection might have exploded prematurely and found itmore than half frustrated fulvia while yet the thunder rolled and the blue lightning flashed above her head and the earth reeled beneath her footsteps went forth strong in the resolution of that roman patriotism which nursed by the institutions of the age and the pride of the haughty heart stood with her as it did with so many others in lieu of any other principle of any other virtue closely veiled unattended even by a single slave that delicate luxurious sinner braved the wild fury of the elements braved the tumultuous frenzy and more tumultuous terror of the disorganised and angry populace braved the dark superstition which crept upon her as she marked the awful portents of that night and half persuaded her to the belief that there were powers on high who heeded the ways punished the crimes of mortals and that strange sense grew on her more and more though she resisted it incredulous when after a little while she sat side by side with the wise and virtuous consul and marked the calmness almost divine of his thoughtful benignant features as he heard the full details of the awful crisis heretofore but suspected in which he stood as if upon the verge of a scarce slumbering volcano what passed between that frail woman and the wise orator none ever fully knew but they partedon his side with words of encouragement and kindnesson hers with a sense of veneration approaching almost to religious awe and the next day the usurer alfenus received in full the debt both principal and interest which he had long despaired of touching but when the great man stood alone in his silent study that strange and unexpected interview concluded he turned his eyes upward not looking even once toward the sublime bust of jupiter which stood before him serene in more than mortal grandeur extended both his arms and prayed in solemn accents all thanks to thee omnipotent ubiquitous eternal one whom we vain fools of fancy adore in many forms and under many names invest with the low attributes of our own earthy nature enshrine in mortal shapes and human habitations but thou who wert before the round world was or the blue heaven oerhung it who wilt be when those shall be no longerthou pardonest our madness guidest our blindness guardest our weakness thou by the basest and most loathed instruments dost work out thy great ends all thanks then be to thee by whatsoever name thou wouldest be addressed to thee whose dwelling is illimitable space whose essence is in every thing that we behold that moves that isto thee whom i hail god for thou hast given it to me to save my country and whether i die now by this assassins knife or live a little longer to behold the safety i establish i have lived long enough and am content to diewhether this death be as philosophers have told us a dreamless senseless and interminable trance or as i sometimes dream a brief and passing slumber from which we shall awaken into a purer brighter happier beingi have lived long enough and when thou callest me will answer to thy summons glad and grateful for rome at least survives me and shall perchance survive till time itself is ended the queen of universal empire chapter xiv the warnings these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us king lear the morning of the eighteenth of october the day so eagerly looked forward to by the conspirators and so much dreaded by the good citizens of the republic had arrived and now was seen as it will oftentimes happen that when great events however carefully concealed are on the point of coming to light a sort of vague rumour or indefinite anticipation is found running through the whole mass of societya rumour traceable to no one source possessing no authority and deserving no credibility from its origin or even its distinctness yet in the main true and correctan anticipation of i know not what terrible unusual and exaggerated issue yet after all not very different from what is really about to happen thus it was at this period andthough it is quite certain that on the preceding evening at the convocation of the senate no person except cicero and paullus unconnected with the conspiracy knew anything at all of the intended massacre and conflagration though no one of the plotters had yet broken faith with his fellows and though none of the leaders dared avow their schemes openly even to the discontented populace with whom they felt no sympathy and from whom they expected no cordial or general cooperationit is equally certain that for many days and even months past there had been a feverish and excited state of the public mind an agitation and restlessness of the operative classes an indistinct and vague alarm of the noble and wealthy orders which had increased gradually until it was now at its height among all these parties this restlessness had taken the shape of anticipation either dreadful or desirable of some great change of some strange noveltythough no one either of the wishers or fearers could explain what it was he wished or fearedto be developed at the consular comitia and amid this confusion most congenial to his bold and scornful spirit catiline stalked like the arch magician to and fro amid the wild and fantastic shapes of terror which he has himself evoked marking the hopes of this one as indications of an unknown yet sure friend and revelling in the terrors of that as certain evidences of an enemy too weak and powerless to be formidable to his projects it is true that a year before previous to ciceros elevation to the chief magistracy and previous to the murder of piso by his own adherents on his way to spain the designs of catiline had been suspected dangerous and as such had contributed to the election of his rival his own faction succeeding only in carrying in antonius the second and least dreaded of their candidates him cicero by rare management and much selfsacrifice had contrived to bring over to the cause of the commonwealth although he had so far kept his faith with catiline as to disclose none if indeed he knew any of his infamous designs in consequence of this defeat and this subsequent secession of one on whom they had perhaps prematurely reckoned the conspirators all but their indomitable and unwearied leader had been for some time paralyzed and this fact joined to the extreme caution of their latter proceedings had tended to throw a shade of doubt over the previous accusation and to create a sense of carelessness and almost of disbelief in the minds of the majority as to the real existence of any schemes at all against the commonwealth under all these circumstances it cannot be doubted for a moment that had catiline and his friends entertained any real desire of ameliorating the condition of the masses of extending the privileges or improving the condition of the discontented and suffering plebeians they could have overturned the ancient fabric of romes worldconquering oligarchy but the truth is they dreamed of nothing less than of meddling at all with the condition of the people on whom they looked merely as tools and instruments for the present and sources of plunder and profit in the future they could not trust the plebeians because they knew that the plebeians in their turn could not trust them the dreadful struggles of marius cinna and sylla had convinced those of all classes who possessed any stake in the well being of the country any estate or property however humble down even to the tools of daily labour and the occupation of permanent stalls for daily traffic that it was neither change nor revolution nor even larger libertymuch less proscription civil strife and fireraisingbut rest but tranquillity but peace that they required it was not to the people therefore properly so called but to the dissolute and ruined outcasts of the aristocracy and to the lowest rabble the homeless idle vicious drunken poor who having nothing to love have necessarily all to gain by havoc and rapine that the conspirators looked for support the first class of these was won bound by oaths only less binding than their necessities and desperation sure guaranties for their good faith the secondcatiline well knew thatneeded no winning the first clang of arms in the streets the first blaze of incendiary flames no fear but they would rise to rob to ravish and slayensuring that grand anarchy which he proposed to substitute for the existing state of things and on which he hoped to build up his own tyrannous and bloodcemented empire so stood affairs on the evening of the seventeenth and although at times a suspicionnot a fear for of that he was incapableflitted across the mind of the traitor that things were not going on as he could wish them that the alienation of paullus arvina and the absence of his injured daughter must probably work together to the discomfiture of the conspiracy still as hour after hour passed away and no discovery was made he revelled in his anticipated triumph of the interview between paullus and lucia he was as yet unaware and with that singular inconsistency which is to be found in almost every mind although he disbelieved as a principle in the existence of honor at all he yet never doubted that young arvina would hold himself bound strictly by the pledge of secrecy which he had reiterated after the frustration of the murderous attempt against his life in the cave of egeria nor did he err in his premises for had not arvina been convinced that new and more perilous schemes were on the point of being executed against himself he would have remained silent as to the names of the traitors however he might have deemed it his duty to reveal the meditated treason with his plans therefore all matured his chief subordinates drilled thoroughly to the performance of their parts his minions armed and ready he doubted not in the least as he gazed on the setting sun that the next rising of the great luminary would look down on the conflagration of the suburbs on the slaughter of his enemies and the triumphant elevation of himself to the supreme command of the vast empire for which he played so foully the morning came the long desired sun arose and all his plots were countermined all his hopes of immediate action paralyzed if not utterly destroyed the senate assembled on the previous evening at a moments notice had been taken by surprise so completely by the strange revelations made to them by their consul that not one of the advocates or friends of catiline arose to say one syllable in his defence and he himself quickwitted ready daring as he was and fearing neither man nor god was for once thunderstricken and astonished the address of the consul was short practical and to the point and the danger he foretold to the order was so terrible while the inconvenience of deferring the elections was so small and its occurrence so frequenta sudden tempest the striking of the standard on the janiculum the interruption of a tribune or the slightest informality in the augural rites sufficing to interrupt themthat little objection was made in any quarter to the motion of cicero that the comitia should be delayed until the matter could be thoroughly investigated for he professed only as yet to possess a clue which he promised hereafter to unravel to the end catiline had however so far recovered from his consternation that he had risen to address the house when the first words he uttered were drowned by a strange and unearthly sound like the rumbling of ten thousand chariots over a stony way beginning as it seemed underneath their feet and rising gradually until it died away over head in the murky air before there was time for any comment on this extraordinary sound a tremulous motion crept through the marble pavements increasing every moment until the doors flew violently open and the vast columns and thick walls of the stately temple reeled visibly in the dread earthquake nor was this all for as the portals opened in the black skies right opposite the entrance there stood glaring with red and lurid light a bearded star or comet which to the terrorstricken eyes of the fathers seemed a portentous sword brandished above the city the groans and shrieks of the multitude rushed in with an appalling sound to increase their superstitious awe and to complete the whole a pale and ghastly messenger was ushered into the house announcing that a bright lambent flame was sitting on the lanceheads of the praetors guard which had been summoned to protect the senate in its deliberations a fell sneer curled the lip of catiline he was not even superstitious selfvanity and confidence in his own powers and long impunity in crime had hardened him had maddened him almost to atheism yet he dared not attack the sacred prejudices of the men whom but for that occurrence he had yet hoped to win to their own undoing but as he saw their blanched visages and heard their mutterings of terror he saw likewise that an impression was made on their minds which no words of his could for the present counteract and with a sneering smile at fears which he knew not and a smothered curse at the accident as he termed it which had foiled him he sat down silent the gods have spoken exclaimed cicero flinging his arms abroad majestically the guilty are struck dumb the gods have spoken aloud their sympathy for romes peril and will ye ye its chosen sons whose all of happiness and life lie in its sanctity and safety will ye i say love your own country your own mother less than the gods love her the moment was decisive the appeal irresistible by acclamation the vote was carried no need to debate or to divide the housethat the elections be deferred until the eleventh day before the calends and that the senate meet again tomorrow shortly after sunrise to deliberate what shall be done to protect the republic morning came dark indeed and lurid and more like the close than the opening of day morning came but it brought no change with it for not a head in rome had lain that night upon a pillow save those of the unburied dead or the bedridden young men and aged sick and sound masters and slaves had wooed no sleep during the hours of darkness so terribly so constantly was it illuminated by the broad flashes of blue lightning and the strange meteors which rushed almost incessantly athwart the sky the winds too had been all unchained in their fury and went howling like tormented spirits over the terrified and trembling city it was said too that the shades of the dead had arisen and were seen mingling in the streets with the living scarcely more livid than the halfdead spectators of portents so ominous no rumour so absurd or fanatical but it found on that night implicit credence some shouted in the streets and open places that the patricians and the knights were arming their adherents for a promiscuous massacre of the people some that the gladiators had broken loose and slain thousands of citizens already some that there was a gallic tumult and that the enemy would be at the gates in the morning some that the gods had judged rome to destruction and so they raved and roared and sometimes fought and would have rioted tremendously for many of the commoner conspirators were abroad ready to take advantage of any casual incident to breed an affray but that a strong force of civil magistrates patrolled the streets with armed attendants and that during the night several cohorts were brought in from the armies of quintus marcius rex and quintus metellus creticus with all their armor and war weapons in heavy marching order and occupied the capitol the palatine and the janiculum and all the other prominent and commanding points of the city with an array that set opposition at defiance so great however were the apprehensions of many of the nobles that rome was on the eve of a servile insurrection that many of them armed their freedmen and imprisoned all their slaves while others the more generous and milder who thought they could rely on the attachment of their people weaponed their slaves themselves and fortified their isolated dwellings against the anticipated onslaught thus passed that terrible and tempestuous night the roar of the elements unchained as they were and at their work of havoc not sufficing to drown the dissonant and angry cries of men the clash of weapons and the shrill clamor of women which made rome more resemble the pandemonium than the metropolis of the worlds most civilized and mightiest nation but now morning had come at length and gradually as the storm ceased and the heavens resumed their natural appearance the terrors and the fury of the multitude subsided and partly satisfied by the constant and welltimed proclamations of the magistrates partly convinced that for the moment there was no hope of successful outrage and yet more wearied out with their own turbulent vehemence whether of fear or anger the crowd began to retire to their houses and the streets were left empty and silent as the day dawned there was no banner hoisted on the janiculum although its turrets might be seen bristling with the short massive javelins of the legions and gleaming with the tawny light that flashed from their brazen casques and corslets there was no augural tent pitched on the hills without the city walls wherefrom to take the auspices and above all there were no loud and stirring calls of the brazen trumpets of the centuries to summon forth the civic army of the roman people to the campus there to elect their rulers for the ensuing year it was apparent therefore to all men that the elections would not be held that day though none knew clearly wherefore they had been deferred while the whole city was loud with turbulent confusionfor as morning broke and it was known that the comitia were postponed the agitation of terror succeeded to that of insubordinationhortensia and her daughter sat together pale anxious and heartsick yet firm and free from all unworthy evidences of dismay during the past night which had been to both a sleepless one they had sate listening lone and weak women to the roar of tumultuous streets and expecting at every moment they knew not what of violence and outrage paullus arvina had come in once to reassure them and informed them that the vigilance of the consul had been crowned with success and that the danger of a conflict in the streets was subsiding every moment still the care which he bestowed on examining the fastenings of the doors and such windows as looked into the streets the earnestness with which he inculcated watchful heed to the armed slaves of the household and the positive manner in which he insisted on leaving thrasea and a dozen of his own trustiest men to assist hortensias people did more to obliterate the hopes his own words would otherwise have excited than the words themselves to excite them nor was it indeed to be wondered that hortensia should be liable above other women not to base terrorfor of that from her high character she was incapablebut to a settled apprehension and distrust of the roman populace it was now fourandtwenty years since the city had been disturbed by plebeian violence or aristocratic vengeance twentyfour years ago the avenging sword of sylla had purged the state of its bloodthirsty demagogues and their brute followers twentyfour years ago his powerful hand had reestablished romes ancient constitution full of checks and balances which secured equal rights to every roman citizen which secured all equality in short to all men save that which no human laws can give equality of social rank and equality of wealth the years however which had gone before that restoration the dreadful massacres and yet more dreadful proscriptions of cinna and marius had left indelible and sanguinary traces on the ancestral tree of many a noble house and on none deeper than on that of hortensias family her brother caius julius an orator second to none in those days had been murdered by the followers of marius almost before his sisters eyes with circumstances of appalling cruelty her house had been forced open by the infuriate rabble her husband hewn down with unnumbered wounds on his own hearthstone and her first born child tossed upon the revolutionary pike heads her husband indeed recovered almost miraculously from his wounds and lived to see retribution fall upon the guilty partizans of marius but he was never well again and after languishing for years died at last of the wounds he received on that bloody day good cause then had hortensia to tremble at the tender mercies of the people nor though they struck the minds of these highborn ladies with less perplexity and awe than the vulgar souls without were the portents and horrors of the heaven without due effect no mind in those days however clear and enlightened but held some lingering belief that such things were ominous of coming wrath and sent by the gods to inform their faithful worshippers it was moreover fresh in her memory how two years before during the consulship of cotta and torquatus in a like terrible nightstorm the fire from heaven had stricken down the highest turrets of the capitol melted the brazen tables of the law and scathed the gilded effigy of romulus and remus sucking their shaggy fostermother which stood on the capitoline the augurs in those days collected from etruria and all parts of italy after long consultation had proclaimed that unless the gods should be appeased duly the end of rome and her empire was at hand and nowwhat though for ten whole days consecutive the sacred games went on what though nothing had been omitted whereby to avert the immortal indignationdid not this heavenborn tempest prove that the wrath was not soothed that the decree yet stood firm in such deep thoughts and in the strong excitement of such expectation hortensia and her daughter had passed that awful night not without high instructions from the elder lady grave and yet stirring narratives of the great men of oldhow they strove fiercely energetically while strife could avail anything and how when the last hope was over they folded their hands in stern and awful resignation and met their fate unblenching and with but one carethat the decorum of their deaths should not prove unworthy the dignity of their past lives not without generous and noble resolutions on the part of both that they too would not be found wanting but there was nothing humble nothing soft in their stern and proud submission to the inevitable necessity nothing of love toward the hand which dealt the blownothing of confidence in supernal justice much less in supernal mercy nothing of that sweet hope that undying trust that consciousness of selfunworthiness that full conviction of a glorious future which renders so beautiful and happy the submission of a dying christian no there were none of these things for to the wisest and best of the ancients the foreshadowings of the souls immortality were dim faint and uncertain the legends of their mythology held up such pictures of the sensuality and vice of those whom they called gods that it was utterly impossible for any sound understanding to accept them and deep thinkers were consequently driven into pure deism coupled too often with the epicurean creed that the great spirit was too grand and too sublime to trouble himself with the brief doings of mortality the whole scope of the romans hope and ambition then was limited to this world or if there was a longing for anything beyond the term of mortality it was for a name a memory an immortality of good report and pride which the christian better instructed knows to be the germ and root of all sin was to the roman the sole spring of honourable action the sole source of virtue now with the morning quiet was restored both to the angry skies and to the restless city worn out with anxiety and watching sleep fell upon the eyes of julia as she sat half recumbent in a large softlycushioned chair of etruscan bronze her fair head fell back on the crimson pillow with all its wealth of auburn ringlets flowing dishevelled and that soft still shadow which is yet in its beautiful serenity half terrible so nearly is it allied to the shadow of that sleep from which there comes no waking fell over her pale features the mother gazed on her for a moment with more gentleness in her eye and a milder smile on her face than her indomitable pride often permitted her to manifest she sleepsshe said looking at her wistfullyshe sleeps aye the young sleep easily even in their affliction they sleep and forget their sorrows and awaken either to fresh woes as soon to be obliterated or to vain joys yet briefer and more fleeting thoughtlessness to the younganguish to the oldsuch is mortality and what beyondaye whatwhat that we should so toil so suffer to be virtuous is it a dream all a dreamthis futurity i fear soand with the words she lapsed into a fit of solemn meditation and stood for many minutes silent and absorbed then a keen light came into her dark eyes a flash of animation coloured her pale cheeks she stretched her arms aloft and in a clear sonorous voiceno no she said honourhonourimmortal honour thou at least art no dreamthou art worth dying suffering aye worth living to obtain for what is life but the deeper sorrow to the more virtuous and the nobler a few minutes longer she stood gazing on her daughters beautiful face until the sound of voices louder than usual and a slight bustle in the peristyle attracted her attention then after throwing a pallium or shawl of richly embroidered woollen stuff over the fair form of the sleeper she opened the door leading to the garden colonnade and left the room silently scarcely had hortensia disappeared before the opposite door by which the saloon communicated with the atrium was opened and a slave entered bearing a small folded note secured by a waxen seal on a silver plate he approached julias chair apparently in some hesitation as if he felt that it was his duty and was yet half afraid to awaken her at length however he made up his mind and addressed a word or two to her which were sufficiently distinct to arouse herfor she started up and gazed wildly about herbut left no clear impression of their meaning on her mind this however the man did not appear to notice at all events he did not wait to observe the effect of his communication but quitted the room hastily and in considerable trepidation leaving the note on the table julia was sleeping very heavily at the moment when she was so startled from her slumber and as is not unfrequently the case a sort of bewilderment and nervous agitation fell upon her as she recovered her senses perhaps she had been dreaming and the imaginary events of her dream had blended themselves with the real occurrence which awakened her but for a minute or two though she saw the note and the person who laid it on the table she could neither bring it to her mind who that person was nor divest herself of the impression that there was something both dangerous and supernatural in what had passed in a little while this feeling passed away and though still nervous and trembling the young girl smiled at her own alarm as she took up the billet which was directed to herself in a delicate feminine hand with the usual form of superscription to julia serena health although the writers name was omitted she gazed at it for a moment wondering from whom it could come since she had no habitual correspondent and the handwriting though beautiful was strange to her she opened it and read her wonder and agitation increasing with every line you love paullus arvina thus it ran and are loved by him he is worthy all your affection are you worthy of him i know not i love him also but alas less happy am not loved again nor hope to be nor indeed deserve it they tell me you are beautiful i have seen you and yet i know notthey told me once that i too was beautiful and yet i know not i know this only that i am desperate and base and miserable yet fear me not nor mistake me i love paullus yet would not have him mine now no not to be happyas to be his would render me yet had it not been for you i might have been virtuous honourable happy hisfor winning him from me you won from me hope and with hope virtue and with virtue honour ought i not then to hate you julia perchance i oughtto do so were at least romanand hating to avenge perchance if i hoped i should but hoping nothing i hate nothing dread nothing and wish nothingyea by the gods i wish to know paullus happyyea more i wish even at cost of my own misery to make him happy shall i do so by making him yours julia i think so for be surebe sure he loves you else had he yielded to my blandishments to my passion to my beauty for i amby the gods i am though he

so by all the gods i adjure you do so and if you do not trembletremble i sayfor think if i sacrifice myself to win bliss for himthink girl how gladly how triumphantly i would destroy a rival who should fail to do that for which alone i spare her spare her nay but much more for i can save hercan and will strange things will come to pass ere long and terrible and to no one so terrible as to you there is a man in rome so powerful that the gods only if there be gods can compare with himso haughty in ambition that stood he second in olympus he would risk all things to be firstso cruel that the dugdrawn hyrcanian tigress were pitiful compared to himso reckless of all things divine or human that did his own mother stand between him and his vengeance he would strike through her heart to gain it this man hath paullus made his foehe hath crossed his path he hath foiled him he never spared man in his wrath or woman in his passion he hateth paullus he hath looked on julia think then when lust and hate spur such a man together what will restrain him now mark me and you shall yet be safe all means will be essayed to win you for he would torture paul by making him his slave ere he make you his victim and paul may waver he hath wavered once chance only and i rescued him i can do no more for rome must know me no longer see then that thou hold him constant in the rightfirm for his country so may he defy secret spite as he hath defied open violence now for thyselfbeware of women go not forth alone ever or without armed followers sleep not but with a woman in thy chamber and a watcher at thy door eat not nor drink any thing abroad nor at home save that which is prepared by known hands and tasted by the slave who serves it be true to paullus and yourself and you have a friend ever watchful so fear not nor despond fail meand failing truth and honour failing to make paullus happy you do fail me fail me and nothing in the worlds history or fable shall match the greatness of my vengeanceof your anguish fail me and yours shall be for ages the name that men shall quote when they would tell of untold misery of utter shame and desolation and despair farewell the letter dropped from her hand she sat aghast and speechless terrified beyond measure and yet unable to determine or divine even to what its dark warnings and darker denunciations pointed just at this instant as between terror and amazement she was on the verge of fainting a clanging step was heard without the crimson draperies that covered the door were put aside and clad in glittering armour paullus arvina stood before her she started up with a strange haggard smile flashing across her pallid face staggered a step or two to meet him and sank in an agony of tears upon his bosom chapter xv the confession to err is human to forgivedivine the astonishment of paullus at this strange burst of feeling on the part of one usually so calm so selfcontrolled and seemingly so unimpassioned as that sweet lady may be more easily imagined than described that she whose maidenly reserve had never heretofore permitted the slightest the most innocent freedom of her accepted lover should cast herself thus into his arms should rest her head on his bosom was in itself enough to surprise him but when to this were added the violent convulsive sobs which shook her whole frame the flood of tears which streamed from her eyes the wild and disjointed words which fell from her pale lips he was struck dumb with something not far removed from terror that it was fear which shook her thus he could not credit for during all the fearful sounds and rumours of the past night she had been as firm as a hero yet he knew not dared not think to what other cause he might attribute it he spoke to her soothingly tenderly but his voice faltered as he spoke nay nay be not alarmed dear girl he said the tumults are all long since quelled the danger has all vanished with the darkness and the storm cheer up my own sweet julia and as he spoke he passed his arm about her graceful form and drew her closer to his bosom but whether it was this movement or something in his words that aroused her she started from his arms in a moment and stood erect and rigid pale still and agitated but no longer trembling she raised her hands to her brow and put away the profusion of rich auburn ringlets which had fallen down dishevelled over her eyes and gazed at him stedfastly strangely as she had never gazed at him before your own julia she said in slow accents scarce louder than a whisper but full of strong and painful meaning oh i adjure you by the gods by all you love or hope are you false to me paullus false julia he exclaimed starting and the blood rushing consciously to his bold face i am answered she said collecting herself with a desperate effort it is wellthe gods guard youleave me leave you he cried by earth and sea and heaven and all that they contain i know not what you mean know you this writing then she asked him reaching the letter from the table and holding it before his eyes no more than i know what so strangely moves you he answered and she saw by the unaffected astonishment which pervaded all his features that he spoke truly read it she said somewhat more composed and tell me who is the writer of it you must know before he had read six lines it was clear to him that it must come from lucia and no words can describe the agony the eager intense torture of anticipation with which he perused it devouring every word and at every word expecting to find the damning record of his falsehood inscribed in characters that should admit of no denial before however he had reached the middle of the letter he felt that he could bear the scrutiny of that pale girl no longer and lowering the strip of vellum on which it was written met her eye firmly for he was resolute for once to do the true and honest thing let what might come of it the weaker points of his character were vanishing rapidly and the last few eventful days had done the work of years upon his mind and all that work was salutary she too read something in the expression of his eye which led her to hopewhat she knew not and she smiled faintly as she said you know the writer paullus julia i know her he replied steadily her she said laying an emphasis on the word but how affected by it arvina could not judge it is then a woman a very young a very beautiful a very wretched girl he answered and you love her she said with an effort at firmness which itself proved the violence of her emotion by your life julia i do not he replied with an energy that spoke well for the truth of his asseveration nor ever loved her nor everloved her julia but he hesitated a little as he said it and laid a peculiar stress on the word loved which did not escape the anxious ears of the lovely being whose whole soul hung suspended on his speech why not she asked after a moments pause if she be so very young and so very beautiful i might answer because i never saw her till i loved one more beautiful but but you will not she interrupted him vehemently oh if you love me if you do love me paullus do not answer me so and wherefore not he asked her half smiling though little mirthful in his heart at her impetuosity because if you descend to flatter answered the fair girl quietly i shall be sure that you intended to deceive me it would be strictly true notwithstanding for though as she says we met years ago she was but a child then and since that time i never saw her until four or five days ago and since then how often julia again interrupted him for in the intensity of her anxiety she could not wait the full answer to one question before another suggested itself to her mind and found voice at the instant once julia only once once only by the gods you have not told me wherefore it was that you never loved her have i not told you that i never saw her till a few days a few hours i might have said ago and does not that tell you wherefore julia but there is something more there is another reason oh tell me i adjure you by all that you hold dearest tell me there is another reason i told you that she was very young and very beautiful but julia she was also very guilty guilty exclaimed the fair girl blushing fiery red guilty of loving you oh paullus paullus and between shame and anger and the repulsive shock that every pure and feminine mind experiences in hearing of a sisters frailty she buried her face in her hands and wept aloud guilty before i ever heard her name or knew that she existed answered the young man fervently but his heart smote him somewhat as he spoke though what he said was but the simple truth and it was well for him perhaps at the present moment that julia did not see his face for there was much perturbation in it and it is like that she would have judged even more hardly of that perturbation than it entirely deserved he paused for a moment and then added but if the guilt of woman can be excusable at all she can plead more in extenuation of her errors than any of her sex that ever fell from virtue she is most penitent and might have been but for fate and the atrocious wickedness of others a most noble beingas she is now a most glorious ruin there was another pause during which neither spoke or moved julia overpowered by the excess of her feelingshe by the painful consciousness of wrong the difficulty of explaining of extenuating his own conduct and above all the dread of losing the enchanting creature whom he had never loved so deeply or so truly as he did now when he had well nigh forfeited all claim to her affection at length she raised her eyes timidly to his and said this is all very strangethere must be much that i have a right to hear there is much juliamuch that will be very painful for me to tell and yet more so for you to listen to and will you tell it to me julia i will and all and truly and all and truly if i tell you at all but you first she said interrupting him read that strange letter to the end then we will speak more of these things nay she continued seeing that he was about to speak i will have it so it must be so or all is at an end between us two now and for ever i do not wish to watch you there is no meanness in my mind paullus no jealousy i am too proud to be jealous either you are worthy of my affection or unworthy if the latter i cast you from me without one pang one sorrowif the first farther words are needless read that wild letter to the end i will turn my back to you and seating herself at the table she took up a piece of embroidery and made as if she would have fixed her mind upon it but paullus saw as his glance followed her that notwithstanding the firmness of her words and manner her hand trembled so much that she could by no means thread her needle he gazed on her for a moment with passionate despairing love and as he gazed his spirit faltered and he doubted the evil genius whispered to his soul that truth must alienate her love must sever her from him for ever there was a sharp and bitter struggle in his heart for that momentbut it passed and the better spirit was again strong and clear within him no he said to himself no i have done with fraud and falsehood i will not win her by a lie if by the truth i must lose her be it so i will be true and at least i candie thereon without another word he read the letter to the end neither faltering nor pausing and then walked calmly to the table and laid it down perfectly resolute and tranquil for his mind was made up for the worst have you read it she asked and her voice trembled as much as her hand had done before i have julia to the end it is very sadand much of it is true and who is the girl who wrote it her name is lucia orestilla orestilla ye gods ye gods the shameless wife of the arch villain catiline not sobut the wretched ruined daughter of that abandoned woman call her not woman by the gods that protect purity call her not woman did she not prompt the wretch to poison his own son oh call her anything but woman but whatwhatin the name of all that is good or holy can have brought you to know that awful beings daughter first julia you must promise me never to mortal ears to reveal what i now disclose to you have you forgotten paullus that i am yet but a young maiden and that i have a mother hortensia exclaimed the youth starting back aghast for he felt that from her clear eye and powerful judgment nothing could be concealed and that her iron will would yield in nothing to a womans tenderness a womans mercy hortensia replied the girl gently the best the wisest and the tenderest of mothers true she is all that you saymore than all but she is resolute withal as iron and stern and cold and unforgiving in her anger and do you need so much forgiveness paullus more i fear than my julias love will grant me i think my paullus you do not know the measure of a girls honest love but may i tell hortensia if not you have said enough what is not fitting for a girl to speak to her own mother it is not fitting that she should hear at allleast of all from a man and that manher lover it is not that my julia but what i have to say contains many livesmine among others contains romes safety nay existence one whisper breathed abroad or lisped in a slaves hearing were the worlds ruin but be it as you willas you think best yourself and wisest if you will tell hortensia i shall tell her paullus i tell her everything since i could babble my first words i never had a secret from her be it so sweet one now i implore you hear me to the end before you judge me and then judge mercifully as the gods are merciful and mortals prone to error and will you tell me the whole truth the whole say on then i will hear you to the end and your guilt must be great paullus if you require a more partial arbitress it was a trying and painful task that was forced upon him yet he went through it nobly at every word the difficulties grew upon him at every word the temptation to swerve from the truth increased at every word the dread of losing her the agony of apprehension the dull cold sense of despair waxed heavier and more stunning the longer he spoke the more certain he felt that by his own words he was destroying his own hope yet he manned his heart stoutly resisted the foul tempter and firm in the integrity of his present purpose laid bare the secrets of his soul beginning from his discovery of medons corpse upon the esquiline he now narrated to her fully all that had passed including much that in his previous tale he had omitted he told of his first meeting with cataline upon the caelian of his visit to cicero of his strange conversation with the cutler volero of his second encounter with the traitor in the field of mars not omitting the careless accident by which he revealed to him voleros recognition of the weapon he told her of the banquet of the art with which catiline plied him with wine of the fascinations of that fair fatal girl and here he paused awhile reluctant to proceed he would have given worlds had he possessed them to catch one glance of her averted eye to read her features but one moment but she sat with her back toward him her head downcast tranquil and motionless save that a tremulous shivering at times ran through her frame perceptible he was compelled perforce to continue his narration and now he was bound to confess that for the moment he had been so bewitched by the charms of the siren that he had bound himself by the fatal oath scarce knowing what he swore which linked him to the fortunes of the villain father slightly he touched on that atrocity of catiline by telling which aloud he dared not sully her pure ears he then related clearly and succinctly the murder of the cutler volero his recognition of the murderer the forced deception which he had used reluctantly toward cicero and the suspicions and distrust of that great man and here again he paused hoping that she would speak and interrupt him if it were even to condemn for so at least he should be relieved from the sickening apprehension which almost choked his voice still she was silent and in so far as he could judge more tranquil than before for the quick tremors had now ceased to shake her and her tears he believed had ceased to flow but was not this the cold tranquillity of a fixed resolution the firmness of a desperate selfcontrolling effort he could endure the doubt no longer and in a softer and more humble voice now then he said you know the measure of my sinthe extent of my falsehood all the ill of my tale is told faithfully frankly what remains is unmixed with evil say then have i sinned julia beyond the hope of forgiveness if to confess that my eyes dazzled with beauty my blood inflamed with wine my better self drowned in a tide of luxury unlike aught i had ever known before my senses wrought upon by every art and every fascinationif to confess that my head was bewildered my reason lost its way for a momentthough my heart never never failed in its faithand by the hopes frail hopes which i yet cling to of obtaining youthe dread of losing you for ever julia by these i swear my heart never did fail or falter if i say to confess this be sufficient and i stand thus condemned and lost for ever spare me the resti may as well be silent she paused a moment ere she answered and it was only with an effort choking down a convulsive sob that she found words at all proceed she said with your tale i cannot answer you but catching at her words with all the elasticity of youthful hope he fancied that she had answered him and cried joyously and eagerly sweet julia then you can you will forgive me i have not said so paullus she began but he interrupted her ere she could frame her sentence no dearest but your speech implied it and but here in her turn she interrupted him saying then paullus did my speech imply what i did not intend for i have not forgivendo not know if i can forgive all that has passed all depends on that which is to come you made me promise not to interrupt your tale i have not done so and in justice i have the right to ask that you should tell it out before you claim my final answer so i say once again proceed unable from the steadiness of her demeanour so much even as to conjecture what were her present feelings yet much dispirited at finding his mistake the young man proceeded with his narrative gaining courage however as he continued speaking the principal difficulties of his story being past he warmed and spoke more feelingly more eloquently with every word he uttered he told her of the deep depression which had fallen on him the following morning when her letter had called him to the house of hortensia he again related the attack made on him by catiline on the same evening in egerias grotto and spoke of the absolute despair in which he was plunged seeing the better course yet unable to pursue it aiming at virtue yet forced by his fatal oath to follow vice marking clearly before him the beacon light of happiness and honour yet driven irresistibly into the gulf of misery crime and destruction he told her of lucias visit to his house how she released him from his fatal oath disclaimed all right to his affection nay to his respect even and esteem encouraged him to hold honour in his eye and in the scorn of consequence to follow virtue for its own sake he told her too of the conspiracy in all its terrible details of atrocity and guiltthat dark and hideous scheme of treason cruelty lust horror from which he had himself escaped so narrowly then with a glow of conscious rectitude he proved to her that he had indeed repented that he was now howsoever he might have been deceived into error and to the brink of crime firm and resolved a champion of the right a defender of his country trusted and chosen by the great consul and in proof of that trust commissioned by him now to lead his troop of horsemen to praeneste a strong fortress near at hand which there was reason to expect might be assailed by the conspirators and now my tale is ended he said i did hope there would have been no need to reveal these things to you but from the first i have been resolved if need were to open to you my whole heartto show you its dark spots as its bright ones i have sinned julia deeply against you your purity your love should have guarded me yet in a moment of treacherous selfconfidence my head grew dizzy and i fell but oh believe me julia my heart never once betrayed you now saycan you pardon metrust melove mebe mine as you promised if notspeed me on my way and my first battlefield shall prove my truth to rome and julia oh this is very sad my paullus she replied very humiliatingvery very bitter i had a trust so perfect in your love i could as soon have believed the sunflower would forget to turn to the daygod as that paul would forget julia i had a confidence so high so noble in your proud untouched virtue and yet i find that at the first alluring glance of a frail beauty you fall off from your truth to meat the first whispering temptation of a demon you half fall off from patriotismhonourvirtue forgive you paullus i can forgive you readily for well alas i know that the best of us all are very frail and prone to evil love you alas for me i do as much as everbut say yourself how can i trust you how can i be yours when the next moment you may fall again into temptation again yield to it and then what would then remain to the wretched julia but a most miserable life and an untimely grave the proud man bowed his head in bitter anguish he buried his face in his hands he gasped and almost groaned aloud in his great agony his heart confessed the truth of all her words and it was long ere he could answer her perhaps he would not have collected courage to do so at all but would have risen in his agony of pride and despair and gone his way to die heartbroken hopeless a lost man but shefor her heart yearned to her loverarose and crossed the room with noiseless step to the spot where he sat and laid her fair hand gently on his shoulder and whispered in her voice of silvery music tell me paullus how can i trust you because i have told you all this truly think you i had humbled myself thus had i not been firm to resist think you i have had no temptation to deceive you to keep back a part to palliate and lo i have told you allthe shameful naked truth how can i ever be so bribed again to falsehood as i have been in this last hour by hope of winning and by dread of losing you my souls idol because i have been true now to the last i think that you may trust me are you sure paullus she said with a soft sad smile yet suffering him to retain the little hand he had imprisoned while he was speakingvery very sure will you believe me julia will you be true hereafter paullus by all nay swear not by the gods she interrupted him they say the gods laugh at the perjury of lovers but oh remember paullus that if you were indeed untrue to julia she could but die he caught her to his heart and she for once resisted not and for the first time permitted his lips were pressed to hers in a long chaste holy kiss and now he said my own own julia i must say fare you well my horse awaits me at your doormy troopers are half the way hence to praeneste nay she replied blushing deeply but you will surely see hortensia ere you go it must be then but for a moment he answered for duty calls me and you must not tempt me to break my newborn resolution but say julia will you tell all these things to hortensia she smiled and laid her hand upon his mouth but he kissed it and drew it down by gentle force and repeated his question will you not a word of it paul do you think me so foolish then i willone day but not now meanwhile let us go seek for her and passing his arm around her slender waist he led her gently from the scene of so many doubts and fears of so much happiness chapter xvi the senate most potent grave and reverend seniors othello the second morning had arrived after that regularly appointed for the consular elections no tumult had occurred nor any overt act to justify the apprehensions of the people yet had those apprehensions in no wise abated the very indistinctness of the rumored terror perhaps increased its weight and so widespread was the vague alarm so prevalent the dread and excitement that in the haggard eyes and pale faces of the frustrated conspirators there was little if anything to call attention for whose features wore their natural expression during those fearful days each moment of which might bring forth massacre and conflagration whose but the great consuls the second morning had arrived and the broad orb of the newly risen sun lurid and larger than his wont as it struggled through the misty haze of the italian autumn had scarcely gained sufficient altitude to throw its beams over the woody crest of the esquiline into the hollow of the sacred way the slant light fell however full on the splendid terraces and shrines of the manytempled palatine playing upon their stately porticoes and tipping their rich capitals with golden lustre and at that early hour the ancient hill was thronged with busy multitudes the crisis was at handthe senate was in solemn session the knights were gathered in their force all armed the younger members of the patrician houses were mustered with their clients the fasces of the lictors displayed the broad heads of the axes glittering above the rods which bound themthe axes never borne in time of peace or within the city walls save upon strange emergency in the old temple of jupiter stator chosen on this occasion for the strength of its position standing on the very brink of the steep declivity of the hill where it overlooked the great roman forum that grand assembly sate in grave deliberation the scene was worthy of the actors as were the actors of the strange tragedy in process it was the cella or great circular space of the inner temple the brazen doors of this huge hall facing the west as was usual in all roman temples were thrown open and without these on the portico yet so placed that they could hear every word that passed within the building sat on their benches five on each side of the door the ten tribunes of the people within the great space surrounded by a double peristyle of tall tuscan columns and roofed by a vast dome richly carved and gilded but with a circular opening at the summit through which a flood of light streamed down on the assembled magnates the senate was in session immediately facing the doors stood the old statue of the god as old it was believed by some as the days of romulus with the high altar at its base hung round with votive wreaths and glittering with ornaments of gold around this altar were grouped the augurs each clad as was usual on occasions of high solemnity in his trabea or robe of horizontal stripes in white and purple each holding in his hand his lituus a crooked staff whereby to designate the temples of the heaven in which to observe the omens on every side of the circumference except that occupied by the altar and the idol were ranged in circular state the benches of the order immediately to the right of the altar were placed the curule chairs rich with carved ivory and crimson cushions of the two consuls and behind them erect with their shouldered axes stood the stout lictors cicero as the first chosen of the consuls sat next the statue of the god calm in his outward mien as the severe and placid features of the marble deity although within him the soul labored mightily big with the fate of rome next him antonius a stout bold sensuallooking soldier filled his placeworthily indeed so far as stature mien and bearing were concerned but with a singular expression in his eye which seemed to indicate embarrassment perhaps apprehension after these the presiding officers of the republic were present each according to his rank the conscript fathersfirst the prince of the senate and then the consulars censorians and praetorians down to those who had filled the lowest office of the state that of quaestor which gave its occupant after his term of occupancy expired admission to the grand representative assembly of the commonwealth for much as there has been written on all sides of this subject there now remains no doubt that from the earliest to the latest age of rome the senate was strictly although an aristocratical still an elective representative assembly the censors themselves elected by the patricians out of their own order in the assembly of the curiae had the appointment of the senators but from those only who had filled one of the magistracies all of which were conferred by the popular vote of the assembly of the centuries and all of which at this period of the republic might be and sometimes were conferred on plebeiansas in the case of marius six times elected consul in spite of patrician opposition such was the constitution of the senate purely elective though like all other portions of the roman constitution under such checks and balances as were deemed sufficient to ensure it from becoming a democratical assembly and such in fact it never did become for having been at first an elective body chosen from an hereditary aristocracy it was at that time save in the varying principles of individuals wholly aristocratic in its nature nor after the tenure of the various magistracies which conferred eligibility to the senate was thrown open to the plebeians did any great change follow since the preponderance of patrician influence in the assembly of the centuries and the force perhaps of old habit combined to continue most of the high offices of state in the hands of members of the old houses again when plebeians were raised to office and became as they were styled new men they speedily were merged in the nobility and were no less aristocratic in their measures than the oldest members of the aristocracy for when have plebeians anywhere when elevated to superior rank been true to their origin been other than the fellest persecutors of plebeians the senate was therefore still as it had been a calm and conservative assembly it was not indeed what it had been before marius first and then sylla the avenger had decimated it of their foes with the sword and filled the vacancies with unworthy friends and partizans yet it was still a grand a wise a noble bodywhen viewed as a bodyand for the most part its decisions were worthy of its dignity and powerwere sage conservative and patriotic on this occasion all motives had conspired to produce a full house doubt anger fear excitement curiosity the love of country the strong sense of right the fiery impulses of interest hate vengeance had urged all men of all parties to be participants in the eventful business of the day about five hundred senators were present men of all ages from thirtytwo years upwardthat being the earliest at which a man could fill this eminent seat but the majority were of those who having passed the prime of active life might be considered to have reached the highest of mental power and capacity removed alike from the greenness of inconsiderate youth and the imbecility of extreme old age the rare beauty of the italian racethe strength and symmetry of the unrivalled warrior nation of which these were for the most part the noblest and most striking specimens the grand flow of the snowwhite draperies faced with the broad crimson laticlavethe classic grace of their positionsthe absence of all rigid angular lines of anything mean or meagre fantastic or tawdry in the garb of the solemn concourse rendered the meeting of romes fathers a widely different spectacle from the convention of any other representative assembly the world has ever witnessed there was no flippancy no affectation no light conversethe members young or old had come thither to perform a great duty in strength of purpose singleness of spiritand all felt deeply the weight of the present moment the vastness of the interests concerned the good and the true were there convened to defend the majesty perhaps the safety of their countrythe wicked to strive for interest for revenge for life itself for catiline well knew and had instilled his knowledge carefully into the minds of his confederates that now to conquer was indeed to triumph that now to be defeated was to fail probably foreverto die it was most like by the dread doom of the tarpeian not one of the conspirators but was in his appointed place firm seemingly unconscious and unruffled and as the eye of the great consul glanced from one to another of that guilty throng he could not even amid his detestation of their crimes but admire the cool hardihood with which they sat unmoved on the brink of destruction could not but think within himself how vast the good that might be wrought by such resolution under a virtuous leader and in an upright cause catiline noticed the glance and as he marked it run along the crowded benches dwelling a moment on the face of each one of his own confederates he saw in an instant that all was discovered and as he saw resolved that since craft had failed to conceal henceforth he would trust audacity alone to carry out his detected villainy but now the augurs had performed their rites the day was pronounced fortunate the assembly formal and nothing more remained but to proceed to the business of the moment a little pause ensued after the sanction of the augurs had been given a short space during which each man drew a deep breath as though he were aware that ere long he should hear words spoken that would thrill his every nerve with excitement and hold him breathless with awe and apprehension there was not a voice not a motion not the rustling of a garment through the large building for every living form was mute as the marble effigies around them with intense expectation every eye of conspirator or patriot was riveted upon the consul the new man of arpinum he rose not unobservant of the general expectation nor ungratified for that great man with all his grand genius solid intellect sound virtue had one small miserable weakness he was not proud but vain vain beyond the feeblest and most craving vanity of womanhood yet now he showed it notperhaps felt it in a less degree than usual it might be it was crushed within him for the time by the magnitude of vast interests the consciousness of right motives the necessity of extraordinary efforts he rose advanced a step or two in front of his curule chair and in a clear slow voice gave utterance to the solemn words which formed the exordium to all senatorial business may this be good and of good omen happy and fortunate to the roman people the quirites which now i lay before you fathers and conscript senators he paused emphatically with the formula and then raising his voice a little and turning his eyes slowly round the house as if in mute appeal to all the senators for that he said on which you must this day determine concerns not the majesty or magnitude of romethe question is not now of insolent foes to be chastised or of faithful friends to be rewardedis not how the city shall be made more beautiful the state more proud and noble the empire more enduring no conscript fathers for the round world has never seen a city so flourishing in all rare beauty so decorated with the virtue of her living citizens so noble in the memories of her dead heroesthe sun has never shone upon a state so solidly established upon an empire so majestical and mighty extending from the herculean columns the far limits of the west beyond the blue symplegades from hyperborean snows to the parched sands of ethiopiano conscript fathers for we have no foes unsubdued from the wild azuretinctured hordes of gaul to the swart eunuchs of the pontic kingfor we have no friends unrewarded unsheltered by the wings of our renown no it is not to beautify to stablish to augmentbut to preserve the empire that i now call upon you that i now urge you by all that is sweet is sacred is sublime in the name of our country that i implore you by whatever earth contains of most awful and heaven of most holy i said to preserve it and do you ask from whom is there a gallic tumult have cimbric myriads again scaled the alps and poured their famished deluge over our devastated frontiers hath mithridates trodden on the neck of pompey by the great gods hath carthage revived from her ashes is hannibal or a greater one than hannibal again thundering at our gates with punic engines visible from the janiculum if it were so i should not despair of romemy heart would not throb as it now does nor my voice tremble with anxiety cisalpine gaul is tranquil as the vale of arno no bow is bended in the teutonic forests unless against the elk or urus the legions have not turned their backs before the scymetars of pontus the salt sown in the marketplace of carthage hath borne no crop but desolation the oneeyed conqueror is nerveless in the silent grave but were all these now peaceful subjugated lifeless were all these i say in arms victorious present upon this soil of italy around these walls of rome i should doubt nothing fear nothing expect nothing but present strife and future victory there isthere is that spark of valor that clear light of roman virtue alive in every heart yea even of our maids and matrons that they would brook no hostile step even upon the threshold of our empire what then do i foresee what fear massacreparricideconflagrationtreason treason in rome itselfin the forumin the campushere here in this holiest and safest spot here in the shrine of that great god who ages since when this vast rome was but a mudbuilt hamlet that golden capitol a strawthatched shed rolled back the tide of war and stablished here here where my foot is fixed the immortal seat of empire even now as i turn my eyes around me they fall abhorrent on the faces they read indignant the designs of their countrys parricides aye conscript fathers praetorians patricians of the great old houses i see them in their places here ready to vote immediately on their own monstrous schemes i see them here adulterers forgers of wills assassins spendthrifts poisoners defilers of vestal virgins contemners of the gods parricides of the republic i see them with daggers sharpened against all true romans lurking beneath their fringed and perfumed tunics misled by strange ambition maddened with lust drunk with despairing guilt athirst for the blood of citizens i see them you all see them will you await in coward apathy until they shake you from your lethargyuntil the outcries of your murdered children of your ravished wives arouse you until you awake from your sleep and find rome in ashes you hear meyou gaze on me in wonder you ask me with your eyes what it is that i mean i who are the traitors lend me your ears then and fix well your minds lest they shrink in disgust and wonder lend me your ears only and i fear not that you will determine worthily of yourselves and of the republic you all well know that on the th day before the calends of november which should have been the eve of the consular elections i promised that i would soon lay before you ample proofs of the plot which then i foretold to you but darkly mark now the faces of the men i shall address and judge whether i then promised vainly whether what i shall now disclose craves your severe attentionyour immediate action he paused for a moment as if to note the effect of his words then turning round abruptly upon the spot where catiline sat writhing with rage and impatience and gnawing his nether lip until the blood trickled down his chin he flung forth his arm with an indignant gesture and instantly addressed him by his name in tones that rang beneath the vaulted roof over the heads of the selfconvicted traitors like heavens own thunder and found a fearful echo in their dismayed and guilty souls where wert thou catiline he thundered forth the charge amid the mute astonishment of allwhere wert thou on the evening of the ides what wert thou doing speak unless guilt and despair hold thee silent i say to thee speak catiline again he stopped in midspeech as if for an answer fixed his eye steadily on the face of the arch conspirator but he though he spoke not to reply quailed not nor shunned that steady gaze but met it with a terrible and portentous glare pregnant with more than mortal hatred thou wilt notcanst notdarest not now hear and tremble hear and know that no step of thine or deed or motion escapes my eyeno traitor not one movement on the eve of the ides thou wert in the street of the scythemakers ha does thy cheek burn now in the house of a senatorof marcus porcius laeca but thou wert not there till thou hadst added one more deed of murder to those which needed no addition thou wert i say in the house of laeca and many whom i now see around me with trim and wellcurled beards with longsleeved tunics and airwoven togas many whom i could name and will if needs be were there with thee what beverage didst thou send around what oath didst thou administer thou to thy foul associates and on the altar of what god fathers my mind shrinks as i speak with horrorthat bowl mantled to the brim with the gore of a human victim those lips reeked with that dread abomination his lips and those of others fitter to sip voluptuous nectar from the soft mouths of their noble paramours than to quaff such pollution that oath was to destroy rome utterly with fire and the sword till not one stone should stand upon another to mark the site of empire the silver eagle was the god to whom he swore the silver eagle whose wings were dyed so deep in massacre by mariusto whom he had a shrine in his own house consecrated by what crimes adored by what sacrilege i say not the consular election was the day fixed and had the people met on that day in the campus on that day had rome ceased to be to murder me in my robes of peace at the comitia to murder the consuls elect to murder the patricians to a man was his own task most congenial to his own savage nature to fire the city in twelve several places was destined to his worthy comrades whose terror my eye now beholds whose names for the present my tongue shall not disclose for i would give them time to repent to change their frantic purpose to cast away their sinoh that they would do so oh that they would have compassion on their prostrate and imploring countrycompassion on themselveson me who beseech them to turn back ere it be too late to the ways of virtue happiness and honor but names there are which i will speak out for to conceal them would avail nothing since they have drawn the sword already and raised the banner of rebellion against the majesty of rome septimius of camerinum has stirred the slaves even now to a fresh servile war has given out arms has appointed leaders by the gods has a force on foot in the picene district julius is soliciting the evil spirits of apulia and ere four days have flown you shall have tidings from the north that caius manlius is in arms at faesulae already he commands more than two legions not of raw levies not of emancipated slaves or enfranchised gladiatorsthough these ere long will swell his host no syllas veterans muster under his bannerthe same swords gleam around him which conquered the famed macedonian phalanx at bloody chaeronea which stormed the long walls of piraeus which won bithynia cappadocia paphlagonia which drove great mithridates back to his own pontus nor is this allfor if frustrated by the postponement of the consular comitia believe not that the rage of the parricide is averted or his thirst for the blood of romans quenched forever no fathers he hath but deferred the day and even now he hath determined on another the fifth before the calends await that day in quiet and ye will never rue your apathy for none of you shall live to rue it save those who now smile grimly conscious of their own desperate resolve expectant of your apathy nor is his villainy all told even now for so securely and so wisely has he laid his plans that had not the great gods interfered and granted it to me to discover all he must needs have succeeded on the night of the calends themselves he would have been the master of praeneste that rich and inaccessible stronghold by a nocturnal escalade that i myself have already made impossiblethe magistrates are warned the free burghers armed and the castle garrisoned by true men and impregnable do ye the like fathers and conscript senators and rome also shall be safe inaccessible immortal give me the powers to save you and i devote my mind my life i am here ready to die at this instantfar worse than death to a noble mind ready to go hence and be forgotten if i may rescue rome from this unequalled peril again he ceased speaking for a moment and many thought that he had concluded his oration but in a seconds space he resumed in a tone more spirited and fiery yet his eyes almost flashing lightning and his whole frame appearing to expand as he confronted the undaunted traitor dost thou not now see catiline that in all things thou art my inferior dost thou not feel thyself caught detected like a thief baffled defeated beaten and wilt thou not now lay down thine arms thy rage thy hate against this innocent republic wilt thou not liberate me now from great fear great peril and great odium no thou wilt notthe time hath flown thou canst not repentcanst not forgive or be forgiventhe gods have maddened thee to thy destructionthy crimes are fullblown and ripening fast for harvestearth is aweary of thy guilthades yawns to receive thee tremble then tremble yea in the depths of thy secret soulfor all thine eye glares more with hate than terror and thy lip quivers not with remorse but rageyea thou dost tremblefor thou dost see feel know thy schemes thy confederates thyself detected frustrated devoted to destruction enough it is for you my fathers to determine for me to act your pleasure and if your own souls your own lives your own interests yea your own fears cry not aloud to rouse you with a voice stronger than the eternal thunder why should i seek to warn you whom his own his wifes childrens countrys safety the glory of his great forefathers the veneration of the everlasting gods awaiting his decision from the tottering pinnacle of romes capitolwhom all these things excite not to actionno voice of man no portent of the gods themselves can stir to energy or valor and i but waste my words in exhorting you to manhood but they will burst the bonds of your long stupor they will rekindle in your hearts that blaze of roman virtue which may sleep for a while but never can be all extinguishedand ye will stir yourselves like men ye will save your country for this thing i do not believe that the immortal gods would have built up this commonwealth of rome to such a height of beauty of glory of puissance had they foredoomed it to destruction by hands so base as those now armed against it nor had it been their pleasure to abolish its great name and make it such as troy and carthage would they have placed me here the consul endowed by themselves with power to discern but with no power to avert destruction his words had done their work the dismayed blank faces of all the conspirators with the exception of the arch traitor only whom it would seem that nothing could disconcert or dismay confirmed the impression made upon all minds by that strong appeal for though he had mentioned no mans name save catilines and laecas only suspicion was called instantly to those who were their known associates in riot and debauchery and many eyes were scrutinizing the pale features which struggled vainly to appear calm and unconcerned the effect of the speech was immediate universal there were not three men of the order present who were not now convinced as fully in their own minds of the truth of ciceros accusation as they would had it come forth in thunder from the cold lips of the marble god who overlooked their proud assembly there was a long drawn breath as he ceased speakingone and simultaneous through the whole concourse and though there were a few men there crassus especially and caius julius caesar who though convinced of the existence of conspiracy would fain have defended the conspirators in the existing state of feeling they dared not attempt to do so then cicero called by name on the prince of the senate enquiring if he would speak on the subject before the house and on receiving from him a grave negative gesture he put the same question to the eldest of the consulars and thence in order none offering any opinion or showing any wish to debate until he came to marcus cato he rose at once to speak stern and composed without the least sign of animation on his impassive face without the least attempt at eloquence in his words or grace in his gestures yet it was evident that he was heard with a degree of attention which proved that the character of the man more than compensated the unvarnished style and rough phraseology of the speaker as it appears to me he said fathers and conscript senators after the very luminous and able oration which our wise consul has this day held forth it would be great folly and great loss of time to add many words to it this i am not about to do i assure you but i arise in my place to say two things cicero has told you that a conspiracy exists and that catiline is the planner and will be the executor of it this though i know not by what sagacity or foresight unless from the gods he discovered itthis i say i believe confidently clearlyall things declare itnot least the faces of men i believe therefore every word our consul has spoken so do you all my friends nevertheless it is just and right that the man villain as he may be shall be heard in his own behalf let him then speak at once or confess by his silence this is the first thing i would saythe next follows it if he admit or fail clearly to disprove his guilt let us not be wanting to ourselves to our country or to the great and prudent consul who if man can will save us in this crisis let us i say decree forthwith that the consuls see the republic takes no harm and let us hold the consular election tomorrow on the field of marsthere with our magistrates empowered to act our clients in arms to defend us let us see who will dare to disturb the roman people let who would do so remember that not all the power or favor of great marius could rescue saturninus from the death he owed the peopleremember that we have a consul no less resolute and vigorous than he is wise and goodthat there are axes in the fasces of the lictorsthat there stands the tarpeian and as he spoke he flung wide both his arms pointing with this hand to the row of glittering blades which shone above the head of the chief magistrate with that through the open doorway of the temple to the bold front of the precipitous and fatal rock all lighted up by the gay sunbeams as it stood fronting them beyond the hollow velabrum crowned with the ramparts of the capitol a general hum as if of assent followed and without putting the motion to the vote cicero turned his eye rapidly to every face and receiving from every senator a slight nod of assent he looked steadily in the fierce and ghastly face of the traitor and said to him arise catiline and speak if you willbut take my counsel confess your guilt go hence and be forgiven forgiven cried the traitor furious and desperateforgiventhis to a roman citizenthis to a roman noble hear me fathers and conscript senatorshear mewho am a soldier and a man and neither driveller nor dotard i tell you there is no conspiracy hath been none shall be nonesave in the addled brains of yon prater from arpinum who would fain set his foot upon the neck of romans all is all shall be peace in rome unless the terror of a few dastards drive you to tyranny and persecution and from persecution come resistance for myself let them who would ruin me beware my hand has never yet failed to protect my head nor have many foes laughed in the end at sergius catilineunless he added with a ferocious sneerthey laughed in their deathpang for my wrongs past i have had some vengeance for these though i behold the axes though i see whence i stand the steep tarpeian i think i shall have more and live to feast my eyes with the downfall of my foes fathers there are two bodies in the state one weak with a base but crafty headthe other powerful and vast but headless urge me a little farther and you shall find that a wise and daring head will not be wanting long to that bold and puissant body urge me and i will be that head oppress me and but insolence such as this was not tolerable there was an universal burst almost a shout of indignation from that assembly the wonted mood of which was so stern so cold so gravely dignified and silent many among the younger senators sprang to their feet enraged almost beyond the control of reason nor did the bold defiance of the daring traitor who stood with his arms folded on his breast and a malignant sneer of contempt on his lip mocking their impotent displeasure tend to disarm their wrath four times he raised his voice four times a cry of indignation drowned his words and at length seeing that he could obtain no farther hearing he resumed his seat with an expression fiendishly malignant and a fierce imprecation on rome and all that it contained after a little time the confusion created by the audacity of that strange being moderated order and silence were restored and upon catos motion the senate was divided whatever might have been the result had catiline been silent the majority was overwhelming the very partisans and favorers of the conspiracy not daring to commit themselves more openly against so strong a manifestation passed over one by one and voted with the consul catiline stood alone against the vote of the whole order yet stood and voted resolute as though he had been conscious of the right the vote was registered the senate declared martial law investing the consuls with dictatorial power by the decree which commanded them to see that the republic takes no harm the very tribunes factious and reckless as they were potent for ill and powerless for good presumed not to interpose not even lucius bestia deep as he was in the designbestia whose accusation of the consul from the rostrum was the concerted signal for the massacre the conflagrationnot bestia himself relied so far on the inviolability of his person as to intrude his veto the good cause had prevailedthe good consul triumphed the senate was dismissed and as the stream of patrician togas flowed through the temple door conspicuous the rash and reckless traitor shouldered the mass to and fro dividing it as a brave galley under sail divides the murmuring but unresisting billows once in the throng he touched julius caesars robe as he brushed onward and as he did so a word fell on his ear in the low harmonious tones which marked the orator second to none in rome save cicero alone fear not it saidanother day will come fear exclaimed the conspirator in a hoarse cry half fury half contempt what is feari know not the thing nor the wordgo prate of fear to cicero and he will understand you these words perhaps alienated one who might have served him well but so it ever is even in the shrewdest and most worldly wise of men passion will often outweigh interest and plans which have been framed for years with craft and patience are often wrecked by the
