the online distributed proofreading team at httpswwwpgdpnet an englishwomans loveletters new york the mershon company publishers an englishwomans loveletters explanation it need hardly be said that the woman by whom these letter were written had no thought that they would be read by anyone but the person to whom they were addressed but a request conveyed under circumstances which the writer herself would have regarded as allcommanding urges that they should now be given to the world and so far as is possible with a due regard to the claims of privacy what is here printed presents the letters as they were first written in their complete form and sequence very little has been omitted which in any way bears upon the devotion of which they are a record a few names of persons and localities have been changed and several short notes not above twenty in all together with some passages bearing too intimately upon events which might be recognized have been left out without indication of their omission it was a necessary condition to the present publication that the authorship of these letters should remain unstated those who know will keep silence those who do not will not find here any data likely to guide them to the truth the story which darkens these pages cannot be more fully indicated while the feelings of some who are still living have to be consulted nor will the reader find the root of the tragedy explained in the letters themselves but one thing at least may be said as regards the principal actorsthat to the memory of neither of them does any blame belong they were equally the victims of circumstances which came whole out of the hands of fate and remained so far as one of the two was concerned a mystery to the day of her death letter i beloved this is your first letter from me yet it is not the first i have written to you there are letters to you lying at loves deadletter office in this same writingso many my memory has lost count of them this is my confession i told you i had one to make and you laughedyou did not know how serious it wasfor to be in love with you long before you were in love with menothing can be more serious than that you deny that i was yet i know when you first really loved me all at once one day something about me came upon you as a surprise and how except on the road to love can there be surprises and in the surprise came love you did not know me before before then it was only the other nine entanglements which take hold of the male heart and occupy it till the tenth is ready to make one knot of them all in the letter written that day i said you love me i could never have said it before though i had written twelve letters to my love for you i had not once been able to write of your love for me was not that serious now i have confessed i thought to discover myself all blushes but my face is cool you have kissed all my blushes away can i ever be ashamed in your eyes now or grow rosy because of anything you or i think soyou have robbed me of one of my charms i am brazen can you love me still you love me you love me you are wonderful we are both wonderful you and i well it is good for you to know i have waited and wished long before the thing came true but to see you waiting and wishing when the thing was true all the timeoh that was the trial how not suddenly to throw my arms round you and cry look see o blind mouth why are you famished and you never knew dearest i love you for it you never knew i believe a man when he finds he has won thinks he has taken the city by assault he does not guess how to the insiders it has been a weary siege with flags of surrender fluttering themselves to rags from every wall and window no in love it is the women who are the strategists and they have at last to fall into the ambush they know of with a good grace you must let me praise myself a little for the past since i can never praise myself again you must do that for me now there is not a battle left for me to win you and peace hold me so much a prisoner have so caught me from my own way of living that i seem to hear a pin drop twenty years ahead of me it seems an event dearest a thousand times i would not have it be otherwise i am only too willing to drop out of existence altogether and find myself in your arms instead giving you my love i can so easily give you my life ah my dear i am yours so utterly so gladly will you ever find it out you who took so long to discover anything letter ii dearest your name woke me this morning i found my lips piping their song before i was well back into my body out of dreams i wonder if the rogues babble when my spirit is nesting last night you were a high tree and i was in it the wind blowing us both but i forget the restwhatever it was enough to make me wake happy there are dreams that go out like candlelight directly one opens the shutters they illumine the walls no longer the daylight is too strong for them so now i can hardly remember anything of my dreams daylight with you in it floods them out oh how are you awake up have you breakfasted i ask you a thousand things you are thinking of me i know but what are you thinking i am devoured by curiosity about myselfnone at all about you whom i have all by heart if i might only know how happy i make you and just which thing i said yesterday is making you laugh todayi could cry with joy over being the person i am it is you who make me think so much about myself trying to find myself out i used to be most selfpossessed and regarded it as the crowning virtue and nowyour possession of me sweeps it away and i stand crying to be let into a secret that is no longer mine shall i ever know why you love me it is my religious difficulty but it never rises into a doubt you do love me i know why i dont think i ever can know you ask me the same question about yourself and it becomes absurd because i altogether belong to you if i hold my breath for a moment wickedly for i cant do it breathing and try to look at the world with you out of it i seem to have fallen over a precipice or rather the solid earth has slipped from under my feet and i am off into vacuum then as i take breath again for fear my star swims up and clasps me and shows me your face o happy star this that i was born under that moved with me and winked quiet prophecies at me all through my childhood i not knowing what it meantthe dear radiant thing naming to me my lover as a child now and then and for no reason i used to be sublimely happy real wings took hold of me sometimes a field became fairyland as i walked through it or a tree poured out a scent that its blossoms never had before or after i think now that those must have been moments when you too were in like contact with earthhad your feet in grass which felt a faint ripple of wind or stood under a lilac in a drench of fragrance that had grown double after rain when i asked you about the places of your youth i had some fear of finding that we might once have met and that i had not remembered it as the summing up of my happiness in being young far off i see something undiscovered waiting us something i could not have guessed at beforethe happiness of being old will it not be something like the evening before last when we were sitting together your hand in mine and one by one as the twilight drew about us the stars came and took up their stations overhead they seemed to me then to be following out some quiet train of thought in the universal mind the heavens were remembering the stars back into their placesthe ancient of days drawing upon the infinite treasures of memory in his great lifetime will not loves old age be the same to us botha starry place of memories your dear letter is with me while i write how shortly you are able to say everything tomorrow you will come what more do i wantexcept tomorrow itself with more promises of the same thing you are at my heart dearest nothing in the world can be nearer to me than you letter iii dearest and rightly beloved you cannot tell how your gift has pleased me or rather you can for it shows you have a long memory back to our first meeting though at the time i was the one who thought most of it it is quite true you have the most beautifully shaped memory in christendom these are the very books in the very edition i have long wanted and have been too humble to afford myself and now i cannot stop to read one for joy of looking at them all in a row i will kiss you for them all and for more besides indeed it is the besides which brings you my kisses at all now that you have chosen so perfectly to my mind i may proffer a request which before i was shy of making it seems now beneficently anticipated it is that you will not ever let your gifts take the form of jewelry not after the ring which you are bringing me that you know i both welcome and wish for but as to the rest the world has supplied me with a feeling against jewelry as a lovesymbol look abroad and you will see it is too possessive too much like chains of officethe fair one is to wear her radiant harness before the world that other women may be envious and the desire of her masters eye be satisfied ah no i am yours dear utterly and nothing you give me would have that sense i know you too well to think it but in the face of the present fashion and to flout it which expects the lover to give in this sort and the beloved to show herself a dazzling captive let me cherish my ritual of opposition which would have no meaning if we were in a world of our own and no place in my thoughts dearestas it has not now so far as you are concerned but i am conscious i shall be looked at as your chosen and i would choose my own way of how to look back most proudly and so for the books more thanks and morethat they are what i would most wish and not anything else which had they been they would still have given me pleasure since from you they could come only with a good meaning anddiamonds eveni could have put up with them tomorrow you come for your ring and bring me my own yours is here waiting i have it on my finger very loose with another standing sentry over it to keep it from running away a mouse came out of my wainscot last night and plunged me in horrible dilemma for i am equally idiotic over the idea of the creature trapped or free and i saw sleepless nights ahead of me till i had secured a change of locality for him to startle him back into hiding would have only deferred my getting truly rid of him so i was most tiptoe and diplomatic in my doings finally a paper bag put into a likely nook with some sentimentally preserved weddingcake crumbled into it crackled to me of his arrival in a brave moment i noosed the little beast bag and all and lowered him from the window by string till the shrubs took from me the burden of responsibility i visited the bag this morning he had eaten his way out crumbs and all and has i suppose become a fieldmouse for the hay smells invitingly and it is only a short run over the lawn and a jump over the haha to be in it poor morsels i prefer them so much undomesticated now this mouse is no allegory and the paper bag is not a diamond necklace in spite of the weddingcake sprinkled over it so dont say that this letter is too hard for your understanding or you will frighten me from telling you anything foolish again brains are like jewels in this difference of surface has nothing to do with the size and value of them yours is a beautiful smooth round like a pearl and mine all facets and flashes like cut glass and yours so much the bigger and i love it so much the best the trap which caught me was baited with one great pearl so the mouse comes in with a meaning tied to its tail after all letter iv in all the world dearest what is more unequal than love between a man and a woman i have been spending an amorous morning and want to share it with you but lo the task of bringing that bit of my life into your vision is altogether beyond me what have i been doing dear man i have been dressmaking and dress when one is in the toils is but a loveletter writ large you will see and admire the finished thing but you will take no interest in the composition therefore i say your love is unequal to mine for think how ravished i would be if you brought me a coat and told me it was all your own making one day you had thrown down a mere tailormade thing in the hall and yet i kissed it as i went by and that was at a time when we were only at the handshaking stage the palsied beginnings of loveyou i mean but oh to get you interested in the dress i was making to you todaythe beautiful flowing openingnot too flowing the elaborate central composition where the heart of me has to come and the windup of the skirt a long reluctant tailingoff full of commas and colons of ribbon to make it seem longer and insertions everywhere i dreamed myself in it retiring through the door after having bidden you goodnight and you watching the long disappearing eloquence of that tail still saying to you as it vanished goodby goodby i love you so see me how slowly i am going well that is a bit of my dressmaking a very corporate part of my affection for you and you are not a bit interested for i have shown you none of the seamy side it is that which interests you male creatures zolaites every one of you and what have you to show similar of the thought of me entering into all your masculine pursuits do you go out rabbitshooting for the love of me if so i trust you make a miss of it every time that you are a sportsman is one of the very hardest things in life that i have to bear last night peterkins came up with me to keep guard against any further intrusion of mice i put her to sleep on the couch but she discarded the red shawl i had prepared for her at the bottom and lay at the top most uncomfortably in a parcel of millinery into which from one end i had already made excavations so that it formed a large bag into the further end of this bag turks crept and snuggled down but every time she turned in the night and it seemed very often the brown paper crackled and woke me up so at last i took it up and shook out its contents and pippins slept soundly on red flannel till nannan brought the tea you will notice that in this small narrative peterkins gets three names it is a fashion that runs through the household beginning with the motheraunt who on some days speaks of nannan as the old lady and sometimes as that girl all according to the two tempers she has about nannans privileged position in regard to me you were only here yesterday and already i want you again so much so much your never satisfied but always loving letter v most beloved i have been thinking staring at this blank piece of paper and wondering how there am i ever to say what i have in me herenot wishing to say anything at all but just to be i feel that i am living now only because you love me and that my life will have run out like this penful of ink when that use in me is past not yet beloved oh not yet nothing is finished that we have to do and behardly begun i will not call even this midsummer however much it seems so it is still only spring every day your love binds me more deeply than i knew the day before so that no day is the same now but each one a little happier than the last my own you are my very own and yet true as that is it is not so true as that i am your own it is less absolute i mean and must be so because i cannot very well take possession of anything when i am given over heart and soul out of my own possession there isnt enough identity left in me i am yours so much so much all this is useless to say yet what can i say else if i have to begin saying anything could i truly be your star and goddess as you call me beloved i would do you the service of thetis at least who did it for a greater than herself bid heaven and earth combine their charms and round you early round you late briareus fold his hundred arms to guard you from your single fate but i havent got power over an eightarmed octopus even so am merely a very helpless loving nonentity which merges itself most happily in you and begs to be lifted to no pedestal at all at all if you love me in a manner that is at all possible you will see that goddess does not suit me star i would i were now with a wide eye to carry my looks to you over this horizon which keeps you invisible choose one if you will dearest and call it mine and to me it shall be yours so that when we are apart and the stars come out our eyes may meet up at the same point in the heavens and be keeping company for us among the celestial bodieswith their permission for i have too lively a sense of their beauty not to be a little superstitious about them have you not felt for yourself a sort of physiognomy in the constellationsmost of them seeming benevolent and full of kind regardsbut not all i am always glad when the great bear goes away from my window fine beast though he is he seems to growl at me no doubt it is largely a question of names and whats in a name in yours beloved when i speak it more than i can compass letter vi beloved i have been trusting to fate while keeping silence that something from you was to come today and make me specially happy and it has bless you abundantly you have undone and got round all i said about jewelry though this is nothing of the sort but a shrine so my word remains i have it with me now safe hidden only now and then it comes out to have a look at mesmiles and goes back again dearest you must feel how i thank you for i cannot say it body and soul i grow too much blessed with all that you have given me both visibly and invisibly and always perfectly and as for the day i have been thinking you the most uncurious of men because you had not asked and supposed it was too early days yet for you to remember that i had ever been born today is my birthday you said nothing so i said nothing and yet this has come i trusted my star to show its sweet influences in its own way or after all did you know and had you asked anyone but me yet had you known you would have wished me the happy returns which among all your dear words to me you do not so i take it that the motion comes straight to you from heaven and in the event you will pardon me for having been still secretive and shy in not telling what you did not inquire after yours i knew dear quite long ago so had no need to ask you for it and it is six months before you will be in the same year with me again and give to twentytwo all the companionable sweetness that twentyone has been having many happy returns of my birthday to you dearest that is all that my birthdays are for have you been happy today i wonder and am wondering also whether this evening we shall see you walking quietly in and making everything into perfection that has been trembling just on the verge of it all day long one drawback of my feast is that i have to write short to you for there are other correspondents who on this occasion look for quick answers and not all of them to be answered in an offhand way except you it is the coziest whom i keep waiting but elders have a way with themeven kind ones and when they condescend to write upon an anniversary we have to skip to attention or be in their bad books at once so with the sun still a long way out of bed i have to tuck up these sheets for you as if the good of the day had already been sufficient unto itself and its full tale had been told goodnight it is so hard to take my hands off writing to you and worry on at the same exercise in another direction i kiss you more times than i can count it is almost really you that i kiss now my very dearest my own sweetheart whom i so worship goodnight goodafternoon sounds too funny is outside our vocabulary altogether while i live i must love you more than i know letter vii my friend do you think this a cold way of beginning i do not is it not the true sendoff of love i do not know how men fall in love but i could not have had that comedown in your direction without being your friend first oh my dear and after after it is but a limitless friendship i have grown into i have heard men run down the friendships of women as having little true substance those who speak so i think have never come across a real case of womans friendship i praise my own sex dearest for i know some of their loneliness which you do not and until a certain date their friendship was the deepest thing in life i had met with for must it not be true that a woman becomes more absorbed in friendship than a man since friendship may have to mean so much more to her and cover so far more of her life than it does to the average man however big a mans capacity for friendship the beauty of it does not fill his whole horizon for the future he still looks ahead of it for the mate who will complete his life giving his body and soul the complement they require friendship alone does not satisfy him he makes a bigger claim on life regarding certain possessions as his right but a womanoh it is a fashion to say the best women are sure to find husbands and have if they care for it the certainty before them of a full life i know it is not so there are women wonderful ones who come to know quite early in life that no men will ever wish to make wives of them for them then love in friendship is all that remains and the strongest wish of all that can pass through their souls with hope for its fulfillment is to be a friend to somebody it is mans arrogant certainty of his future which makes him impatient of the word friendship it cools life to his lips he so confident that the headier nectar is his due i came upon a little phrase the other day that touched me so deeply it said so well what i have wanted to say since we have known each other some peasant rhymer an irishman is singing his loves praises and sinks his voice from the height of his passionate superlatives to call her his share of the world peasant and irishman he knew that his fortune did not embrace the universe but for him his love was just thathis share of the world surely when in anyones friendship we seem to have gained our share of the world that is all that can be said it means all that we can take in the whole armful the heart and senses are capable of or that fate can bestow and for how many that must be friendshipespecially for how many women my dear you are my share of the world also my share of heaven but there i begin to speak of what i do not know as is the way with happy humanity all that my eyes could dream of waking or sleeping all that my ears could be most glad to hear all that my heart could beat faster to get hold ofyour friendship gave me suddenly as a bolt from the blue my friend my friend my friend if you could change or go out of my life now the sun would drop out of my heavens i should see the world with a great piece gashed out of its sidemy share of it gone no i should not see it i dont think i should see anything ever againnot truly is it not strange how often to test our happiness we harp on sorrow i do dont let it weary you i know i have read somewhere that great love always entails pain i have not found it yet but for me it does mean fearthe sort of fear i had as a child going into big buildings i loved them but i feared because of their bigness they were likely to tumble on me but when i begin to think you may be too big for me i remember you as my friend and the fear goes for a time or becomes that sort of fear i would not part with if i might i have no news for you only the old things to tell you the wonder of which ever remains new how holy your face has become to me as i saw it last with something more than the usual proofs of love for me upon ita look as if your love troubled you i know the trouble i feel it dearest in my own womans way have patiencewhen i see you so i feel that prayer is the only way given me for saying what my love for you wishes to be and yet i hardly ever pray in words dearest be happy when you get this and when you can come and give my happiness its rest till then it is a watchman on the lookout nightnight your true sleepy one letter viii now why i want to know beloved was i so specially good to you in my last i have been quite as good to you fifty times beforeif such a thing can be from me to you or do you mean good for you then dear i must be sorry that the thing stands out so much as an exception oh dearest beloved for a little i think i must not love you so much or must not let you see it when does your mother return and when am i to see her i long to so much has she still not written to you about our news i woke last night to the sound of a great flock of sheep going past i suppose they were going by forced marches to the fair over at hylesbury it was in the small hours and a few of them lifted up their voices and complained of this robbery of night and sleep in the night they were so tired so tired they said and so did the muffawully patter of their poor feet the lambs said most and the sheep agreed with a husky croak i said a prayer for them and went to sleep again as the sound of the lambs died away but somehow they stick in my heart those sad sheep driven along through the night it was in its degree like the woman hurrying along who said my god my god that summer sunday morning these notes from lives that appear and disappear remain endlessly and i do not think our hearts can have been made so sensitive to suffering we can do nothing to relieve without some good reason so i tell you this as i would any sorrow of my own because it has become a part of me and is underlying all that i think today i am to expect you the day after tomorrow but not for certain thus you give and you take away equally blessed in either case all the same i shall certainly expect you and be disappointed if on thursday at about this hour your way be not my way how shall i my true love know if he does not come often enough to see me sunshine be on you all possible hours till we meet again letter ix beloved is the morning looking at you as it is looking at me a little to the right of the sun there lies a small cloud filmy and faint but enough to cast a shadow somewhere from this window high up over the view i cannot see where the shadow of it fallsfurther than my eye can reach perhaps just now over you since you lie further west but i cannot be sure we cannot be sure about the near things in this world only about what is far off and fixed you and i looking up see the same sun if there are no clouds over us but we may not be looking at the same clouds even when both our hearts are in shadow that is so even when hearts are as close together as yours and mine they respond to the same light but each one has its own roof of shadow wearing its rue with a world of difference why is it why can no two of us have sorrows quite in common what can be nearer together than our wills to be one in joy we are and yet though i reach and reach and sadden if you are sad i cannot make your sorrow my own i suppose sorrow is of the earth earthy and all that is of earth makes division every joy that belongs to the body casts shadows somewhere i wonder if there can enter into us a joy that has no shadow anywhere the joy of having you has behind it the shadow of parting is there any way of loving that would make parting no sorrow at all to me now the idea seems treason i cling to my sorrow that you are not here i send up my cloud as it were to catch the suns brightness it is a kite that i pull with my heartstrings to the sun of love the clouds that cover absence must look like white flowers in the green fields of earth or like doves hovering and he reaches down and strokes them with his warm beams making all their feathers like gold some clouds let the gold come through mine nowthat cloud i saw away to the right is coming this way toward me i can see the shadow of it now moving along a faroff strip of road and i wonder if it is your cloud with you under it coming to see me again when you come why am i any happier than when i know you are coming it is the same thing in love i have you now all in my minds eye i have you by heart have i my arms a bit more round you then than now how it puzzles me that when love is perfect there should be disappearances and reappearances and faces now and then showing a changeyou actually the last time you came looking a day older than the day before what was it had old age blown you a kiss or given you a wrinkle in the art of dying or had you turned over some new leaf and found it withered on the other side i could not see how it was i heard you comingit was spring the door openedoh it was autumnal one day had fallen away like a leaf out of my forest and i had not been there to see it go at what hour of the twentyfour does a day shed itself out of our lives not i think on the stroke of the clock at midnight or at cockcrow some people perhaps would saywith the first sleep and that the beautysleep is the new day putting out its green wings i think it must be not till something happens to make the new day a stronger impression than the last so it would please me to think that your yesterday dropped off as you opened the door and that had i peeped and seen you coming up the stairs i should have seen you looking a day younger that means that you age at the sight of me i think you do i i feel a hundred on the road to immortality directly your face dawns on me theres a foot gone over my grave the angel of the resurrection with his mouth pursed fast to his trumpetnothing else than the gallopagallop of your horseit sounds like a kettle boiling over so this goes into hiding listens to us all the while we talk and comes out afterwards with all its blushes stale to be rouged up again and sent off the moment your back is turned no betterto be slipped into your pocket and carried home to yourself by yourself how when you get to your destination and find it you will curse yourself that you were not a speedier postman letter x dearest did you find your letter the quicker i post the quicker i need to sit down and write again the grass under loves feet never stops growing i must make hay of it while the sun shines you say my metaphors make you giddymy clear you without a metaphor in your composition do that to me so it is not for you to complain your curses simply fly back to roost where do you pigeonhole them in a pie i mean to write now until i have made you as giddy as a dancing dervish your letters are much more like blackbirds and i have a pie of them here twentyfour at least and when i open it they sing chewee chewee chewee in the most scared way your last but three said most solemnly just as if you meant it i hope you dont keep these miserables though i fill up my hollow hours with them there is no reason why they should fill up yours you added that i was better occupiedand here i am better occupied even as you bid me but one can jump best from a springboard and how could i jump as far as your arms by letter if i had not yours to jump from so you see they are kept and my disobedience of you has begun and i find disobedience wonderfully sweet but then you gave me a law which you knew i should disobeythat is the way the world began it is not for nothing that i am a daughter of eve and here is our world in our hands yours and mine now in the making which day are the evening and the morning now i think it must be the birdsand already with the wings disobedience has been reached make much of it the day will come when i shall wish to obey there are moments when i feel a wish taking hold of me stronger than i can understand that you should command me beyond myselfto things i have not strength or courage for of my own accord how close dearest when that day comes my heart will feel itself to yours it feels close now but it is to your feet i am nearest as yet lift me there there beloved i kiss you with all my will oh dear heart forgive me for being no more than i am your freehold to all eternity letter xi oh dearest i have danced and i have danced till i am tired i am dropping with sleep but i must just touch you and say goodnight this was our great day of publishing dearest ours all the world knows it and all admire your choice i was determined they should i have been collecting scalps for you to hang at your girdle all thought me beautiful people who never did so before i wanted to say to them am i not beautiful i am am i not and it was not for myself i was asking this praise beloved i was wearing the magic rosewhat you gave me when we parted you saying alas that you were not to be there but you were its leaves have not dropped nor the scent of it faded i kiss you out of the heart of it goodnight come to me in my first dream letter xii dearest it has been such a funny day from posttime onwards congratulations on the great event are beginning to arrive in envelopes and on wheels some are very kind and dear and some are not soonly the ordinary seemliness of polite snifflesnaffle just after you had gone yesterday mrs called and was told the news of course she knew of you but didnt think she had ever seen you probably he passed you at the gates i said what she went off with a viewhallo that welldressed sort of young fellow in gray and a mustache and knowing how to ride met us in the lane well my dear i do congratulate you and whether it was by the gray suit or the mustache or the knowing how to ride that her congratulations were so emphatically secured i know not others are yet more quaint and more to my liking nannan is nannan i cannot let you off what she said no tears or sentiment came from her to prevent me laughing she brisked like an old warhorse at the first word of it and blessed god that it had come betimes that she might be a nurse again in her old age she is a true mrs berry and is ready to make room for you in my affections for the sake of faroff divine events which promise renewed youth to her old bones roberts when he brought me my pony this morning touched his hat quick twice over to show that the news brimmed in his body and a very nice cordial way of showing i thought it he was quite ready to talk when i let him go and he gave me plenty of good fun he used to know you when he was in service at the hs and speaks of you as being then a gallous young hound whatever that may mean i imagine gallous to be a rustic lewis carroll compound made up in equal parts of callousness and gallantry which most boys are at some stage of their existence what tales will you be getting of me out of nannan some day behind my back i wonder there is one i shall forbid her to reveal it shall be part of my marriageportion to show you early that you have got a wife with a temper here is a whole letter that must end nowand the great word never mentioned it is good for you to be put upon maigre fare for once i hold my pen back with both hands it wants so much to give you the forbidden treat oh the serpent in the garden see where it has underlined its meaning frailty thy pen is a j pen adieu adieu remember me letter xiii the letters no beloved i could not not yet there you have caught me where i own i am still shy of you a long time hence when we are a safely wedded pair you shall turn them over it may be a short time but i will keep them however long indeed i must ever keep them they talk to me of the dawn of my existencethe early light before our sun rose when my love of you was growing and had not yet reached its full if i disappoint you i will try to make up for it with something i wrote long before i ever saw you today i was turning over old things my mother had treasured for me of my childhoodof days spent with her things of laughter as well as of tears such a dear selection so quaint and sweet with moods of her as i dimly remember her to have been and among them was this absurdity written and i suppose placed in the mouth of my stocking the christmas i stayed with her in france i remember the time as a great treat but nothing of this nilgoes is nicholas you must understand how he must have laughed over me asleep while he read this cher pere nilgoes sil vous plait voulez vous me donne plus de jeux que des oranges des pommes et des pombons parc que nous allons faire larbre de noel cette anne et les jeaux ferait mieux pour larbre de noel il ne faut pas dire a petite mere sil vous plait parce que je ne veut pas quelle sache sil vous voulez venir ce soir du ceil pour que vous pouvez me donner ce que je vous demande dites bon jour a la st viearge est a lenfant jeuses et a ste joseph adieu cher st nilgoes i havent altered the spelling i love it too well prophetic of a fault i still carry about me how strange that little bit of invocation to the dear folk above sounds to me now my mother must have been teaching me things after her own persuasion most naturally poor dear onethough that too has gone like water off my mind it was one of the troubles between her and my father the compact that i was to be brought up a catholic was dissolved after they separated and i am sorry thinking it unjust to her yet glad content with being what i am i must have been less than five when i penned this i was always a letterwriter it seems it is a reproach now from many that i have ceased to be and to them i fear it is true that i have not truly ceased witness under my hand these presentsor whatever may be the proper legal terms for an affidavit what were you like beloved as a very small child should i have loved you from the beginning had we toddled to the rencounter and would my love have passed safely through the gallous young hound period and could i love you more now in any case had i all your days treasured up in my heart instead of less than a year of them how strangely much have seven miles kept our fates apart it seems uncharacteristic for this small worldwhere meetings come about so far above the dreams of averageto have played us such a prank this must do for this once beloved for behold me busy today with what i shall not tell you i would like to put you to a test as ladies did their knights of old and hardly ever do nowfearing i suppose lest the species should altogether fail them at the pinch i would like to see if you could come here and sit with me from beginning to end with your eyes shut never once opening them i am not saying whether i think curiosity or affection would make the attempt too difficult but if you were sure you could you might come here tomorrowa day otherwise interdicted only know having come that if you open those dear cupboards of vision and set eyes on things not yet intended to be looked at there will be confusion of tongues in this tower we are building whose top is to reach heaven will you come i dont say come i only want to knowwill you today my love flies low over the earth like a swallow before rain and touching the tops of the flowers has culled you these kiss them until they open they are full of my thoughts as the world to me is full of you letter xiv own dearest come i did not think that you would or mean that you should seriously for is it not a poor way of love to make the object of it cut an absurd or partly absurd figure i wrote only as a woman having a secret on the tip of her tongue and the tips of her fingers and full of a longing to say it and send it here it is at last love me for it i have worked so hard to get it done and you do not know why and what for beloved itthisis the anniversary of the day we first met and you have forgotten it already or never remembered itand yet have been clamoring for the letters on the first anniversary of our marriage if you remember it you shall have those same letters and not otherwise so there they lie safe till doomsday the ma has been very gracious and clear after her little outbreak of yesterday her repentances after i have hurt her feelings are so gentle and sweet they always fill me with compunction finding that i would go on with the thing i was doing she volunteered to come and read to me a requiem over the bone of contention which we had gnawed between us was not that pretty and charitable she read tennysons life for a solid hour and continued it today isnt it funny that she should take up such a bookshe who cant abide tennyson or browning or shakespeare only likes byron i suppose because it was the right and fashionable liking when she was young yet she is plodding through the life religiouslyonly skipping the verses i have come across two little specimens of death and the child in it his son lionel was carried out in a blanket one night in the great comet year and waking up under the stars asked am i dead number two is of a little girl at wellingtons funeral who saw his charger carrying his boots and asked shall i be like that after i die a queer old lady came to lunch yesterday a great traveler though lame on two crutches we carefully hid all guidebooks and maps and held our peace about next month lest she should insist on coming too though i think nineveh was the place she was most anxious to go to if the ma would consent to accompany her goodby dearest of oneyearold acquaintances you too send your blessing on the anniversary now that my better memory has reminded you of it all that follow we will bless in company i trust you are onehalf as happy as i am my own my own letter xv you told me dearest that i should find your mother formidable it is true i did she is a person very much in the grand pagan style i admire it but i cannot flow in that sort of company and i think she meant to crush me you were very wise to leave her to come alone i like her i mean i believe that under that terribleness she has a heart of gold which once opened would never shut but she has not opened it to me i believe she could have a great charity that no evildoing would dismay her stanch sums her up but i have done nothing wrong enough yet to bring me into her good graces loving her son even though i fear a great offense has done me no good turn perhaps that is her inconsistency women are sure to be inconsistent somewhere it is their birthright i began to study her at once to find you it did not take long how i could love her if she would let me you know her far far better than i and want no advice otherwise i would saynever praise me to her quote my follies rather to give ground for her distaste to revel in will not deepen me in her bad books so much as attempts to warp her judgment i need not go through it all she will have told you all that is to the purpose about our meeting she bristled in a brave old fighting figure announcing compulsion in every line but with all her colors flying she waited for the door to close then said my son has bidden me come i suppose it is my duty he is his own master now we only shook hands our talk was very little of you i showed her all the horses the dogs and the poultry she let the inspection appear to conclude with myself asked me my habits and said i looked healthy i owned i felt it looks and feelings are the most deceptive things in the world she told me adding that poor stock got more than its share of these and when she said it i saw quite plainly that she meant me i wonder where she gets the notion for we are a longlived race both sides of the family i guessed that she would like frankness and was as frank as i could be pretending no deference to her objections you think you suit each other she asked me my answer he suits me pleased her maternal palate i think any girl might say that she admitted she might indeed this is the part of our interview she will not have repeated to you i was due at hillyn when she was preparing to go aunt n came in and i left her to do the honors while i slipped on my habit i rode by your mothers carriage as far as the greenway where we branched i suppose that is what her phrase means that you quote about my making a trophy of her and marching her a prisoner across the borders before all the world i do like her she is worth winningcan one say warmer of a future motherinlaw who stands hostile all the same it was an ordeal i believe i have wept since for benjy scratched my door often yesterday evening and looked most wistful when i came out merely paltry selflove dearesti am so little accustomed to not beingliked i think she will be more gracious in her own house i have her formal word that i am to come soon not too soon i will come over and you shall meet me and take me to see her there is something in her opposition that i cant fathom i wondered twice was lunacy her notion she looked at me so hard my mothers seclusion and living apart from us was not on that account i often saw her she was very dear and sweet to me and had quiet eyes the very reverse of a person mentally deranged my father i know went to visit her when she lay dying and i remember we all wore mourning my uncle has told me they had a deep regard for each other but disagreed and were independent enough to choose living apart i do not remember my father ever speaking of her to us as children but i am sure there was no state of health to be concealed last night i was talking to aunt n about her a very dear woman she told me but your father was never so much alive to her worth as the rest of us of him she said a dear fine fellow but not at all easy to get on with him of course i have a continuous recollection of and a fine fellow we did think him my mother comes to me more rarely at intervals dont talk me down your mothers throat but tell her as much as she cares to know of this i am very proud of my stock which she thinks poor dear how much i have written on things which can never concern us finally and so should not ruffle us while they last hold me in your heart always always and the world may turn adamant to me for aught i care be in my dreams tonight letter xvi but dearest when i think of you i never question whether what i think would be true or false in the eyes of others all that concerns you seems to go on a different plane where evidence has no meaning or existence where nobody exists or means anything but only we two alone engaged in bringing about for ourselves the still greater solitude of two into one oh beloved what a company that will be take me in your arms fasten me to your heart breathe on me deny me either breath or the light of day i am yours equally to live or die at your word i shut my eyes to feel your kisses falling on me like rain or still more like sunshineyet most of all like kisses my own dearest and best beloved oh we two how wonderful we seem and to think that there have been lovers like us since the world began and the world not able to tell us one little word of itnot well so as to be believedor only along with sadness where fate has broken up the heavens which lay over some pair of lovers oenones cry ah me my mountain shepherd tells us of the joy when it has vanished and most of all i get it in that song of wife and husband which ends not a word for you not a lock or kiss goodby we one must part in two verily death is this i must die it was a woman wrote that and we get love there is it only when joy is past that we can give it its full expression even now beloved i break down in trying to say how i love you i cannot put all my joy into my words nor all my love into my lips nor all my life into your arms whatever way i try something remains that i cannot express believe dearest that the half has not yet been spoken neither of my love for you nor of my trust in younor of a wish that seems sad but comes in a very tumult of happinessthe wish to die so that some unknown good may come to you out of me not till you die dearest shall i die truly i love you now too much for your heart not to carry me to its grave though i should die now and you live to be a hundred i pray you may i cannot choose a day for you to die i am too grateful to life which has given me to you to sayif i were dyingcome with me dearest though how the words tempt me as i write themcome with me dearest yes come ah but you kiss me more i think when we say goodby than when meeting so you will kiss me most of all when i have to diea thing in death to look forward to and till thenlife life till i am out of my depth in happiness and drown in your arms beloved that i can write so to youthink what it means what you have made me come through in the way of love that this which i could not have dreamed before comes from me with the thought of you you told me to be stillto let you worship i was to write back acceptance of all your dear words are you never to be at my feet you ask indeed dearest i do not know how for i cannot move from where i am do you feel where my thoughts kiss you you would be vexed with me if i wrote it down so i do not and after all some day under a bright star of providence i may have gifts for you after my own mind which will allow me to grow proud only now all the giving comes from you it is i who am enriched by your love beyond knowledge of my former self are you changed dearest by anything i have done my heart goes to you like a tree in the wind and all these thoughts are loose leaves that fly after you when i have to remain behind dear lover what short visits yours seem and the motheraunt tells me they are most unconscionably longyou will not pay any attention to that please forever let the heavens fall rather than that a hint to such foul effect should grow operative through me this brings you me so far as it cansuch little words off so great a body ofliking shall i call it my paper stops me it is my last sheet i should have to go down to the library to get moreelse i think i could not cease writing more love than i can nameever dearest your own letter xvii dearest do i not write you long letters it reveals my weakness i have thought it had been coming on me and now and then had broken out of me before i met you that left to myself i should have become a writer of booksi scarcely can guess what sortand gone contentedly into middleage with that instead of this as my raison detre how gladly i lay down that part of myself and saybut for you i had been this quite other person whom i have no wish to be now beloved your heart is the shelf where i put all my uncut volumes wondering a little what sort of a writer i should have made and chiefly wondering would you have liked me in that character there is one here in the family who considers me a writer of the darkest dye and does not approve of it benjy comes and sits most mournfully facing me when i settle down on a sunny morning such as this to write and inquires with all the dumbness a dog is capable ofwhat has come between us that you fill up your time and mine with those catsclaw scratchings when you should be in your woodland dress running with me through damp places having written this sentimental meaning into his eyes and benjy still sitting watching me i was seized with ruth for my neglect of him and took him to see his mothers grave at the bottom of the long walk is our dogs cemeteryno tombstones but mounds and a dogrose grows there and flourishes as nowhere else it was my fancy as a child to have it planted and i declare to you it has taken wonderfully to the notion as if it knew that it had relations of a higher species under its keeping benjy too has a profound air of knowing and never scratches for bones there as he does in other places what horror were i to find him digging up his mothers skeleton would my esteem for him survive when we got there today he deprecated my choice of locality asking what i had brought him there for i pointed out to him the precise mound which covered the object of his earliest affections and gathered you these buds are they not a deep color for wild onesif their blush remains a fixed state till the post brings them to you through what flower would you best like to be passed back as regards your material atoms into the spiritualized side of nature when we have done with ourselves in this life no single flower quite covers all my wants and aspirations you and i would put our heads together underground and evolve a new flowercarnation lily lily roseand send it up one fine morning for scientists to dispute over and give diabolical learned names to what an end to our cozy floral collaboration that would be here endeth the epistle the elect salutes you this week if the authorities permit i shall be paying you a flying visit with wings full of eyesand i hope healing for i believe you are seedy and that that is what is behind it you notice i have not complained dearest how could i my happiness reaches to the cloudsthat is to where things are not quite clear at present i love you no more than i ought yet far more than i can name goodnight and goodmorningyour star since you call me so letter xviii dearest not having had a letter from you this morning i have read over some back ones and find in one a bidding which i have never fulfilled to tell you what i do all day was that to avoid the too great length of my telling you what i think yet you get more of me this way than that what i do is every day so much the same while what i think is always different however since you want a woman of action rather than of brain here i start telling you i wake punctual and hungry at the sound of nannans drawing of the blinds wait till she is gone the old darling potters and tattles it is her most possessive moment of me in the day except when i sham headaches and let her put me to bed then i have my hand under my pillow and draw out your last for a reading that has lost count whether it is the twentysecond or the fiftysecond timediscover new beauties in it and run to the glass to discover new beauties in myselffind them benjy comes up with the posts latest and behold my day is begun is that the sort of thing you want to know my days are without an action worth naming i only think swelling thoughts and write some of them if ever i do anything worth telling be sure i run a penandink race to tell you no it is man who does things a woman only diddles to adapt a word of diminutive sound for the occasion unless good fortunate independent thing she works for her own living and that is not me i feel sometimes as if a real bar were between me and a whole conception of life because i have carpets and curtains and nannan and benjy and last of all youshutting me out from the realities of existence if you would all leave me just for one full moon and come back to me only when i am starving for you allfor my tea to be brought to me in the morning and all the paddings and cushionings which bolster me up from morning till nightwith what a sigh of wisdom i would drop back into your arms and would let you draw the rosecolored curtains round me again now i am afraid lest i have become too happy i am leaning so far out of window to welcome the dawn i seem to be tempting a fallheaven itself to fall upon me what do i know truly who only know so much happiness dearest if there is anything else in love which i do not know teach it me quickly i am utterly yours if there is sorrow to give give it me only let me have with it the consciousness of your love oh my dear i lose myself if i think of you so much what would life have without you in it the sun would drop from my heavens i see only by you you have kissed me on the eyes you are more to me than my own poor brain could ever have devised had i started to invent paradise i could not have invented you but perhaps you have invented me i am something new to myself since i saw you first god bless you for it even if you were to shut your eyes at me nowthough i might go blind you could not unmake methe gods themselves cannot recall their gifts also that i am yours is a gift of the gods i will trust and so not to be recalled kiss me dearest here where i have written this i am yours beloved i kiss you again and againever your own making letter xix dearest dearest how long has this happened you dont tell me the day or the hour is it ever since you last wrote then you have been in pain and grief for four days and i not knowing anything about it and you have no hand in the house kind enough to let you dictate by it one small word to poor me what heartless merrymakings may i not have sent you to worry you when soothing was the one thing wanted well i will not worry now then neither at not being told nor at not being allowed to come but i will come thus and thus o my dear heart and take you in my arms and you will be comforted will you not be when i tell you that even if you had no legs at all i would love you just the same indeed dearest so much of you is a superfluity just your heart against mine and the sound of your voice would carry me up to more heavens than i could otherwise have dreamed of i may say now now that i know it was not your choice what a void these last few days the lack of letters has been to me i wondered truly if you had found it well to put off such visible signs for a while in order to appease one who in other things more essential sees you rebellious but the wonder is over now and i dont want you to writenot till a consultation of doctors orders it for the good of your health i will be so happy talking to you also i am sending you booksthose i wish you to read and which now you must since you have the leisure and i for my part will make time and read yours whose do you most want me to read that my education in your likings may become complete what i send you will not deprive me of anything for i have the beautiful complete setyour giftand shall read side by side with you to realize in imagination what the happiness of reading them for the first time ought to be yesterday by a most unsympathetic instinct i went out for a long tramp on my two feet and no ache in them came and told me of you over sillingford i sat on a bank and looked downhill where went a carter and i looked uphill where lay something which might be nothingor not his now shall i make a fool of myself by pursuing to tell him he may have dropped something or shall i go on and see so i went on and saw a coat with a fat pocket and by then he was out of sight and perhaps it wasnt his and it was very hot and the hill steep so i minded my own business making cains motto mine and now feel so had being quite sure that it was his and i wonder how many miles he will have tramped back looking for it and whether his dinner was in the pocket these unintentional misdoings are the sins one repents of all ones life long i have others stored away the bitterest of small things done or undone in haste and repented of at so much leisure afterwards and always done to people or things i had no grudge against sometimes even a love for they are my skeletons i will tell you of them some day this dearest is our first enforced absence from each other and i feel it almost more hard on me than on you beloved let us lay our hearts together and get comforted it is not real separation to know that another part of the world contains the rest of me oh the rest of me the rest of me that you are so thinking of you i can never be tired i rest yours letter xx yes dearest patience but it is a virtue i have little enough of naturally and used to be taught to pray for as a child and i remember once really hurting clear motheraunts feelings by trying to repay her for that teaching by a little iniquitous laughter at her expense it was too funny for me to feel very contrite about as i do sometimes over quite small things or i would not be telling it you now for there are things in me i would conceal even from you i dare say you wouldnt guess it but the ma is a most long person over her private devotions perhaps it was her own habit with the cares of a household sometimes conflicting which made her recite to me so often her pet legend of a saintly person who constantly interrupted over her prayers by mundane matters became a pattern in patience out of these snippings of her godly desires so one day angels in the disguise of cross people with selfish demands on her time came seeking to know where in her composition or composure exasperation began and finding none they let her return in peace to her missal where for a reward all the letters had been turned into gold and that my dear comes of patience my aunt would say till i grew a little tired of the saying i dont know what experience my uncle had gathered of her patience under like circumstances but i notice that to this day he treads delicately like agag when he knows her to be on her knees and prefers then to send me on his errands instead of doing them himself so it happened one day that he wanted a particular coat which had been put away in her clothesclosetand she was on her knees between him and it with the time of her amen quite indefinite i was sent said my errand briefly and was permitted to fumble out her keys from her pocket while she continued to kneel over her morning psalms what i brought to him turned out to be the wrong coat i went back and knocked for readmittance longsufferingly she bade me to come in i explained and still she repressed herself only saying in a tone of affliction do see this time that you take the right one after i had made my second selection and proved it right on my uncles person the parallelism of things struck me and i skipped back to my aunts door and tapped i got a low wailing yes for answera monosyllabic substitute for the how long o lord of a saint in difficulties when i called through the keyhole are your psalms written in gold she became really angryi suppose because the miracle so well earned had not come to pass well dearest if you have been patient with me over so much about nothing i pray this letter may appear to you written in gold why i write so is partly that it is bad for us both to be down in the mouth or with hearts down at heel and so since you cannot i have to do the dancingand partly because i found i had a bad temper on me which needed curing and being brought to the sungodown point of owing no man anything which sooner said has finally been done and i am very meek now and loving to you and everything belonging to younot to come nearer the sore point and i hope some day some day as a reward to my present submission that you will sprain your ankle in my company just a very little bit for an excuse and let me have the nursing of it it hurts my heart to have your poor bones crying out for comfort that i am not to bring to them i feel robbed of a part of my domestic training and may never pick up what i have just lost and i fear greatly you must have been truly in pain to have put off meredith for a day if i had been at hand to read to you i flatter myself you would have liked him well and been soothed you must take the will beloved for the deed i kiss you now as much as even you can demand and when you get this i will be thinking of you all over againwhen do i ever leave off love love love till our next meeting and then more love still and moreever your own letter xxi dearest i am in a simple mood today and give you the benefit of it i shall become complicated again presently and you will hear from me directly that happens the house only emptied itself this morning i may say emptied for the remainder fits like a saint into her niche and is far too comfortable to count this is c whom you only once met when she sat so much in the background that you will not remember her she has one weakness a thirst between mealsthe blameless thirst of a rabid teetotaler she hides cups of cold tea about the place as a dog its bones now and then one gets spilled or sat on and when she hears of the accident she looks thirsty with a thirst which only that particular cup of tea could have quenched in no other way is she any trouble indeed she is a great dear and has the face of a madonna as beautiful as an apocryphal gospel to look at and make believe in arthur too like the rest of them when he came over to give me his brotherly blessing wished to know what you were like i didnt pretend to remember your outward appearance too welltold him you looked like a common or garden englishman and roused his suspicions by so careless a championship of my choice he accused me of being in reality highly sentimental about you and with having at that moment your portrait concealed and strung around my neck in a locket motheraunt stood up for me against him declaring i was too sensible a girl for nonsense of that sort it is a little weakness of hers you know to resent extremes of endearment towards anyone but herself in those she has brooded and she has thought us hitherto most restrained and properas indeed have we not been arthur and i exchanged tokens of truce in a little while off went my aunt to bed leaving us alone then for he is the one of us that i am most frank with arthur cried i and up came your little locket like a bucket from a well for him to have his first sight of you my beloved he objected that he could not see faces in a nutshell and i suppose others cannot only i he too is gone if you had been coming he would have spared another dayfor today was planned and dated you will rememberand we would have ridden halfway to meet you but as fate has tripped you and made all comings on your part indefinite he sends you his hopes for a later meeting how is your poor foot i suppose as it is ill i may send it a kiss by post and wish it well i do truly you are to let me know if it gives you much pain and i will lie awake thinking of you this is not sentimental for if one knows that a friend is occupied over ones sleeplessness one feels the comfort i am perplexed how else to give you my company your mother i know could not yet truly welcome me and i wish to be as patient as possible and not push for favors that are not offered so i cannot come and ask to take you out in her carriage nor come and carry you away in mine we must try how fast we can hold hands at a distance i have kept up to where you have been reading in richard feverel though it has been a scramble for i have less opportunity of reading i with my feet than you without yours in your book i have just got to the smuggling away of general monk in the perforated coffin and my sense of history capitulates in an abandonment of laughter i yield the gauls invasion of britain always becomes broad farce when he attempts it this in clever ludicrousness beats the unintentional comedy of victor hugos johnjimjack as a name typical of anglosaxon christenings but dumas through a dozen absurdities knows apparently how to stalk his quarry so large a genius may play the fool and remain wise you see i have given your author a warm welcome at last and what about you and mine tell me you love his women and i will not be jealous indeed outside him i dont know where to find a written english woman of modern times whom i would care to meet or could feel honestly bound to look up tonowhere will i have her shaking her ringlets at me in dickens or thackeray scott is simply not modern and hardys women if they have nobility in them get so cruelly broken on the wheel that you get but the wrecks of them at last it is only his charming baggages who come to a good ending i like an author who has the courage and selfrestraint to leave his noble creations alive too many try to ennoble them by death for my part if i have to go out of life before you i would gladly trust you to the hands of clara or rose or janet or most of all vittoria though to be accurate i fear they have all grown too old for you by now and you have you any men to offer me in turn out of your literary admirations supposing you should die of a snapped ankle would you give me to dartagnan for instance hardly i suspect but either choose me some proxy hero or get well and come to me you will be very welcome when you do sleep is making sandy eyes at me goodnight dearest letter xxii why my beloved since you put it to me as a point of conscience it is only lying on your back with one active leg doing nothing and the other dying to have done aching which has made you take this new start of inquiring within upon everything since you call on me for a conscientious answer i say that it stands to reason that i love you more than you love me because there is so much more of you to love let alone fit for loving do you imagine that you are going to be a cripple for life and therefore an indifferent dancer in the dances i shall always be leading you that you have started this fit of selfdepreciation or is it because i have thrown meredith at your sick head that you doubt my tact and my affection and my power patiently to bear for your sake a good deal of cold shoulder dearest remember i am doctoring you from a distance and am not yet allowed to come and see my patient so can only judge from your letters how ill you are that you have been concealing from me almost treacherously and only by a piece of abject waylaying did i receive word today of your sleepless nights and so get the key to your symptoms lay by meredith then for a while i am sending you a cargo of stevenson instead you have been truly unkind trying to read what required effort when you were fit for nothing of the sort and lest even stevenson should be too much for you and wanting very much and perhaps a little bit jealously to be your most successful nurse i am letting my last large bit of shyness of you go and with a pleasant sort of pain because i know i have hit on a thing that will please you i open my hands and let you have these and with them goes my last blush henceforth i am a woman without a secret and all your interest in me may evaporate yet i know well it will not as for this resurrection pie from loves deadletter office you will find from it at least one thinghow much i depended upon response from you before i could become at all articulate it is you dearest from the beginning who have set my head and heart free and made me a woman i am something quite different from the sort of child i was less than a year ago when i wrote that small prayer which stands sponsor for all that follows how abundantly it has been answered dearest beloved only i know you do not now my prayer is not that you should come true but that you should get well do this one little thing for me dearest for you i will do anything my happiness waits for that as yet i seem to have done nothing oh but beloved i will from a reading of the fioretti i sign myself as i feelyour glorious poor little one the casket letters a my dear prince wonderful pray god bless and make him come true for my sake amen rsvp footnote the ms contained at first no name but a blank over it this has been written afterwards in a small hand b dear prince wonderful now that i have met you i pray that you will be my friend i want just a little of your friendship but that so much so much and even for that little i do not know how to ask always to be your friend of that you shall be quite sure c dear prince wonderful long ago when i was still a child i told myself of you but thought of you only as in a fairy tale now i am afraid of trusting my eyes or ears for fear i should think too much of you before i know you really to be true do not make me wish so much to be your friend unless you are also going to be true please come true now for mine and for all the worlds sakebut for mine especially because i thought of you first and if you are not able to come true dont make me see you any more i shall always remember you and be glad that i have seen you just once d dear prince wonderful has god blessed you yet and made you come true i have not seen you again so how am i to know not that it is necessary for me to know even if you do come true i believe already that you are true if i were never to see you again i should be glad to think of you as living and shall always be your friend i pray that you may come to know that e dear highness i do not know what to write to you i only know how much i wish to write i have always written the things i thought about it has been easy to find words for them now i think about you but have no wordsno words dear highness for you i could write at once if i knew you were my friend come true for me i will have so much to tell you then f dear highness if i believe in fairy tales coming true it is because i am superstitious this is what i did today i shut my eyes and took a book from the shelf opened it and put my fingers down on a page this is what i came to all i believed is true i am able yet all i want to get by a method as strange as new dare i trust the same to you fate says then you are to be my friend fate has said i am yours already that is very certain only in real life where things come true would a book have opened as this has done g dear highness i am sure now then that i please you and that you like me perhaps only a little for you turned out of your way to ride with me though you were going somewhere so fast how much i wished it when i saw you coming but dared not believe it would come true come true it is the word i have always been writing and everything hasyou most of all you are more true each time i see you so true that now i will write it down at lastthe truth for you who have come so true dear highness and great heart i love you dearly though you dont know itquite ever so much and am going to love you ever so much more onlyplease like me a little better first you on your dear side must do something or before i know i may be wringing my hands all alone on a desert island to a bare blue horizon with nothing in it real or fabulous if i am to love you nothing but happiness is to be allowed to come of it so dont come true too fast without one little wee corresponding wish for me to find that you are i am quite happy thinking you out slowly it takes me all day long the longer the better i wonder how often in my life i shall write down that i love you having once written it i doi love you there it is for you with more to follow after and send you my love as i do now into the great emptiness of chance hoping somehow known or unknown it may bless you and bring good to you oh but tis a windy world and i a mere feather in it how can i get blown the way i would still i have a superstition that some star is over me which i have not seen yet but shallheaven helping me and now goodnight and no more no more at all i send out an i love you to be my celestial commercial traveler for me while i fold myself up and become its sleeping partner goodnight you are the best and truest that i ever dreamed yet h dear highness i begin not to be able to name you anything for there is not a word for you that will do highness you are but that leaves gaps and coldnesses without end royal yet much more serene than royal though by that i dont mean any detraction from your royalty for i never saw a man carry his invisible crown with so level a head and no haughtiness at all and that is the finest royalty of look possible i look at you and wonder so how you have grown to thisto have become king so quietly without any coronation ceremony you have thought more than you should for happiness at your age making me by that one line in your forehead think you were three years older than you really are i wishif i dare wish you anything differentthat you were it makes me uncomfortable to remember that i amwhat almost half a year your elder as time fliesnot really for your brain was born long before mine began to rattle in its shell you say quite old things and quietly as if you had had them in your mind ten years already when you told me about your two old pensioners the blind man and his wife whom you brought to so funny a reconciliation i felt mir war ich wuszte nicht wie that i would like very much to go blindfold led by you it struck me suddenly how happy would be a blindfoldness of perfect trust such as one might have with your hands on one i suppose that is what in religion is called faith i havent it there my dear but i have it in you now i love you beginning to understand why at first i did not i am ashamed not to have discovered it earlier the matter with you is that you have goodness prevailing in you an integrity of goodness i meana different thing from there being a whereabouts for goodness in you that we all have in some proportion or another i was quite right to love you i know it nowi did not when i first did yesterday i was turning over a silly confession book in which a rose was everybodys favorite flower manliness the finest quality for a man and womanliness for a woman which is as much as to say that pig is the best quality for pork and pork for pig till i came upon one different from the others and found myself saying yes all down the page i turned over for the signature and found my own mothers was it not a strange sweet meeting and only then did the memory of her handwriting from far back come to me she died dear highness before i was seven years old i love her as i do my early memory of flowers as something very sweet hardly as a real person i noticed she loved best in men and women what they lack most often in a man a fair mind in a woman courage brave women and fair men she wrote byron might have turned in his grave at having his dissolute stiffneck so wrung for him by misquotation and sheit must have been before the eighties had started the popular craze for himchose meredith my own dear meredith for her favorite author how our tastes would have run together had she lived well i know you fair and believe myself braveconstitutionally so that i cant help it and this therefore is not selfpraise but fairness in a man is a deadly hard acquirement i begin now to discover you have it fixed fast in you you i think began to do just things consciously as the burden of manhood began in you i love to think of you growing by degrees till you could carry your head soand no other way so that looking at you i can promise myself you never did a mean thing and never consciously an unjust thing except to yourself i can just fancy that fault in you but whateveri love you for it more and more and am proud knowing you and finding that we are to become friends for it is that and no less than that now i love you and me you like cordially and that is enough i need not look behind it for already i have no way to repay you for the happiness this brings me i oh i think greatly of you my dear and it takes long thinking not merely such a quantity of thought but such a quality makes so hard a days work that by the end of it i am quite drowsy bless me dearest all today has belonged to you and tomorrow i know waits to become yours without the asking just as without the asking i too am yours i wish it were more possible for us to give service to those we love i am most glad because i see you so often but i come and go in your life emptyhanded though i have so much to give away thoughts the best i have i give you i cannot empty my brain of them some day you shall think well of methat is a vow dear friendyou whom i love so much j i have not had to alter any thought ever formed about you beloved i have only had to deepen itthat is all you grow but you remain i have heard people talk about you generally kindly but what they think of you is often wrong i do not say anything but i am glad and so sure that i know you better if my mind is so clear about you it shows that you are good for me now for nearly three months i may not see you again but all that time you will be growing in my heart and at the end without another word from you i shall find that i know you better than before is that strange it is because i love you love is knowledgeblind knowledge not wanting eyes i only hope that i shall keep in your memory the kind place you have given me you are almost my friend now and i know it you do not know that i love you k beloved you love me i know it now and bless the sun and the moon and the stars for the dear certainty of it and i ask you now o heart that has opened to me have i once been unhappy or impatient while this good thing has been withheld from me indeed my love for you has occupied me too completely i have been so glad to find how much there is to learn in a good heart deeply unconscious of its own goodness you have employed me as i wish i may be employed all the days of my life and now my beloved employer has given me the wages i did not ask you love me is it a question of little or much is it not rather an entire new thought of me that has entered your life as the thought of you entered mine months that seem years ago it was the seed then and seemed small but the whole life was there and it has grown and grown till now it is i who have become small and have hardly room in me for the roots and it seems to have gone so far up over my head that i wonder if the stars know of my happiness they must know of yours too then my beloved they are no company for me without you oh today today of all days how in my heart i shall go on kissing it till i die you love me that is wonderful you love me and already it is not wonderful in the least but belongs to noah and the ark and all the animals saved up for an earth washed clean and dried and the new beginnings of time which have ever since been twisting and turning with us in safe keeping through all the history of the world we came over at the norman conquest my dear as people say trailing their pedigree but there was no ancestral pride about usit was all for the love of the thing we did it how clear it seems now in the hall hangs a portrait in a big wig but otherwise the image of my father of a man who flouted the authority of james ii merely because he was so like my father in character that he could do nothing else i shall look for you now in the bayeux tapestries with a prong from your helmet down the middle of your faceof which that line on your forehead is the remainder and you love me i wonder what the line has to do with that by such little things do great things seem to come about not really i know it was not because i said just what i did say and did what i did yesterday that your heart was bound to come for mine but it was those small things that brought you consciousness and when we parted i knew that i had all the world at my feetor all heaven over my head ah at last i may let the spirit of a kiss go to you from me and not be ashamed or think myself forward since i have your love all this time you are thinking of me a certainty lying far outside what i can see beloved if great happiness may be set to any words it is here if silence goes better with itspeak silence for me when i end now goodnight and think greatly of me i shall wake early l dearest was my heart at all my ownwas it my own to give till you came and made me aware of how much it contains truly dear it contained nothing before since now it contains you and nothing else so i have a brandnew heart to give away and you you want it and cant see that there it is staring you in the face like a rose with all its petals ready to drop i am quite sure that if i had not met you i could have loved nobody as i love you yet it is very likely that i should have lovedsufficiently as the way of the world goes it is not a romantic confession but it is true to life i do so genuinely like most of my fellowcreatures and am not happy except where shoulders rub sociallythat is to say have not until now been happy except dependently on the company and smiles of others now beloved i have none of your company and have had but few of your smiles i could count them all yet i have become more happy filling up my solitude with the understanding of you which has made me wise than all the rest of fate or fortune could make me down comes autumns sad heart and finds me gay and the asters which used to chill me at their appearing have come out like crocuses this year because it is the beginning of a new world and all the winter will carry more than a suspicion of summer with it just as the longest days carry round light from northwest to northeast because so near the horizon but out of sight lies their sun so you beloved so near to me now at last though out of sight m beloved whether i have sorry or glad things to think about they are accompanied and changed by thoughts of you you are my diaryall goes to you now that you love me is the very light by which i see everything also i learn so much through having you in my thoughts i cannot say how it is for i have no more knowledge of life than i had beforeyet i am wiser i believe knowing much more what lives at the root of things and what men have meant and felt in all they have donebecause i love you dearest also i am quicker in my apprehensions and have more joy and more fear in me than i had before and if this seems to be all about myself it is all about you really beloved last week one of my dearest old friends our rector died a character you too would have loved he was a father to the whole village rather stern of speech and no respecter of persons yet he made a very generous allowance for those who did not go through the church door to find their salvation i often went only because i loved him and he knew it i went for that reason alone last sunday the whole village was full of closed blinds and of all things over him chopins funeral march was playeda thing utterly unchristian in its meaning wild pagan grief desolate over lost beauty balder the beautiful is dead is dead it cried and i thought of you suddenly you who are not balder at all too many thorns have been in your life but not the mistletoe stroke dealt by a blind god ignorantly yet in all great joy there is the balder element and i feared lest something might slay it for me and my life become a cry like chopins march over mowndown unripened grass and youth slain in its high places after service a sort of processional instinct drew people up to the house they waited about till permission was given and went in to look at their old man lying in high state among his books i did not go beloved i have never yet seen death you have i know do you i wonder remember your father better than i mineor your brother are they more living because you saw them once not living i think death might open our eyes to those we lived on ill terms with but not to the familiar and dear i do not need you dead to be certain that your heart has mine for its true inmate and mine yours i love you i love you so let goodnight bring you goodmorning n at long intervals dearest i write to you a secret all about yourself for my eyes to see because chiefly because i have not you to look at thus i bless myself with you away over the world west of this and a little bit north is the city of spires where you are now never having seen it i am the more free to picture it as i like and to me it is quite full of youquite greedily full beloved when elsewhere you are so much wanted i send my thoughts there to pick up crumbs for me it is a strange blend of notionswisdom and ignorance combined for you i seem to know perfectly but of your life nothing at all and yet nobody there knows so much about you as i what you do matters so much less than what you are you who are the clearest heart in all the world do what you will you are so still to me beloved i take a happy armful of thoughts about you into all my dreams and when i wake they are there still and have done nothing but remain true what better can i ask of them you do love me you have not changed without change i remain yours so long as i live o and you beloved what are you thinking of me all this while think well of me i beg you i deserve so much loving you as truly as i do so often dearest i sit thinking my hands into yours again as when we were saying goodby the last time then it was under our laughter and light words that i saw suddenly how the thing too great to name had become true that from friends we were changed into lovers it seemed the most natural thing to be and yet was wonderfulfor it was i who loved you first a thing i could never be ashamed of and am now proud to ownfor has it not proved me wise my love for you is the best wisdom that i have goodnight dearest sleep as well as i love you and nobody in the world will sleep so soundly p a few times in my life beloved i have had the bluemoonhunger for something which seemed too impossible and good ever to come true prosaic people call it being in the blues i comfort myself with a prettier word for it today not the bluemoon itself but the man of it came down and ate plumporridge with me also i do believe that it burnt his mouth and am quite reasonably happy thinking so since it makes me know that you love me as much as ever if i have had doubts dearest they have been of myself lest i might be unworthy of your friendship or love suspicions of you i never had who wrote that suspicions among thoughts are like bats among birds flying only by twilight but even my doubts have been thoughts belovedsure of you if not always of myself and if i have looked for you only with doubtful vision yet i have always seen you in as strong a light as my eyes could bear bluemoonlight beloved is not twilight and bluemoonlight has been the light i saw you by it is you alone who can make sunlight of it this i read yesterday has lain on my mind since as true and altogether beautiful with the beauty of major not of minor poetry though it was a minor poet who wrote it it is of a wood where apollo has gone in quest of his beloved and she is not yet to be found here each branch swayd with a glitter all its crowded leaves and brushed the soft divine hair touching them in ruffled clusters suddenly the moon smoothed herself out of vapordrift and made the deep night full of pleasure in the eye of her sweet motion not alone she came leading the starlight with her like a song and not a bud of all that undergrowth but crisped and tingled out an ardent edge as the light steeped it over whose massed leaves the portals of illimitable sleep faded in heaven that is love in its moonrise not its sunrise stage yet you see beloved how it takes possession of its dark world quite as fully as the brighter sunlight could do and if i speak of doubts i mean no twilight and no suspicions nor by darkness do i mean any unhappiness my bluemoon has come leading the starlight with her like a song am i not happy enough to be patiently yours before you know it good things which are to be before they happen are already true nothing is so true as you are except my love for you and yours for me goodnight goodnight sleep well beloved and wake q beloved i heard somebody yesterday speak of you as charming and i began wondering to myself was that the word which could ever have covered my thoughts of you i do not know whether you ever charmed me except in the sense of charming which means magic and spellbinding that you did from the beginning dearest but i think i held you at first in too much awe to discover charm in you and at last knew you too much to the depths to name you by a word so lightly used for the surface of things yet now a charm in you which is not all you but just a part of you comes to light when i see you wondering whether you are really loved or whether beloved i only like you rather well well if you will be so charming i am helpless and can do nothing nothing but pray for the bluemoon to rise and love you a little better because you have some of that divine foolishness which strikes the very wise ones of earth and makes them kin to weaker mortals who otherwise might miss their charm altogether truly beloved if i am happy it is because i am also your most patiently loving r beloved the certainty which i have now that you love me so fills all my thoughts i cannot understand you being in any doubt on your side what must i do that i do not do to show gladness when we meet and sorrow when we have to part i am sure that i make no pretense or disguise except that i do not stand and wring my hands before all the world and cry dont gowhich has sometimes been in my mind to be kept not said indeed i think so much of you my dear that i believe some day if you do your part you will only have to look up from your books to find me standing if you did would you still be in doubt whether i loved you oh if any apparition of me ever goes to you all my thoughts will surely look truthfully out of its eyes and even you will read what is there at last beloved i kiss your blind eyes and love them the better for all their unreadiness to see that i am already their slave not a day now but i think i may see you again i am in a golden uncertainty from hour to hour i love you you love me a mist of blessing swims over my eyes as i write the words till they become one and the same thing i can no longer divide their meaning in my mind amen there is no need that i should s beloved i have not written to you for quite a long time ah i could not i have nothing now to say i think i could very easily die of this great happiness so certainly do you love me just a breath more of it and i should be gone goodby dearest and goodby and goodby if you want letters from me now you must ask for them that the earth contains us both and that we love each other is about all that i have mind enough to take in i do not think i can love you more than i do you are no longer my dream but my great waking thought i am waiting for no bluemoonrise now my heart has not a wish which you do not fulfill i owe you my whole life and for any good to you must pay it out to the last farthing and still feel myself your debtor oh beloved i am most poor and most rich when i think of your love goodnight i can never let thought of you go beloved these are almost all of them but not quite a few here and there have cried to be taken out saying they were still too shy to be looked at i cant argue with them they know their own minds best and you know mine see what a dignified historic name i have given this letterbox or chatterbox or whatever you like to call it but resurrection pie is my name for it dont eat too much of it prays your loving letter xxiii saving your presence dearest i would rather have prince otto a very lovable character for second affections to cling to richard feverel would never marry again so i dont ask for him as for the rest they are all too excellent for me they give me the impression of having worn copybooks under their coats when they were boys to cheat punishment and the copybooks got beaten into their systems you must find me somebody who was a gallous young hound in the days of his youthcrossjay for instancethere i have found the very man for me but really and truly are you better it will not hurt your foot to come to me since i am not to come to you how i long to see you again dearest it is an age as a matter of fact it is a fortnight but i dread lest you will find some change in me i have kept a real white hair to show you i drew it out of my comb the other morning wound up into a curl it becomes quite visible and it is ivorywhite you are not to think it flaxen and take away its one wee sentiment and i make you an offeryou shall have it if honestly you can find in your own head a white one to exchange dearest i am not hurt nor do i take seriously to heart your mothers present coldness how much more i could forgive her when i put myself in her place she may well feel a struggle and some resentment at having to give up in any degree her place with you all my selfishness would come to the front if that were demanded of me do not think because i leave her alone that i am repaying her coldness in the same coin i know that for the present anything i do must offend have i demanded your coming too soon then stay away another dayor two every day only piles up the joy it will be to have your arms round me once more i can keep for a little longer and the gray hair will keep and many tomorrows will come bringing good things for us when perhaps your mothers share of the world will be over dont say it but when you next kiss her kiss her for me also i am sorry for all old people their love of things they are losing is so far more to be reverenced and made room for than ours of the things which will come to us in good time abundantly tonight i feel selfish at having too much of your love and not a bit of it can i let go i hope beloved we shall live to see each others gray hairs in earnest gray hairs that we shall not laugh at as at this one i pulled how dark your dear eyes will look with a white setting my hearts heart every day you grow larger round me and i so much stronger depending upon you i wont saycome for certain tomorrow but come if and as soon as you can i seem to see a mile further when i am on the lookout for you and i shall be longsighted every day until you come it is only doubtful hope deferred which maketh the heart sick i am as happy as the day is long waiting for you but the day is long dearest none the less when i dont see you all this space on the page below is love i have no time left to put it into words or words into it you bless my thoughts constantlybelieve me never your thoughtless letter xxiv dearest how when and where is there any use wrangling as to which of us loves the other the best the better i believe would be the more grammatical phrase in incompetent queens english and why in that of all things should we pretend to be rivals for this at least seems certain to me that being created male and female no two lovers since the world began ever loved each other quite in the same way it is not in nature for it to be so they cannot compare only to the best that is in them they do love each after their kindas do we for certain be sure then that i am utterly contented with what i get and you beloved and you nay i wonder forever at the love you have given me and if i will to lay mine at your feet and feel yours crowning my lifewhy so it is you know you cannot alter it and if you insist that your love is at my feet i have only to turn irish and reply that it is because i am heels over head in love with youand mark you that is no pretty attitude for a lady that you have driven me into in order that i may stick to my crown go to dearest there is one thing in which i can beat you and that is in the bandying of words and all verbal conjurings take this as the last proof of it and rest quiet i know you love me a great great deal more than i have wit or power to love you and that is just the little reason why your love mounts till as i tell you it crowns me head or heels while mine insufficient and groveling lies at your feet and will till they become amputated and i can give you but wont sixty other reasons why things are as i say and are to be left as i say and oh my world my world it is with you i go round sunwards and you make my evenings and mornings and will till time shuts his wings over us and now it is doleful business i have to write to you i have dropped to sleep over all this writing of things and my cheek down on the page has made the paper unwilling to take the ink againwhat a pretty compliment to me and if you prefer it what an easy way of writing to you i can send you such any day and be as idle as i like and you will decide about all the above exactly as you and i think best or should it be better again being only between us two when you get this blow your beloved self a kiss in the glass for mea great big shattering blow that shall astonish mercury behind his windowpane goodnight my bestor better for that is what i most want you to be letter xxv my own beloved and i never thanked you yesterday for your dear words about the resurrection pie that comes of quarreling well you must prove them and come quickly that i may see this restoration of health and spirits that you assure me of you avoid saying that they sent you to sleep but i suppose that is what you mean fate meant me only to light upon gay things this morning listen to this and guess where it comes from when march with variant winds was past and april had with her silver showers taen leif at life with an orient blast and lusty may that mother of flowers had made the birds to begin their hours among the odours ruddy and white whose harmony was the ears delight in bed at morrow i sleeping lay methought aurora with crystal een in at the window looked by day and gave me her visage pale and green and on her hand sang a lark from the splene awake ye lovers from slumbering see how the lusty morrow doth spring ah but you are no scholar of the things in your own tongue that is dunbar a scots poet contemporary of henry vii just a little bit altered by me to make him soundable to your ears if i had not had to leave an archaic word here and there would you ever have guessed he lay outside this century that shows the permanent element in all good poetry and in all good joy in things also in the four centuries since that was written we have only succeeded in worsening the meaning of certain words as for instance spleen which now means irritation and vexation but stood then for quite the oppositewhat we should call i suppose a full heart it is what i am always sayinga good digestion is the root of nearly all the good living and high thinking we are capable of and the spleen was then the root of the happy emotions as it is now of the miserable ones your prereformation lark sang from a full stomach and thanked god it had a constitution to carry it off without affectation and your nineteenth century lark applying the same code of life his plainsong is mere happy everyday prose and not poetry at all as we try to make it out to be i have no news for you at all of anyone all inside the house is a simmer of peace and quiet with blinds drawn down against the heat the whole day long no callers and as for me i never call elsewhere the gossips about here eke out a precarious existence by washing each others dirty linen in public and the process never seems to result in any satisfactory cleansing i avoid saying what news i trust tomorrows postbag may contain for me every wish i send you comes from the spleen which means i am very healthy and conditionally as happy as is good for me pray god bless my dear share of the world and make him get well for his own and my sake amen this catches the noon post an event which always shows i am jubilant with a lot of the opposite to a little death feeling running over my nerves i feel the grass growing under me the reverse of poor keats complaint goodby beloved till i find my way into the provender of tomorrows postbag letter xxvi oh wings of the morning here you come i have been looking out for you ever since post came roberts is carrying orders into town and will bring you this with a touch of the hat and an amused grin under it i saw you right on the top sallis hill this is to wager that my eyes have told me correctly look out for me from far away i am at my corner window wave to me dearest this is to kiss you before i can letter xxvii dearest i have made a bad beginning of the week i wonder how it will end it all comes of my not seeing enough of you time hangs heavy on my hands and the devil finds me the mischief i prevailed upon myself to go on sunday and listen to our new lately appointed vicar for i thought it not fair to condemn him on the strength of mrs ps terrible reporting powers and her sensuous worship of his fullblown flowers of speechpulpitpotplants is what i call them it was not worse and not otherwise than i had expected i find there are only two kinds of clerics as generally necessary to salvation in a country parishone leads his parishioners to the altar and the other to the pulpit and the latter is vastly the more popular among the articulate and gadabout members of his flock this one sways himself over the edge of his frame making signals of distress in all directions and with that and his windy flights of oratory suggests twenty minutes in a ballooncar till he comes down to earth at the finish with the doxology for a parachute his shepherds crook is one long note of interrogation with which he tries to hook down the heavens to the understanding of his hearers and his hearers up to an understanding of himself all his arguments are put interrogatively and few of them are worth answering well well i shall be all the freer for your visit when you come next sunday and any sunday after that you will and he shall come in to tea if you like and talk to you in quite a cultured and agreeable manner as he can when his favorite beverage is before him i discover that i get the snaps on a monday morning if i get them at all the ma gets them on the sunday itself softly but regularly they distress no one and we all know the cause her fingers are itching for the knitting which she maynt do your protestant ignores lent as a popish device a fond thing vainly invented but spreads it instead over fiftytwo days in the year why i want to know cannot i change the subject sunday we get no post and no collection except in church unless we send down to the town for it so monday is all the more welcome but this i have been up and writing before it arrivestherefore the snaps our postman is a lovely sight i watched him walking up the drive the other morning and he seemed quite perfection for i guessed he was bringing me the thing which would make me happy all day i only hope the government pays him properly i think this is the least pleasant letter i have ever sent you shall i tell you why it was not the sermon he is quite a forgivable good man in his way but in the afternoon that same mrs p came got me in a corner and wanted to unburden herself of invective against your mother believing that i should be glad because her coldness to me has become known what mean things some people can think about one i heard nothing but i am ruffled in all my plumage and want stroking and my love to your mother please if she will have it it is only through her that i get youever your very own letter xxviii dearest here comes a letter to you from me flying in the opposite direction i wont say i am not wishing to go but oh to be a bird in two places at once give this letter then a special nestingplace because i am so much on the wing elsewhere i shut my eyes most of the time through france and opened them on a souptureen full of coffee which presented itself at the frontier and then realized that only a little way ahead lay berne with baths buns bears breakfast and other nice things beginning with b waiting to make us clean comfortable contented and other nice things beginning with c through france i loved you sleepy fashion with many dreams in between not all about you but now i am breathing thoughts of you out of a new atmospherea great gulp of you all cleanliving and highthinking between these alpine royal highnesses with snowwhite crowns to their heads and no time for a word more about anything except you you and doubleyouand trebleyou if the alphabet only had grace to contain so beautiful a symbol goodby we meet next perhaps out of lucerne if notitaly what a lot i have to go through before we meet again visibly you will find me worldworn my beloved write often letter xxix beloved you know of the method for making a cat settle down in a strange place by buttering her all over the theory being that by the time she has polished off the butter she feels herself at home my mornings work has been the buttering of the motheraunt with such things as will lucerne her the most when her instincts are appeased i am the more free to indulge my own so after breakfast we went round the cloisters very thick set with tablets and family vaults and crowded graves inclosed it proved quite the best butter to me the penance turned out interesting after a period of natural repulsion a most unpleasant addition to sepulchral sentiment is here the fashion photographs of the departed set into the stone you see an elegant and genteel marble cross there on the pedestal above the name is the photoa smug man with bourgeois whiskersa militiaman with waxed mustaches well turned upa woman well attired and conscious of it you cannot think how indecent looked the pretension of such types to the dignity of death and immortality but just one or two faces stood the test and were justified a young man oppressed with the burden of youth a sweet toothless grandmother in a bonnet wearing old age like a flower a woman not beautiful but for her neck which carried indignation her face had a thwarted look dead and rotten one did not say of these in disgust and involuntarily as one did of the others and yet i dont suppose the eye picks out the faces that kindled most kindness round them when living or that one can see well at all where one sees without sympathy i think the motheraunts face would not look dear to most people as it does to meyet my sight of her is the truer only i would not put it up on a tombstone in order that it might look nothing to those that pass by i wrote this much and then leaving the ma to glory in her innumerable correspondence arthur and i went off to the lake where we have been for about seven hours on it i found it become infinitely more beautiful for everything was mystified by a lovely bloomy haze out of which the white peaks floated like dreams and the mountains change and change and seem not all the same as going when returning dont ask me to write landscape to you one breathes it in and it is there ever after but remains unset to words the ts whittle themselves out of our company just to the right amount come back at the right time which is more than arthur and i are likely to do when our legs get on the spin and are duly welcome with a diversity of doings to talk about their tastes are more the mas and their activities about halfway between hers and ours so we make rather a fortunate quintette the m trio join us the day after tomorrow when the majority of us will head away at once to florence arthur growls and threatens he means to be left behind for a week and it suits the funny little jealousy of the ma well enough to see us parted for a time quite apart from the fact that i shall then be more dependent on her company she will then glory in overworking herselfsay it is me and i shall feel a fiend no letter at all dearest this merely talkytalkyyours without words letter xxx dearest i cannot say i have seen pisa for the majority had their way and we simply skipped into it got ourselves bumped down at the duomo and campo santo for two hours fell exhausted to bed and skipped out again by the first train next morning over the walls of the campo santo are some divine crumbs of benozzo gozzoli dont expect me ever to spell the names of dead painters correctly it is a politeness one owes to the living but the famous dead are exalted by being spelt phonetically as the heart dictates and become all the better company for that greatest of unspelled and spreadabout namesshakspere shakspeare shakespearehis mark not himself such a long parenthesis requires steppingstones to carry you over it crumbs was the last wasnt a whole loaf of bread a steppingstone in one of andersens fairytales but indeed i hadnt time to digest them properly let me come back to them before i die and bury me in that inclosure if you love me as much then as i think you do now the baptistry has a roof of echoes that is wonderfula mirror of sound hung over the head of an official who opens his mouth for centimes to drop there you sing notes up into it or rather you dont for that is his perquisite and they fly circling and flock and become a single chord stretching two octaves till you feel that you are living inside what in the days of our youth would have been called the sound of a grand amen the cathedral has fine points or more than pointsaspects but the italian version of gothic with its bands of flat marbles instead of moldings was a shock to me at first i only begin to understand it now that i have seen the outside of the duomo at florence curiously enough it doesnt strike me as in the least christian only civic and splendid reminding me of what ruskin says about church architecture being really a dependant on the feudal or domestic the strozzi palace is a beautiful piece of streetarchitecture its effect is of an iron hand which gives you a buffet in the face when you look up and wonderhow shall i climb in i will tell you more about insides when i write next i fear my last letter to you from lucerne may either have strayed or not even have begun straying for in the hurry of coming away i left it addressed i think but unstamped and i am not sure that that particular hotel will be christian enough to spare the postage out of the bill which had a galaxy of small extras running into centimes and suggesting a redtape rectitude that would not show blind twentyfivecentime gratitude to the backs of departed guests so be patient and forgiving if i seem to have written little i found two of yours waiting for me and cannot choose between them which i find most dear i will say for a fancy the shorter that you may ever be encouraged to write your shortest rather than none at all one word from you gives me almost as much pleasure as twenty for it contains all your sincerity and truth and what more do i want yon bless me quite how many perfectly happy days i owe to you and seldom dare dream that i have made any beginning of a return if i could take one unhappy day out of your life dearest the secret would be mine and no such thing should be left in it be happy beloved oh happy happywith me for a partial reasonthat is what i wish letter xxxi dearest the italian papermoney paralyzes my brain i cannot calculate in it and were i left to myself an unscrupulous shopman could empty me of pounds without my becoming conscious of it till i beheld vacuum but the ts have been wonderful caretakers to me and tomorrow arthur rejoins us so that i shall be able to resume my full activities under his safeconduct the ways of the italian cabbies and porters fill me with terror for the time when i may have to fall alive and unassisted into their hands they have neither conscience nor gratitude and regard thievish demands when satisfied merely as steppingstones to higher things many of the outsides of florence i seemed to know by heartthe palazzo vecchio for instance but close by it cellinis two statues the judith and the perseus brought my heart up to my mouth unexpectedly the perseus is so out of proportion as to be ludicrous from one point of view but another is magnificent enough to make me forgive the scamp his autobiography from now to the day of judgment when we shall all begin forgiving each other in great haste i suppose for fear of the devil taking the hindmost and i registered a vow on the spot to that effectso no more of him here henceforth but good there is not so much color about as i had expected and austerity rather than richness is the note of most of the exteriors i have not been allowed into the uffizi yet so today consoled myself with the pitti titians duke of norfolk is there and i loved him seeing a certain likeness there to somebody whom ilike a photo of him will be coming to you also there is a very fine lelyvandyck of charles i and henrietta maria a quite moral painting making a triumphant assertion of that martyrs bad character i imagine he got into heaven through having his head cut off and cast from him otherwise all of him would have perished along with his mouth somewhere too high up was hanging a ravishing botticellia madonna and child bending over like a windblown tree to be kissed by st johna composition that takes you up in its arms and rocks you as you look at it andrea del sarto is to me only a big mediocrity there is nothing here to touch his chortling childchrist in our national gallery at pisa i slept in a mosquitonet and felt like a bride at the altar under a tulle veil which was too large for her here for lack of that luxury being assured that there were no mosquitoes to be had i have been sadly ravaged the creatures pick out all foreigners i think and only when they have exhausted the supply do they pass on to the natives mrs t left one foot unveiled when in pisa and only this morning did the irritation in the part bitten begin to come out i can now ask for a bath in italian and order the necessary things for myself in the hotel also say come in and thank you but just the few days of that very german table dhote at lucerne where i talked gladly to polish myself up have given my tongue a hybrid way of talking without thinking and i say ja ja and nein and der die das as often as not before such italian nouns as i have yet captured to fall upon a chambermaid who knows french is like coming upon my native tongue suddenly give me good news of your foot and all that is above it i am so doubtful of its being really strong yet and its willing spirits will overcome it some day and do it an injury and hurt my feelings dreadfully at the same time walk only on one leg whenever you think of me i tell you truly i am wonderfully little lonely and yet my thoughts are constantly away with you wishing wishingwhat no word on paper can ever carry to you it shall be at our next meetingall yours letter xxxii my dearest florence is still eating up all my time and energies i promised you there should be austerity and selfdenial in the matter of letterwriting and i know you are unselfish enough to expect even less than i send you girls in the street address compliments to arthurs complexion beautiful brown boy they call him and he simmers over with vanity and wishes he could show them his boating arms brown up to the shoulder as well have you noticed that combination in some of the dearest specimens of young english manhoodgreat physical vanity and great mental modesty and each as transparently sincere as the other the bargello is an ideal museum for the storage of the best things out of the middle ages it opens out of splendid courtyards and staircases and ranges through rooms which have quite a feudal gloom about them most of these are hung with bad late tapestries too late at least for my taste so that the gloom is welcome and charming making even gobelins quite bearable i find quite a new man here to admirepollaiolo both painter and sculptor one of the school of passionate anatomists as i call them about the time of botticelli i fancy he has one bust of a young florentine which equals verocchio on the same ground and charms me even more some of his subjects are done twice over in paint and bronze but he is more really a sculptor i think and merely paints his piece into a picture from its best point of view verocchios idea of david is charming he is a saucy fellow who has gone in for it for the fun of the thingknew he could bring down a hawk with his catapult and therefore why not a goliath also if he failed he need but cut and run and everybody would laugh and call him plucky for doing even that much so he does it brings down his big game by good luck and stands posing with a sort of irresistible stateliness to suit the result he has a laugh something like little dicks only more full of bubbles and is saying to himself what a hero they all think me he is the merriest of slydog hypocrites and has thin wiry arms and a craney neck he is a bit like tom sawyer in character more ornate and dramatic than huckleberry finn but quite as much a liar given a good cause another thing that has seized me more for its idea than actual carrying out is an unnamed terracotta madonna and child he is crushing himself up against her neck openmouthed and terrified and she spreading long fingers all over his head and face my notion of it is that it is the godhead taking his first look at life from the human point of view and he realizes himself caught in his own trap discovering it to be ever so much worse than it had seemed from an outside view it is a fine modern zeitgeist piece of declamation to come out of the rather oversweet della robbia period of art there seems to have been a rage at one period for commissioning statues of david so donatello and others just turned to and did what they liked most in the way of budding youth stuck a goliaths head at its feet and called it david verocchio is the exception we are going to get outside florence for a week or ten days it is too hot to be borne at night after a day of tiring activity so we go to the ds villa which they offered us in their absence it lies about four miles out and is on much higher ground address only your very immediately next letter there or it may miss me there are hills out there with vineyards among them which draw me into wishing to be away from towns altogether much as i love what is to be found in this one i think heaven meant me to be truly rural which all falls in dearest with what i mean to be beloved how little i sometimes can say to you sometimes my heart can put only silence into the end of a letter and with that i let this one goyours and so lovingly letter xxxiii beloved i had your last letter on friday all your letters have come in their right numbers i have lost count of mine but i think seven and two postcards is the total which is the same as the numbers of clean and unclean beasts proportionately represented in the ark up here we are out of the deadliness of the heat and are thankful for it vineyards and olives brush the eyes between the hard upright bars of the cypresses and florence below is like a hot bath which we dip into and come out again at the riccardi chapel i found benozzo gozzoli not in crumbs but perfectly preserved a procession of early florentine youths turning into angels when they get to the bay of the window where the altar once stood the more i see of them the greater these early men seem to me i shall be afraid to go to venice soon titian will only half satisfy me and tintoretto i know will be actively annoying i shall stay in my gondola as your american lady did on her donkey after riding twenty miles to visit the ruins ofcarnac was it not it is well to have the courage of ones likings and dislikings that is the only true culture the state obtained by use of a coulter or cutteri cut many things severely which no doubt are good for other people botticelli i was shy of because of the craze about him among people who know nothing he is far more wonderful than i had hoped both at the uffizi and the academia but he is quite pagan i dont know why i say but he is quite typical of the worlds arttraining christianity may get hold of the names and dictate the subjects but the artistbreed carries a fairly level head through it all and like paters mona lisa draws christianity and paganism into one at least wherever it reaches perfect expression it has done so some of the distinctly primitives are different their works inclose a charm which is not artistic fra angelico after being a great disappointment to me in some of his large set pictures in the academia and elsewhere shows himself lovely in fresco though i think the crumb element helps him his great crucifixion is big altogether and has so permanent a force in its aloofness from mere drama and mere life in san marco the cells of the monks are quite charming a row of little square bandboxes under a broad raftered corridor and in every cell is a beautiful little fresco for the monks to live up to but they no longer live there now all that part of san marco has become a peepshow i liked being in savonarolas room and was more susceptible to the remains of his presence than i have been to michel angelo or anyone elses michel angelo i feel most when he has left a thing unfinished then one can put ones finger into the print of the chisel and believe anything of the beauty that might have come out of the great stone chrysalis lying cased and rough waiting to be raised up to life yesterday arthur and i walked from here to fiesole which we had neglected while in florencesix miles going and more like twelve coming back all because of arthurs absurd crosscountry instinct which after hours of riverbends bare mountain tracks and tottering precipices brought us out again half a mile nearer florence than when we started at fiesole is the only church about here whose interior architecture i have greatly admired austere but at the same time graciouslike a madonna of the best period of painting we also went to look at the roman baths and theater the theater is charming enough because it is still there but for the bathsoblongs of stone dont interest me just because they are old all stone is old and these didnt even hold water to give one the real look of the thing too tired and even more too lazy to write other things except love most dear beloved letter xxxiv dearest we were to have gone down with the rest into florence yesterday but soft miles of italy gleamed too invitingly away on our right and i saw arthurs eyes hungry with the same faraway wish so i said prato and he ran up to the fattores and secured a wondrous shandrydan with just space enough between its horns to toss the two of us in the direction where we would go its gaunt framework was painted of a bright red and our feet had only netting to rest on so constructed the creature was most vital and light of limb taking every rut on the road with flealike agility oh but it was worth it we had a drive of fourteen miles through hills and villages and castellated villas with gardens shut in by formidably high wallsalways a charm a garden should always have something of the jealous seclusion of a harem i am getting italian landscape into my system and enjoy it more and more prato is a little cathedral town very like the narrow and tumbledown parts of florence only more so the streets were a seething caldron of cattlemarket when we entered which made us feel like a teacup in a bullring or is it thunderstorm as we drove through needleseye ways bristling with agitated horns the cathedral is little and good damaged of course wherever the last three centuries have laid hands on it at the corner of the west front is an outdoor pulpit beautifully put on with a mushroom hood over its head the main lines of the interior are finely severe either quite round or quite flat and proportions good always an upholstered priest coming out to say mass is generally a sickening sight so wicked and ugly in look and costume the bestbehaved people are the lowdown beggars who are most decoratively devotional we tried to model our exit on a brigandbeggar who came in to ask permission to murder one of his enemies he got his request granted at one of the sidealtars some strictly local madonna i imagine and his gratitude as he departed was quite touching having studiously copied his exit we want to know whom we shall murder to pay ourselves for our trouble it amuses me to have my share of driving over these free and easy and very narrow highroads but a has to do the collisionshouting and the cries of viathe horse only smiles when he hears me do it also did i tell you that on saturday we two walked from here over to fiesolesix miles there and ten back for whybecause we chose to go what arthur calls a beeline across country having thought we had sighted a route from the top of fiesole but in the valley we lost it and after breaking our necks over precipices and our hearts down culdesacs that led nowhere and losing all the ways that were pointed out to us for lack of a knowledge of the language we came out again into view of florence about half a mile nearer than when we started and proportionately far away from home when he had got me thoroughly footsore arthur remarked complacently the right way to see a country is to lose yourself in it i didnt feel the truth of it then but applied to other things i perceive its wisdom dear heart where i have lost myself what in all the world do i know so well as you your most lost and loving letter xxxv beloved rain swooped down on us from on high during the night and the country is cut into islands the river from a rocky wriggling stream has risen into a tawny opaque torrent that roars with a voice a mile long and is become quite unfordable the little millstream just below has broken its banks and poured itself away over the lower vineyards into the river a lot of the vines look sadly upset generally unhinged and unstrung yet i am told the damage is really small i hope so for i enjoyed a real lashout of weather after the changelessness of the long heat i have been down in florence beginning to make my farewells to the many things i have seen too little of we start away for venice about the end of the week at the uffizi i seem to have found out all my future favorites the first day and very little new has come to me but most of them go on growing the raphael lady is quite wonderful i think she was in love with him and her soul went into the painting though he himself did not care for her and she looks at you and says see a miracle he was able to paint this and never knew that i loved him it is wonderful that but i suppose it can be donea soul pass into a work and haunt it without its creator knowing anything about how it came there always when i come across anything like that which has something inner and rather mysterious i tremble and want to get back to you you are the touchstone by which i must test everything that is a little new and unfamiliar from now onwards dearest you must expect only cards for a time it is not settled yet whether we stop at padua on our way in or our way out i am clamoring for verona also but that will be off our route so arthur and i may go there alone for a couple of greedy days which i fear will only leave me dissatisfied and wishing i had had patience to depend on coming againperhaps with you uncle n has written of your numerous visits to him and i understand you have been very good in his direction he does not speak of loneliness and with anna and her brood next week or now he will be as happy as his temperament allows him to be when he has nothing to worry over i am proud to say i have gone brown without freckles and are you really as cheerful as you write yourself to be dearest and best when is your holiday to begin and is it to be with me does anywhere on earth hold that happiness for us both in the near future i kiss you well beloved letter xxxvi dearest venice is round me as i write well i will not waste my baedeker knowledge on youyou too can get a copy and it is not the panoramic view of things you will be wanting from me it is my own particular venice i am to find out and send you so first of all from the heart of it i send you mine when i have kissed you i will go on my eyes have been seeing so much that is new i shall want a fresh vocabulary for it all but mainly i want to say let us be here again together quickly before we lose any more of our youth or our twohanded hold on life i get short of breath thinking of it so let it be here beloved that some of our soontobe happiness opens and shuts its eyes for truly venice is a sleepy place i am wanting and taking nine hours sleep after all i do outside coming over the flats from padua she looked something like a manufacturing town at its ablutionsa smoky chimney well to the fore but get near to her and you find her standing on turquoise her feet set about with jaspers and with one of her eyes she ravishes you and all her campanile are like the thin flames of souls mounting up to god that is from without within she becomes too sensuous and civic in her splendor to let me think much of souls rest and be indolent is the motto for the life she teaches the architecture is the song of the lotoseater built into stonewere i in a more florid mood i would have said swansong for the whole stands finished with nothing more to be added it has sung itself out and if there is a moral to it all no doubt it is in ruskin and i dont wont to read it just now what i want is you close at hand looking up at all this beauty and smiling when i smile which is your way as if you had no opinions of your own about anything in which you are not a professor so you will write and agree that i am to have the pleasure of this return to look forward to if i know that i shall be so much more reconciled to all the joy of the things i am seeing now for the first time and shall see so much better the second beloved when your eyes are here helping me here is love dearest help yourself to just as much as you wish for though all that i send is good for you no letter from you since florence but i am neither sad nor anxious only all the more your loving letter xxxvii beloved the weather is as gray as england today and much rainier to feel it on my cheeks and be back north with that and warmer things i would go out in it in the face of protests and had to go alonenot arthur even being in the mood just then for a patriotic quest of the uncomfortable i had myself oared into the lagoons across a racing current and a driving headwind which made my gondolier bend like a distressed poplar over his oar patience on a monument smiling at backsheeshall comes to him who knows of course for comfort and pleasure and everything but economy we have picked up a gondolier to pet we making much of him and he much out of us he takes arthur to a place where he can batheto use his own expressioncleanly that is to say unconventionally and this appropriately enough is on the borders of a land called the garden of eden being named so after its owners hecharon i call himis large and of ruddy countenance and talks english in blinkersthat is to say gondola englishout of which he could not find words to summon me a cab even if it were not opposed to his interests still there are no cabs to be called in venice and he is teaching us that the shortest way is always by water if arthur is not punctually in his gondola by am i hear a call for the signore inglese go up to his window and it is hungry charon waiting to ferry him yesterday your friend mr c called and took me over to murano in a beautiful pairoared boat that simply flew there i saw a wonderful apse filled with mosaic of dull gold wherein is set a blueblack figure of the madonna ten heads high and ten centuries old which almost made me become a mariolatrist on the spot she stands leaning up the bend with two pale hands lifted in ghostly blessing underfoot the floor is all mosaic mountainous with age and earthquakes the architecture classic in the grip of byzantine christianity which is like the spirit of god moving on the face of the waters or ezekiel prophesying to the dry bones the colleoni is quite as much more beautiful in fact and seen fullsize as i had hoped from all smaller reproductions a fine equestrian figure always strikes one as enthroned and not merely riding if i cant get that i consider a centaur the nobler creature with its human body set down into the socket of the brute and all firea candle burning at both ends which in a way is what the centaur means i imagine bellini goes on being wonderful and for me beats raphaels blenheim madonna period on its own ground i hear now that the raphael lady i raved over in florence is no raphael at allwhich accounts for it being so beautiful and interestingto me i hasten to add raphaels studied calmness his soul of invisible soap and imperceptible water may charm some me it only chills or leaves unmoved is this more about art than you care to hear i have nothing to say about myself except that i am as happy as a cutinhalf thing can be is it any use sending kind messages to your mother if so my heart is full of them bless you dearest and goodnight letter xxxviii dearest st marks inside is entirely different from anything i had imagined i had expected a grove of pillars instead of these wonderful breadths of wall and the marble overlay i had not understood at all till i saw it my admiration mounts every time i enter it has a different gloom from any i have ever been in more joyous and satisfying not in the least moody as our own gothic seems sometimes to be and saints instead of devils look at you solemneyed from every corner of shade a heavy rain turns the piazza into a lake this morning arthur had to carry me across other foolish englishwomen were shocked at such means and paddled their own leaky canoes or stood on the brink and looked miserable the effect of rainpool reflections on the inside of st marks is noticeable causing it to bloom unexpectedly into fresh subtleties and glories the gold takes so sympathetically to any least tint of color that is in the air and counts up the altar candles even unto its furthest recesses and cupolas i think before i leave venice i shall find about ten tintorettos which i really like best of all is that bacchus and ariadne in the ducal palace of which you gave me the engraving his marriage of st catherine which is there also has all veroneses charm of color and what i call his breeding and in the ceiling of the council chamber is one splendid figure of a seayouth striding a dolphin last evening we climbed the san giorgio campanile for a sunset view of venice it is a much better point of view than the st marks one and we were lucky in our sunset venice again looked like a beautified factory town blue and blue with smoke and evening mists down below in the church i met a delightful capuchin priest who could talk french and a poor very young laybrother who had the holy custody of the eyes heavily upon his conscience when i spoke to him i was so sorry for him the motheraunt is ill in bed but as she is at the present moment receiving three visitors you will understand about how ill the fact is she is worn to death with sightseeing i cant stop her while she is on her legs it is her duty and she will the consequence is i get rushed through things i want to let soak into me and have to go again my only way of getting her to rest has been by deserting her and then i come back and receive reproaches with a meek countenance mr c has been good to us and cordial and brings his gondola often to our service a gondola and pair has quite a different motion from a oneoared gondola it is like riding a seahorse instead of a seacamel almost exciting only it is so soft in its prancings he took a and myself into the procession which welcomed the crowned heads last wednesday the hurlyburly of it was splendid we tore down the grand canal from end to end almost cheek by jowl with the royalties the ma was quite jubilant when she heard we had had such good places hundreds of gondolas swarmed round many of them in the old carpaccio rigouts very gorgeous though a little tawdry when taken out of the canvas hut the rush and the collisions and the sound of many waters walloping under the bellies of the gondolas and the blows of fighting oarsregular underwater wrestling matchesmade it as vivid and amusing as a prolonged oxford and cambridge boatrace in fancy costume our gondoliers streamed with the exertion and looked like men fighting a real battle and yet enjoyed it thoroughly violent altercations with policeboats dont ruffle them at all at one moment it looks daggers drawn at the next it is shrugs and smiles often from not knowing enough of italian and italian ways i get hot all over when an ordinary discussion is going on thinking that blows are about to be exchanged the motheraunt had hung a wonderful satin skirt out of window for decoration and when she leaned over it in a bodice of the same color it looked as if she were sitting with her legs out as well i suppose it was this peculiar effect that when the king and queen came by earlier in the morning won for her a special bow and smile i must hurry or i shall miss the post that i wish to catch there seems little chance now of my getting you in venice but elsewhere perhaps you will drop to me out of the clouds your own and most loving letter xxxix my own own beloved say that my being away does not seem too long i have not had a letter yet and that makes me somehow not anxious but compunctious only writing to you of all i do helps to keep me in good conscience not the other foot gone to the menders i hope with the same obstructive accompaniments as went to the settingup again of the last if i dont hear soon you will have me dancing on wires which cost as much by the word as a gondola by the hour yesterday we went to see carpaccio at his best in san giorgio di schiavone two are st george pictures three st jeromes and two of some other saint unknown to me the st jerome series is really a homily on the love and pathos of animals first is st jerome in his study with a sort of unclipped white poodle in the pictorial place of honor all alone on a floor beautifully swept and garnished looking up wistfully to his master busy at writing a benjy saying come and take me for a walk theres a good saint scattered among the adornments of the room are small bronzes of horses and i think birds so of course these being his tastes when st jerome goes into the wilderness a lion takes to him and accompanies him when he pays a call on the monks in a neighboring monastery thereupon holy men of little faith the entire fraternity take to their heels and rush upstairs the hindermost clinging to the skirts of the formermost to be hauled the quicker out of harms way and all the while the lion stands incorrectly offering the left paw and jerome with shrugs tries to explain that even the best butter wouldnt melt in his dear lions mouth after that comes the tragedy st jerome lies dying in excessive odor of sanctity and all the monks crowd round him with prayers and viaticums and the ordinary stuffy pieties of a happy death while jerome wonders feebly what it is he misses in all this todo for which he cares so little and there elbowed far out into the cold the lion lies and lifts his poor head and howls because he knows his master is being taken from him quite near to him fastened to a tree a queer nondescript crocodileshaped dog runs out the length of its tether to comfort the disconsolate beast but la bete humaine has got the whiphand of the situation in another picture is a parrot that has just mimicked a dog or called carlo and then laughed the dog turns his head away with a sleek sheepish shy look exactly as a sensitive dog does when you make fun of him these are perhaps mere undercurrents of pictures which are quite glorious in color and design but they help me to love carpaccio to distraction and when the others lose me they hunt through all the carpaccios in venice till they find me love me a little more if possible while i am so long absent from you what i do and what i think go so much together now that you will take what i write as the most of me that it is possible to cram in coming back to you to share everything under such an italian sky as today how i would like to see your face here dearest among these palaces you would be in your peerage for i think you have some southern blood in you curious that with all my fairness somebody said to me today but you are not quite english are you and i swore by the nine gods of my ancestry that i was nothing else but the look is in us my father had a foreign air but made up for it by so violent a patriotism that uncle n used to call him john bull let loose my love to england is it showing much autumn yet my eyes long for green fields again since i have been in italy i had not seen one until the other day from the top of st giorgio maggiore where one lies in hiding under the monastery walls all that i see now quickens me to fresh thoughts of you yet do not expect me to come back wiser my last effort at wisdom was to fall in love with you and there i stopped for good and all there i am still everything included what do you want more my letter and my heart both threaten to be overweight so no more of them this time most dearly do i love you letter xl beloved if two days slip by i dont know where i am when i come to write things get so crowded in such a short space of time where i left off i know not i will begin where i am most awakeyour letter which i have just received that is well dearest that is well indeed a truce till february and since the struggle then must needs be a sharp onewith only one end as we knowdo not vex her now by any overt signs of preparation as if you assumed already that her final arguments were to be as so much chaff before the wind you do not tell me what she argues and i do not ask she does not say i shall not love you enough to answer businesslike to your questions first with your forgiveness we stay here till the th and get back to england with the last of the month does that seem a very cruel faroff date others have the wish to stay even longer and it would be no fairness to hurry them beyond a certain degree of reasonableness with my particular reason for impatience seeing moreover that in your love i have every help for remaining patient it is too much to hope i suppose that the truce sets you free now and that you could meet us here after all and prolong our stay indefinitely i know one besides myself who would be glad and would welcome an outside excuse dearly for oh the funniness of near and dear things arthurs heart is laid up with a small love affair and it is the comicalest of internal maladies he is screwing up courage to tell me all about it and i write in haste before my mouth is sealed by his confidences i fancy i know the party an energetic little mortal whom we met at lucerne where arthur lingered while we came on to florence she talked vaguely of being in venice some time this autumn and the vagueness continues arthur in consequence roams round disconsolately with no interest but in hotel books and for fear lest we should gird up his loins and drag him away with us out of paradisal possibilities he is forever praising venice as a restingplace and saying he wants to be nowhere else the bathing just keeps him alive but when put to it to explain what charms him since pictures do not and architecture only slightly he says in exemplary brotherly fashion that he likes to see me completing my education and enthusiasmsand does not realize with how foreign an air that explanation sits upon his shoulders i saw today a remnant of your patron saint and for your sake transferred a kiss to it italian fashion with my thumb and the sign of the cross i hope it will do you good also i have been up among the galleries of st marks and about the roof and the west front where somebody or another painted his picture of the bronze horses the pigeons get to recognize people personally and grow more intimate every time we come i even conceive they make favorites for i had three pecking food out of my mouth today and refusing to take it in any other fashion and they coo and say thank you before and after every seed they take or spill they are quite the pleasantest of all the italian beggarsand the cleanest your friend pressed us in to tea yesterday i think less for the sake of giving us tea than that we should see his palace or rather his first floor in which alone he seems to lose himself i have no idea for measurements but i imagine his big sala is about eighty feet long and perhaps twentyfive feet across with a flatbeamed roof windows at each end and portieres along the walls of old blue venetian linen a place in which it seems one could only live and think nobly his face seems to respond to its teachings what more might not an environment like that bring out in you come and let me see i have hopes springing as i think of things that you may be coming after all and that that is what lay concealed under the gayety of your last paragraph then i am more blessed even than i knew what you are coming so well i do love you my beloved letter xli dearest this letter will travel with me we leave today our movements are to be too restless and uncomfortable for the next few days for me to have a chance of quiet seeing or quiet writing anywhere at riva we shall rest i hope yesterday a storm began coming over towards evening and i thought to myself that if it passed in time there should be a splendid sunset of smolder and glitter to be seen from the campanile and perhaps by good chance a rainbow i went alone when i got to the top the rain was pelting hard so there i stayed happily weatherbound for an hour looking over venice silvered with slants of rain and watching umbrellas scuttering below with toes beneath them the golden smolder was very slow in coming it lay over the mainland and came creeping along the railway track then came the glitter and the sun and i turned round and found my rainbow but it wasnt a bow it was a circle the campanile stood up as it were a spoke in the middlethe lower curve of the rainbow lay on the ground of the piazzetta cut off sharp by the shadow of the campanile it was worth waiting an hour to see the islands shone mellow and bright in the clearance with the storm going off black behind them goodby venice verona began by seeming dull to me but it improves and unfolds beautiful corners of itself to be looked at only i am given so little time the tombs of the della scalas and the renaissance facade of the consiglio are what chiefly delight me i had some quiet hours in the museo where i fell in love with a little picture by an unknown painter of orpheus charming the beasts in a wandering green landscape with a dance of fauns in the distance and here and there eurydice runningand orpheus in hades and the thracian women killing him and a crocodile fishing out his head and mermaids and ducks sitting above their reflections reflecting also there is one beautiful tobias and the angel there by a painter whose name i most ungratefully forget i saw a man yesterday carrying fishes in the market each strung through the gills on a twig of myrtle that is how tobias ought to carry his fish when a native custom suggests old paintings how charming it always is riva we have just got here from verona in the matter of the garden at least it is a paradise of a place a great sill of honeysuckle leans out from my window beyond is a court grown round with creepers and beyond that the gardensuch a garden the first thing one sees is an arcade of vines upon stone pillars between which peep stacks of roses going off a little from their glory now and right away stretches an alley of green that shows at the end a furlong off the blue glitter of water it is a beautifully wild garden grass and vegetables and trees and roses all grow in a jungle together there are little groves of bamboo and chestnut and willow and a runnel of water is somewherei can hear it it suggests rest which i want and so for all its difference suggests you whom also i wantmore i own it now than i have said but that went without saying beloved as it always must if it is to be the truth and nothing short of the truth while this has been waiting to go your letter has been put into my hands i am too happy to say words about it and can afford now to let this go as it is the little time of waiting for you will be perfect happiness now and your coming seems to color all that is behind as well i have had a good time indeed and was only wearying with the plethora of my enjoyment but the better time has been kept till now we shall be together day after day and all day long for at least a month i hope a joy that has never happened to us yet never mind about the lost letter now dearest dearest venice was a little empty just one week because of it i still hope it will come but what matteri know you will all my heart waits for youyour most glad and most loving letter xlii dearest i saw an old woman riding a horse astride and i was convinced on the spot that this is the rightest way of riding and that the sidesaddle was a foolish and affected invention the horse was fine and so was the young man leading it the old woman was upright and stately with a wide hat and full petticoats like a maximilian soldier this was at bozen where we stayed for two nights and from which i have brought a cold with me it seems such an english thing to have that i feel quite at home in the discomfort of it it had been such wonderful weather that we were sitting out of doors every evening up to pm without wraps and on our heads only our widows caps the ma persists in a style which suggests that uncle n has gone to a better world mine was too flimsy a work of fiction and a day before i had been for a climb and got wet through so a chill laid its benediction on my head and here i amnot seriously incommoded by the malady but by the remedy which is the ma full of kind quackings and fierce tyranny if i do but put my head out of window to admire the view whose best is a little round the corner i had no idea innsbruck was so high up among the mountains snows are on the peaks all around behind the housetops so close and near lies a quarter circle of white crests you are told that in winter creatures come down and look in at the windows sometimes they are called wolves sometimes bearsany way the feeling is mediaeval hereabouts the wayside shrines nearly always contain a crucifix whereas in italy that was rarethe virgin and child being the most common i remarked on this which i suppose gave rise to a subsequent observation of the mas i think the tyrolese are a good people they are not given over to mariolatry like those poor priestridden italians i think however that they merely have that fundamental grace religious simplicity worshipingjust what they can get for yesterday i saw two dear old bodies going round and telling their beads before the bronze statues of the maximilian tombking arthur charles the bold etc i suppose by mere association a statue helps them to pray the national costume does look so nice though not exactly beautiful i like the flat black hats with long streamers behind and a gold tassel and the spacious apron blue satin is a favorite style always silk or satin for sunday best one i saw of pearlwhite brocade since we came north we have had lovely weather except the one day of which i am still the filterings and morning along the brenner pass was perfect i think the mountains look most beautiful quite early at sunrise when they are all pearly and mysterious we go on to zurich on thursday and then beloved and thenso this must be my last letter since i shall have nowhere to write to with you rushing all across europe and resting nowhere because of my impatience to have you the motheraunt concedes a whole month but arthur will have to leave earlier for the beginning of term how little my two dearest men have yet seen of each other barely a week lies between us this will scarcely catch you dearest of dearests my heart waits on yours letter xliii my dearest see what an effect your gallous young hound episode has had on me i send it back to you roughly done into rhyme i dont know whether it will carry for outside your telling of it johnnie kigarrow is not a name of heroic sound what touches me as so strangely complete about it is that you should have got that impression and momentary romantic delusion as a child and now hear years after of his disappearing out of life thus fittingly and mysteriously so that his name will fix its legend to the countryside for many a long day i would like to go there some day with you and standing on twloch hill imagine all the country round as the burialplace of the strong man on whose knees my beloved used to play when a child it must have been soon after this that your brother died truly dearest from now and strangely this johnnie kigarrow will seem more to me than him touching a more heroic strain of idea and stiffening fibers in your nature that brotherhood as a rule has no bearing on a short letter today beloved because what goes with it is so long this is the first time i have come before your eyes as anything but a letterwriter and i am doubtful whether you will care to have so much all about yourself yet for that very reason think how much i loved doing it i am jealous of those days before i knew you and want to have all their wildhoney flavor for myself do remember more and tell me dearest heart it was to me you were coming through all your scampers and ramblings no wonder with that unknown good running parallel that my childhood was a happy one may long life bless you beloved inclosure my brother and i were down in wales and listened by night to the welshmans tales he was eleven and i was ten we sat on the knees of the farmers men after the whole days work was done and i was friends with the farmers son his hands were rough as his arms were strong his mouth was merry and loud for song each night when set by the inglewall he was the merriest man of them all i would catch at his beard and say all the things i had done in the day tumbled bowlders over the force swum in the river and fired the gorse half the side of the hill quoth i ah cried he and didnt you die chut said he but the squeak was narrow didnt you meet with johnnie kigarrow no said i and who will he be and what will be johnnie kigarrow to me the farmers son said under his breath johnnie kigarrow may be your death listen you here and keep you still johnnie kigarrow bides under the hill twloch barrow stands over his head he shallows the river to make his bed bowlders roll when he stirs a limb and the gorse on the hills belongs to him and if so be one fires his gorse hes out of his bed and he mounts his horse off he sets with the first long stride he is halfway over the mountain side with his second stride he has crossed the barrow and he has you fast has johnnie kigarrow half i laughed and half i feared i clutched and tugged at the strong mans beard and bragged as brave as a boy could be so but you see he didnt catch me fear caught hold of me what had i done high as the roof rose the farmers son how the sight of him froze my marrow i he cried am johnnie kigarrow well you wonder what was the end never forgethe had called me friend mighty of limb and hard and blown quickly he laughed and set me down heh said he but the squeak was narrow not to be caught by johnnie kigarrow now i hear after years gone by nobody knows how he came to die he strode out one night of storm get you to bed and keep you warm out into darkness so went he nobody knows where his bones may be only i thinkif his tongue let go truth that oncehow perhaps i know twloch river and twloch barrow do you cover my johnnie kigarrow letter xliv dearest i have been doing something so wise and foolish mentally wise i mean and physically foolish do you guessdisobeying your parting injunction and sitting up to see eclipses it was such a luxury to do as i was not told just for once to feel there was an independent me still capable of asserting itself my belief is that waking you hold me subjugated but once your godhead has put on its spiritual nightcap and begun nodding your mesmeric influence relaxes up starts resolution and independence and i breathe desolately for a time feeling myself once more a free woman twas a tremulous experience beloved but i loved it all the more for that how we love playing at grief and deaththe two things that must comebefore it is their due time i took a look at my world for three most mortal hours last night trying to see you out of it and oh how close it kept bringing me i almost heard you breathe and was forever wonderingcan we ever be nearer or love each other more than we do for that we should each want a sixth sense and a second soul and it would still be only the same spread out over larger territory i prefer to keep it nesting close in its present limitations where it feels like a growing pain children have it in their legs we in our hearts i am growing sleepy as i write and feel i am sending you a dull lettermy penalty for doing as you forbade i sat up from halfpast one to a quarter to five to see our shadow go over heaven i didnt see much the sky was too piebald but i was not disappointed as i had never watched the darkness into dawn like that before and it was interesting to hear all the persons awakingcocks at halfpast four frogs immediately after then pheasants and various others following i was cuddled close up against my window throned in a big armchair with many pillows a spiritlamp cocoa bread and butter and buns so i fared well just after the pheasants and the first querulous fidgetings of hungry blackbirds comes a soft pattering along the path below and benjy secretive and important is fussing his way to the shrubbery when instinct or real sentiment prompts him to look up at my window he gives a whimper and a wag and goes on i try to persuade myself that he didnt see me and that he does this other mornings when i am not thus perversely bolstered up in rebellion and peering through blinds at wrong hours isnt there something pathetic in the very idea that a dog may have a behindyourback attachment of that sortthat every morning he looks up at an unresponsive blank and wags and goes by i heard him very happy in the shrubs a moment after he and a pheasant i fancy disputing over a question of boundaries and he comes in for breakfast three hours later looking positively fresh and wants to know why i am yawning most mornings he brings your letter up to my room in his mouth it is old nannans joke she only sends up yours so and pretends it is benjys own clever selection i pretend that too to him and he thinks he is doing something wonderful the other morning i waswell benjy hears splashing and tires of waitingor his mouth waters an extra can of hot water happens to stand at the door and therein he deposits his treasure mine i mean and retires saying nothing the consequence is when i open three minutes after his scratch i find you all ungummed and swimming your beautiful handwriting bleared and smeared so that no eye but mine could have read it benjys shame when i showed him what he had done was wonderful how it rejoices me to write quite foolish things to youthat i can helps to explain a great deal in the upabove order of things which i never took in when i was merely young and frivolous one must have touched a grave side of life before one can take in that heaven is not opposed to laughter my eye has just caught back at what i have written and the little death runs through me just because i wrote grave side it shouldnt but loving has made me superstitious the happiness seems too great how can it go on i keep thinkingthis is not life you are too much for me my dearest oh my beloved come quickly to meet me today this morning ride over i am willing it my own dearest you must come if you dont what shall i believe that love cannot outdo space that when you are away i cannot reach you by willing but i can come to me you shall see my arms open to you as never before what is ityou must be coming i have more love in me after all than i knew ah i know i wrote grave side and all my heart is in arms against the treason with us it is not till death us do part we leap it altogether and are clasped on the other side my dear my dear i lay my head down on your heart i love you i post this to show how certain i am at twelve today i shall see you letter xlv beloved i look at this ridiculous little nib now running like a plow along the furrows what can the poor thing do bury its poor black blunt little nose in the english language in order to tell you in all sorts of roundabout ways what you know already as well as i do and yet though that is all it can do you complain of not having had a letter not had a letter beloved there are half a hundred i have not had from you do you suppose you have ever any one week in your life sent me as many as i wanted now for once i did hold off and didnt write to you because there was something in your last i couldnt give any answer to and i hoped you would come yourself before i need then i hoped silence would bring you and nownoinstead of your dear peacegiving face i get this complaint ah beloved have you in reality any complaint or sorrow that i can set at rest or has that little little silence made you anxious i do come to think so for you never flourish your words about as i do so believing that i would like to write again differently only it is truer to let what i have written stand and make amends for it in all haste i love you so infinitely well how could even a years silence give you any doubt or anxiety so long as you knew i was not ill should one not make great concessions to great grief even when it is unreasonable i cannot answer dearest i am in the dark great grief cannot be great without reasons it should give them and you should judge by themyou not i i imagine you have again been face to face with fierce unexplained opposition dearest if it would give you happiness i would say make five ten twenty years concession as you call it but the only time you ever spoke to me clearly about your mothers mind toward me you said she wanted an absolute surrender from you not covered only by her lifetime then though i pitied her i had to smile a twenty years concession even would not give rest to her perturbed spirit i pray trulyhaving so much reason for your sake to pray itgod rest her soul and give her a saner mind toward both of us why has this come about at all it is not february yet and our plans have been putting forth no buds before their time when the day comes and you have said the inevitable word i think more calm will follow than you expect you dearest i do understand and the instinct of tenderness you have toward a claim which yet fills you with the sense of its injustice i know that you can laugh at her threat to make you poor but not at hurting her affections did your asking for an answer mean that i was to write so openly bless you my own dearest letter xlvi dearest today i came upon a strange spectacle poor old nannan weeping for wounded pride in me i found her stitching at raiment of needlework that is to be mine piles of it have been through her fingers since the word first went out for her love asserts that i am to go all homemade from my old home to my new onewherever that may be and she was weeping because as i slowly got to understand from one particular quarter too little attention had been paid to methe kowtow of a ceremonious reception into my new status had not been deep enough to make amends to her heart for its partial loss of me her deferential recognition of the change which is coming is pathetic and full of etiquette it is at once so jealous and so unselfish because her sense of the proprieties will not allow her to do so much longer she comes up to my room and makes opportunity to scold me over quite slight thingsand there i am meeker under her than i would be to any relative so today i had to bear a statement of your mothers infirmities rigorously outlined in a way i could only pretend to be deaf to until she had done then i said nannan go and say your prayers and as she stuck her heels down and refused to go there i left the poor thing not to prayer i fear but to desolate weeping in which love and pride will get more firmly entangled together than ever i know when i go up to my room next i shall find fresh flowers put upon my table but the grievous old dear will be carrying a sore heart that i cannot comfort by any words i cannot convince her that i am not hiding in myself any wounds such as she feels on my behalf i write this dearest as an indirect answer to yourswhich is but nannans woe writ large if i could persuade your two dear and very different heads how very slightly wounded i am by a thing which a little waiting will bring right i could give it even less thought than i do are you keeping the truce in spirit when you disturb yourself like this trust me beloved always to be candid i will complain to you when i feel in need of comfort be comforted yourself meanwhile and dont shape ghosts of grief which never do a goosestep over me ah well well if there is a way to love you better than i do now only show it me meantime think of me as your most contented and happygoloving letter xlvii dearest i am haunted by a line of quotation and cannot think where it comes from now sets the year in roaring gray can you help me to what follows if it is a true poem it ought now to be able to sing itself to me at large from an outer world which at this moment is all gray and roaring today the year is bowing itself out tempestuously as if angry at having to go dear golden year i am sorry to see its face so changed and withering it has held so much for us both yet i am feeling vigorous and quite like spring all the seasons have their marches with buffetings and borderforays this is an autumn marchwind before long i shall be out into it and up the hill to look over at your territory and you being swept and garnished for the seven devils of winter roaring gray suggests tennyson whom i do very much associate with this sort of weather not so much because of passages in maud and in memoriam as because i once went over to swainston on a day such as this when rooks and leaves alike hung helpless in the wind and heard there the story of how tennyson coming over for his friends funeral would not go into the house but asked for one of sir johns old hats and with that on his head sat in the garden and wrote almost the best of his small lyrics nightingales warbled without within was weeping for thee the old hat was mentioned as something humorous yet an old glove is the most accepted symbol of faithful absence and why should head rank lower than hand what creatures of convention we are there is an old notion quite likely to be true that a nightcap carries in it the dreams of its first owner or that anything laid over a sleepers head will bring away the dream one of the stories which used to put a lump in my throat as a child was of an old backwoodsman who by that means found out that his dog stole hams from the storeroom the dog was given away in disgrace and came to england to die of a broken heart at the sight of a cargo of hams which at their unpacking seemed like a monstrous day of judgmentthe bones of his misdeeds rising again reclothed with flesh to reproach him with the thing he had never forgotten i wonder how long it was before i left off definitely choosing out a story for the pleasure of making myself cry when one begins to avoid that luxury of the fledgling emotions the first leaf of youth is flown today i look almost jovially at the decay of the best year i have ever lived through and am your very middleaged faithful and true letter xlviii dearest if anybody has been calling me names that are not mine they do me a fine injury and you did well to purge the text of their abuse i agree with no authority however immortal which inquires whats in a name expecting the answer to be a snap of the fingers i answer with a snap of temper that the blood boots and bones of my ancestors are in mine do you suppose i could have been the same woman had such names as amelia or bella or cinderella been clinging leechlike to my consciousness through all the years of my training why there are names i can think of which would have made me break down into sideringlets had i been forced to wear them audibly the effect is not so absolute when it is a second name that can be tucked away if unpresentable but even then it is a misfortune there is c now who wont marry i believe chiefly because of the insane annie with which she was smitten at the baptismal font by an afterthought she regards it as a taint in her constitution which orders her to a lonely life lest worse might follow and apply the consideration more publicly do you imagine the prince of wales will be the same sort of king if when he comes to the throne he calls himself king albert edward in florid continental fashion instead of edward the seventh with a right hope that an edward the eighth may follow after him to make a neckandneck race of it with the henries i dont know anything that would do more to knit up the english constitution but whenever i pass the albert memorial i tremble lest filial piety will not allow the thing to be done now of all this i had an instance in the village the day before yesterday at the corner house by the postoffice as i went by a bird opened his bill and sang a note and down down down down he went over a golden scale pitched afresh and dropped down another and then up up up over the range of both then he flung back his shaggy head and laughed in all my fathers realm there are no such bells as these it was the laughing jackass who gave you your name my godfathers and my godmothers in my baptism well his will have that to answer for however safely for the rest he may have eschewed the world the flesh and the devil poor bird to be set to sing to us under such a burdenof which unconscious failure he knows nothing here i have remembered for you a bit of a poem that took hold of me some while ago and touched on the same unkindness only here the flower is conscious of the wrong done to it and looks forward to a day of juster judgment what have i doneman came theres nothing that sticks like dirt looked at me with eyes of blame and called me squinancywort what have i done i linger i cannot say that i live in the happy lands of my birth passersby point with the finger for me the light of the sun is darkened oh what would i give to creep away and hide my shame in the earth what have i done yet there is hope i have seen many changes since i began the webfooted beasts have been dear beastsand gone being part of some wider plan perhaps in his infinite mercy god will remove this man now i am on sentiment and unjust judgments here is another instance where evidently in life i did not love well enough a character nobler than this capering and accommodating boy benjy who toadies to all my moods calling at the lower farm i missed him whom i used to nickname manger because his dogjaws always refused to smile on me his old mistress gave me a pathetic account of his last days it was the muzzling order that broke his poor old heart he took it as an accusation on a point where though of a melancholy disposition his reputation had been spotless he never lifted his head nor smiled again and not all his mistress love could explain to him that he was not in fault she wept as she told it me goodby dearest and for this letter so full of such little worth call me what names you like and i will go to jemima keziah and kerenhappuch for the patience in which they must have taken after their father when he so named them i suppose for a discipline my beloved let my heart come where it wants to be twilight has been on me today i dont know why and i have not written it off as i hoped to doall yours and nothing left letter xlix dearest i suppose your mothers continued absence and her unexplanation of her further stay must be taken for unyielding disapproval and tells us what to expect of february it is not a cordial form of truce but since it lets me see just twice as much of you as i should otherwise i will not complain so long as it does not make you unhappy you write to her often and kindly do you not well if this last letter of hers frees you sufficiently it is quite settled at this end that you are to be with us for christmasread into that the warmest corners of a heart already fully occupied i do not think of it too much till i am assured it is to be did you go over to pembury for the day your letter does not say anything but your letters have a wonderful way with them of leaving out things of outside importance i shall hear from the rattle of returning fireengines some day that hatterling has been burned down and you will arrive cool the next day and say oh yes it is so i am sure you have been right to secure this pledge of independence to yourself but it hurts me to think what a deadly offense it may be both to her tenderness for you and her pride and stern love of power to realize suddenly that hatterling does not mean to you so much as the power to be your own master and happy in your own way which is altogether opposite to her way will be so much of a blow that at first you will be able to do nothing to soften it february filldyke is likely to be true to its name this coming one in all that concerns us and our fortunes meanwhile if at pembury you brought things any nearer settlement and are not coming so soon as tomorrow let me know for some things of outside importance do affect me unfavorably while in suspense i have not your serene determination to abide the workings of kismet when once all that can be done is done the sun sets now when it does so visibly just where pembury is i take it as an omen in your diary tomorrow you may write down in the business column that you have had a business letter from me or as near to one as i can gochiefly for that it requires an answer on this matter of outside importance which otherwise you will altogether leave out but you will do better still to come my whole heart goes out to fetch you my dearest dear ever your own letter l beloved no not browning but tennyson was in my thoughts at our last ride together and i found myself shy as i have been for a long time wishing to say things i could not what has never entered your head to ask becomes difficult when i wish to get it spoken so i bring tennyson to tell you what i mean dosnt thou ear my erses legs as they canters awaaey proputty proputty proputtythats what i ears em saaey the tune of this kept me silent all the while we galloped this and pembury a name that glows to me now like the new jerusalem and do you understand beloved or must i say more my freedom has made its nest under my uncles roof but i am a quite independent person in other ways besides character well pembury was settled on your own initiative and i looked on proud and glad now i have my own little word to add merely a tail that wags and makes merry over a thing decided and done do you forgive me for this and for the greater offense of being quite shy at having to write it my aunt thanks you for the game for my part i cannot own that it will taste sweeter to me for being your own shooting and please whatever else you do big and grand and dangerous respect my superstitions and dont shoot any larks this winter in the spring i would like to think that here or there an extra lark bubbles over because i and my whims find occasional favor in your sight when i ask great favors you always grant them and so ahasuerus grant this little one to your beautifully loving give me the credit of being conscious of it beloved postscripts i never do write i am glad you noticed it if i find anything left out i start another letter this is that other letter it goes into the same envelope merely for company and signs itself yours in all state letter li dearest it was so nice and comedy to see the motheraunt this morning importantly opening a letter from you all to herself with the pleasure quite unmixed by any inclosure for me or any other letter in the house to me so far as she was aware i listened to you with new ears discovering that you write quite beautifully in the style which i never get from you dont because i admire you in your more formal form alter in your style to me i prefer you much for my own part formless and feel nearer to your heart in an unfinished sentence than in one that is perfectly balanced still i want you to know that your cordial warmed her dear old heart and makes her not think now that she has let me see too much of you she was just beginning to worry herself jealously into that belief the last two days and arthurs taking to you helped to the same end very well i seem to understand everybodys oddities nowhaving made a complete study of yours best beloved i have your little letter lying close and feel dumb when i try to answer you with your few words make me feel a small thing with all my unpenned rabble about me only you do know so very well that i love you better than i can ever write this is my first letter of the new year will our letterwriting go on all this year or will it as we dearly dream die a divine death somewhere before autumn in any case i am dearest your most happy and loving letter lii my dearest arthur and the friend went off together yesterday i am glad the latter stayed just long enough after you left for me to have leisure to find him out human here is the whole story he came and unbosomed to me three days ago and he said nothing about not telling so i tell you as water goes from a ducks back so go all things worth hearing from me to you arthur had said to him come down for a week and he had answered cant because of clothes explaining that beyond eveningdress he had only those he stood in well said arthur stand in them then you look all right the question is said his friend can i sit down however he came and was appalled to find that a man unpacked his trunk and would in all probability be carrying away his clothes each night to brush them he conscious of interiors a lining hanging in rags and even a patching somewhere had not the heart to let his one and only dayjacket go down to the servants hall to be sniffed over and so every evening when he dressed for dinner he hid his jacket laboriously under the permanent layers of a linen wardrobe which stood in his room i had all this in the frankest manner from him in the hour when he became human and my fancy fired at the vision graves with a fierce eye set on duty probing hither and thither in search after the missing coat and each night the search becoming more strenuous and the mystery more baffling than ever it had a funny likeness to the jack raikes episode in evan harrington and pleased me the more thus cropping up in real life well i demanded there and then to be shown the subject of so much romance and adventure and had the satisfaction of mending it he sitting by in his shirtsleeves the while and watching delighted and without craven apologies i notice it is not his own set he is ashamed of but only the moneyed highsniffing servantclass who have no understanding for honorable poverty and to be misunderstood pricks him in the thinnest of thin places he told me also that he brought only three white ties to last him for seven days and that graves placed them out in order of freshness and cleanliness night after nightfirst three new ones consecutively then three once worn after that on the seventh day graves resigned all further responsibility and laid out all three of them for him to choose from on the last three days of his stay he did me the honor to leave his coat out declaring that my mendings had made it presentable before an emperor out of this dates the whole of his character and i understand what i did not why arthur and he get on together now the house is empty and your comings will bei cannot say more welcome but there will be more room for them to be after my own heart heaven be over us both faithfully your most loving letter liii beloved i wish you could have been with me to look out into this garden last night when the spirit moved me there i had started for bed but became sensitive of something outside not normal whether my ear missed the usual echoes and so guessed a muffled world i do not know to open the door was like slicing into a weddingcake thenwhere was i to put a foot into that newlaid carpet of ankledeepness i hobbled out in a pair of my uncles i suppose it is because i know every tree and shrub in its true form that snow seems to pile itself nowhere as it does here it becomes a garden of entombments now and then some heap would shuffle feebly under its shroud but resurrection was not to be the lawson cypress held out great boxingglove hands for me to shake and set free and the silence was wonderful i padded about till i froze this morning i can see my big hoofmarks all over the place and benjy has been scampering about in them as if he found some flavor of me there the trees are already beginning to shake themselves loose and the spell is over but it had a wonderful hold while it lasted i take a breath back into last night and feel myself again full of a romance without words that i cannot explain if you had been there even i think i could have forgotten i had you by me the place was so weighed down with its sense of solitude it struck eleven while i was outside and in that too i could hear a muffle as if snow choked all the belfry lattices and lay even on the outer edge of the bell itself across the park there are dead boughs cracking down under the weight of snow and it would be very like you to tramp over just because the roads will be so impossible i heard yesterday a thing which made me just a little more free and easy in mind though i had nothing sensibly on my conscience such a good youth who two years ago believed i was his only possible future happiness is now quite happy with a totally different sort of person i had a little letter from him shy and stately announcing the event i thought it such a friendly act for some have never the grace to unsay their grievances however much actually blessed as a consequence of them with that off my mind i can come to you swearing that there have been no accidents on anybodys line of life through a mistake in signals or a flying in the face of them where i have had any responsibility as for you and as you know well by now my signals were ready and waiting before you sought for them oh whistle and ill come to you was their giveaway attitude i am going down to play snowballs with benjy goodby if you come you will find this letter on the hall table and me you will probably hear barking behind the rhododendronsso much your most loving letter liv beloved we have been having a great day of tidyings out rummaging through years and years of accumulationsthings quite useless but which i have not liked to throw away my soul has been getting such dusty answers to all sorts of doubtful inquiries as to where on earth this that and the other lay hidden and there were other things the memory of which had lain quite dead or slept till under the light of day they sprouted hack into life like corn from the grave of an egyptian mummy very deep in one box i found a stealthy little collection of secret playthings which it used to be my fond belief that nobody knew of but myself it may have been annas graspingness when four years of seniority gave her double my age or arthurs genial instinct for destructiveness which drove me into such deep concealment of my dearest idols but whether for those or more mystic reasons i know i had dolls which i nursed only in the strictest privacy and lavished my firmest love upon it was because of them that i bore the reproach of being but a lukewarm mother of dolls and careless of their toilets the truth being that my motherly passion expended itself in secret on certain outcasts of society whom others despised or had forgotten they on their limp and dissolute bodies wore all the finery i could find to pile on them and one shady transaction done on their behalf i remember now without pangs there was one creature of state whom an inconsiderate relative had presented to anna and myself in equal shares of course annas became more and more lionlike i had very little love for the bone of contention myself but the sense of injustice rankled in me so one day at an unclothing anna discovered that certain undergarments were gone altogether away she sat aghast questioned me and when i refused to disgorge screamed down vengeance from the authorities i was morally certain i had taken no more than my just share and resolution sat on my lips under all threats for a punishment the whole ownership of the big doll was made over to anna i was no worse off and was very contented with my obstinacy today i found the beautifully wrought bodice which i had carried beyond reach of even the supreme court of appeal clothing with ridiculous looseness a ragdoll whose head tottered on its stem like an overripe plum and whose legs had no deportment at all and am sending it off in charitable surrender to anna to be given bag and rag to whichever one of the children she likes to select also i foundwould you care to have a lock of hair taken from the head of a child then two years old which bright golden does not match what i have on now in the least i can just remember her but she is much of a stranger to both of us why i value it is that the name and date on the envelope inclosing it are in my mothers handwriting and i suppose she loved very much the curly treasure she then put away some of the other things quite funny i will show you the next time you come over how i wish that vanished mite had mixed some of her playhours with yoursyou only six miles away all the time had one but knownnow grown very old and loving always your own letter lv beloved i am getting quite out of letterwriting and it is your doing not mine no sooner do i get a line from you than you rush over in person and take the answer to it out of my mouth i have had six from you in the last week and believe i have only exchanged you one all the rest have been nipped in the bud by your arrivals my pen turns up a cross nose whenever it hears you coming now and declares life so dull as not to be worth living poor dinky little othello it shall have its occupation again today and say just what it likes it likes you while you keep away so thats said when i make it write come it kicks and tries to say dont for it is an industrious minion loves to have work to do and never complains of overhours it is a sentimental fact that i keep all its usedup brethren in an inclosure together and throw none of them away if once they have ridden over paper to you i turn them to grass in their old age i let this out because i think it is time you had another laugh at me laugh dearest and tell me that you have done so if you want to make me a little more happy than i have been this last day or two there has been too much thinking in the heads of both of us be emptyheaded for once when you write next whether you write little or much i am sure always of your full heart but i cannot trust your brain to the same pressure it is such a martha to headaches and careful about so many things and you dont bring it here to be soothed as often as you shouldnot at its most needy moments i mean have you made the announcement or does it not go till today i am not sorry since the move comes from her that we have not to wait now till february you will feel better when the storm is up than when it is only looming this is the headachy period well say well with me dearest it is going to be well waiting has not suited usnot any of us i think your mother is one in a thousand i say that and mean itworth conquering as all good things are i would not wish great fortune to come by too primrosy a way canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook even so for size is the share of the world which we lay claim to and for that we must be toilers of the deepalways beloved your truest and most loving letter lvi my own own love you have given me a spring day before the buds begin the weather i have been longing for i had been quite sad at heart these cold wet days really downa treasonable sadness with you still anywhere in the world though where in the world have you been spring seemed such a long way off over the bend of it with you unable to come and it seems now another letter of yours has got lost write it again dearestall that was in it with any blots that happened to comethere was a dear smudge in todays with the whirlpool mark of your thumb quite clear on itdelicious to rest my face against and feel you there and so back to my spring weather all in a moment you gave me a whole week of the weather i had longed after for you say the sun has been shining on you and i would rather have it there than here if it refuses to be in two places at once also my letters have pleased you when they do i feel such a proud mother to them here they fly quick out of the nest but i think sometimes they must come to you brokenwinged with so much meant and all so badly put how can we ever with our poor handful of senses contrive to express ourselves perfectly perhapsi dont knowdearest i love you i kiss you a hundred times to the minute if everything in the world were dark round us could not kisses tell us quite well all that we wish to know of each otherme that you were true and brave and so beautiful that a woman must be afraid looking at youand you that i was just my very selfloving andno just loving i have no room for anything more you have swallowed up all my moral qualities i have none left i am a beggar where it is so sweet to beggive me back crumbs of myself i am so hungry i cannot show it only by kissing you a hundred times dear share of the world what a wonderful large helping of it you are to me i alter portias complaint and swear that my little body is bursting with this great world and now it is written and i look at it it seems a budge and toddy sort of complaint i do thank heaven that the godhead who rules in it for us does not forbid the recognition of the ludicrous c was telling me how long ago in her own dull protestant household she heard a riddle propounded by some indiscreet soul who did not understand the prudish piety which reigned there and saw such shocked eyes opening all round on the sound of it what is it was asked that a common man can see every day but that god never sees his equal is the correct answer but even so demure and proper a support to thistly theology was to the ears that heard it as the hand of uzzah stretched out intrusively and deserving to be smitten as for c a twinkle of wickedness seized her she hazarded a joke to be the true answer and was ordered into banishment by the head of that godfearing household for having so successfully diagnosed the family skeleton as for skeletons why your letter makes me so happy is that the one which has been rubbing its ribs against you for so long seems to have given itself a day off or crumbled to dissolution and you are yourself again as you have not been for many a long day i suppose there has been thunder and the air is cleared and i am not to know any of that side of your discomforts still i do know you have been writing your letters with pressed lips for a month past and i have been a mere toything and no helpmate to you at all at all oh why will she not love me i know i am lovable except to a very hard heart and hers is not it is only like yours reserved in its expression it is strange what pain her prejudice has been able to drop into my cup of happiness and into yours dearest i fear even more oh i love you i love you i am crying with it having no words to declare to you what i feel my tears have wings in them first semidetached then detached see dearest there is a rainstain to make this letter fruitful of meaning it is sheer conventionand we creatures of habitthat tears dont come kindly and easily to express where laughter leaves off and a something better begins which is all very ungrammatical and entirely me as i am when i get off my hinges too suddenly amen amen when we are both a hundred we shall remember all this very peaceably and the sanguine flower will not look back at us less beautifully because in just one spot it was inscribed with woe and if we with all our aids cannot have patience where in this midgebitten world is that virtue to find a standing i kiss youhow as if it were for the first or the last time no but for all time beloved every time i see you or think of you sums up my world love me a little too and i will be as contented as i am your loving letter lvii come to me i will not understand a word you have written till you come who has been using your hand to strike me like this and why do you lend it oh if it is she you do not owe her that duty never write such thingsspeak have you ever found me not listen to you or hard to convince dearest dearesttake what i mean i cannot write over this gulf come to mei will believe anything you can say but i can believe nothing of this written i must see you and hear what it is you mean dear heart i am blind till i set eyes on you again beloved i have nothing nothing in me but love for you except for that i am empty believe me and give me time i will not be unworthy of the joy of holding you i am nothing if not yours tell this to whoever is deceiving you oh my dearest why did you stay away from me to write so come and put an end to a thing which means nothing to either of us you love me how can it have a meaning can you not hear my heart cryingi love nobody but youdo not know what love is without you how can i be more yours than i am tell me and i

most loved and loving letter lviii no no i cannot read it what have i done that you will not come to me they are mad here telling me to be calm that i am not to go to you i too am out of my mindexcept that i love you i know nothing except that beloved only on my lips will i take my dismissal from yours not god himself can claim you from me till you have done me that justice kiss me once more and then if you can say we must part you cannotah come here where my heart is and you cannot have i never told you enough how i love you dearest i have no words for all my love i have no pride in me does not this alone tell youyou are sending me away and i cry to you to spare me can i love you more than that what will you have of me that i have not given oh you the sun in my dear heavensif i lose you what is left of me could you break so to pieces even a woman you did not love and me you do loveyou do between all this denial of me and all this silence of words that you have put your name to i see clearly that you are still my loveryour writing breaks with trying not to say it you say again and again that there is no fault in me i swear to you dearest there is none unless it be loving you and how can you mean that for what are you and i made for unless for each other with all our difference people tell us we are alike we were shaped for each other from our very birth have we not proved it in a hundred days of happiness which have lifted us up to the blue of a heaven higher than any birds ever sang and now you saytaking on you the blame for the very lifeblood in us boththat the fault is yours and that your fault is to have allowed me to love you and yourself to love me who has suddenly turned our love into a crime beloved is it a sin that here on earth i have been seeing god through you go away from me and he is gone also ah sweetheart let me see you before all my world turns into a wilderness let me know better whyif my senses are to be emptied of you my heart can never let you go do you wish that it should bring your own here and see if it can tell me that come and listen to mine oh dearest heart that ever beat mine beats so like yours that once together you shall not divide their sound beloved i will be patient believe me to any words you can say but i cannot be patient away from you if i have seemed to reproach you do not think that now for you are to give me a greater joy than i ever had before when you take me in your arms again after a week that has spelled dreadful separation and i shall bless you for itfor this present pain evenbecause the joy will be so much greater only come i do not live till you have kissed me again oh my beloved how cruel love may seem if we do not trust it enough my trust in you has come back in a great rush of warmth like a spring day after frost i almost laugh as i let this go it brings youperhaps before i wake i shall be so tired tonight call under my window make me hear in my sleep i will wake up to you and it shall be all over before the rest of the world wakes there is no dream so deep that i shall not hear you out of the midst of it come and be my morningglory tomorrow without fail i will rewrite nothing that i have writtenlet it go see me out of deep waters again because i have thought so much of you i have come through clouds and thick darkness i press your name to my lips a thousand times as sure as sunrise i say to myself that you will come the sun is not truer to his rising than you to me love will go flying after this till i sleep god bless youand me also it is all one and the same wishyour most true loving and dear faithful one letter lix i have to own that i know your will now at last without seeing you i am convinced you have a strong power in you to have done that you have told me the word i am to say to you it is your bidding so i say itgoodby but it is a word whose meaning i cannot share yet i have something to tell you which i could not have dreamed if it had not somehow been true which has made it possible for me to believe without hearing you speak it that i am to be dismissed out of your heartmay the doing of it cost you far less pain than i am fearing you did not come though i promised myself so certainly that you would instead came your last very brief note which this is to obey still i watched for you to come believing it still and trusting to silence on my part to bring you more certainly than any more words could do and at last either you came to me or i came to you a bitter last meeting perhaps your mind too holds what happened if so i have got truly at what your will is i must accept it as true since i am not to see you again i cannot tell you whether i thought it or dreamed it but it seems still quite real and has turned all my past life into a mockery when i came i was behind you then you turned and i could see your faceyou too were in pain in that we seemed one but when i touched you and would have kissed you you shuddered at me and drew back your head i tell you this as i would tell you anything unbelievable that i had heard told of you behind your back you see i am obeying you at last for all the love which you gave me when i seemed worthy of it i thank you a thousand times could you ever return to the same mind i should be yours once more as i still am never ceasing on my side to be your lover and servant till death andif there be anything moreafter as well my lips say amen now but my heart cannot say it till breath goes out of my body goodby that meansgod be with you i mean it but he seems to have ceased to be with me altogether goodby dearest i kiss your heart with writing for the last time and your eyes that will see nothing more from me after this goodby noteall the letters which follow were found lying loosely together they only went to their destination after the writers death letter lx today dearest a letter from you reached me a fallen star which had lost its way it lies dead in my bosom it was the letter that lost itself in the post while i was traveling it comes now with half a dozen postmarks and signs of long waiting in one place in it you say we have been engaged now for two whole months i never dreamed that two moons could contain so much happiness nor i dearest we have now been separated for three and till now i had not dreamed that time could so creep to such infinitely small purpose as it has in carrying me from the moment when i last saw you you were so dear to me beloved that you ever are time changes nothing in you as you seemed to me then oh i am sick to touch your hands all my thoughts run to your service they seem to hear you call only to find locked doors if you could see me now i think you would open the door for a little while if they came and told meyou are to see him just for five minutes and then part againwhat should i be wanting most to say to you nothing only speak speak i would have you fill my heart with your voice the whole time five minutes more of you to fold my life round it would matter very little what you said barring the one thing that remains never to be said oh could all this silence teach me the one thing i am longing to know why am i unworthy of you if i cannot be your wife why cannot i see you stillserve you if possible i would be grateful you meant to be generous and wishing not to wound me you said that there was no fault in me i realize now that you would not have said that to the woman you still loved and now i am never to know what part in me is hateful to you i must live with it because you would not tell me the truth every day tells me i am different from the thing i wish to beyour love the woman you approve i love you i love you can i get no nearer to you ever for all this straining if i love you so much i must be moving toward what you would have me be in our happiest days my heart had its growing painsgrowing to be as you wished it dear even the wisest make mistakes and the tenderest may be hard without knowing i do not think i am unworthy of you if you knew all writing to you now seems weakness yet it seemed peace to come in here and cry to you and when i go about i have still strength left and try to be cheerful nobody knows i think nobody knows no one in the house is made downcast because of me how dear they are and how little i can thank them except to you dearest i have not shown myself selfish i love you too much too much i cannot write it letter lxi you are very ill they tell me beloved it is such kindness in them to have regard for the wish they disapprove and to let me know knowledge is the one thing needful whose lack has deprived me of my happiness the express image of sorrow is not so terrible as the foreboding doubt of it not because you are ill but because i know something definitely about you i am happier today a little nearer to a semblance of service to you in my helplessness how much i wish you well even though that might again carry you out of my knowledge and though death might bring you nearer than life now makes possible i pray to you dearest not to die it is not right that you should die yet with a mistake in your heart which a little more life might clear away praying for your dear eyes to remain open i realize suddenly how much hope still remains in me where i thought none was left even your illness i take as a good omen and the thought of you weak as a child and somewhat like one in your present state with no brain for deep thinking comes to my heart to be cherished endlessly there you lie beloved brought home to my imagination as never since the day we parted and the thought comes to the rescue of my helpless longingthat it is as little children that men get brought into the kingdom of heaven let that be the medicine and outcome of your sickness my own beloved i hold my breath with hope that i shall have word of you when your hand has strength again to write for i know that in sleepless nights and in pain you will be unable not to think of me if you made resolutions against that when you were well they will go now that you are laid weak and so some power will come back to me and my heart will never be asleep for thinking that yours lies awake wanting itnor ever be at rest for devising ways by which to be at the service of your conscious longing ah my own one beloved whom i have loved so openly and so secretly if you were as i think some other men are i could believe that i had given you so much of my love that you had tired of me because i had made no favor of it but had let you see that i was your faithful subject and servant till death so that after twenty years you chancing upon an empty day in your life might come back and find me still yoursas tomorrow if you came you would my pride died when i saw love looking out of your eyes at me and it has not come back to me now that i see you no more i have no wish that it should in all ways possible i would wish to be as i was when you loved me and seek to change nothing except as you bid me letter lxii so i have seen you beloved again after fearing that i never should a days absence from home has given me this great fortune the pain of it was less than it might have been since our looks did not meet to have seen your eyes shut out their recognition of me would have hurt me too much i must have cried out against such a judgment but you passed by the window without knowing your face not raised so little changed yet you have been ill arthur tells me everything he knows i must have any word of you that goes begging oh i hope you are altogether better happier an illness helps some people the worst of their sorrow goes with the health that breaks down under it and they come out purged into a clearer air and are made whole for a fresh trial of life i hear that you are going quite away and my eyes bless this chance to have embraced you once again your face is the kindest i have ever seen even your silence while i looked at you seemed a grace instead of a cruelty what kindness i say to myself even if it be mistaken kindness must have sealed those dear lips not to tell me of my unworth oh if i could see once into the brain of it all no one but myself knows how good you are how can i then be so unworthy of you did you think i would not surrender to anything you fixed that you severed us so completely not even allowing us to meet and giving me no way to come back to you though i might come to be all that you wished ah dear face how hungry you have made methe more that i think you are not yet so happy as i could wishas i could make youi say it foolishlyyet if you would trust me i am sure oh how tired loving you now makes me physically i grow weary with the ache to have you in my arms and i dream i dream always the shadows of former kindness that never grow warm enough to clasp me before i wakeyours dearest waking or sleeping letter lxiii do you remember beloved when you came on your birthday you said i was to give you another birthday present of your own choosing and i promised and it was that we were to do for the whole day what i wished you were not to be asked to choose you said then that it was the first time i had ever let you have your way which was to see me be myself independently of youas if such a self existed you will never see what i write now and i did not do then any of the things i most wished for first i wished to kneel down and kiss your hands and feet and you would not have liked that even now that you love me no more you would not like me to do such a thing a woman can never do as she likes when she lovesthere is no such thing until he shows it her or she divines it i loved you i loved youthat was all i could do and all i wanted to do you have kept my letters do you read them ever i wonder and do they tell you differently about me now that you see me with new eyes ah no you dare not look at them they tell too much truth how can loveletters ever cease to be the winged things they were when they first came i fancy mine sick to death for want of your heart to rest on but never less loving if you would read them again you would come back to me those little throats of happiness would be too strong for you and so you lay them in a cruel grave of lavenderlavender for forgetfulness might be another song for ophelia to sing i am weak with writing to you i have written too long this is twice today i do not write to make myself more miserable only to fill up my time when i go about something definite i can do itto ride or read aloud to the old people or sit down at meals with them is very easy but i cannot make employment for myselfthat requires too much effort of invention and will and i have only will for one thing in lifeto get through it and no invention to the purpose oh beloved in the grave i shall lie forever with a lock of your hair in my hand i wonder if beyond there one sees anything my eyes ache today from the brain which is always at blind groping for you and the point where i missed you letter lxiv dearest it is dreadful to own that i was glad at first to know that you and your mother were no longer together glad of something that must mean pain to you i am not now when you were ill i did a wrong thing from her something came to me which i returned i would do much to undo that act now but this has fixed it forever with it were a few kind words i could not bear to accept praise from her all went back to her oh poor thing poor thing if i ever had an enemy i thought it was she i do not think so now those who seem cold seldom are i hope you were with her at the last she loved you beyond any word that was in her nature to utter and the young are hard on the old without knowing it we were two people she and i whose love clashed jealously over the same object and we both failed she is the first to get rest letter lxv my dear i dream of you now every night and you are always kind always just as i knew you the same without a shadow of change i cannot picture you anyhow else though my life is full of the silence you have made my heart seems to have stopped on the last beat the sight of your handwriting gave it i dare not bid you come back now sorrow has made me a stranger to myself i could not look at you and say i am your stari could not believe it if i said it two women have inhabited me and the one here now is not the one you knew and loved their one likeness is that they both have loved the same man the one certain that her love was returned and the other certain of nothing what a world of difference lies in that i lay hands on myself half doubting and feel my skeleton pushing to the front my glass shows it me thus we are all built up bones are at the foundations of our happiness and when the happiness wears thin they show through the true architecture of humanity i have to realize now that i have become the greatest possible failure in lifea woman who has lost her share of the world i try to shape myself to it it is deadly when a womans sex what was once her glory reveals itself to her as an allcontaining loss i realized myself fully only when i was with you and now i cant undo ityou gone i lean against a shadow and feel myself forever falling drifting to no end a francesca without a paolo well it must be some comfort that i do not drag you with me i never believed myself a strong woman your lightest wish shaped me to its liking now you have molded me with your own image and superscription and have cast me away are not the die and the coin that comes from it only two sides of the same formthere is not a hairs breadth anywhere between their surfaces where they lie the one inclosing the other yet part them and the light strikes on them how differently that is a mere condition of light join them in darkness where the light cannot strike and they are the sametwo faces of a single form so you and i dear when we are dead shall come together again i trust or are we to come back to each other defaced and warped out of our true conjunction i think not for if you have changed if soul can ever change i shall be melted again by your touch and flow to meet all the change that is in you since my true self is to be you oh you my beloved do you wake happy either with or without thoughts of me i cannot understand but i trust that it may be so if i could have a reason why i have so passed out of your life i could endure it better what was in me that you did not wish what was in you that i must not wish for evermore if the root of this separation was in you if in gods will it was ordered that we were to love and without loving less afterwards be parted i could acquiesce so willingly but it is this knowing nothing that overwhelms mei strain my eyes for sight and cant see i reach out my hands for the sunlight and am given great handfuls of darkness i said to you the sun had dropped out of my heavenmy dear my dear is this darkness indeed you am i in the mold with my face to yours receiving the close impression of a misery in which we are at one are you dearest hungering and thirsting for me as i now for you i wonder what to the starving and droughtstricken the taste of death can be like do all the rivers of the world run together to the lips then and all its fruits strike suddenly to the taste when the long deprivation ceases to be a want or is it simply a ceasing of hunger and thirstan antidote to it all i may know soon how very strange if at the last i forget to think of you letter lxvi dearest every day i am giving myself a little more pain than i needfor the sake of you i am giving myself your letters to read again day by day as i received them only one a day so that i have still something left to look forward to tomorrow and oh dearest what unanswerable things they have now become those letters which i used to answer so easily there is hardly a word but the light of today stands before it like a drawn sword between the heart that then felt and wrote so and mine as it now feels and waits all your tenderness then seems to be cruelty now only seems dearest for i still say i do say that it is not so i know it is not so i who know nothing else know that so i look every day at one of these monstrous contradictions and press it to my heart till it becomes reconciled with the pain that is there always indeed you loved me that i see now words which i took so much for granted then have a strange force now that i look back at them you did love and i who did not realize it enough then realize it now when you no longer do and the commentary on all this is that one letter of yours which i say over and over to myself sometimes when i cannot pray there is no fault in you the fault is elsewhere i can no longer love you as i did all that was between us must be at an end for your good and mine the only right thing is to say goodby without meeting i know you will not forget me but you will forgive me even because of the great pain i cause you you are the most generous woman i have known if it would comfort you to blame me for this i would beg you to do it but i know you better and ask you to believe that it is my deep misfortune rather than my fault that i can be no longer your lover as god knows i was once i dare not say how short a time ago to me you remain what i always found you the best and most truehearted woman a man could pray to meet this dearest i say and say and write down now lest you have forgotten it for your writing of it and all the rest of you that i have goes with me to my grave how superstitious we are of our own bodies after deathi as if i believed that i should ever rise or open my ears to any sound again i do not yet it comforts me to make sure that certain things shall go with me to dissolution truly dearest i believe grief is a great deceiver and that no one quite quite wishes not to exist i have no belief in future existence yet i wish it so muchto exist again outside all this failure of my life for at present i have done you no good at all only evil and i hope now and then that writing thus to you i am not writing altogether in vain if i can see sufficiently at the last to saysend him these it will be almost like living again for surely you will love me again when you see how much i have sufferedand suffered because i would not let thought of you go could you dream beloved reading this that there is bright sunlight streaming over my paper as i write letter lxvii do you forgive me for coming into your life beloved i do not know in what way i can have hurt you but i know that i have perhaps without knowing it we exchange salves for the wounds we have given and received dearest i trust those i send reach you i send them wishing till i grow weak my arms strain and become tired trying to be wings to carry them to you and i am glad of that wearinessit seems to be some virtue that has gone out of me if all my body could go out in the effort i think i should get a glimpse of your face and the meaning of everything then at last i have brought in a wild rose to lay here in loves cenotaph among all my thoughts of you it comes from a graveyard full of little deaths i remember once sending you a flower from the same place when love was still fortunate with us i must have been reckless in my happiness to do that beloved if i could speak or write out all my thoughts till i had emptied myself of them i feel that i should rest but there is no emptying the brain by thinking things thought come to be thought again over and over and more and fresh come in their train children and grandchildren generations of them sprung from the old stock i have many thoughts now born of my love for you that never came when we were togethergrandchildren of our days of courtship some of them are set down here but others escape and will never see your face if poor word it has the sound but no hope of a future life still if you should ever come back to me and want as you would want to know something of the life in betweeni could put these letters that i keep into your hands and trust them to say for me that no day have i been truly that is to say willingly out of your heart when richard feverel comes back to his wife do you remember how she takes him to see their child which till then he had never seenand its likeness to him as it lies asleep dearest have i not been as true to you in all that i leave here written if when i come to my finish i get any truer glimpse of your mind and am sure of what you would wish i will leave word that these shall be sent to you if not i must suppose knowledge is still delayed not that it will not reach you sometimes i try still not to wish to die for my poor bodys sake i wish well to have its last chance of coming to pass it is the unhappy unfulfilled clay of life i think which robbed of its share of things set ghosts to walk mists which rise out of a ground that has not worked out its fruitfulness to take the shape of old desires if i leave a ghost it will take your shape not mine dearest for it will be as trees walking that the lovers of trees will come back to earth browning did not know that someone else not browning has worded it for us a lover of trees far away sends his soul back to the country that has lost him and there the traveler marveling why halts on the bridge to hearken how soft the poplars sigh not knowing that it is the lover himself who sighs in the trees all night that is how the ghosts of real love come back into the world the ghosts of love and the ghosts of hatred must be quite different these bring fear and those none come to me dearest in the blackest night and i will not be afraid how strange that when one has suffered most it is the poets those who are supposed to sing who best express things for us yet singing is the thing i feel least like if ever a heart once woke up to find itself full of tune it was mine now you have drawn all the song out of it emptied it dry and i go to the poets to read epitaphs i think it is their cruelty that appeals to methey can sing of grief o hard hearts sitting here thinking of you my ears have suddenly become wide open to the nightsounds outside a nightjar is making its beautiful burr in the stillness and there are things going away and away telling me the whereabouts of life like points on a map made for the ear you too are somewhere outside making no sound and listening for you i heard these it seemed as if my brain had all at once opened and caught a new sense are you there this is one of those things which drop to us with no present meaning yet i know i am not to forget it as long as i live goodnight at your head at your feet is there any room for me tonight beloved letter lxviii dearest the thought keeps troubling me how to give myself to you most if you should ever come back for me when i am no longer here these poor letters are all that i can leave will they tell you enough of my heart oh into that wish any wish that you like and it is there already my heart dearest only moves in the wish to be what you desire yet i am conscious that i cannot give unless you shall choose to take and though i write myself down each day your willing slave i cry my wares in a market where there is no bidder to hear me dearest though my whole life is yours it is little you know of it my wish would be to have every year of my life blessed by your consciousness of it barely a year of me is all that you have truly to remember though i think five summers at least came to flower and withered in that one i wish you knew my whole life i cannot tell it it was too full of infinitely small things yet what i can remember i would like to tell now so that some day perhaps perhaps my childhood may here and there be warmed long after its death by your knowledge coming to it and discovering in it more than you knew before how i long dearest that what i write may look up some day and meet your eye beloved then however faded the ink may have grown i think the spirit of my love will remain fresh in iti kiss you on the lips with every word the thought of goodby is never to enter here it is a reviderci for ever and everlove love and meet againthe words we put into the thrushs song on a day you will remember when all the world for us was a garden dearest what i can tell you of older dayslittle things they must bei will and i know that if you ever come to value them at all their littleness will make them doubly welcomejust as to know that you were once called a gallous young hound by people whom you plagued when a boy was to me a darling discovery all at once i caught my childhoods imaginary comrade to my young spirits heart and kissed him brow and eyes goodnight goodnight tomorrow i will find you some earliest memory the dew of hermon be on it when you come to itif ever oh beloved could you see into my heart now or i into yours time would grow to nothing for us and my childhood would stay unwritten from far and near i gather my thoughts of you for the kiss i cannot give goodnight dearest letter lxix beloved i remember my second birthday i am quite sure of it because my third i remember so infinitely wellthen i was taken in to see arthur lying in baby bridal array of lace fringes and gauze and received in my arms held up for me by nannan the awful weight and imperial importance of his small body i think from the first i was told of him as my brother cousin i have never been able to think him but all this belongs to my third on my second i remember being on a floor of roses and they told me if i would go across to a clipboard and pull it open there would be something there waiting for me and it was on allfours that i went all eagerness across great patches of rosepattern till i had butted my way through a door left ajar and found in a cardboard box of bright tinsel and flowers two little wax babes in the wood lying i think they gave me my first sense of color except perhaps the rosecarpet which came earlier and they remained for quite a long time the most beautiful thing i knew it is strange that i cannot remember what became of them for i am sure i neither broke nor lost themperhaps it was done for me arthur came afterward the tomb of many of my early joys and the maker of so many new ones he dearest is the one the only one who has seen the tears that belong truly to you and he blesses me with such wonderful patience when i speak your name allowing that perhaps i know better than he and after the wax babies i had him for my third birthday letter lxx beloved i think that small children see very much as animals must do just the parts of things which have a direct influence on their lives and no memory outside that i remember the kindness or frowns of faces in early days far more than the faces themselves and it is quite a distinct and later memory that i have of standing within a doorway and watching my mother pass downstairs unconscious of my being thereand then for the first time studying her features and seeing in them a certain solitude and distance which i had never before noticedi suppose because i had never before thought of looking at her when she was not concerned with me it was this unobservance of actual features i imagine which made me think all grayhaired people alike and find a difficulty in recognizing those who called except generically as callerspeople who kissed me and whom therefore i liked to see one i remember for no reason unless because she had a brown face i mistook from a distance for my aunt dolly and bounded into the room where she was sitting with a cry of rapture and it was my earliest conscious test of politeness when i found out my mistake not to cry over it in the kind but very inferior presence to that one i had hoped for i suppose also that many sights which have no meaning to children go happily quite out of memory and that what our early years leave for us in the minds lavender are just the titbits of life or the first blows to our intelligencethings which did matter and mean much corduroys come early into my lifetheir color and the queer earthy smell of those which particularly concerned me because i was picked up from a fall and tenderly handled by a rough workingman so clothed whom i regarded for a long time afterward as an adorable object he and i lived to my recognition of him as a wizened scrubby middleaged man but remained good friends after the romance was over i dont know when the change in my sense of beauty took place as regards him anything unusual that appealed to my senses left exaggerated marks my father once in full uniform appeared to me as a giant so that i screamed and ran and required much of his kindest voice to coax me back to him also once in the street a dancer in fancy costume struck me in the same way and seemed in his red tunic twice the size of the people who crowded round him i think as a child the small groundflowers of spring took a larger hold upon me than any othersi was so close to them roses i dont remember till i was four or five but crocus and snowdrop seem to have been in my blood from the very beginning of things and i remember likening the green inner petals of the snowdrop to the skirts of some balletdancing dolls which danced themselves out of sight before i was four years old snapdragons too i remember as if with my first summer i used to feed them with bits of their own green leaves believing faithfully that those mouths must need food of some sort when i became more thoughtful i ceased to make cannibals of them but i think i was less convinced then of the digestive process i dont know when i left off feeding snapdragons i think calceolarias helped to break me off the habit for i found they had no throats to swallow with in much the same way as sights that have no meaning leave no traces so i suppose do words and sounds it was many years before i overheard in the sense of taking in a conversation by elders not meant for me though once in my innocence i hid under the table during the elders late dinner and came out at dessert to which we were always allowed to come down hoping to be an amusing surprise to them and i could not at all understand why i was scolded for indeed i had heard nothing at all though no doubt plenty that was unsuitable for a childs ears had been said and was on the elders minds when they upbraided me dearest such a longago and all these smallest of small things i remember again to lay them up for you all the childparentage of me whom you loved once and will again if ever these come to you bless my childhood dearest it did not know it was lonely of you as i know of myself now and yet i have known you and know you still so am the more blestgoodnight letter lxxi i used to stand at the foot of the stairs a long time when by myself before daring to start up and then it was always the right foot that went first and a fearful feeling used to accompany me that i was going to meet the evil chance when i got to the corner sometimes when i felt it was there very badly i used at the last moment to shut my eyes and walk through it and feel on the other side like a pilgrim who had come through the waters of jordan my eyes were always the timidest things about me and to shut my eyes tight against the dark was the only way i had of meeting the solitude of the first hour of bed when nannan had left me and before i could get to sleep i have an idea that one listens better with ones eyes shut and that this and other things are a remnant of our primitive existence when perhaps the ears of our arboreal ancestors kept a lookout while the rest of their senses slept i think also that the instinct i found in myself and have since in other children to conceal a wound is a similar survival at one time i suppose in the human herd the damaged were quickly put out of existence and it was the selfpreservation instinct which gave me so keen a wish to get into hiding when one day i cut my finger badlysomething more than a mere scratch which i would have cried over and had bandaged quite in the correct way i remember i sat in a corner and pretended to be nursing a rag doll which i had knotted round my hand till nannan noticed perhaps that i looked white and found blood flowing into my lap and i can recall still the overcoming comfort which fell upon me as i let resolution go and sobbed in her arms full of pity for myself and scolding the naughty knife that had done the deed the rest of that day is lost to me yet it is not only occasions of happiness and pain which impress themselves when the mind takes a sudden stride in consciousnessthat also fixes itself i remember the agony of shyness which came on me when strange hands did my undressing for me once in nannans absence the first time i had felt such a thing and another day i remember after contemplating the head of judas in a pictorial puzzle for a long time that i seized a brick and pounded him with it beyond recognitionthese were the first vengeful beginnings of christianity in me all my history bible and english came to me through picturebooks i wept tenderly over the endangered eyes of prince arthur yet i put out the eyes of many kings princes and governors who incurred my displeasure scratching them with pins till only a white blur remained on the paper all this comes to me quite seriously now i used to laugh thinking it over but can a single thing we do be called trivial since out of it we grow up minute by minute into a whole being charged with capacity for gladness or suffering now as i look back all these atoms of memory are dust and ashes that i have walked through in order to get to present things how i suffer how i suffer if you could have dreamed that a human body could contain so much suffering i think you would have chosen a less dreadful way of showing me your will you would have given me a reason why i have to suffer so dearest i am broken off every habit i ever had except my love of you if you would come back to me you could shape me into whatever you wished i will be different in all but just that one thing letter lxxii here in my pain beloved i remember keenly now the one or two occasions when as a small child i was consciously a cause of pain to others what an irony of life that once of the two times when i remember to have been cruel it was to arthur with his small astonished babyface remaining a reproach to me ever after i was hardly five then and going up to the nursery from downstairs had my suppercake in my hand only a few mouthfuls left he had been having his bath and was sitting up on nannans knee being got into his bed clothes when spying me with my cake he piped to have a share of it i dare say it would not have been good for him but of that i thought nothing at all the cruel impulse took me to make one mouthful of all that was left he watched it go without crying but his eyes opened at me in a strange way wondering at this sudden lesson of the hardness of a human heart all gone was what he said turning his head from me up to nannan to see perhaps if she too had a like surprise for his wee intelligence i think i have never forgiven myself that though arthur has no memory of it left in him the judging remembrance of it would i believe win forgiveness to him for any wrong he might now do me if that and not the contrary were his way with me so unreasonably is my brain scarred where the thought of it still lies god may forgive us our trespasses by marvelous slow ways but we cannot always forgive them ourselves the other thing came out of a less personal greed and was years later arthur and i were collecting eggs and in the loft over one of the outhouses there was a swallows nest too high up to be reached by any ladder we could get up there i was intent on getting the eggs and thought of no other thing that might chance so i spread a soft fall below and with a long pole i broke the floor of the nest then with a sudden stir of horror i saw soft things falling along with the clay tiny and feathery two were killed by the breakage that fell with them but one was quite alive and unhurt i gathered up the remnants of the nest and set it with the young one in it by the loft window where the parentbirds might see making clumsy strivings of pity to quiet my conscience the parentbirds did see soon enough they returned first up to the rafters then darting round and round and crying then to where their little one lay helpless and exposed hung over it with a nibbling movement of their beaks for a moment making my miserable heart bound up with hope then away away shrieking into the july sunshine once they came back and shrieked at the horror of it all and fled away not to return i remained for hours and did whatever silly pity could dictate but of course the young one died and icleared away all remains that nobody might see and that i gave up eggcollecting after that was no penance but choice since then the poignancy of my regret when i think of it has never softened the question which pride of life and love of makebelieve till then had not raised in me am i a god to kill and to make alive was answered all at once by an emphatic no which i never afterward forgot but the grief remained all the same that life to teach me that blunt truth should have had to make sacrifice in the motehung loft of three frail lives on a clayaltar and bring to nothing but pain and a last miserable dart away into the bright sunshine the spring work of two swiftwinged intelligences is man we are told to think not worth many sparrows oh beloved sometimes i doubt it and would in thought give my life that those swallows in their generations might live again beloved i am letting what i have tried to tell you of my childhood end in a sad way for it is no use no use i have not today a glimmer of hope left that your eyes will ever rest on what i have been at such deep trouble to write if i were being punished for these two childish things i did i should see a side of justice in it all but it is for loving you i am being punished and not god himself shall make me let you go beloved beloved all my days are at your feet and among them days when you held me to your heart goodnight goodnight always now letter lxxiii dearest i could never have made any appeal from you to anybody all my appeal has been to you alone i have wished to hear reason from no other lips but yours and had you but really and deeply confided in me i believe i could have submitted almost with a light heart to what you thought bestthough in no way and by no stretch of the imagination can i see you coming to me for the last time and saying as you only wrote that it was best we should never see each other again you could not have said that with any sound of truth and how can it look truer frozen into writing i have kissed the words because you wrote them not believing them it is a suspense of unbelief that you have left me in oh still dearest yet never was sad heart truer to the fountain of all its joy than mine to yours you had only to see me to know that some day i dream we shall come suddenly together and you will see before a word before i have time to gather my mind back to the bodily comfort of your presence a face filled with thoughts of you that have never left it and never been bitteri believe never once bitter for even when i think and convince myself that you have wronged yourselfand so me alsoeven then oh then most of all my heart seems to break with tenderness and my spirit grow more famished than ever for the want of you for if you have done right wisely then you have no longer any need of me but if you have done wrong then you must need me oh dear heart let that need overwhelm you like a sea and bring you toward me on its strong tide and come when you will i shall be waiting letter lxxiv dearest and dearest so long as you are still this to my heart i trust to have strength to write it though it is but a ghost of old happiness that comes to me in the act i have no hope now left in me but i love you not less only more if that be possible or is it the same love with just a weaker body to contain it all i find that to have definitely laid off all hope gives me a certain relief for now that i am so hopeless it becomes less hard not to misjudge younot to say and think impatiently about you things which would explain why i had to die like this dearest nothing but love shall explain anything of you to me when i think of your dear face it is only love that can give it its meaning if love would teach me the meaning of this silence i would accept all the rest and not ask for any joy in life besides for if i had the meaning however dark it would be by love speaking to me again at last and i should have your hand holding mine in the darkness forever your face beloved i can remember so well that it would be enough if i had your handthe meaning just the meaning why i have to sit blind letter lxxv dearest there is always one possibility which i try to remember in all i write even where there is no hope a thing remains possiblethat your eye may some day come to rest upon what i leave here and i would have nothing so dark as to make it seem that i were better dead than to have come to such a pass through loving you if i felt that dearest i should not be writing my heart out to you as i do when i cease doing that i shall indeed have become dead and not want you any more i suppose how far i am from dying then now so be quite sure that if now even nowfor today of all days has seemed most darkif now i were given my choiceto have known you or not to have known youbeloved a thousand times i would claim to keep what i have rather than have it taken away from me i cannot forget that for a few months i was the happiest woman i ever knew and that happiness is perhaps only by present conditions removed from me if i have a soul i believe good will come back to it because i have done nothing to deserve this darkness unless by loving you and if by loving you i am glad that the darkness came beloved you have the yes and no to all this i have not and cannot have something that you have not chosen for me to know you know it should be a burden on your conscience surely not to have shared it with me maybe there is something i know that you do not in the way of sorrow i think and wishyes in the way of love i wish to thinkno any more thinking wearies me perhaps we have loved too much and have lost our way out of our poor five senses without having strength to take over the new world which is waiting beyond them well i would rather beloved suffer through loving too much than through loving too little it is a good fault as faults go and it is my fault beloved so some day you may have to be tender to it letter lxxvi dearest i feel constantly that we are together still i cannot explain when i am most miserable even so that i feel a longing to fly out of reach of the dear household voices which say shy things to keep me cheerfuli feel that i have you in here waiting for me hearts heart in my darkest it is you who speak to me as i write i have my cheek pressed against yours none of it is true not a word not a day that has separated us i am yours it is only the poor five senses part of us that spells absence some day some day you will answer this letter which has to stay locked in my desk some day i mean an answer will reach mewithout your reading this your answer will come is not your heart at this moment answering me dearest i trust you i could not have dreamed you to myself therefore you must be true quite independently of me you as i saw you once with open eyes remain so forever you cannot make yourself beloved not to be what you are you have called my soul to life if for no other reason than to bear witness of you come what may no length of silence can make a truth once sounded ever cease to be borne away out of our hearing it makes its way to the stars dispersed or removed it cannot be lost i too for truths sake may have to be dispersed out of my present self which shuts me from you but i shall find you some dayyou who made me you who every day make me a part of you cut off i suffer pain because i am still part of you if i had no part in you i should suffer nothing but i do i do one is told how when a man has lost a limb he still feels itnot the pleasure of it but the pain dearest are you aware of me now because i am suffering you shall not think i am entirely miserable but here and now i am all unfinished ends desperately i need faith at times to tell me that each shoot of pain has a point at which it assuages itself and becomes healing that pain is not endurance wasted but that i and my weary body have a goal which will give a meaning to all this somehow somewhere never i begin to fear here while this body has charge of me dearest i lay my heart down on yours and cry and having worn myself out with it and ended i kiss your lips and bless god that i have known you i have not saidi never could say itlet the day perish wherein love was born i forget nothing of you you are clear to meall but one thing why we have become as we are now one whole parted and sent different ways and yet so near on my most sleepless nights my pillow is yours i wet your face with my tears and cry sleep well tonight also beloved sleep well night and morning i make you my prayer letter lxxvii my own one beloved my dearest dear want me please want me i will keep alive for you say you wish me to livenot come to you dont say that if you cantbut just wish me to live and i will yes i will do anything even live if you tell me to do it i will be stronger than all the world or fate if you have any wish about me at all wish well dearest and surely the knowledge will come to me wish big things of me or little things wish me to sleep and i will sleep better because of it wish anything of me only not that i should love you better i cant dearest i cant any more of that and love would go out of my body and leave it clay if you would even wish that i would be happy at finding a way to do your will below ground more perfectly than any i found on it wish wish only wish something for me to do oh i could rest if i had but your little finger to love the tyranny of love is when it makes no bidding at all that you have no want or wish left in you as regards me is my continual despair my own my beloved my tormentor and comforter my ever dearest dear whom i love so much letter lxxviii tonight beloved the burden of things is too much for me come to me somehow dear ghost of all my happiness and take me in your arms i ache and ache not to belong to you i do i must it is only our senses that divide us and mine are all famished servants waiting for their master they have nothing to do but watch for you and pretend that they believe you will come oh it is grievous beloved in the darkness do you feel my kisses they go out of me in sharp stabs of pain they must go somewhere for me to be delivered of them only with so much suffering oh how this should make me hate you if that were possible how instead i love you more and more and shall dearest and will till i die i will die because in no other way can i express how much i love you i am possessed by all the despairing words about lost happiness that the poets have written they go through me like ghosts i am haunted by them but they are bloodless things it seems when i listen to all the other desolate voices that have ever cried that i alone have blood in me nobody ever loved as i love since the world began there dearest take this all this bitter wine of me poured out until i feel in myself only the dregs left and still in them is the fire and the suffering no but i will be better it is better to have known you than not give me time dearest to get you to heart again i cannot leave you like this not with such words as these for goodnight oh dear face dear unforgettable lost face my soul strains up to look for you through the blind eyes that have been left to torment me because they can never behold you very often i have seen you looking grieved shutting away some sorrow in yourself quietly but never once angry or impatient at any of the small follies of men come then and look at me patiently now i am your blind girl i must cry out because i cannot see you only make me believe that you yet think of me as when you so unbelievably separated us you said you had always found methe dearest and most truehearted woman a man could pray to meet beloved if in your heart i am still that separation does not matter i can wait i can wait i kiss your feet even tomorrow may bring the light god bless you i pray it more than ever because to me tonight has been so very dark letter lxxix dearest i have not written to you for three weeks at last i am better again you seem to have been waiting for me here always wondering when i would come back i do come back you see dear heart how are you i kiss your feet you are my one only happiness my great one words are too cold and cruel to write anything for me picture me i am too weak to write more but i have written this and am so much better for it reward me some day by reading what is here i kiss because of you this paper which i am too tired to fill any more love nothing but love into every one of these dead words my heart has been beating trying to lay down its life and reach to you letter lxxx a secret dearest that will be no secret soon before i am done with twentythree i shall have passed my age beloved it hurts me more than i can say that the news of it should come to you from anyone but me for this though i write it is already a dead letter lost like a predestined soul even in the pains that gave it birth yes it does pain me frightens me even that i must die all by myself and feeling still so young i thought i should look forward to it but i do not no no i would give much to put it off for a time until i could know what it will mean for me as regards you oh if you only knew and cared what wild comfort i might have in the knowledge it seems strange that if i were going away from the chance of a perfect life with you i should feel it with less pain than i feel this the dust and the ashes of life are all that i have to let fall and it is bitterness itself to part with them how we grow to love sorrow joy is never so much a possessionit goes over us incloses us like air or sunlight but sorrow goes into us and becomes part of our flesh and bone so that i holding up my hand to the sunshine see sorrow red and transparent like stained glass between me and the light of day sorrow that has become inseparably mine and is the very life i am wishing to keep dearest will the world be more bearable to you when i am out of it it is selfish of me not to wish so since i can satisfy you in this so soon every day i will try to make it my wish or wish that it may be so when the event comesnot a day before till then let it be more bearable that i am still alive grant me dearest that one little grace while i live bearable my sorrow is bearable i suppose because i do bear it from day to day otherwise i would declare it not to be dont suffer as i do dearest unless that will comfort you one thing is strange but i feel quite certain of it when i heard that i carried death about in me scarcely an armslength away i thought quickly to myself that it was not the solution of the mystery others might have thought that it was that because i was to die so soon therefore i was not fit to be your wife but i know it was not that i know that whatever hopes death in me put an end to you would have married me and loved me patiently till i released you as i am to so soon it is always this same woe that crops up nothing i can ever think can account for what has been decreed that too is a secret mine comes to meet it when it arrives shall i know and not a word not a word of this can reach you ever its uses are wrung out and drained dry to comfort me in my eternal solitude goodnight very soon it will have to be goodby letter lxxxi beloved i woke last night and believed i had your arms round me and that all storms had gone over me forever the peace of your love had inclosed me so tremendously that when i was fully awake i began to think that what i held was you dead and that our reconciliation had come at that great cost something remains real of it all even now under the full light of day yet i know you are not dead only it leaves me with a hope that at the lesser cost of my own death when it comes happiness may break in and that whichever of us has been the most in poor and needy ignorance will know the truth at lastthe truth which is an inseparable need for all hearts that love rightly even now to me the thought of you is a peace passing all understanding beloved beloved beloved all the greetings i ever gave you gather here and are hungry to belong to you by a better way than i have ever dreamed i am yours till something more than death swallows me up letter lxxxii dearest if you will believe any word of mine you must not believe that i have died of a broken heart should science and the doctors bring about a fulfillment of their present prophesyings concerning me i think my heart has held me up for a long time not letting me know that i was ill i did not notice and now my body snaps on a stem that has grown too thin to hold up its weight i am at the end of twentytwo years they have been too many for me and the last has seemed a useless waste of time it is difficult not to believe that great happiness might have carried me over many more years and built up for me in the end a renewed youth i asked that quite frankly wishing to know and was told not to think it so dearest whatever comes whatever i may have written to fill up my worst loneliness be sure if you care to be that though my life was wholly yours my death was my own and comes at its right natural time pity me but invent no blame to yourself my heart has sung of you even in the darkest days in the face of everything the blankness of everything i mean it has clung to an unreasoning belief that in spite of appearances all had some well in it above all to a conviction that perhaps without knowing ityou still love me believing that it could not break could not dearest any other part of me but not that beloved i kiss your face i kiss your lips and eyes my mind melts into kisses when i think of you however weak the rest of me grows my love shall remain strong and certain if i could look at you again how in a moment you would fill up the past and the future and turn even my grief into gold even my senses then would forget that they had ever been starved dear share of the world you have been out of sight but i have never let you go ah if only the whole of me the double doubting part of me as well could only be so certain as to be able to give wings to this and let it fly to you wish for it and i think the knowledge will come to me goodnight god brings you to me in my first dream but the longing so keeps me awake that sometimes i am a whole night sleepless letter lxxxiii i am frightened dearest i am frightened at death not only for fear it should take me altogether away from you instead of to you but for other reasons besidesinstincts which i thought gone but am not rid of even yet no healthy body or body with power of enjoyment in it wishes to die i think and no heart with any desire still living out of the past we know nothing at all really we only think we believe and hope we know and how thin that sort of conviction gets when in our extremity we come face to face with the one immovable fact of our own death waiting for us that is what i have to go through yet even the fear is a relief i come upon something that i can meet at last a challenge to my courage whether it is still to be found here in this body i have worn so weak with useless lamentations if i had your hand or even a word from you i think i should not be afraid but perhaps i should it is all one goodby i am beginning at last to feel a meaning in that word which i wrote at your bidding so longago oh beloved from face to feet goodby god be with you wherever you go and i do not letter lxxxiv dearest i am to have news of you arthur came to me last night and told me that if i wished he would bring me word of you he goes tomorrow he put out the light that i might not see his face i felt what was there you should know this of him he has been the dearest possible of human beings to me since i lost you i am almost not unblessed when i have him to speak to yet we can say so little together i guess all he means an endless wish to give me comfortand i stay selfish the knowledge that he would stolidly die to serve me hardly touches me oh look kindly in his eyes if you see him mine will be looking at you out of his letter lxxxv goodmorning beloved there is sun shining i wonder if arthur is with you yet if faith could still remove mountains surely i should have seen you long ago but if i were to see you now i should fear that it meant you were dead that the same world should hold you and me living and unseen by each other is a great mystery will love ever explain it i wish i could bid the sun stand still over your meeting with arthur so that i might know we were so like each other once time has worn it off but he is like what i was will you remember me well enough to recognize me in him and to be a little pitiful to my weak longing for a word this one last time of all beloved i press my lips to yours and prayspeak letter lxxxvi dearest today arthur came and brought me your message i have at my heart your profoundly grateful remembrances somewhere
