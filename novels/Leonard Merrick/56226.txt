conrad in quest of his youth an extravagance of temperament by leonard merrick mitchell kennerley new york and london mcmxi copyright by mitchell kennerly conrad in quest of his youth chapter i how we laughed as we laboured together how well i remember to day our 'outings' in midsummer weather our winter delights at the play we were not over nice in our dinners our 'rooms' were up rickety stairs but if hope be the wealth of beginners by jove we were all millionaires our incomes were very uncertain our prospects were equally vague yet the persons i pity who know not the city the beautiful city of prague if you can imagine the lonely shade of the man who wrote that verse returning to literary london where there is no longer a young man who could write it and merely a few greybeards are left still to understand what it means i say if you can imagine this you may appreciate the condition of conrad when he went back to the quartier latin conrad was no less sad his disappointment was no less bitter the society that he had sought so eagerly was no less alien to him but while he commanded bocks for all and mourned the change that left him desolate the melancholy of his mood was a subtler thing for he realised that the profoundest change was in himself something should be said of the longings that had brought him back to the quarter longings in one hour tender and in the next tempestuous something hinted of the regretful years during which his limbs reposed in an official chair while his mind flew out of the official window to places across the sea where he had been young and sanguine and infinitely glad to a score of places it flew but to none perhaps so often as paris where he had studied art in the days when he meant to move the world of course the trouble with the man was that he wanted to be nineteen again and didn't recognise it we do not immediately recognise that our youth is going from us it recedes stealthily like our hair for a long time he had missed the zest the sparkle the buoyancy from life but for the flatness that distressed him he blamed the colony instead of his age he confused the emotions of his youth with the scenes where he had felt them and yearned to make sentimental journeys fancying that to revisit the scenes would be to recover the emotions because the office rewarded his mental flights ungenerously he was restrained by one of those little realities which vulgar novelists observe and which are so out of place in novels sordid considerations like ways and means give us lots of blood and the dummy over the dashing highwayman's shoulder if you call him a cavalier it's breezy romance and then his aunt tryphena died and left him everything at once he was lord of himself liberated by everything he sailed for home and savouring the knowledge that he was free to rove where he listed lingered in london some months afterwards when the crocuses were perking behind the park rails and piccadilly was abloom with the first millinery of spring he travelled to dover en route for the past and lilac was everywhere paris was all lilac and sunshine he drove to an hotel on the left bank to behold it again the grotesque clock under the glass shade and the clothes pegs that were too large to hang clothes on the scarlet dredon that he would throw on the floor before he got into bed the sight of these things was sweet to him as the welcome of a woman is sweet after a passage made on a slow steamer to reach her side he said to the femme de chambre she was elderly and she was plain pretty chambermaids are all employed in farcical comedies but she was a femme de chambre and he felt communicative he said la dernire fois que j'tais paris j'tais un gamin she smiled and gave a shrug monsieur n'est qu'un enfant aujourd'hui what english servant would have earned that tip oh yes english servants are all too truthful when he had scattered his things about the room he strode out to seek the little restaurant where the dinners had been so good and the company had been so witty years before well it had vanished perhaps he wasn't surprised but he loitered wistfully in the street from which the faded sign had gone and at the flashy establishment where he dined instead the plats lacked flavour by and by he sauntered along the boul' mich' while he walked he perceived that he had ceased to look about him and was again looking back the sigh of names that had been long forgotten was in the plaintive night and the air was thick with echoes he moved along the lamp lit boulevard seeing ghosts and to right and left the heedless faces of the fleshly crowd were strange to him all strange to him this was the first impediment in his road gay paree is gayest in the doggerel of the english music halls its gaiety is declining fast but its beauty is fadeless no city goes to bed more worldly and wakes up looking more innocent at six o'clock next day when they began to beat carpets and conrad flung the windows wide some of the happiness of the wakened capital's simplicity was breathed into his heart and his fervour and his purse overcame the first impediment within a week of his arrival he had already been called mon cher he was called mon cher and other things he puffed his caporal at the caf vachette and found that he had lost his relish for french tobacco he sat among the cards and the dominoes at the caf d'harcourt bought carnations and crevisses from the pedlars' baskets for angle and suzanne and angle and suzanne proved witless compared with what their mothers had been and he noted not without some slight pride for we are all patriotic abroad that though the art of tying a veil has been granted to french women the pretty features have been granted to the english it was now that the disappointment fell now that he cried 'oh for one hour of youthful joy give back my twentieth spring' the ardour of the students left him chilly the rodomontades of his compatriots sounded merely stupid they were all going to sacrifice themselves for an ideal all going to england to paint persistently the class of work that england did not want no concessions was their battle cry youth can never believe that it will live to make concessions your adept finds nowhere so scathing a critic as your novice o beautiful time when he too had imagined he was born with a mission bright morning when he had vapoured with the vainest this afternoon the rapsodie anglaise was played to duller ears the freaks seemed joyless and he said the aspirations were out of drawing he was not sure that it was of immense importance whether one painted well or ill whether one painted at all there were more useful things to be done in the world he did not wish to do them but he suggested that they were there then the audience hurled passages from the preface to mademoiselle de maupin at him without acknowledgment pelting him with the paragraphs full of shoes and potatoes until he was dizzy and perhaps a little shaken after all when one has failed to pluck the grapes it is easy to proclaim that potatoes are more nourishing on the whole he was scarcely a success in the quarter a success of curiosity at most and he won no converts to his theory advanced in the soleil d'or that the greatest services to modern art were rendered by the writers of ladies' fashion articles they are the teachers who make the widest school he urged under their influence the fairest work of nature takes an added loveliness to them we owe the enticements of the tea gown the soul compelling whisper of the silk petticoat what other apostle of beauty can hope to shed beauty in every home into how many homes do you suppose your ballades will go he was chatting to a poet but the poet became diffuse conrad returned to his hotel not wholly dissatisfied with the impression he had made upon the poet in la rue du haut pav he had one or two vigorous thoughts concerning the vanity of versification which he wished had occurred to him in the cabaret and when he had lit the lamp he began to write you can know very little about him if you are surprised to be told that what he wrote was verse it was of course a monody to his boyhood as his age has not been stated and he had begun to deplore it so much it may be as well at this point to say that he was thirty seven a less venerable figure than you have pictured him perhaps despite the chambermaid there were however hours when he felt a hundred he felt a hundred towards the close of his stay in paris he had resolved to go back to london but it had few associations for him and he packed his portmanteaux drearily on the evening before he crossed his thoughts flashed to a little english watering place where he had spent a summer when he was still proud of wearing trousers he recalled the moment of his invitation the thrill of its unexpectedness a nursery and four children three of them his cousins departing for the seaside next day in fancy already on the sands and one of the trio had exclaimed was it ted who began it one of the trio had exclaimed wouldn't it be jolly if con could come too he was con he was con hanging over the banisters breathless five minutes later for nina and 'gina and ted had descended to the drawing room tumultuously to prefer a petition to ma ma says there wouldn't be beds enough they announced with long faces mounting the stairs and then he stammered that he had expected there'd be something like that and they danced round him in a ring crying we made it up you're to come with us if you may you're to go home and ask the nursery was very clear to him he saw the gleeful group on the threshold again and the bright pattern of the wall paper he could see the open window with the radiant sky across the roofs so they had all gone to the seaside together he and nina and 'gina and ted in charge of the governess and the house had turned out to be a school called mowbray lodge but the boys were away jack the dog had been lost on the journey and killed the schoolmaster's chickens when he was restored the rows there used to be with the master mr boultbee that was his name there was a yellow field blazing with dandelions conrad remembered and behind the shadow of the fir trees apples swayed he remembered the garden of rose villa next door and the afternoon when mary page kissed her hand over the fence mary page on a sudden how close it was all except her features her hat trimmed with blue and her dangling plaits and the vibration of the time ted and he were enslaved by her equally without bitterness and used to show each other the love letters she wrote to them both after they went home and oh how they longed to be back and oh the plans they made which never fructified for husbanding their pocket money and taking her by surprise one brilliant morning qu'est ce que vous m'offrez monsieur payez moi un bock hein no said conrad starting run along and play there's a good child these memories had come to him at the bal bullier and the band was banging and the petticoats were whirling and a young lady was asking to be refreshed chapter ii she pouted a protest at him and whisked into the dance he observed that she had graces and heaved a sigh for the time when it would have been piquant to brush the pout away to night it would be tasteless kissing a cocotte is like eating tinned salmon said conrad to himself regretfully and went to the vestiaire for his overcoat the interruption had jarred him but it was not until the closerie des lilas was a hundred yards behind that he knew he had left the hall for the purpose of resuming his reverie in comfort when he reached the boulevard saint michel his interest in the projects of five and twenty years ago was again so keen that he grieved to think they had been fruitless improving on history he permitted the boys who were boys no more to amass the sovereign that they coveted and giving his fancy rein lived through the glorious day which had never dawned he tried very hard to be fair to ted after mary had welcomed them though to prevent the conversation becoming a dualogue irked him a good deal in moments he discovered that he was talking to her rather well for his age and then he corrected himself with loving artistry but he could seldom find it in his heart to correct mary and she said the prettiest things in the world he came back to the present swimming with tenderness for the little maiden of his retrospect it shocked him to reflect that she must be about thirty eight if she lived still and might even have a marriageable daughter the pathos of the marriageable daughter indeed overwhelmed him and taking a seat at the taverne du panthon he pictured himself waking to realise that he was only twelve years old and that all events subsequent to the epoch had been a dream the october air was bleak when he crossed on the morrow and the deck rolled to meet the splashes of the waves the idea of revisiting the watering place and the idea had germinated attracted him less forcibly as his chair played see saw with the taffrail but he remembered that he had often been advised by advertisements not to risk infection from foreigners when he could winter in sunny sweetbay the fairest spot in england the fact that it had a reputation as a winter resort encouraged him somewhat and by the time he saw the lamps of charing cross he felt adventurous again he also admired a girl on the platform there's nothing like an englishwoman for beauty he said and the girl exclaimed oh i've left my little fur in my grip right there he fulfilled his programme the next morning the drowsy station of sweetbay seemed to him larger than of yore as he glanced about him but he did not stop to gather information in the matter his bag was in the fly and he was rattled to an hotel where the manager appeared surprised to see him although his sensations on the boat had left him with no insistent longing for a room with a sea view he accepted one without complaint and learning that luncheon was being served descended to where three despondent looking visitors were scattered among an acre of tables evidently people continued to go abroad in spite of the advice however he had not come to sweetbay for society it was a neat and decorous little town awaiting him when he sallied forth from the hotel everything was very clean very tidy the pink paved sidewalks bordered by trees glistened like coral the snug villas enclosed by euonymus hedges trimmed to precision had a fresh and wholesome air an air that made him think of honey soap and good rice puddings he backed before the walls of the parish church a play bill of the rosery theatre near by seemed an anachronism and even as he recalled sweetbay it had been content with assembly rooms on a hoarding he saw a poster of the pier pavilion the pavilion was an innovation too in the high street photographs of some popular actors had invaded a shop window and he was struck by the extraordinary resemblance they bore to one another all wearing on the brow the frown of intellectuality and carefully disordered hair the town hall was a landmark he murmured matthew arnold's line expressive merely of the impotence of the architect to express anything but the unparalleled ugliness of the building warmed him with recollections he branched to the left as he used to branch to the left when he carried mary's bathing shoes and surrendering himself to sentiment unreservedly now swung joyously for eden and from this point landmarks flocked thick and fast the way began to climb the hill the hill began to show the boughs the boughs began to veil the road the road began to woo the lane the lane began to near the house and like the old woman's pig conrad got over the stile and mowbray lodge was still painted on the gate it was all so wonderfully the same for a moment in the shade behind the fir trees so wonderfully that he felt tearful the scene had stood so still that there seemed something unreal in his returning here a man again he saw the slender columns of the long veranda and the summer house on which the weather cock still perched he looked and looked wide eyed at a faded door not green not blue and knew suddenly that behind that door there should be currant bushes and a tangle of nasturtium and hens prinking on the path his soul embraced the scene and yet and yet it was not the features which had lived in his mind that moved him most the magic lay in the pervasive hush and in a gust of the fir trees' smell which he had forgotten until it swept him breathless across the years yes there seemed something unreal in his standing here a man his spirit was listening and he knew that it was listening for calls from children who had grown to middle age now his gaze was waiting even he knew that it was waiting for the rush of childish figures which the scene should yield presently he sought the space where they had played but the field of the cloth of gold was transformed where the dandelions had spread their splendour for mary he saw a market garden and the sun that had made a halo for mary glittered on glass there was a quantity of glass there were consequential rows of it all raising money for somebody all reminding the pilgrim that meadows move with the times well i suppose it's progress said conrad shaking his head but he missed the dandelions he was a conservative by instinct though he was a liberal by reason when he loitered back to the view of mowbray lodge a lady of the age which it is gallant to call uncertain had come out on the veranda she had a little shawl over her shoulders and in her hand she held a pair of scissors with which she was clipping a palm the placid gaze she lifted to him was not discouraging and advancing towards her with a bow he said pray forgive me for troubling you but may i ask if mr boultbee lives here now n no answered the lady pensively no gentleman lives here 'mr boultbee' i'm afraid i don't know the name are you sure he is still living in the town i am sure of nothing replied conrad it is so long since my last visit that i am even doubtful if he is living at all she seemed to reflect again and said perhaps they might be able to tell you at the post office it really isn't important he declared though i'm obliged by your suggestion to confess the truth i am more drawn to the garden than to mr boultbee years ago i spent a summer here and being in the neighbourhood again i couldn't resist the temptation to come and dream over the top rail of your gate oh er would you care to look round the place she murmured with a tentative wave of the scissors i should be charmed said conrad if i am not intruding of course you don't see it to advantage now last month she moved across the lawn beside him telling the falsehoods with which everybody who has a garden always dejects a visitor he affected that thirst for knowledge with which everybody who is shown a garden always rewards a host it's a long time since you were here i think you said she remarked pleased by his eagerness it is said conrad in his most byronic manner just a quarter of a century the lady looked startled and he continued with a sigh yes i was then in that exquisitely happy period of life when we just begin to know that we are happy you may imagine what memories are stirring in me 'i can recall nay they are present still parts of myself the perfume of my mind days that seem farther off than homer's now ere yet the child had loudened to the boy' that poem lowell's 'the cathedral' flashed into my mind as i came upon your parish church awhile ago and 'gazed abashed child of an age that lectures not creates' at its old honours i quoted the best part of a stanza to myself in the street i'm afraid that is a habit of mine it must be very nice said the lady apprehensively yes indeed it appeared that she was no more acquainted with lowell than with mr boultbee so gliding to a subject which lay quite near his heart this afternoon he introduced a third name when i was here last a dr page occupied the villa across the fence he went on he had a daughter to be prolix he had several daughters but to me his family consisted of miss mary we were engaged i won't ask you if they are there still something warns me that they are not but can you by any chance give me news of them i am sorry i cannot she returned fluttering there has been no dr page in sweetbay i am almost certain there has been no dr page in sweetbay since i settled here i am positive there is none now quite positive there's dr hunt there's dr tatham she recounted laboriously the names of all the medical men practising about the town while he wondered what she was doing it for i thank you heartily he said when she reached the end of the list the next moment it became evident that she in her turn had a question to put for her glance was interrogating him already and at last she faltered pardon my asking you but did i understand you to say that you were h'm engaged to the daughter of dr page twenty five years ago surely when you said you were a child then it was no figure of speech no answered conrad but to be frank with you it was nothing less than the thought of her that lured me back to day let me admit that i wasn't quite ingenuous when i spoke of of 'being' in the neighbourhood i came deliberately in fulfilment of a cherished plan to me your garden is a tomb if i may say so without depressing you it is the tomb of the used to be we were both children but there are some things that one never forgets 'i'm not a chicken i have seen full many a chill september and though i was a youngster then that girl i well remember' holmes wrote 'gale' not 'girl' otherwise he might have been speaking for me such constancy is very beautiful breathed the lady i thought she paused slightly pink but it was unfair he assured her men can be quite as constant as women especially to the women they never won er perhaps you would like to see the house she inquired and you will allow me to offer you some tea before you go i accept both offers gratefully said conrad he followed her into the hall and she conducted him with little prefatory murmurs to such of the apartments as a maiden lady might modestly display repapered and rearranged they looked quite strange to him but the knowledge that he was in mowbray lodge averted boredom you find them altered she said as they went back to the drawing room improved said he and the town she added no doubt you find the town improved too altered said conrad thinking of the market garden well it is certainly bigger the rapid development of sweetbay can astonish none who bear in mind its remarkable combination of climatic advantages but the sylvan fairness of the town is not diminished and it continues to present an unrivalled example of the 'rus in urbe' responded the lady with surprising fluency do you take sugar and milk ah thank you he said are you making a long stay among us or a very brief one indeed i thought of returning to morrow oh there was a tinge of disappointment in her oh i wondered if you meant to stop if you had meant to pass the winter here but i daresay you would have preferred an hotel anyhow i don't understand he said sipping what is it you were going to be good enough to suggest it occurred to me that as the house has so many associations for you you might have liked to take it for a short term i am trying to let it furnished during the next few months and i could leave the servants my cook has been with me now you would let this house to me exclaimed conrad thrilling and saw such splendid visions that for quite a minute he forgot to attend to her if the rent is too high she was regarding him nervously not at all he cried not at all i was simply lost in the effulgent prospect that you've opened to me really it was an inspiration how kind of you to mention it she deprecated gratitude there would be no children of course she said her gaze dwelling among her china four he answered promptly that is the youngest must be about thirty five now i beg your pardon but i have had an inspiration too i'm dazzled by the idea of peopling the house with the men and women who were children here five and twenty years ago i dare swear my relatives have never set foot in sweetbay since we'll be comrades all over again you know how time loosens these childish ties in the very place in the very rooms where we were such comrades then why it's the most delightful plan that was ever hatched he hesitated i wonder if they'll come how about the trains one of my cousins would have to go up rather often i expect the railway company has combined with mother nature and a spirited corporation to render sweetbay attractive to the jaded londoner the service is fast and frequent and well appointed 'flys' may be chartered at most reasonable fares replied his hostess without an instant's pause how convenient said conrad what more can he want if you think your friends may need persuasion i should be pleased to present you with a copy of a little work of mine to send them it describes all the attractions of the neighbourhood and it's quite unlike the usual guide book it is thorough but chatty my aim has been to inform the visitor in a sprightly way an authoress he said warmly of one book only she murmured her face suffused by an unbecoming blush but of many readers i'll be bound if obstacles arise then it shall be your pen that conquers them you overwhelm me with kindnesses i really think though the address will be magnet enough for the friends i want 'mowbray lodge sweetbay' how they'll stare 'bring your spades and pails' i shall write 'come and let us all be boys and girls again' the girls have little girls and boys of their own now no don't be afraid of their smashing that soul stirring chelsea my dear madam i won't have them that's the essence of the contract the new generation must be left behind there must be we four and nobody else the four who will find their childhood waiting for them here just the four who can feel the enchantment of mowbray lodge so it is settled as far as she smoothed her gown oh naturally there must be references and inventories and all sorts of tiresome details and with your permission we will get them over as soon as possible i shall have the pleasure of writing to you to morrow to whom miss phipps she intimated and mine is 'warrener' stay i have a card but by the way when did you propose to let me come in miss phipps would next month suit you she asked perhaps you would prefer it to be early in the month i wouldn't disorder your arrangements for the world yet i own that 'early' has a musical ring it would be agreeable to arrive before the colder weather there are places in england where winter's cold blasts seem never to penetrate and where birds and flowers go on singing and blooming in defiance of the calendar she rejoined really said conrad still and among such places concluded the lady firmly sweetbay is pre eminent but you will let me give you another cup of tea chapter iii he could not persuade himself that the invitations evoked enthusiasm indeed two of them were declined at the beginning only nina accepted at once she wrote how on earth did you find sweetbay again is it still on the map yes i will come and with 'no encumbrances' but i won't promise to be rural so long as all that if i were you i would arrange with the stores for constant supplies can you depend on the cook regina was obviously indignant at the exclusion of her husband she replied that her cousin's remembrance of their childhood was quite touching this was underlined but though i fully understand that toto's presence would spoil your romantic plan i cannot pretend to forget that i am now a wife conrad conrad was perturbed he drove to regent's park and showed the letter to nina and she said that her sister couldn't forget she was a wife because she had married a remote relation of lord polpero's they have stayed at the 'abbey' my dear at least she tells me they have as often as she condescends to dine with us regent's park is 'so far away' from their poky little place in mayfair she can just call it 'mayfair' without getting a remonstrance from the postal authorities an 'abbey' has been too much for her of course polpero is a pauper and the abbey's a wreck but i believe she slept with the family tree over her bed it's about the only tree of polpero's that the woodman has spared but 'gina feels norman conrad was still perturbed he hastened to appease regina and moderating his desires implored toto to spare her to him just for a week or two toto said promptly that to spend a couple of months at sweetbay was exactly what she needed for her cough so she was won and there remained only ted to conquer as a young professional man with nothing to do ted had naturally been slow to answer the letter young professional men make a point of delaying a long time before they answer letters it shows how busy they are after they have plenty of work on hand they answer more quickly when he wrote he declared that the notion of renewing their boyish memories in such tranquil quarters appealed to him more forcibly than he could say but he was so terribly hard pressed that he feared he would get no change until he ran over to monte carlo at the end of the term he was at the bar waiting for briefs conrad called at his chambers and bore him off to dinner ted was fortunately independent of his profession and his immutable purpose was to convince people that it was wearing him to death in the restaurant he bent over his melon a brow corrugated by the cares of imaginary suits he frowned at his soup through a monacle as if he were perpending an opinion but it was a dinner of supreme excellence and then they adjourned to the club if it had not been ted's club too and socially undistinguished conrad might have aspired to greater favours now invite a man to a club for which he is ineligible himself and he will remember you with kindliness no less often than he drawls a fellow was telling me in brooks's the other day before they parted ted had consented quite cheerfully for the later ted and all was well so the evening came when conrad sat in mowbray lodge looking forward to the morrow and the arrival of the train due at twelve fifteen and he looked forward with more eagerness because the evening strange to say was rather melancholy and the knowledge that he was going to bed in the room where he had slept as a boy induced a mood totally different from the mood he had expected of it he did not feel a boy as he sat in the silent house by a bad light listening to the rain patter on the shrubs on the contrary he felt increasingly old and increasingly mournful while the long evening wore away the dreary lamps depressed him and the sad tick of the clock and the ceaseless dripping of the rain sent him to the whisky bottle after breakfast next day he bought lamps several of them with duplex burners the roads were a little sloppy but the sky was blue he was gratified to reflect that his cousins were doubtless blinking in a black fog the permanent pleasure of wintering in the country is the thought of how unhappy our friends must be in town in the forlornest watering places of the south coast you may notice on a fine november morning people folding newspapers briskly and looking heavenward with a twinkle in their eyes they are all returning thanks for the sufferings of their friends in london the train due at twelve fifteen wound into view at twelve thirty five they were there nina alert a smile on her thin shrewd face regina with an air of having travelled under protest ted bowed beneath the weight of the law courts so you've come at last what a loathsome line who's looking after the luggage is there a cab to be had well of course do you suppose it's a village how hot it is you must be smothered in those furs dear this to nina from 'gina 'gina was always expensively clothed and badly dressed but she couldn't vie with the regent's park sables you must be half dead she insisted compassionately it's as warm as the riviera we boast of it in our advertisements said conrad but it isn't how did you leave toto and the family he heard that it was a fine day in town too and secretly resented the fact the party drove away another fly rumbling with the baggage in their wake the lane he exclaimed as he sprang out and it's the same as ever i don't remember it a bit said all three gazing about them vaguely the garden he displayed it in triumph i fancied it was quite big said nina funny how wee children's eyes exaggerate isn't it but she had not really been so wee as all that the hall where boultbee was always ragging us because we didn't wipe our shoes he had thrown the door open before the maid could run upstairs who was boultbee asked regina what a memory you have they lunched and they were blithe at luncheon they discussed a divorce case in smart circles regina said hurriedly that there was another side to the story she knew no more about it than she had read in the papers but she now moved on the confines of smart circles and there are people who can never accustom themselves to advancement pecuniary or social her husband is such a scamp she explained such a scamp i don't defend her but there's so much that never came out in court dear lady marminger her mother was always against the match she always felt it would be fatal i recollect when we were staying at the abbey once she was the most obnoxious variety of snob the middle class woman who has married into the fringe of society if she had written novels everybody in them who wasn't a duchess would have been a duke one of the cleverest things ever said in the divorce court ted began judicially was when hollburn was cross examining oh the scamp theory is worn out struck in nina when a woman has married a scamp her family feel provided with an excuse for everything odious she does all the rest of her life was when hollburn was cross examining he was not to be put off they were nina and 'gina and ted and conrad welcomed them with both hands but he caught himself thinking that for any influence the surroundings had upon the conversation he might as well have invited them to princes' he took ted to see the summer house when luncheon was over the summer house in which they used to have their conferences when they were such chums and ted was a disappointment the summer house had withstood the years but the chum had gone he was affecting interest and it hurt it hurt horribly because he was ted and they were where they were he was led to rose villa where mary page had lived the sound of its name had made their hearts ache once and the same name was on the same gate post visible to the same eyes he passed it by telling casual falsehoods about the extent of the practice that he hadn't made and when the post was pointed out he murmured oh is it by jove maintained a perfunctory pause for ten seconds and broke it with well as i was saying afterwards they all sauntered to the esplanade and conrad owned to himself that it was no animated scene but the sun shone bright and when there is beautiful weather in sweetbay it almost compensates for the absence of everything else there like spring he observed isn't it probably there's a fog in town by now or it's beginning to snow we're all well out of it y e s replied nina you don't find it a little depressing seeing so many people in bath chairs do you 'so many people' regina was derisive i've only seen seven human beings since we arrived still the seven were all in bath chairs said nina one expects to meet people in bath chairs at the seaside conrad pleaded but not sick people she said here they are conscientious it's a pretty little band stand what time does the band play it'll begin in june i think he answered june cried regina it's not the season he pointed out of course it's quiet just now i don't wish to cavil said ted with a forbearing smile but when you tell us it is not the season i am struck by a slight discrepancy in your statements a few minutes ago you told us it was a winter place well so it is but it's first of all an english place you mustn't ask for bands to discourse in band stands all the year round my dear fellow such things don't happen a 'town band' enlivens the streets once a week i believe i'm not an authority yet i only came down yesterday morning and i've been setting my house in order there's a theatre he added hopefully we might drop in to night if you like i can't say what is going on there but we'll ascertain they spied a framed play bill in a confectioner's window on the way back and stopped to examine it though the piece was familiar to them and the names of the company were strange they crowded before the play bill cheerfully until they discovered that it bore an ancient date the theatre they learnt was now closed excepting for an orchestral concert every thursday evening this was saturday we'll have a jolly evening at home said conrad there isn't a billiard table i suppose inquired regina i'm an awful swell with the cue i make them play every night at the abbey when we're there polpero chaffs me about it immensely he's one of the old school sweet but of the old school it's such fun i chaff him back toto roars the inventory had not included a billiard table but he remembered after dinner that he had seen a pier pavilion advertised and his guests seemed encouraged when he mentioned it regina said it was fun to be bohemian sometimes the place looked less animated still when they sped forth to be bohemian its aspect was no longer sedate it was bereaved the vacant high street mourned behind its shutters at the quadrant a forsaken policeman kept a doleful eye on space everybody must be on the pier said conrad as soon as we turn the corner we shall see the lights their feet sprung echoes in the stricken town as they pressed forward and through the gloom that veiled a moaning sea the pier became distinguishable but no light was on it save the light of a misty moon no gas jet glimmered among the globes on either side the pay box was black and tenantless the gates were locked against them leant a lonely board announcing a refined entertainment for the twenty second evening of the previous month the desolation of the scene was tragic their return was made in silence and the first thing happened that recalled the days of their childhood here they all went to bed early nina wanted to know if she could be given another room the next morning she remarked that the slowest railways always made the most fuss and that a train had been rehearsing outside her window half the night it rattled and snorted and clashed and clanked till three o'clock she acknowledged conrad's regrets and assurances with a plaintive sigh and shook her head feebly at her coffee cup it was raining that it can rain in sweetbay for a fortnight on end with no longer intervals than the entr'actes at a fashionable theatre is not distinctive the idiocrasy of sweetbay is that it recommences raining twenty times a day as if the deluge had bee hoarded for a year it rains as if the heavens had fallen out nina and 'gina who had ventured into the lane between the showers were drenched before they could gain shelter and they were taciturn when they had changed their clothes the rain was still pelting when ted went up to town on monday and a vicious wind lashed sunny sweetbay when he came back on tuesday the ardour of the flood abated but the fairest spot in england was sodden under a persevering drizzle and a letter by the evening post made regina nervous about the health of her baby toto seemed a good deal worried she said and she thought under the circumstances she ought to be at home she departed on wednesday in a cataract do you think she's good looking asked nina she is not good looking said conrad reflectively but she's so convinced that she is that she almost persuades you in moments that's it nina assented she attitudinises as if she were a beauty when they're shown photographs of her with her face bent men are quite eager to know her of course the baby's bosh i'll confess that i'm not anxious about the baby myself i'm afraid she found it rather slow here i got punch for her at the station and a servant went round before breakfast to order a foot warmer it's necessary to give notice when you'll want a foot warmer but it was weak reparation you were all very good to come if there were anything to read in the house i wouldn't mind so much she said i mean i wouldn't mind the weather if it ever leaves off we might go and try to find 'a select library in connection with mudie's' there are heaps of books in the house i can lend you all the poets i would rather have something to read she said thanks do you think if we found one it would be open oftener than once a week you mustn't misjudge the town by the theatre he expostulated that the theatre only opens once a week is due to a combination of circumstances that i don't know anything about but i am sanguine of the shops opening every day how long are you saddled with the place for her tone was sympathetic i'm not sorry i took it he answered of course everything is more or less a disappointment except the unattainable when columbus reached the new world at last the aborigines said 'well what do you think of amurrica' he said 'i thought it would be bigger' a bird in the hand is not worth two in the bush on the contrary a lark in the sky is worth two in the pudding if you ever scratched those pretty hands of yours getting a glow worm out of a hedge you know that when you have brought it home you wondered why you had given yourself so much inconvenience to acquire the little impostor possession strains it depresseth her that gives and him that takes while it was in the hedge the glow worm shone no less divine than the poet's star where was that she said in a fable did you think i meant a star of the music halls they weren't the fashion in poetry yet he was a glorious poet enchanted by a star of the heavens he stretched his arms to it he sang to it nightly and for his sake the star 'stooped earthward and became a woman' and then the day came when the woman asked her lover which was best 'the star's beam or the woman's breast' 'i miss from heaven' the man replied 'a light that drew my spirit to it' and to the man the woman sigh'd 'i miss from earth a poet' m m that's rather sensible admitted nina i like that i suppose it can't be really great poetry what get on my nerves so in the poetry of the really great are those irritating words that i knew were coming like 'porphyry' and 'empyrean' and 'bower' and 'nymph' and then there are the titles they always sound so dull because i never know what they mean well go on talking to me about eleven o'clock the downpour ceased and presently a timid sunbeam played upon a puddle they went out to look for a library at noon there was no need for umbrellas the librarian was a listless young woman of superior manners when not occupied among the literature she assisted in the fancy department while nina was lingering at the shelves three other readers went to the counter and the first lady said good morning i want a book something er rather exciting the young woman threw an omniscient glance at the collection and plucked the lady read the title aloud is this rather exciting oh yes madam that is very exciting oh she ruffled the pages irresolutely it's not very long she murmured haven't you anything longer the young woman plucked is this rather exciting asked the lady the librarian assured her that it was no less exciting than the other novel oh said the lady 'the face in the drawer' oh i'll take this one then you know the address don't you good morning the requirement of the second lady was something pretty not too short to last me through the week conrad almost expected to hear the librarian reply that they had a very durable line at three three but she plucked again shall i like it inquired the lady trustfully the young woman listless but confident told her that she was certain to like that you're sure said the lady oh very well then i'll have it good day the third subscriber was still more free from the vice of favouritism she simply stated that she wanted a nice book to read the librarian handed a book to her and she accepted it as unquestioningly as if it had been stamps in a post office in not one of the three cases had any author's name been mentioned there are popular writers there is a public besieging the libraries for their work but the literary choice of the nation is bulk for its twopence and the tale admired by the young woman at the desk i hope you haven't been bored said nina at last holding out half a dozen volumes to be carried for her not in the faintest degree cried conrad but he was exceedingly bored on the morrow when ted returned to dinner with elaborate excuses for bringing his visit to a sudden close yes the host was bored then he knew so well while he responded what a nuisance and of course it can't be helped that ted was not in the least needed in town only dull in sweetbay they were all to have gone together to the orchestral concert and when the barrister alleged that he felt too worn out conrad was not pressing nina went with him alone and they walked some way before they spoke she understood that he was hurt dimly she understood that he had shown a stronger affection on his side than they had shown on theirs so the experiment is a failure con she said he sighed i'm afraid there's no other word for it it was rather idiotic of me i might have known you'd all be hipped oh i don't think it's that she declared as a professional man ted isn't free she was ever ready to disparage regina but she had a soft spot in her shrewdness for ted of course she added after a moment his going means that i shall have to go too i can't stay with you by myself ridiculous as these things are no i thought of that he said i'm sorry i'm sorry you're going nina it's no use trying to persuade him i suppose if you told him you didn't want to go every woman is to be touched by oral sentiment excepting the sentiment of her lover whom she does not love that irritates her to brutality nina wavered i might she owned perhaps he could arrange it would be very nice of you he said and really when you get used to sweetbay you'll find it has a a certain charm hallo what's the matter here are we too soon they were opposite the theatre but the building was dark his heart sank he felt that the stars in their courses were fighting against him it isn't open said nina superfluously we must have come too soon he urged let's cross over and see what time it begins for a minute or two they peered at the glum frontage puzzled and then they descried affixed by its flap to a large door a small envelope it was an official announcement on the envelope was written no concert this evening they turned away and moved in reverie towards the sea which shimmered within sight on the long lamp blurred stretch of asphalt no one moved a mile of downcast lodging houses veiled in gloom kept hopeless watch over a blank parade in their dim fan lights the legend of apartments looked the emblem of despair to the right the black pier slumbered silently to the left a lugubrious hotel unpeopled and unlit imparted to the view the last symbol of disaster on a sudden spasmodically in the wide spread desolation the town band burst into the overture to zampa it was the jocularity of hysteria at a funeral nina gave a gulp and clutched his arm conrad she quavered let me go home to morrow or i shall cry he did not plead with her he recognised that there was some justice in her plaint he promised that she should go by an early train and his kindness cheered her she came down to breakfast with her hat on she too had punch and a foot warmer and again he doubted if they were adequate to exculpate him try to bear no malice he begged on the platform you'll dine with us as soon as you come back won't you she laughed good bye old chap exclaimed ted he had risen quite vivacious mind you look me up when you're in town let me know well ahead and i'll manage a spare evening i expect i've left a lot of things behind said nina brightly bending to the window you might tell the servants to send them on yes i'll tell them are you sure you don't want any more papers we're a long time starting aren't we said ted you're just off conrad answered it was less than a week since he had loitered on the other side impatient for their arrival he forced a smile and stood bareheaded and turned from the station with a sigh 'oh near ones dear ones you in whose right hands our own rests calm whose faithful hearts all day wide open wait till back from distant lands thought the tired traveller wends his homeward way helpmates and hearthmates gladdeners of gone years' where are you said conrad chapter iv he felt very lonely something of the christmas spirit descended on him the true the unacknowledged christmas spirit in which after we have directed the last stack of cards and hurried out aglow with the last parcel we sit before the bare mantel piece discovering that most of our acquaintances have become too advanced to observe the season we are quite sure it is advancement though it looks a little like stinginess he wondered as he entered the lane whether the other child he was remembering would have proved a disappointment too wondered if the ache in his heart would be intelligible to her or if he would appear to her absurd it interested him to wonder conjecturing the disposition of the strange woman whose whereabouts he did not know he endued her with many attributes that he admired and she moved before his mental vision gradually as a fair and slightly pathetic figure prepared to be his confidante he fancied she was unhappy with her husband at least the sadness of life had touched her enough to tinge her sentiment with cynicism and she had flashes of wit on rainy days it surprised him that he had made no attempt to trace her his curiosity was awake many things were more unlikely than that she was living in the town as he passed rose villa he was in two minds about ringing the bell and trying to gather information from the present occupants he would probably have obeyed the impulse but while he hesitated the householder came out a middle aged little man with a sanguine complexion and gaiters conrad accosted him excuse me he began the gentleman saluted with his crop 'morning he said i was looking at your bell with the idea of troubling you with an inquiry about a 'missing friend' may i ask if you happen to know the address of your predecessor here dr page who said the little man briskly dr page no don't know the name took the place of people called er greames agents might tell you chipper and stokes in the high street page doctor n no he shook his head sorry i thank you not at all neighbours i think sir for long no it's a very temporary pleasure of mine said conrad congratulate you said the little man if your friend was a doctor probably knew better than to stop much misled myself recommended here for my health most in ju rious damp sir sweetbay is damp they call it a 'humid atmosphere' 'humid atmosphere' be damned sir take your clothes off the peg in the morning and wring 'em out that's not a humid atmosphere it's a death trap you astonish me said conrad i understood the climate was so salubrious that the inhabitants would all live to be a hundred if they didn't die of the dulness young he lifted his hat i am obliged pleasure said the neighbour er hope we shall er er i hope so too smiled conrad er no doubt 'morning said the gentleman saluting with his crop it was discomfiting to find the occupant of mary's former home so completely ignorant of mary such ignorance there on the very threshold in view of the sun shutters that had framed her face seemed rather callous of him as conrad watched him swagger up the lane he resented the usurper's privilege to stretch his gaitered legs on the hearth to whose history he was so utterly indifferent somehow the drawing room looked emptier still to conrad for the colloquy when he went indoors in the violent disassociation of the next house from mary page this one seemed suddenly foreign to him suddenly he felt that he had committed a fatuous and a mournful act in taking it sweetbay had meant to him four persons and of these three had fled and the fourth was lost why should he stay here he thought vaguely of a little dinner at odd and even's and a stall at the alhambra he nearly stretched his arm for the time table and all the while the melancholy that oppressed him urged him to remain and find mary his mind demanded her more insistently than before it was no longer a whim it was a strenuous desire after all it would be a crazy thing to go to london for pleasure he mused i'll hear what the agents have to say he strolled to their office after luncheon and a small boy told him that mr stokes was in for once conrad chafed at the local languor the torpid tradesmen unconcerned whether he bought or not had amused him but the heavy young man who gazed at him with vacant eyes was irritating dr page echoed the young man dully rose villa there was a dr page in esselfield wasn't there i don't know said conrad perhaps you can tell me where is esselfield that's along the esselfield road said mr stokes with deliberation what do you want to know for i'm trying to learn the address of a friend who has moved conrad explained labouredly polite oh y e s he paused so long that it seemed doubtful if he would speak again there was a dr page in esselfield i can't say if he's there still the gentleman i mean was well he must be an elderly man said conrad he could not remember in the least how dr page had looked he wished he knew his christian name an elderly man he had a family they used to be at rose villa next door to mowbray lodge i'm talking of years ago a good many years ago perhaps your partner might be able to assist me major bompas lives at rose villa now said mr stokes his tone was a little firmer the tone of one who says a helpful thing and he took it of people called 'greames' i know all that dr page had the house before the greames oh murmured mr stokes did he y e s no i couldn't say i'm sure mr greames lived there before major bompas mr greames was there a long while back dr page lived there in let me think where are we now it must have been in eighteen seventy seven oh gawd said the young man faintly for the first time an expression humanised his countenance an expression of dismay tempered with entertainment it made conrad feel prehistoric eighteen sev enty sev en i'm sure i couldn't tell you who lived there then a snigger escaped him there was a dr page at esselfield he repeated he may have been at rose villa first is there any place in the town asked conrad with frank disgust where it's possible to see an old directory i shouldn't think averred the heavy young man that a directory was published in sweetbay in 'sev enty sev en there was nearly a twinkle in his eyes thank you said conrad good afternoon he went forth to seek the esselfield road incensed as well as disappointed now 'seventy seven who was this blank faced dolt to jeer at 'seventy seven sweetbay had been an infinitely more attractive place in 'seventy seven than it was to day the high street bored him as he walked once it had been stimulating replete with interest and now it was unworthy his attention he looked at it as a young girl looks at a married man there was a fresh coloured woman dandling her baby behind the glass door of a baker's shop as he passed and he recognised with a frown that she had not been born in 'seventy seven it was a small matter but it depressed him more the sepulchral window of a monumental mason caught his glance overhead was the inscription established he wavered in his course and entered the interior was like a premature graveyard ranged with marble tombstones waiting for allotment and brittle wreaths lamenting the dissolution of beloved relatives who were still alive there seemed to him something appropriate in pursuing his investigations among the tombstones but though the business had been established in the mason himself proved to be very recent when he realised that his interlocutor was not there to give an order the sympathetic droop of his bearing evaporated and he straightened into a careless soul to whom the mention of 'seventy seven was almost as disconcerting as it had been to mr stokes the esselfield road was thick with mud after the heavy rains his long tramp for he had learnt that it was necessary to walk had no enlivening effect on conrad's mood nor was the village cheering when he reached it a few houses were scattered beside a common some geese waddled around a pond beyond an inn a labourer in his cups shouted a refrain of the london music halls conrad went into the bar parlour and asked for beer in the sensitiveness to his years which was being so rapidly developed in him he observed with satisfaction that the untidy proprietress was middle aged yes there had been a dr page she told him not what you might call a regular doctor he didn't do nothing she believed he had moved into sweetbay so as to be near the sea i understood that he moved here from sweetbay an elderly man he had a family said conrad with fatigue there was two young gals she agreed they was always about 'about' he murmured picking and skating and that i used to say they was never at 'ome oho said conrad and added to himself the younger children grown up girls of spirit when did they leave he continued oh it must be a long time she answered she turned to a man who had the air of being her husband 'ow long is it since that dr page was 'ere pa dr page drawled the man wonderingly oh it's a long time ago yes she repeated it's a long time ago but roughly how long persisted conrad w e ll it must be eight years or more she said visibly resenting an occasion to be definite in his soul he groaned if eight years seemed so remote what would they think of twenty five again he was bowed beneath the sense of senility you don't happen to know where he settled in sweetbay he proceeded she shook her head she had no idea at all neither of the pair had any idea so he finished his ale and paid for some cigars which there was of course no need to smoke the lamps were winking through the dusk when he drew in sight of sweetbay at a stationer's he bought a directory of the current year and studied it at the counter it contained a captain page and john page milkman he found also miss page ladies' outfitter and mrs page laundress but there was no page of promise among the leaves he availed himself of the opportunity to inquire again concerning the likelihood of his discovering an ancient copy of the work but at his reference to 'seventy seven the stationer too fell agape it recurred to conrad that in connection with mr boultbee the post office had been suggested physically he was tired by now but mentally he was unflagging and he bent his steps to the general post office forthwith the clerk who sold the stamps to him couldn't say she retired however to repeat his question to the postmistress and it was at this point that the outlook brightened the postmistress was a young and gracious woman in a pink blouse and she came forward with a confident smile to inform him that dr page was no longer a resident of sweetbay but had removed to redhill redhill he had not suspected that anyone ever got out there an elderly man he had a family he reiterated with exhaustion two young girls oh yes she nodded that's the same very pretty tall young ladies they were always in and out really said conrad mary's sisters began to beckon to him can you help me to communicate with dr page we have the address he left with us the one we used to forward letters to i don't know if he's there still she confessed the limitation of her knowledge with regret it's some years since he went from sweetbay perhaps you would be so merciful as to give me the one you have i am an old friend of dr page's family very old and till providence directed my steps to you i despaired of finding them again he outlined the difficulties he had encountered but he had grown diffident of mentioning 'seventy seven the postmistress laughed quite mirthfully at his recital which encouraged by her appreciation he falsified sufficiently to make amusing after bidding the clerk turn to a book she announced to him that the address was home rest peregrine place and the assurances of his gratitude seemed amply to repay her conrad went to bed with much more exhilaration than he had looked for the day after all had seen something accomplished within his head when he punched the pillow the project of running dr page to earth on the morrow promised agreeable developments at the onset the interview would be a trifle embarrassing he foresaw inasmuch as the gentleman on whom he intruded would certainly have no recollection of his name but the ice would break under a few suave references to my first visit to the neighbourhood since i was a boy and my little playmates of long ago he would put her in the plural his inquiries could be concentrated gradually if mary herself were living in redhill he might remain there he would intimate that he thought of doing so it would forefend the suspicion of impetuosity the sun was shining when he woke the birds chirruped among the fir trees and there were echoes of old time music in his heart while he brushed his hair until he fought to draw up a sailor's knot under one of those double collars that have led to so much domestic unhappiness at the breakfast table he travelled by the south eastern and chatham but he reached redhill and smelt the tannery as he searched for an exit from the station the salient features of redhill are the smell of leather the shrieks of trains and the all night barking of mongrels he was directed to station road and told to bear to the left the townlet seemed to him to blend the most unpleasant characteristics of clapham junction and hanley in the potteries he started briskly the way was long and several times he paused to seek further information occasionally a carriage passed the occupants with protesting noses by degrees all the villas and the pavement dropped behind him the smell of the tannery was fainter and the path on either side was bordered by a hedge from the altitude of a butcher's cart a boy in blue encouraged him with the assurance that peregrine place was straight on presently the way wound and a terrace of small semi detached houses with little front gardens gladdened his view as he drew close he saw home rest painted on the gate post at the corner outside in the sequestered road a venerable tenant with a velvet skull cap and silvery hair was pottering around a camera at conrad's approach he lifted his head and regarded him with gentle curiosity the sight of the blue eyes and placid face seemed suddenly familiar to conrad he felt far off memories stirring in him as his gaze met the old man's features and doffing his hat he murmured with the deference that sat so well upon him dr page i think heh said the old gentleman inclining the other ear you don't know me said conrad wistfully but in a louder tone we haven't met since i was a boy dr page that's many years ago the old gentleman indicated home rest impatiently next door he snapped dr page lives next door conrad retreated with hasty apologies feeling considerably foolish he would have preferred to stroll awhile before repeating his exordium and only the consciousness of being watched by the old gentleman who had misled him constrained him to unlatch the gate a neat servant answered that dr page was not at home he was relieved i'll call again he said when do you expect him to come in oh he's away sir he won't be back for two or three days would you like to see mrs page sir he had no remembrance of a mrs page but there was the objection to travelling fruitlessly and the thought that a woman would be susceptible to the prettiness of his visit he hesitated he answered that he would the girl conducted him to a small cheerless drawing room and returned to say that mrs page would be down in a few minutes there were antimacassars everywhere and the cold white mantelpiece exhibited the perpetual porcelain courtship which has never advanced the amorous male still smirked inanely and the simpering maiden seemed still to hope conrad was much attracted by a large album that reposed on an occasional table he sat tempted to unclasp it and had just risen and made a tentative step in its direction when he heard the doorknob move the lady who came in seemed to deprecate her entrance she was evidently timid and she blinked he thought at first that she suffered from some affection of the eyes but when she spoke he opined that the blinking was due entirely to nervousness mr warrener she said in a whisper mrs page he began i must crave your pardon for intruding on you in this fashion it's very audacious of me because even when i tell you who i am i daren't suppose that you will recollect me her eyelids fluttered more and she said wo won't you sit down she wore mittens and plucked at them thank you instinctively he lowered his voice as if he were speaking to an invalid my excuse is rather unusual i hope it won't appear to you preposterous when i was a boy your children and i used to be bosom friends and i found myself in sweetbay the other day for the first time since i needn't tell you that i went to look at the house and the desire to to find them all again was very strong i was fortunate enough to learn that you had moved to redhill so i decided to risk your ridicule and throw myself on your forbearance oh not at all she faltered i i'm sure i her nervousness seemed increased rather than diminished by his address there was an awkward pause i trust dr page and and my former comrades are all well oh thank you yes they are all quite well he wished that mary's were not the only name among them he could recall all well he said forcing a hearty note all well it's strange to me to think of them as grown up time er brings many changes madam indeed she concurred timorously as you say but she volunteered no news and he began to feel that they were getting on slowly his harassed gaze wandered to the china courtship may i ask if they are still with you he ventured my eldest daughter is married she replied the others are i hope very soon i er don't quite understand when it was you knew them while we were in sweetbay i think you said yes he answered musingly when the daughter who is married was a little girl mrs page to think that she's a woman and a wife why miss mary and i were like brother and sister then how wonderful it would be to meet her now my daughter's name is ursula she demurred she blinked fast there was another pause 'ur ursula' stammered conrad with the precursory sinking of an awful fear miss mary not the eldest but surely at rose villa she was the eldest at home during that summer at least i think there must be some mistake she quavered i have no daughter 'mary' i think there must be some mistake good heavens gasped conrad he was covered with confusion my dear madam what can i say to you i i have been most shamefully deceived i knew the family of a dr page in sweetbay in 'seventy seven i was assured i was officially misinformed that they had removed to redhill this house was mentioned to me as their residence i am abased i can't sufficiently express my regret possibly i'll say 'probably' my informant was led astray by the sameness of the surname and the profession but nothing can excuse an error that has caused you so much annoyance nothing he repeated implacably i can only offer you my profoundest my most contrite apologies the lady was now blinking so rapidly that it was dazzling to watch her my husband never practised in sweetbay the said my husband's name is 'napoleon page' we had never seen sweetbay in 'seventy seven our house was not called 'rose villa' oh dear no i'm afraid there must be some mistake obviously cried conrad it overwhelms me i shall severely reprimand the person who who is responsible permit me to thank you for the patience the infinite courtesy with which you have listened to my my totally irrelevant reminiscences i pray don't trouble to ring madam his cheeks were hot when he gained the step he walked towards the station swiftly eager to leave home rest and redhill far behind long after the train for which he was obliged to wait had started the incident continued to distress him he smarted anew in the compartment he was even denied the unction of feeling he had made a satisfactory exit and the certainty that the lady would describe his later demeanour as flurried annoyed him more than he could say in the presence of his fellow passengers to fall into the mistake was natural he argued but he wished ardently that he had extricated himself from it with more grace with more of the leisurely elegance he could display if the situation were to occur again well he had done with his search for mary he said he abandoned it in disgust and was still firm on the point when he reached mowbray lodge he began to reconsider packing his portmanteaux for two days he made no further inquiry of anyone and lingered as it were under protest yet in england at least he might spend december amid worse surroundings than sweetbay presented now he owned that from the chief thoroughfares the last speck of mud had long since been removed the pink sidewalks shone as spotless as when he trod them in october the air was tender there was an azure sky a sunlit sea curled innocently upon the beach yes of a truth he might fare worse if it were not for the dulness he could scarcely fare better on the third afternoon as he sauntered through the high street it occurred to him that it could do no harm to announce his failure to the mirthful postmistress he did not pledge himself to resume his efforts but it certainly was very dull and if he were more explicit she might be able to give him another hint she recognised him at once and advanced sparkling as before did you find your friends sir she asked as he saluted her i did not said conrad but i intruded on an inoffensive household who were perfect strangers to me the dr page whose address you very kindly furnished was not my dr page at all oh dear how very awkward she said i am so sorry it was awkward wasn't it he concurred of course i threw all the blame on you so they forgave me but i'm now quite helpless my friends seem to have vanished as utterly as if sweetbay had closed over their heads and to complete the difficulty this family of spurious pages arose since i foresee that as often as i make another attempt i shall be directed to redhill i didn't like to tell you before because it makes me sound so old but the people i mean are the pages who lived here in 'seventy seven i beg of you not to jump everybody jumps that's why i have grown so nervous of mentioning the date her eyes were full of amusement she leant her elbows on the counter i wasn't in the office then she said reflectively naturally he returned you must have been in your cradle i was only a little boy they were companions of my cherub stage believe me i was rosily young there's a gentleman in the town who might be able to tell you something she suggested mr irquetson the vicar of all saints he has been here thirty years or more really exclaimed conrad and added it's a shame to be beaten isn't it oh it is she agreed and he's a very nice gentleman he'll be glad to help you if he can well i think i'll go to see him if he has been here thirty years he can hardly fail to remember the dr page i'm talking about he glanced at the clock do you think he's likely to be in now i should think the morning would be the best time sir she answered but you might try it isn't far if you'll wait a second i'll write the address down for you you are too good said conrad impressively his pulses quickened at the chance instantly the thought of quitting sweetbay was forgotten again he thanked her and again she bowed graciously over her pink blouse as he withdrew when he turned at the doors she was bowing still they swung to behind him and he wished he had reported himself to her three days ago what amiability he had never seen anything to compare with it in a post office as he strode towards the vicar's he was possessed by amazement the experience had an air of the ideal as everybody will admit probably the mirthful postmistress was the only member of her calling ever known to exhibit a pleasant countenance to the public excepting but the exception merits a paragraph to herself and as she has nothing to do with the story you are recommended to skip to the next chapter excepting a little lady who once brightened the ancient post office of southampton row the post office have i said rather should i say she brightened the district with that sunny smile of hers and the daily flower freshening her neat little frock to watch her it seemed she found long hours in the cage the very poetry of bread winning dull matrons from russell square and tired clerks from guilford street alike felt the encouragement of her cheerfulness and went on their way refreshed one may well believe she was the unwitting cause of many kindly actions in west central london for a crowd was ever at the counter and the sourest soul of all on whom she smiled must for a space have viewed the world with friendlier eyes often i used to wonder as i bought a postcard and waited for the farthing change whether it was interest in her duties or the message of the daily flower that kept that light of happiness in the girlish face when she vanished southampton row was grey they repainted and replanned it and built spruce hotels and pink mansions but nothing could make good the loss it was whispered she had left to be married all bloomsbury must hope that he is kind to her chapter v and after that little tribute which has been owing for more years than it exhilarates me to count and which has been paid with no expense to anyone who followed my advice let us overtake conrad on the doorstep where he had just learnt that the vicar was at home the rev athol irquetson was a sombre eyed priest with a beautiful voice in his zeal he had studied how to use it under an eminent actor in his discretion he suppressed the fact for he knew his sweetbay he had also a fine faculty for gesture which his parishioners found impressive and which they would have found theatrical had they guessed that for years it had been cultivated daily before a looking glass why invalidate an instrument to admiring friends he said his gestures came to him they did by this time he waved conrad's apologies aside and motioning towards a seat sank slowly into a study chair himself conrad ardently appreciated the pose of his hand there as a pensive profile supported by his finger tips the vicar asked in a voice to make converts and what can i do for you yes he remembered dr page dr page was dead but soon it was the vicar's turn to be appreciative for the intruder's glance kept straying to the canaletto prints that graced the walls and it was a rare thing for mr irquetson to have a visitor to whom they spoke those glances warmed his heart and a digression melted his reserve there are not many he said but i think my small room is the richer on that account surely said conrad if a picture is worth owning it is worth a spacious setting a mere millionaire may buy a gallery but it takes a man of taste to hang a sketch i have always thought that a picture calls for two artists one to create it and the other to prepare his wall for its reception but how little the second art is understood of course the eye should be enabled to rest on a picture reposefully the custom of massing pictures in conflicting multitudes is barbarous it's like the compression of flowers into bundles that hide half their loveliness the western mind is slowly learning from the japanese that a flower ought to be displayed so that we may appreciate its form i have hope that when they have taught us how a flower should be put in water they may proceed to teach us how a picture should be hung quite ten minutes passed in such amenities yes dr page died long ago said the deep voice again but the subject was resumed in a manner almost intimate his wife was living in malvern i think there was it was common knowledge at the time some domestic unhappiness late in life or perhaps it would be more correct to say that it culminated late in life for like so many mighty issues i believe it originated in a seeming trifle he was a man acutely sensitive to noise and his wife was decidedly a noisy woman i remember his remarking once that if she but touched a cup it had a collision with all the china on the table and that a newspaper in her hands became an instrument of torture no doubt he could have controlled his irritability but by all accounts his temper grew unbearable however the news of his death must have been a blow to the lady for he died suddenly soon after they had separated death is a wondrous peacemaker the gravest offence looks smaller in our eyes when it is too late to condone it yes assented conrad 'and i think in the lives of most women and men there's a moment when all would go smooth and even if only the dead could find out when to come back and be forgiven' that is a beautiful thought said the vicar or speaking more strictly i should say it is an ordinary thought beautified from one of owen meredith's early poems isn't it but do you remember those lines of coventry patmore's to the dead 'it is not true that love will do no wrong poor child and did you think when you so cried and smiled how i in lonely nights should lie awake and of those words your full avengers make poor child poor child and now unless it be that sweet amends thrice told are come to thee o god have thou no mercy upon me poor child' oh exclaimed conrad exquisite i used to read coventry patmore all day do you know 'departure' 'with huddled unintelligible phrase' ah surely his hope was not vain the posterity he respected will respect him but but he bubbled i am so glad i came my dear sir you enchant me your recognition of owen meredith alone would make the interview memorable ah returned mr irquetson with a whimsical smile there was once a time when i read much poetry and wrote much verse and i have a good memory i remember his trained gaze took in the name which he had forgotten on the card i remember mr warrener when i used to pray to be a poet do you think prayers are ever answered inquired conrad in my life i have sent up many prayers and always with the attempt to persuade myself that some former prayer had been fulfilled but i knew i knew in my heart none ever had been things that i have wanted have come to me but i say it with all reverence at the wrong time as the means to buy unlimited toffee comes to a man when he has outgrown his taste for sweets mr irquetson's fine hand wandered across his brow once he began conversationally i was passing with a friend through grosvenor street it was when in the spring the tenant's fancy lightly turns to coats of paint and we came to a ladder leaning against a house that was being redecorated in stepping to the outer side of the ladder my friend lifted his hat to it you may know the superstition he was a 'varsity man a man of considerable attainments i said 'is it possible that you believe in that nonsense' he said 'n no i don't exactly believe in it but i never throw away a chance' on a sudden his inflexion changed his utterance was solemn stirring devout 'i think sir that most people pray on my friend's principle they don't believe in it but they never throw away a chance' he had said it before the whole thing was too assured too finished for an impromptu but the effect of that modulation was superb all the artist in conrad responded to it and when they are sincere he questioned after a pause for they are sometimes your walls remind me how passionately i prayed to be a painter and your own prayers i take it came from the soul when you craved to be a poet but should i have been more useful as a poet it wouldn't have contented me to write let us say 'the better land' and more minds are to be influenced by simple sermons than by great poetry you think perhaps that as a painter you would have been happier but perhaps you wouldn't we are often like little children petitioning their parents for the dangerous i will not suggest that a merciful god chastises us to demonstrate our error but many an observant man must have noticed the truth that what we have desired most strenuously often proves an affliction to us while the only sunshine in our lives is shed by the thing which we prayed might never come to pass yes said conrad thoughtfully i have seen more than one example of that but if we are mere blunderers beseeching in the dark if we are like children importuning their parents without discernment as you say isn't the act of prayer futile isn't it even presumptuous mr irquetson raised his head his eyes looked upward no pray he said and the melody of his tone gave glory to a commonplace pray he repeated and conrad wanted to kneel to him then there on the study floor one day perhaps you will afford me an opportunity to make my thoughts on prayer quite clear to you pray but with fervour and with sense with humility sir i cannot reconcile my faith in an omniscient creator with the idea that it is necessary to advise him we need rain in rutland but i'm withholding the little information that i am able to give you i was about to say that mrs page so far as i know lives still in malvern or perhaps it was matlock and the eldest girl mary interposed conrad quite so 'mary' mary married some time before her father's death and is settled in london i think my wife would know her whereabouts better than i she is friendly with a resident who has some fitful correspondence with mrs bailey 'mrs bailey' is the eldest girl's married name well it used to be replied the clergyman with another of his smiles but i was wrong i should have said 'mrs barchester bailey' she acquired the 'barchester' after the ceremony i cannot supply its exegesis the result of six months in the capital i suppose though it is not everybody who can make such a great name in london in six months much may be done in six months his parents gave keats to the world in seven said conrad i am infinitely grateful to you for your kindness he rose if mrs irquetson should mention mrs barchester bailey's address to you and you would have the additional goodness to let me know it i will drop you a line to night or to morrow at the latest declared the vicar and he pencilled the direction on the card good bye said conrad i shall always be your debtor for more than the address sir good bye said the vicar extending his hand and 'good bye' as he pronounced it was a benediction conrad had been so much impressed so uplifted by the cleric's manner that instead of swinging homeward in high feather at the end of his difficulties he proceeded slowly in serious meditation it was not until the following afternoon when he learnt that mrs barchester bailey's residence was beau sjour hyperion terrace upper tooting that interest in his project was again keen then there was a little throb in his pulses a little tremor stole from the note he had annihilated the obstacles of five and twenty years it excited him to realise that he stood so close to her who had been mary page the barchester however disturbed him somewhat a woman who reverenced apocryphal hyphens promised less companionship than he had pictured perhaps the snobbishness was her husband's tooting he had a dim recollection of driving through it once on his way somewhere was it to the derby well he supposed the correct course would be to write to her and hint at his return to town he wondered whether the signature would waken memories in her if she perpended it unless it did the letter was likely to prove a failure he could not indite a very stimulating epistle to a married woman of whom he knew nothing yet to call on her without writing no he must stand or fall by the signature that would say everything if it said anything at all how stupid in the circumstances dear madam sounded and what a stumbling block it looked dear madam he wrote though i cannot hope you will be able to recall my name i think you may remember mowbray lodge i have regretted very much during my visit that mrs page is not my neighbour it would have given me so much pleasure to call on her and to meet the family who were such very good comrades of mine in the year when this house was a school kept by mr boultbee and a posse of children came down for the summer holidays perhaps the names of my cousins nina and 'gina may be more familiar to you than my own at least those old time friends of yours have shared my disappointment it is only since they left that i have had the good fortune to hear your address mentioned will you pardon a stranger writing to express this vehement interest on the part of people whom you have probably forgotten if i debated the matter for long my courage would desert me and i should leave my cousins to make their own inquiries next week when i go back to town on the other hand if you and your sisters remember us pray believe that none sends kinder regards to you all than yours truly conrad warrener come i don't think anybody can take exception to that mused conrad and he sent it to the post with a line of thanks to mr irquetson on the next evening but one he began to doubt if she meant to reply it seemed to him the sort of thing a woman would acknowledge immediately if she didn't mean to ignore it altogether yet why should she ignore it silence would be rather uncivil wouldn't it a humiliation needlessly inflicted if she had reasons for wishing to decline his acquaintance it was quite possible to prevent his advancing and to frame an urbane answer at the same time had he said too much about nina and 'gina appeared too much in the light of an amanuensis surely she had the wit to understand four or five days passed before he tore open an envelope stamped with the initials mbb the enclosure began dear sir and his brows contracted dear sir he read i was very surprised to receive your letter what a long time ago is it not it is very nice of you all to remember us after so long i left sweetbay at the time of my marriage and have been living in tooting some years now my mother has removed to matlock if you or your cousins are ever in the neighbourhood i shall hope to have a chat over old times please give them my remembrances with kind regards yours truly mary barchester bailey there were only three wrong ways of beginning a response three blatant solecisms and she had chosen one of them when she wrote dear sir conrad was disappointed the fair and slightly pathetic figure of his dreams grew fainter his ideal confidante didn't make these mistakes he put the missive in his pocket and drew dejectedly at his pipe of course i shall go ran his thoughts but i've made rather an ass of myself taking such trouble to find her chapter vi the man to whom he gave his ticket at the station of balham and upper tooting told him that he could walk to hyperion terrace in about ten minutes he perceived that he would reach the house too early if he proceeded there at once so he strolled awhile in the opposite direction the pavements were dry and he was thankful for he had seen no cab when he came down the station stairs and he would have been chagrined to present himself in muddy boots when he estimated that he would arrive at beau sjour none too soon to be welcome he retraced his steps and now anticipation warmed his blood once more after all she was the woman who had been mary page it was a piece of his boyhood that awaited him indeed he was repentant that he had cavilled at minor defects by dint of inquiries he found the way to hyperion terrace it was new and red and all that a man who could call a street hyperion terrace would naturally create a very small servant wearing a very pretentious cap showed him at once to the drawing room where the soul's awakening met his distressed view on a pink and gold wall paper he heard flying footsteps overhead sounds of discomposure there are houses at which a visitor always arrives too early his nerves were tremulous while he sat alone but mary's home would have pleased him better if it had been no more than a single room with a decent etching over a bed masquerading as a sideboard and half a dozen shilling classics on a shelf mr warrener how d' ye do she advanced towards him with a wide smile a large and masculine woman wearing a vivid silk blouse and an air of having dressed herself in a hurry she wore also with a droll effort at deception a string of pearls which if it had been real would have been worth more than the street for an instant his heart seemed to drop into his stomach and in the next an overwhelming compassion for her swept him he could have shed tears for her as he took her hand and remembered that she had once been a dainty child mrs barchester bailey so good of you to let me call oh i'm sure it was very kind of you to come she said won't you sit down how very odd that you should have been living in mowbray lodge isn't it quite a coincidence yes he said yes i wanted a place there and mowbray lodge happened to be to let for a few months it was the first time i had been to sweetbay since that summer your old house looks just the same the outside at least i've not been in it really she said yes does it yes and the lane looks just the same too until you get to the field and then then there isn't one but perhaps that had vanished before you left no there was no change when i was down there last but that's a long while ago horrid old place i'm very glad there's nothing to take me there any more didn't you like it he asked pained oh it was so slow i wonder how i put up with it as long as i did didn't you find it slow i must have gaiety people tell me i'm a regular gadabout but she laughed one's only young once mr warrener i believe in having a good time while i can i say i shall have plenty of time to be on the shelf by and by she was very very plain it was while he was thinking how plain she was how ruthless the years had been to her that the sudden pity for himself engulfed him the pathetic consciousness that she must be reflecting how hard the years had been on him it can't be difficult for you to have a good time he returned labouredly light well i don't think it is she declared she tossed her large head and rolled colourless eyes at him archly people tell me i've quite woke tooting up since i've been here and i must say i've done my best i must lead i mean to say if i'd been a man i should have liked to be a great politician or a great general you know you could be nothing more potent than mrs barchester bailey oh now that's very sweet of you she said but i mean to say i must lead i started the tooting 'thursdays' you mustn't think i'm just a frivolous little woman who cares for nothing but pleasure i'm i'm very interested in literature too at the 'thursdays' we have literary discussions next week the subject is miss verbena's novels now which do you think is miss verbena's greatest novel he could only assume that she never saw a comic paper i i'm afraid i haven't read any of them he owned oh oh you surprise me oh but you must they're enormously clever ettie verbena is quite my favourite novelist excepting perhaps that dear man who writes those immensely clever books that never offend in any way so pure they are such a true religious spirit in them you know mr warrener i'm a curious mixture people tell me that i seem to enjoy myself just as much talking to a very clever man as when i'm romping through a barn dance and it's true you know that is me but i suppose you're more interested in stocks and shares and things like that than in books well i i shouldn't describe myself as widely read answered conrad still books do interest me oh well then you must come on one of my at home days next time she said graciously one of the ladies you'll meet writes for 'winsome words' and you'll meet several people you'll like i should be charmed he said the servant bustled in and carried a bamboo table to the hearth as she threw the teacloth over it a cold wind blew through his hair do your cousins live in london inquired mrs barchester bailey with the tail of a worried eye on the maid's blunders yes he said yes they do but i haven't seen them since i came back i'm not sure whether they're in town are they married yes he said again oh yes they're married both of them where are they she asked anywhere this way no unfortunately they're a long way off that's the drawback to town isn't it everybody lives at such a distance from everybody else oh i don't know she said one can get about so quickly nowadays what part are they in nina lives in regent's park he replied where the mists are oh really regent's park she seemed impressed i was wondering whether she would care to join our thursday debates we want to get as many members as we can two of the ladies come over from wandsworth but from regent's park it would be a drag certainly shall i put in sugar and milk please he took the cup and sat down again and knew that he had entered on that grade of society where there are no more men and women and they all become ladies and gentlemen and the other one 'gina she continued he felt very uncomfortable he wouldn't say mayfair 'gina lives further west he murmured no i won't have any cake thank you then your cousins are quite high up she exclaimed 'high up' they're quite swells oh he shrugged his shoulders no i don't think i should call them that too swell for me rather but then i'm half a colonial and the other half a bohemian i haven't been home long it's all strange to me until i came out here to day i had no idea london could be so picturesque how glorious your common must be in the summer so healthy she said promptly the air is so fine we moved here from the west end for the children's sake you have children oh she rolled her eyes again four mr warrener my eldest boy is getting quite big people tell me they wouldn't believe he was mine at all but it makes me feel quite old sometimes to look at him i think it's cruel of children to grow up don't you he stifled a sad assent sometimes they grow up still more charming he said oh now that's very sweet of you now really that's very pretty but i mean to say i think it's cruel to us when they shoot up so fast you're not married yourself yet eh no i hate asking favours what a modest way of putting it but you should a good wife would be the making of you and give you something to think about don't you know that i'm sure of it a man can have no greater blessing than a good wife excepting none he concluded mentally shall i be allowed to see them before i go the children would you like to dudley is out but the others are just going to have tea in the next room my husband isn't back from the city yet of course oh the city what a hold it does get on you men as if it really mattered whether you made an extra thousand pounds one month or not a trayful of crockery rattled and the footsteps of the little servant thudded through the passage you're quite right said conrad what does it matter when one comes to think of it not but what herbert's the best of boys she added if it weren't that she hesitated she endeavoured to look confused the fact is he's he's jealous he's a very jealous man not that he has any reason to be not exactly of course i'm awfully fond of him he's a dear old silly but i mean to say i can't help it when men want to talk to me now can i if i get half a dozen men round me even though we're only talking about the simplest thing he doesn't like it of course it makes it awfully awkward for me socially it must responded conrad yes i can understand that i tell him he should have married a different woman she giggled ah but how unreasonable of you he said then if they won't mind being disturbed i am really to see your children oh they won't mind at all but i'm afraid you'll find them very untidy they've just been having high jinks she led him to them presently and slammed the door behind her it shook his thoughts to the clergyman's description of mrs page heredity again perhaps two girls of about twelve or fourteen years of age and a boy in a pinafore were sitting at a table at their mother and the visitor's entrance they all took their hands off the cloth and stared and so this is the family cried conrad trying to sound enthusiastic how do you do and will you say 'how do you do' to me my little man three limp hands flopped to him in turn and he stood contemplating the group while the lady cooed silly questions to them and elicited dull constrained replies they were not attractive children they were indeed singularly uninteresting children even for other people's whose virtues seldom strike us vividly to conrad who failed to allow sufficiently for their shyness they appeared stupidity personified yes and no they answered and their eyes were round and their mouths ajar like all children from the lower to the middle classes inclusive they proclaimed instantaneously the social stratum of their parents with a monosyllable a child will do this it is by no means impossible for a man to exchange remarks with a girl from a show room and at the end of five minutes to be still uncertain to what class she belongs but when the intrusive little cub in the sailor suit romps up to her he betrays the listless beauty's entourage with the first slovenly words he drops have your cousins any children mr warrener yes he said oh yes they have three or four each he was speculating what individuality lay concealed behind the vacant fronts their mother had been no older than the eldest when he was sick with romance for her oh positively romance although its expression had been ludicrous in that period was it possible that these meaningless little girls also had precocity and sweethearts appalling thought had mary been so unpleasant had he idealised a dirty mouth i should like to see them i wish nina and er 'gina would come over one morning to lunch her tone was painfully eager or i might look them up do you know their 'days' no he murmured i can't say i do i perhaps they'll come with you next time i hope you'll see them sooner it's more than likely i go back to paris in a day or two i only left a few weeks ago i may remain there through the year oh really she exclaimed then you have no business in london mary she broke off impatiently what is it what is ferdie fidgeting about for what does he want jam ma said the plainer of the girls in a whisper what do you say do speak up dear jam ma repeated her daughter he wants jam on the first piece well give him it then only this once now darling you shouldn't tease him so mary remember he's a very little boy mary minor leant towards him and conrad thought she muttered little pig then you have nothing to do in london resumed the lady as he followed her from the room quite all that i hoped to do in london i have done this afternoon he smiled as a matter of fact i don't suppose i shall call on anybody else before i leave but he saw clearly that she wanted to know the women who were high up and he was self reproachful distressed he wished that he had made no reference to them in his letter sha'n't you even go to see your cousins she persisted but you say you're not sure if they're in town if they are any day would suit me if they would drop me a line no he said i'm not sure i haven't heard from either of them since they left sweetbay he was at the point of mentioning nina's address he reminded himself that he had a duty to nina too yet a moment later he succumbed the remembrance of what he had written even civility itself prevented his parrying so keen an aim as mrs barchester bailey's he mentioned the address and he said how pretty the plain children were and regretted that her husband was not in he sat smiling at boredom for five minutes longer and when he escaped at last he had the reward of knowing that she thought he admired her very much he had owed her that as he felt the air in his lungs he thanked heaven well he would explain the occurrence to nina who would consider him an idiot and tell her to expect a speedy visit the rest lay with the visitor herself with her powers to please for his own part never never did he want to see her again he walked fast her image still pursuing him what an exhausting woman he dined at his club and wondered if it would be bad taste for so new a member to make a complaint to the committee afterwards he drifted into a music hall where quailing brutes who had been created to scamper on four legs were distorted to maintain a smirking brute who was unworthy to walk on two the animals' sufferings diverted the audience vastly and the applause sickened conrad more than the club dinner and though his disappointment at tooting may sound a very trivial matter it continued to depress him he was sad not because one woman was different from what he had hoped to find her but because the difference in the one woman typified so much that seemed pathetic to him in life and to sneer at him as a sentimentalist absorbed by opal tinted sorrows blown of indolence would not be conclusive it is of course natural that those of us who have to struggle should set up the man of leisure as a figure to be pelted with precepts indeed we pelt so hard at the silver spoon in his mouth that between the shies we might well reflect that ethics is often an alias of envy but with conrad the leisure was quite recent and the sentiment had ached for years in his case wealth had not formed a temperament wealth had simply freed it let us accept him as he was my business is to present not to defend were tales tellable only when the hero fulfilled both definitions of the word reviewers would have less to do if i could draw a frontispiece should enlist your sympathies for him conrad and the coquette for that is youth a laughing jilt showing us her heels and tempting over her dimpled shoulder as she flies this is where you begin to think me insufferably dull i see your fair brow clouding i can see your beautiful lips shaping to say oh bother be patient with me we have arrived at a brief interval in which nothing particular happened it is true that soon afterwards conrad went to monte carlo but details would not interest you in the least be gracious to me yield to the book another finger tip i feel it slipping say poor drivel as it is a man has written it in the hope of pleasing me for he has indeed on many a fine morning i have plodded when i would rather have sunned myself where the band played on many an evening i have wound my feet round the legs of the table and budged not when the next room and a new novel paid for and unopened wooed me as with a siren song and all to win a smile from you i have thought of you so often and wanted to know you you don't realise how i have longed to meet you to listen to you to have you lift the veil that hides your mind from me sometimes in a crowd i have fancied i caught a glimpse of you i can't explain the poise of the head a look in the eyes there was something that hinted it was you and in a whirlwind of an instant it almost seemed that you would recognise me but you said no word you passed a secret from me still to yourself where you are sitting you are just a charming woman with a local habitation and a name but to me you are not miss or madam not m or n you are a power and i have sought you by a name you have not heard you are my public and o my lady i am speaking to you i feel your presence in my senses though you are far away and i can't hear your answer i do wrong to speak like this i may be arraigned for speaking i have broken laws for the honour of addressing you among all the men who have worshipped you has one done more and i will never offend again but in this breathless minute while i dare i would say remember that overleaf and in every line unto the end i shall be picturing you working for you trembling lest you frown unto the end forgive me i have sinned but i exult it is as if i had touched your hand across the page chapter vii conrad drifted from the riviera with the rest and lingered through june in paris not on the left bank this time in the paris of the boulevards and the bois where he was a world away from the quarter where he had run to clasp the illusions of his youth and stayed to mourn them although he was finding life pleasant there were moments when he looked at the bridges and felt wistful but he never crossed one he knew now that he could not walk over the pont neuf into the past nor was it with any definite purpose that he returned to london amusement agreeable society had lulled that desire to revisit old scenes and his experiments had been such failures the endeavour to recapture his fervour as an art student the ludicrous attempt to revive in cynical adults the buoyant comradery of childhood the interest in the little girl whom time had turned into the least interesting of women it was with a mental blush that he recalled these follies if he thought no less tenderly of his youth he thought of it less often if he was still liable to a sense of bereavement he was now idling as conventionally as any other man of his class he arrived in london while the sun shone and told the cabman to drive to the carlton where some americans whom he liked in monte carlo had talked of staying after he had made himself presentable he descended to the palm court and ordered tea since tea was in evidence and glanced round the groups that sipped and chatted his americans were not there perhaps they had been faithful to the american hotel by and by he inquired about them and learnt that they were unknown he was hipped for they had been companionable and one of the women was very pretty he felt rather out of it among the dawdling groups during dinner he asked himself to what theatre he should go he remembered reading recently that a farcical comedy had scored a great success and decided to go to see that one of his oddities was a reluctance to inconvenience people by passing in front of them in a theatre after the curtain had risen so he didn't dally at the table the piece began at a quarter past eight he had a cup of coffee and a red grand marnier and slid into a hansom there would be just time to smoke a cigarette comfortably during the drive hansoms darted everywhere in the pale evening a man and a friend a man and a girl a man going to meet a girl from pall mall the line of liveries rolled up endlessly the broughams and landaus flashing glimpses of coiffures and jewelled ears and flowers where a block occurred in the traffic a young man who had paused on the curb in a dress suit that looked rather tight for him bowed delightedly to the occupants of a victoria and they beamed in response the encounter was gratifying on both sides for the young man had not often occasion to put on a dress suit and his acquaintances had not long acquired a carriage conrad who missed the humour of the incident was again sensible of loneliness in an atmosphere where everybody seemed to know someone but himself but as he passed a barrow at the corner of a side street he appreciated the humour of a costermonger shouting liedy i can sell you some o' the finest cherries that was ever brought into this country when he entered the house the overture was being played and as he squeezed towards his chair a faint hope rose of discerning his monte carlo companions among the audience he sat down between a lady with a moustache and a youth who was trying to cultivate one and scanned the profiles that were visible but there was none he recognised the attendants were still busy in his velvet fauteuil he watched the arrivals almost as eagerly as the poor had watched them on the pavement what white backs the women had when they slipped them out of their cloaks he wondered if it was safe for them to lean against the seats with what geometrical perfection the hair margined the napes of their slender necks how did they do it the rising excitement of the overture warned him that it was about to bang to an end his programme had fallen to the floor he stooped for it with the idea of looking at the cast before the lights were lowered at this moment the lady in the stall next to him took out her handkerchief chapter viii as she did so the curtain went up and showed a divided scene on the right the stage represented the office of a matrimonial agent on the left the office of an agent who obtained reliable evidence for divorce but conrad was not attending the two careers were followed by the same person under different names his introductions in the first capacity led to business in the second he explained this soon after he bustled on and the audience laughed but conrad did not hear the lady still held her handkerchief a scrap of lawn and lace that was scented with chypre and he had been heaved to rouen and was seventeen years old there by the side of the woman we never forget for in the life of every man whether he will own it or not there is at least one unmentioned woman whom he never permanently forgets while he keeps his faculties she may not be the best or the prettiest or even the nicest woman he has loved not her virtues but his madness graved so deep and he will take the impression out sometimes when he has lost his figure and his hair and when a boy who is storing experiences on his own account calls him the governor no her qualities have as little to do with the matter as the date on her birth certificate a woman isn't her age or herself she is what she makes us feel like art and nature like a musical phrase or a line of words like everything of suggestion and mystery the woman her husband hates and her lover adores is an equally vivid personality to both men that to herself she is vividly a third character makes no difference to the view of either of them to say that on the few occasions conrad had smelt chypre during the last twenty years it had never failed to remind him of mrs adaile to say this would be to imply that he yielded himself leisurely to reverie and it would sound truer than the truth but the fact is that there was nothing voluntary at all in what occurred it was a physical swirl that the smell always caused him and it left him vibrant for a few seconds with the very craving the very sickness of the time when he had worshipped her he often thought of her even strummed a song she used to sing but in such moments as these he was less conscious of thinking than of feeling normally he looked back at her with the reflections of a man when he smelt chypre he was near her again with the tremors of a boy life is less consistent than fiction even than tolerably bad fiction what perfume do you use wrote maupassant to a correspondent whom he had not seen but who had made him curious her answer if it hadn't been none would have meant a thousand times more to him than it would mean to the man in the crowd but it might very easily have misled him too in fiction conrad was dimly aware mrs adaile and chypre would never have been associated it wasn't faint enough fresh enough it wasn't matutinal enough for mrs adaile to one who had not seen her it could never be evocative yet perhaps it had been a passing fancy even an experiment in some days that were immortal to him chypre had been her scent the piece became funny by and by and he began to listen to it but though the sensations wakened by the lady's handkerchief subsided the memories did no more than doze between the acts and when he left the theatre they beset him with full force as he strolled to the club he surrendered to them he had recalled mrs adaile so often so often re enacted scenes with her and mocked himself that he had not played them differently that the episode seemed to him by no means so remote as it was it seemed much closer than many episodes that had happened since it was with a shock in the reading room that he counted the years was it possible good heavens how time flew it indicates the fervour of his mood to say that when he made this reflection it had to him a sense of novelty then she must be again good heavens that girl for she had been but a girl although she was married and he had felt himself a child beside her he remembered the afternoon when she came to the hotel and he told his people that the most beautiful woman he had ever seen had just arrived well she figured still as one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen but was that twenty years ago what a babe he had been and he used to believe himself sapient for his age well perhaps in some things how stupid he must have seemed to her for a boy of seventeen yet she used to confide in him on the terrace he could not have seemed so stupid to her after all innocent that night on the terrace always the terrace it appeared when she let him hold her hand and bent her face to him saying a mosquito has bitten me on the cheek look as if it were yesterday he could remember how his heart pounded and the fatuous words he muttered in his tight throat he wished forcefully now that he had had the courage what atom of difference would it make to day yet he did wish that he had had the courage o imbecile but how exquisite it all was if it could only come over again there were no more than two men besides himself in the room one of them was reading and the other slept the silence was absolute until a page sped in to bawl the name of a member who wasn't there and sped forth to bawl for him somewhere else the man who had slept said damn very softly and turned to sleep on the other side conrad lay back in the deep chair and let fancy reign there were many gaps but there were moments that made the calendar unreal he remembered intimately things that she had said to him oddly enough more of the things that he had said to her he stared at his whisky and potash and mentally relived the story and this is the story he relived chapter ix the boy came to the french windows paint smeared and tired he had been to bonsecours where the monument of jeanne d'arc is now and tried to make a study of the landscape from the cemetery on the boat they had no dream of electric trams then the immensity of his failure had filled him with alarm a tall slight woman was standing in the salon with her back to him she wore a pale coloured travelling coat and a hat with a wing in it as his step sounded on the terrace she turned and he forgot the landscape he passed awkwardly and was troubled afterwards by the thought that he should have bowed he said to his mother the most beautiful woman you've ever seen is downstairs i wonder if she means to stay she is staying answered his mother she's grice adaile's wife the man who made that speech in the house the other day well is bonsecours worth going to rather he said he was still thinking of the woman's delicate wistful face he thought of it while he dressed for dinner he had thought of nothing latterly but that he would be studying art in paris soon had wished for nothing but to escape before his parents could withdraw their consent all at once he would have regretted to learn that he was leaving suddenly at table she was opposite him she sat next to miss mcguire he perceived that they were friends and was dismayed for miss mcguire considered he had been impertinent to her and no longer spoke to him he recognised blankly that the beautiful woman would be told he was a cub if he had done wrong his punishment had overtaken him mrs adaile vouchsafed no word to him for days her disapproval humbled him so much that he used to leave the salon when she was laughing with his mother and the rest he hoped she would observe he was humiliated and be stirred with pity it seemed to him he must awaken her respect by the course he was adopting incongruously there was an element of unacknowledged joy in his distress it was not without its exultation to think that mrs adaile was being heartless to him to feel that she was making him suffer but it was with thanksgiving he heard that miss mcguire had said she wished he would apologise she had forbidden him to address her he followed her from the dining room and begged her pardon in the hall she replied you're a nice boy really i'm so glad you've said you're sorry he wanted to tell her that he appreciated her kindness but he could only falter and grip her hand it discomfited him to know that he was blushing in the afternoon he was sitting on the terrace with a sketching block on his knees and mrs adaile came out through the windows she sauntered to and fro he couldn't lift his eyelids when she approached but each time he listened tense with the frou frou of her skirt all his consciousness was strung to the question whether she would stop may i look she said the sensation was in his chest he felt as if his chest had gone she stood there amused by his symptoms for two or three minutes and moved away he was incredibly excited boundlessly happy until he began to think of the better answers he might have made visions of the evening and the morrow dazzled him when he went inside it was not the same hotel to him they were not the same rooms it does not take a woman six days to create a world for any man by the end of the week he talked to her often and freely at the end of a fortnight i used to be afraid you'd never say anything at all to me he owned i thought you weren't very nice she said miss mcguire told you things about me she told me as soon as you apologised to her too i was pleased you did that even if you weren't in the wrong wouldn't you ever have taken any notice of me if i hadn't i did notice you she smiled did you but 'ever spoken to me' i mean i don't know we shouldn't have been such good friends as we are i've never liked any boy as i like you con he ached to tell her how infinitely grateful he felt but he could not find a word they walked up and down together perhaps she understood on a sudden he thought how cruel it was that the end would come when he went to paris or when she went to england in that moment instinct taught the lad as remorselessly as experience teaches man he knew their friendship was the merest incident to her and the hurtfulness of the knowledge squeezed his throat if we meet again one day you'll give me a stiff little bow and pass by he blurted con she murmured why i've become chummier here with you in a little while than i am with people i've known at home for years still instinct was heavy in the boy he always spent the morning out of doors with his brushes soon he found himself restless during the morning impatient to return to the hotel and he did not know he was in love with her it did not occur to him as possible he could be in love with her he had absolutely no suspicion it was still more extraordinary because he had so often thought he was in love and gloried in being so when we are very young half the pleasure of being miserable about a girl consists of exciting comment and pretending to be offended by it yet no idea of falling in love with mrs adaile had crossed his mind perhaps it was because she was married perhaps it was because he was for the first time really in love through most of the stages the boy went without an inkling of his complaint one day his father said to him you've caught it very badly con and laughed a warning the boy was startled he went away bewildered and asked himself if it was true when mrs adaile sat with him on the terrace that night he was self conscious and husky for once her presence was scarcely welcome it rather frightened him though he would have died sooner than admit the shameful word to himself afterwards he did not know how it came to pass but she used to confide to him that her husband wasn't very kind to her he was in london and she sighed when she referred to going home her sighs were very plaintive and her self pity was sincere but it was nothing to the pity that overwhelmed the boy people don't guess how unhappy i am she said to him one evening i wish i were a woman he muttered i can never tell you how sorry i am for you and if i were a woman i could put my arms round you and you'd know it was a beautiful thing to say but he said it badly because he felt it too much to make it effective no woman should deride a boy's love it is ludicrous but it is ludicrous only because it is so genuine he has not learnt yet to trick the truth out he does not know yet that before one could make converts to the very truths of god they had to be presented with art have you any idea when you'll go she inquired he was to travel with a friend who was visiting in england i may get a letter any day he answered are you in a hurry no i thought you were he was dumb i've been quite loyal to you i haven't said a word of what i think to your people when they've talked of you i knew you wouldn't it only needs a word to make them back out i wouldn't let you go if i were your mother supposing i did spoil it all for you how you'd hate me no i shouldn't he said why have you changed your mind then don't you want to go after all i shouldn't hate you because i couldn't hate you whatever you did he explained haltingly yes of course i want to go but but i don't want to go yet they sat down and there was a pause in the pause his consciousness of her presence grew queerly acute almost painful what's the scent you've got on he asked unsteadily chypre she said do you like it she played with a ring she wore and showed it to him he touched the ring and in a tumult of the spirit was holding her hand they sat silent again he knew that he ought to say something that she was waiting for him to say something that his long silence was ridiculous and he could think of nothing to say he was at once tremulous with joy and faint with fear the fear that she would withdraw her hand before his effort had wrenched out words she withdrew it he gazed before him blankly when he was a man and recalled that evening he wondered whether the atmosphere had seemed so much a part of his emotions at the time as it did in looking back he wondered whether in his heartthrobs and his sickness he had been acutely conscious of the black shrubs in the moonlight of all the soft sounds and odours that stole up on the air he thought not yet long after her features which he tried to vitalise were hazy to him he could still see clearly the position that the two chairs had occupied could have sketched the terrace almost with the accuracy of a plan and felt the night air of rouen in his throat presently she said the head waiter thinks some people who came from italy must have brought the mosquitoes in their luggage oh said the boy i believe this is a mosquito bite on my cheek she added look she turned her cheek and leant forward he leant forward too her face had never been so close to him his fingers craved its softness he only realised that with courage he might touch it with a finger and the courage was not there my hand is cold he said hoarsely and afterwards too he used to wonder whether he had been excusing his cowardice to himself or to her and yet it was with no abashment that he tramped his bedroom later it was with an exaltation that panted for vast solitudes the whirl of the unexpected was in his being the marvel of her hand the marvel that she had let him hold her hand uplifted him beyond belief and through all the turbulence of his pulses and his mind there was not a carnal thought not an instant's base imagining he adored her without desire without reflection without asking what he adored when he was alone with her once more during some minutes he tried trembling to examine the ring again no she said gently it's wrong and in the next few days nothing happened one day was like another then the date of his departure was settled he looked for her as soon as he read the news sought her dismayed because he was to go and twice unhappy because on his last evening she would be out she was shopping and he met her at the corner of la rue thiers where the horlogerie is i'm going he said and my chum can't stay here is it fixed her eyes were startled he had never known her eyes were quite so blue yes he's travelling at night and won't break the journey i'm to be at the station at six in the morning he was to be at the station the next morning but one the train reaches rouen at an earlier hour now but the service was a tidal one twenty years ago when she had scanned the letter neither of them spoke for it seemed a long time to him they had crossed the road into the solfrino garden and he stood beside her with his hands thrust in his jacket pockets staring at the little lake so we shall soon be saying 'good bye' she said at last he nodded miserably to morrow evening about nine o'clock he said why so early have you forgotten you're going to a dance with miss mcguire to morrow night i didn't forget i thought of it directly i saw the date what time shall you begin to dress you don't know me very well con after all she murmured his heart leapt he pretended not to understand what she meant don't i he asked why not how could you think i'd go out on your last night here she answered you won't go oh mrs adaile and as they moved away under the horse chestnut blossom it was less dreadful to him that he was going to leave her why did she do it it could not have been to test her power over him it could not have been to wound him wantonly who shall say why she did it a woman is often unable to define her motive to herself two men came into the hotel after dinner acquaintances both and she became engrossed by them and sent up little peals of laughter and seemed to like their admiration which was presumptuously barefaced he sat tongue tied in a corner unwittingly providing equal entertainment for other women in the room though she knew he was suffering she threw no glance to him and that evening the boy entered on another stage the stage of jealousy the fires of jealousy are always horrible and there is none they ravage more fiercely than the lad whose torture the world finds comic there is none because no man nor woman nor young girl in such a pass is so totally defenceless as a lad to none other than a lad when his love is outraged does nature forbid even the resource of simulated dignity his torments are intensified by the knowledge of his ineptitude always present is the thought that he ought to adopt an attitude which he is too raw to discover and he is prostrated in perceiving that beside his glib rival he looks ridiculous and a lout after a clock had struck many times she makes herself too cheap mrs van buren said sotto voce and madame de lavardens assented by a grimace the boy overheard and got up and wandered away a new misery tightened his throat and burned behind his eyeballs she had been disdained his world rocked he was degraded vicariously for her sake degraded that his ideal should afford these people the opportunity to disparage her resentment beat in him he longed to vindicate to lay down his life for her and knew himself a cipher and that the tempest in his soul would be thought absurd disdained it was paramount bitterest the humiliation of neglect dwindled all his pain all his consciousness was the hurricane of humiliation that he felt for her if you weren't so young i should think you were trying to insult me conrad please don't speak to me any more she said next morning when he had made tactless seventeen year old reproaches to her her voice and gaze were cold as if he were a stranger she rose and left him the grace of the slender figure had no mercy in it as he watched the sun was streaming and the birds chirped loud and he thought his heart was broken as he watched he sat looking the way that she had gone for long after the terrace was bare and heavy hours passed emptily and he was still bereft and it was his last day here half of it was lost when wretchedness waylaid her at a door i'm sorry he gulped she bent her head and moved by him without speaking in the group about the tea table she was no gentler the glare of sunshine mellowed his father claimed him and talked with unusual earnestness of ambition and of life his mother wrapt his arm about her waist and was pathetic and confident by turn in the chatter of the salon he heard that mrs adaile was going to the dance from herself he had still no word or look the flush in the sky faded a relentless star peered forth and it was his last day here she went until the final minutes he could not feel that she would go could not believe it until he saw her in the triumphant cruelty of her ball gown with the lilies at her dazzling breast saw her giddily with the long gloves and the fan in her hands the room was full of animation of movement the boy sat mute his gaze fastened on her face the fiacre grated to the curb miss mcguire asked her if she was ready yes i'm ready colonel van buren put the cape about her shoulders she turned carelessly her hand outstretched well i'll say 'good bye' con you've all my good wishes good bye mrs adaile he faltered his eyes implored her but her touch was fleeting the fiacre rattled she had gone and upon the hotel fell a profound and deathly silence he heard nothing damp he was and blind he had seen her for the last time he kept saying it it seemed unreal an impossible thing though the harrowing of it was so actual his mind wouldn't seize it even while the weight of it was grinding his youth for the last time outside he bit hard upon his nether lip to check its silly quivering a myriad stars glittered over rouen now a breeze was blowing across the river there was a roll of wheels approaching foolish as he knew the hope to be he waited strained till they rolled past at the piano miss digby smith was playing ascher's alice his mother joined him and sat there with him and scarcely spoke she took his hand he thought she didn't guess it's late con she said at last hadn't you better go to bed i'm not tired said the boy you'll come to my room as soon as you're dressed in the morning you won't be able to go to sleep again i want you to your father's going to the station with you do you know yes he told me what time the indifference of his tone what time do you think miss mcguire and er mrs adaile will be back not for hours yet she said i daresay it will be three or four o'clock she looked away from him he thought she didn't guess presently the lights were turned out people said good night and bade him good bye but for very shame he would have sat alone in the salon till it was time for him to start sat there just to see the woman pass through the hall in his bed he listened he lay in the darkness listening holding his breath he wanted to hear her come home to hear her would be something the wind was rising and alternately it tricked and terrorised him he trembled lest a gust should drown the faint stir of her return it was a long long while that he had listened sleep pressed upon his eyelids but he would not yield once it was mastering him and he twitched to wide wakefulness in the guilty fear that he had missed her the blustering wind and the clock of st ouen made the only sounds he saw the door opening with the dim notion that he was being called too soon for a mere vague moment which seemed dishonour to him in the next he beheld without realising her he raised himself slowly on his elbows and it thrilled through him that she was moving to his side i've come to say 'good bye' to you con mrs adaile the name was all that he could whisper oh mrs adaile i've been horrid to you haven't i no no he said strenuously it was i i want to beg your pardon forgive me oh you do forgive me don't you it's been awful her hands were swift and live he held them fast the ghostliness of daybreak was in the room in the pallor she sat at the edge of the bed the ball gown wan and the faded lilies drooping at her breast being so young he was shy that his hair was on end and the collar of his nightshirt crumpled i'm sorry she said i've been sorry all the night her penitence started his tears and blinking wouldn't keep them back he wanted to smear them away but he didn't want to let go her hands he turned his head he was ashamed but less ashamed than he would have expected that she should see him blub don't she said and he had never heard that note before you'll make me hate myself i love you he exclaimed i love you sh you mustn't say that con she murmured i love you i love you cried the boy i know she said i know you do and wonderfully there was nothing wonderful to his mind that he had owned it to her at the instant there was nothing but perfect peace you've made me so happy he breathed afterwards that sounded to her a little funny but as she heard him say it she thought it only strange and beautiful something tenderer than liking something graver came into her gaze as she looked down at him i've not been a nice woman to you con she said one day you'll think so i shall never think so he vowed never i deserved you should punish me but that wasn't what she had meant you will think so she nodded only you won't mind then because you'll laugh at it all you're cruel he choked because i'm not a man you think i can't love you really no man could love you better than i do if i could only tell you what i feel i'd die for you i'd do anything for you oh mrs adaile i shall never see you any more for god's sake let me kiss you once quick as her compassion was the misgiving of a boy was quicker in the dizzy second that he saw her bending to him he wondered how he ought to hold her then her bosom fell upon his breathlessness and he went to heaven against her lips i must go she said freeing herself oh don't he begged not yet i must i oughtn't to have come up what shall i do he groaned oh it's awful to be leaving you i wish i hadn't made you fond of me she sighed you didn't you couldn't help it but what shall i do my life's no good to me i shall be thinking of you and longing for you when you've forgotten all about me she smoothed the ruffled hair think of me sometimes when you've got over it she said think of me when you're going to do anything that isn't worthy of you now i shall be true to you as long as i live said the boy understanding mrs adaile it was odd to her ear that he called her that a moment after she had been in his arms what she asked when you go down to breakfast i shall be in paris yes she said shall you read the papers by the window this morning do you want me to yes i should be able to know where you were i will then i shall be imagining you all the time what shall you do this evening reproach myself she said no you mustn't what for will you think of me yes after dinner i'll go on the terrace con and i'll sit there alone wondering what you're doing and thinking of just now and well perhaps i'll say a little prayer for you i must go now say 'good bye' to me i can't he gasped i can't con i must give me something he stammered give me something you've got on she broke off a handful of the flowers they had crushed and stooping took his strained face between her palms and kissed him twice once on the lips and by impulse on the brow then she opened the door cautiously she smiled back at him and stole away into the passage and in the loneliness she left behind her the boy lay kissing her lilies and sobbing with his great despair chapter x across twenty years a man made an obeisance to a woman for risking what she had risked that she might comfort a boy's pain conrad got up from the club chair and crossed over to the bookcase he pulled out the post office directory and it sprawled open on the top shelf would he find the name under a grice ewart adaile mp norfolk street park lane and she was she alive could she be there so close to him as that he mourned to think how different she must be to day the woman had changed and the boy had changed and though he didn't know it the town had changed the most the ubiquitous rush and whir of electric trams the ceaseless clangour of their bells beating through the brain had turned peace into a pandemonium rouen had acquired all the noise of new york without any of its gaiety telegraph wires and telephone wires spanned the tops of the churches and a mesh work of iron ropes obscured the sky he strolled to norfolk street the next afternoon there was a half hope in his mind of finding a carriage at the door waiting to take the lady for her drive if mrs adaile came out oh if mrs adaile came out he would be well repaid it would be exciting to recognise her although she wouldn't recognise him but she did not come out the door was shut fast and no familiar face happened to gaze pensively over the window boxes he was disappointed in the evening he went to another theatre the hero of the comedy was supposed to be a man of his own age and talked about himself as if he were a centenarian he said he was thirty seven and had lived his life and he called the heroine child his hair was silvered at the temples and he depressed conrad exceedingly the situation of norfolk street was so convenient however that conrad took to passing through it rather often and though he was old enough to know better he certainly looked young enough to be the hero's son one day he found the windows of no blank behind shutters so the family had left town he sauntered on and hesitated and went back here was an opportunity to ascertain what he wanted to know he rang the bell and asked a solemn functionary when mrs adaile was expected home i can't say sir said the man mrs adaile is on the continent oh said conrad with a heart prank she did live he vacillated and obeyed a second impulse can you give me mrs adaile's address the solemn person noted the pearl in the stranger's tie the silk lining of the coat he unbuttoned and the direction in which his hand was travelling mrs adaile was in ostend thenk you sir he named the hotel and conrad proceeded to piccadilly enamoured of temptation how tired he was of london in any case he would go away why shouldn't he go to ostend he had never been there and he might sit next to her at dinner it would be an absurdity of course but the hero of thirty seven with hair silvered at the temples admonished him from every hoarding and he took a hansom to avoid his sedate contemporary's reproof entering the club he walked through an avenue of decorators' ladders the smoking room was full of paint and pails what could be more absurd than to remain in town he winced as it occurred to him that adaile might have been married twice supposing the mrs adaile in ostend proved to be a stranger an unfamiliar person profaning a hallowed name how complete a fool he would feel when he arrived but he would not dwell on that contingency far fetched he said even a fate that showered disappointments as freely as if they were confetti must draw the line somewhere he was among the tourists and the luggage thieves at charing cross by ten o'clock next morning when he reached ostend it was a fine afternoon and the town was baking by comparison london had been pleasant so a multitude of londoners had flocked to ostend with trepidation he beheld the hotel that sheltered her what if he were unable to obtain a room in it but no so far so good fate was perhaps napping in the heat a room was to be had he washed his face in no victoriously and overlooked the scarlet geraniums and the faience fountain glistening in a grass plot and the red striped sun umbrellas that sprouted through the little tables nobody was visible among the basket chairs a starling's twittering in a lilac bush was the only voice the number of his room chimed with his mood a happy coincidence to the manager's mind at least he was seventeen again again he stood in an hotel bedroom preparing to join her downstairs had she changed very much presently he wandered into the salon and lounged round the reading room everywhere it was unpromisingly quiet a hint of siesta pervaded the hotel should he go out he sauntered through the hall but the dazzle of the plage blistering in the glare made his eyes ache he went back to the shade and ruffled newspapers and smoked cigarettes a child came into the scorching courtyard that was called a garden and hopped round on one leg and said to another child can you do that the starling twittered imperturbably who said ostend was gay benighted male the women weren't asleep they were all changing their frocks again when he woke he had missed one of the sights of the day the creations that vie with another between five o'clock and seven a gong was booming only the first gong good there was time for him to dress before the room began to fill he sought the head waiter and inquired if a place facing the door could be arranged the headwaiter had house property and two sons at college but he was the urbanest of head waiters a novice tips the servants when he leaves an hotel and if he is a generous novice pays for attention which he hasn't received a traveller of experience tips them when he arrives and gets the liver wing and a seat by the window the second gong was still reverberating when no descended to dinner the urbanest of head waiters hovered on the threshold for scrutinising the company conrad had scarcely time to glance at the menu the doorway was as dazzling as the plage had been a cinematograph of toilettes a succession of audacities only clusters of diamonds seemed to keep some of the bodices up man formed a shifting background to an exhibition of jewels a pageant of skirts and breasts still more gowns the humming room was the apotheosis of clothes until the women sat down and then it was the apotheosis of bosom she came in late she wore white satin embroidered in silver and a collar of emeralds he recognised her at once there was no hesitation in his mind he had expected to hesitate he knew her the instant she appeared she had altered certainly even pathetically the girl of twenty years ago was lost but in the flash of the moment the difference in her face startled him less than the difference in her figure a shade too stout yes a shade too stout for his taste and and had her hair been copper colour in rouen but a pretty woman nobody could deny it she didn't look a day more than thirty five might pass for thirty now the rose glow of the lamps was on her well almost her table was well in view she was with another woman perhaps younger a brunette vivacious and an elderly man with projecting teeth and eyes like a fish adaile how grotesque he must have looked making love he had a nose as long as the one in blake's portrait of the man who built the pyramids and he used to be unkind to her one could read that he was a cold blooded unappreciative stick now he was talking to her on second thoughts perhaps he wasn't her husband he displayed the projecting teeth to her in so many smiles the other woman's husband then quite a good chap in his way no doubt he was doing them very well in the matter of wine would there be a chance to speak to her to night abominably hard lines if he had to wait till to morrow but he wanted to find her alone in the garden for preference in the moonlight no no thirty five but no more not an hour how beautiful she used to be she didn't know she was sitting in the room with a man she had kissed rather an amusing reflection that scores of men in the room though perhaps she did how sick he would have felt to think so once where was the splendid jealousy he ought to feel this evening 'dead as the bulrushes round little moses on the old banks of the nile' he made his coffee last till the party got up and then followed them to the salon the salon did not keep them they drifted to the hall they disappeared the hall was a bevy of women who had been upstairs to put on hats and were desiring to be taken to the kursaal poppa was in constant demand conrad observed that all the family men seemed inclined to loll where they were and that all the unaccompanied men made sprightly departures in the concert room he found her again but he didn't find his opportunity to be sure he had hardly expected one there still he felt rather hipped the last thing at night as he sat among a crowd and the popping of champagne corks in a buffet where the casks were utilised as seats and the ladies' toilettes were as gorgeous and as modest as the ladies' toilettes in the hotel in the morning he met her coming back from the sands with an enormous sunshade in the early bath costume and he met her later wearing a picture hat in the after bath costume also he saw her in the costume she put on when djeuner was over and still she was unapproachable if she proved too elusive he'd be tempted to swim after her next day and try his luck in the water but could he be sentimental with his hair dripping and even in ostend it wouldn't be oh in the wrong key altogether she was scribbling on a picture postcard at one of the little writing tables and there was nobody else there may i remind mrs adaile that i have had the happiness of being presented to her she turned her head and there was approval in the lady's gaze there was however not a scintilla of recognition in it my name is warrener he said oh yes she murmured i'm so short sighted how d'ye do but he saw that she was twenty years away from knowing who he was this is tremendously nice of you he exclaimed i was afraid you wouldn't remember me how absurd she said perfunctorily why shouldn't i we met at but so long ago i was afraid really i've been warning myself that you couldn't be expected to remember and yet i knew i should be so pained if you forgot she made a little amiable movement of her hands he understood it to signify that his doubts had done injustice to them both inwardly he laughed is your husband in ostend mrs adaile no she said no he's in the tyrol innsbruck i'm here with my sister and my brother in law you know them don't you no i've never had the pleasure they weren't with you there ah no she said no they weren't ostend is very dull this year don't you think i've found it very exciting i saw you yesterday at dinner and i've been trying to meet your eyes ever since really said the lady she allowed him to meet them and looked away her expression vacillating between a pucker and a smile my courage wasn't equal to risking a snub from you publicly and you were never alone you balked me last night you escaped me this morning and you drove me to desperation this afternoon i ought to have known you wouldn't forget but i always had misgivings hadn't i had you she said the pucker was getting the upper hand she played with the postcard confess said conrad i remember you perfectly she insisted with transparent hypocrisy but just for the moment i'm fogged where it was we met will it help me if i mention normandy normandy she echoed vaguely rouen the htel britannique a boy who was called 'con' con she cried and the smile had things all its own way with her for an instant the spirit of his youth flashed so close that he nearly captured it you are 'con' still he affirmed earnestly and you are still mrs adaile you are con she repeated wondering that boy and did you remember me directly you saw me last night no i've remembered you all the time ah she laughed reproval what a long while ago that makes it seem the boy never told me pretty falsehoods the boy never told you half the truth he was a very backward boy if we are to be friends you mustn't run him down mr warrener she said i was very fond of con 'rouen' have you ever been there since no i was abroad for years out of europe i mean you were going to be an artist i hoped to be aren't you no i haven't the artist's temperament i'm too constant she regarded the postcard on the table again and he did justice to her eyelashes ostend is going down dreadfully isn't it she remarked all the ridiculous people who have just got titles have brought them here we're leaving on thursday he sighed don't be foolish she said not too flippantly ah said conrad now what a long while ago that makes it seem the boy was not told he was foolish no one could be so unkind to him and he wasn't you'll make me jealous of that boy before you've done don't you believe you could i don't know what you mean she declared you used to take him seriously oh yes we were capital friends did he deserve your friendship more than i you're absurd she smiled her eyes were as blue as they had been in the solfrino garden he looked into them wishing he could feel the despair that had been his that radiant morning is a wretched boy you only knew for a few weeks to be privileged above a man who has thought of you for years within an ace he had said for twenty years but the blunder was nipped in time you mean 'hours' she said we dined last night at eight o'clock it's just four now you don't believe me you think i'm making the most of a happy accident what if i gave you a conclusive an overwhelming proof a proof of what of what that i am constancy itself supposing i told you that my only reason for coming here was to see you again what would you say to that i hope i should answer quite politely she murmured ah you didn't doubt me once he exclaimed with grave reproach you didn't tell such tarra diddles once she urged i came here simply and solely to see you look at me will you give me your hand i want to repeat it solemnly she glanced at the door and yielded him her hand it was very soft and agreeable to hold he continued with no undue haste now holding your hand and with my eyes meeting yours i say that i came here to see you for no one and nothing else that i had no idea of coming to the place till i knew you were here that isn't all he detained her hand gently for an age i have been trying to see you i knew none of your friends it was awfully difficult for me could i call upon you and begin 'once upon a time' should i write to you you might read my note in the wrong mood oh i tell you i racked my brains that isn't all her hand had been retreating again the day before yesterday as i passed your house no you have window boxes the flowers are calceolarias and marguerites this season the day before yesterday as i passed i saw the shutters were closed i rang the bell i deceived your servant i led him to imagine you you would be glad to welcome me i wormed your address from him and threw myself onto the boat rejoicing that isn't all she drew the hand free nevertheless and realising that it wasn't coming back to him yet he concluded but it is enough to show you that you've been cruel at this moment they were interrupted and she said oh let me mr warrener my sister lady bletchworth how d' ye do said lady bletchworth ostend is very dull this year don't you think i've just said that mrs adaile told her it doesn't matter said lady bletchworth it's a very good opening remark and i make it to everybody won't you put me up to the correct answer asked conrad i've only just come and i should like to catch the tone most of them say 'oh my dear' she replied but our latest novelty is 'southend what' mr warrener's people and i used to be very chummy ages ago said mrs adaile i am afraid to inquire mr warrener no he said i i am alone he was quite nice in those days she added to her sister what has spoilt you mr warrener i find my world so sceptical lady bletchworth not here she said they can even believe ostend is smart can you do a sum if 'it takes three generations to make a gentleman' how many shops does it take to make a knight one england said conrad i don't believe he's spoilt after all joan said lady bletchworth there's hope for him yet it's much too early to say that murmured mrs adaile but the glance she cast at him was not discouraging chapter xi the rest of the afternoon promised nothing so conrad bought le marquis de priola to kill time it passed away so peacefully that he was surprised when he found it was dead after dinner he saw the two women on a lounge and they moved their skirts for him and commented on the visitors there was the earl of armoury wearing a stud as big as a brooch and a malmaison the size of a saucer he made grimaces like arthur roberts and when he sang pip pip the lodger and the twins society found him as funny as harry randall as everybody knows the duke of merstham married flossie coburg from the music halls the heir had inherited his mother's gift the best of it said lady bletchworth is that his mother herself has become too prim for words since she has been respectable she asks bishops to dinner and does her hair in plain bands heredity is her cross oh she went on you'll meet all the world and his wife ostend sibly a man brought his wife to the hotel last week and when he went upstairs to bed she wasn't there after he had searched high and low for her he went to the bureau and asked the clerk if he could tell him where she was the clerk hadn't an idea but said that a married lady came to him a little while ago in a fix she didn't know the number of her room and she had forgotten the name of her husband please don't smile i was terribly shocked myself conrad didn't say that the story was not original and had been told about town six months before then lord bletchworth drifted to them and was tedious lord bletchworth twaddled ponderously he considered there was a lot of disgraceful bosh being printed about the service and the country at large in the papers just now my dear sir an englishman who had the interests of england at heart would hold his tongue while she slid down hill and silently watch her bump to the bottom that wasn't how he put it but it was the gist of what he said he added that the battle of waterloo had been won on the playing fields of eton and he seemed as satisfied with waterloo as if it were situated in the transvaal however he had his uses he walked with his wife when they went to the kursaal and left conrad with mrs adaile how quiet you've become she said i am asking myself what to say to you do you find me so hard to talk to i find you so hard to convince why try to convince me why did i come to ostend oh that was a pretty tale she said it wasn't true really was it you know it was true i've looked forward to meeting you again for years i can't tell you how fond i was of you you're the only woman i've ever cared for you were a child and now i'm a man doesn't that show doesn't it prove is it nothing to think of a woman so long as i've thought of you what other man could say to you what i can say but you mustn't say it she smiled it cannot be written that she forbade is your life so full he asked that you have no room for my love mr warrener but really you hurt me he said what have i done since we parted to become 'mr warrener' to you are we going to sit on the terrace said lord bletchworth looking back or are we going inside mr warrener you play perhaps no said conrad i haven't played here i don't care much about it anyhow let's sit down outside said lady bletchworth it's so hot in there on the terrace it was very agreeable the orchestra did not sound too insistent and they found chairs where they could watch the people promenade without being inconvenienced by them extremes meet and ostend is their meeting place only a light railing divides the fashionable world and the half world from the world that works on one side plod a humble flock of wearied trippers who have had tea as nice as mother makes it in a sweltering shop at the back of the town among the shell pin cushions the franc souvenirs they have had tea all the evening they pass and repass with flagging feet wishing they had chosen margate on the other side women who were born in the same class trail paquin's gowns on the necks of some there are flowers that have cost as much as a tripper's holiday a diamond in an ear is worth more than the price of a tripper's home and maggie from dalston with three tired children clinging to her ten and sixpenny skirt gazes across that slender rail and thinks and her thoughts might be unpleasant to hear a really extraordinary thing was that no one but conrad seemed aware that the railing bisected two worlds and a half as for conrad his reflections engrossed him so much that he quite forgot to attend to mrs adaile only when he chanced to notice she was looking pensive in the starlight did it occur to him that he was ignoring a situation by which he ought to be thrilled for here they were the stars were twinkling the waves were murmuring the lady was waiting it was true her sister and bletchworth were in the way but even allowing for their presence this should mean emotion where was it on the terrace while he made small talk and on the plage when they strolled back and as he smoked his last cigar that night in the garden the question in conrad's mind was insistently where is the emotion because she was still an attractive woman and he perceived it he was even making love to her to her to mrs adaile and she was not adamant what had happened to him where were his transports the spiritual whirlwinds where was everything that he had travelled to recover she had a whim to do fancy work in the salon next day during the hour when the women changed their djeuner dresses for the five o'clock to seven costumes he had met her as she was passing his door their rooms were in the same passage and they had gone downstairs together you've told me nothing of your life since we used to know each other he said playing with a thimble what would you like me to tell you you used to tell me a good deal if i am privileged to remember it i'm afraid i did how i must have bored you it was rather a shame but i was in my egotistical stage and you listened with such big eyes con thank you said conrad but i wasn't bored and you weren't an egotist you were the sweetest woman i've ever met i was awfully sorry for you so sorry only a cub's sympathy but you've had none truer from anyone you were a nice boy i've thought about you sometimes are the scissors there do look if a woman knows when she is really loved you should have thought about me very often he answered giving them to her are you happier than you were let us say i don't worry so much about being unhappy i suppose it amounts to the same thing she sighed and smiled would you do this leaf green or yellow i shouldn't do it at all he said put it down and talk to me i remember once when you were telling me your troubles you cried it was one afternoon on the terrace you had on a pale blue frock and a big floppy hat i'd have given my life to kiss you at that moment you mustn't say these things to me she faltered she said it more gravely than on the plage she was not smiling now and she lowered her eyes he knew that he might seize her hands i've waited for you so long he exclaimed joan be kind to me but his heart did not thud in her silence he held her hands fast the doyley she was making had fallen to the couch at last she murmured still looking down how can you care for me we've only just met i've cared for you ever since if you knew how i worshipped you if you knew what i suffered when you were vexed with me that night you sat talking to those men and the next morning when you were offended i remember what i felt as if it were a month ago i remember what you said as you turned away and how i sat watching praying that you'd come back and then i waited at the door and begged your pardon and you wouldn't forgive me i've relived it all so often i did love you darling i did i did it sounds idiotic there was a song of yours 'to day to day our dream is over to day the waking cold and grey' i learnt to strum the refrain there to to make me feel nearer to you when i had gone since i've been a man i've strummed that refrain a hundred times and longed for you i was strumming it years after you had forgotten you ever sang it i've thought about you sometimes till my boyhood has been alive in me trembling if faust's chance could have come to me in any year since we parted i'd have said 'let me be seventeen again in rouen' the past is always beautiful i made you very wretched though but you liked me a little heaven knows why i i was a fool still you did perhaps it was because you were a 'fool' that i was foolish that's all over she drew her hands from his clasp it isn't over he said you sha'n't say it's over the present may be as beautiful as the past she shook her head can we work miracles can i make myself a girl again or you a boy yes if you've not forgotten what you felt for me if the memories are not all mine you can even do that you see i'm a fool still i i half hoped that you'd remember joan 'you were not once so wise' ah she said if i were younger now or if you had been older then who knows could you sing that song still he asked listen he opened the piano and played a few bars can you oh she forced a laugh it was too long ago and what a song besides try he pleaded try it i can't remember the words she murmured the words 'you tell me love that i'll forget you i own it in our last good bye' i'd be so grateful please how does it go on it goes on 'our dream has been too sweet to let you remember that i spoke a lie' oh yes she said coming forward she hummed let me see 'i know the years will crowd above you i know despair must fade away but here and now i know i love you i love you and we part to day' is that it that's it and then there's what i was playing 'to day to day our dream is over to day the waking cold and grey' she nodded yes yes 'what care i time will ' something what is it 'the throes that rend my heart to day' well i'll try but i'm sure i sha'n't be able to i haven't heard it for years then she sat down and began it and he shut his eyes and tried to think he was seventeen and she was twenty the music stopped short i knew it would be a failure it's gone it was too long ago she repeated it was yesterday he cried and caught her in his arms as she got up for a second she held him back from her regarding him curiously regret tenderness irony were mingled in the gaze she bent on him like him she mourned for what had perished like him she sought to delude herself that it bloomed anew it's absurd she said and drooped to him with a kiss as they moved apart both were disappointed the man thought i have spoilt my memory of her kiss to me in rouen i adore you he said mechanically the woman's smile was enigmatic as she left him chapter xii are you heartless he continued have you no pity for me it was the next evening they were sitting among the basket chairs and the dinner dresses in the garden and there was no one inconveniently near lady bletchworth had gone inside a few minutes before a warm breeze bore strains of chopin to them from the kursaal the little fountain plashed languidly and a full moon had been assisting conrad to deceive himself i am not heartless returned mrs adaile i am sensible and there are a thousand reasons for one thing for one thing i don't want romance i want comedy i want to laugh with you my dear con not to be serious this was difficult to answer for he could not offer to laugh at his grand passion he sighed besides she went on i couldn't make you happy it isn't in my power you don't really care for me you are in love with a memory not with me i'm no longer the woman you fell in love with i've changed really i didn't know how much i had changed till you came here i must like you very much to want to talk to you because you make me feel elderly you do indeed you're unjust he exclaimed and he was genuinely distressed not care for you you don't believe it you can't believe that i swear to you no don't she said i can imagine all you would say haven't i listened to you haven't i even tried to make illusions for myself you talk of what you felt for me not of what you feel you don't know it but you rave to me about what i was not about what i am you remember the hat and the frock i had on twenty years ago can you tell me what i wore last night is such constancy nothing he cried hastily it would be irresistible she said if you could find the girl that you've been constant to but she doesn't live con she's gone i am such a different person from the girl you've looked for that that i've even felt a tiny bit jealous sometimes of your rhapsodies to me about her well i'm being quite frank with you you see it's pathetic i think there have been moments when i've listened to you and felt a little pained because you seemed to forget all about me i am hurting you you hurt me said conrad because for the first time i realise you are different from the girl i've looked for till now i've felt that i was with her again that's nice of you but it isn't true oh i like you for saying it of course if you had felt it really go on no what for i should only make you unhappier you want comedy he demurred you have said the saddest things a woman ever said to me she raised a white shoulder with a laugh i never get what i want it should have taught you to feel for me but you are not 'wondrous kind' oh i am more to be pitied than you are what have i got in my life friends yes to play bridge with my husband he delivers speeches on local option and climbs mountains both make me deadly tired i used to go in for music 'god save the king' is the only tune he knows when he hears it and he only knows that because the men take their hats off i was interested in my house at the beginning after you've quarrelled in your house every day for years it doesn't absorb you to make the mantelpiece look pretty i wanted a child well my sister has seven voil my autobiography up to date there is to morrow said conrad moved to morrow you must give me the comedy she smiled and the morning after i go to the highlands and big men will shoot little birds and think it's 'sport' did you ever see a sparrow die i watched one once it was human like a child come on come on let's go out and behold another woman she had been wise and dejected him now she was unwise to make amends behold a myriad women in one before half an hour had passed she had told him her philosophy was a puff ball that she had prated reason only to be reasoned with and she told him so without a word about it said so by the modulation of her voice while they talked trifles and conrad conrad had been scrambling to the point of friendship and he slipped back to folly conrad strove to forget that discomfiting phrase you are in love with a memory not with me it made the folly so difficult he could not succeed in forgetting it it was in his mind next day coldly a fact yes he was making love to mrs adaile because she was mrs adaile not because she was a charming woman he knew that if they hadn't met before he came to ostend he might have admired her tried to know her grown to like her but that he would never have said to her what he had said nor wished to say it yet there was the regnant truth that it was she she had the fascination of sharing with him his dearest his sweetest remembrances the radiance of the past still tinged her in her keeping lay the wonder of his youth so they ate neapolitan ices in the morning and she brought down the doyley in the afternoon and they listened to chopin again in the evening it was the last evening the bletchworths and she were leaving early on the morrow and he was unlikely to be alone with her again before she went i wish you weren't going he said how horribly i shall miss you i sha'n't stop here why aren't you going to homburg instead of to people in scotland then we might have met again are you going to homburg to be 'cured' i think i shall go there or to antwerp yes i shall go to antwerp first i was there when i was a boy i was happy in antwerp how funny you are she said involuntarily i've never found anyone much entertained by me how you'll go to antwerp of all places in the world because you liked it when you were a boy antwerp will disappoint you too you could always stab deep with a monosyllable he said but you used to have more mercy i'm sorry i have deteriorated said the lady rather stiffly she leant back in her chair and a minute passed in silence she gave her attention to the orchestra tapping time with the tip of a shoe does it amuse you to say cruel things to me asked conrad if it does by all means say what you like i don't understand you she drooped disdainful eyelids what you said was unworthy of you you know it was i really forget what i did say please talk about something else what is it they are playing they were playing cavalleria now so he scorned to reply to this otherwise than by a look i asked you a question she said in tones of ice i beg your pardon he answered hastily they are playing cavalleria rusticana an opera written by a young italian his name is mascagni you are rude she exclaimed i am human joan you hurt me then her sister and bletchworth reappeared perhaps you know a good hotel conrad was saying an hotel where inquired lady bletchworth mr warrener is going to homburg i tell him everybody says it's deadly dull there this year murmured mrs adaile it was deadly dull in ostend too during the next hour both women were rather quiet and bletchworth was exceptionally wearisome but for the fact that it was the farewell evening conrad would have seen friends among the company and gone to greet them however at last the orchestra finished and they all got up a leisurely crowd was flocking to the exit and perhaps it was the crowd perhaps it was lady bletchworth conrad and mrs adaile were separated from the others for satisfactory seconds won't you forgive me he whispered even a crowd has merits her hand rested on his arm an instant it must be fate he said i always offend you just when we're going to part do you remember she nodded i remember her glance was very pretty in the moonshine this won't be our last talk together he begged what are you going to do when we go in i suppose we shall sit in the garden but everybody i expect so don't let's keep behind walk with lily she addressed her brother in law and conrad sauntered beside lady bletchworth the windows of the villa this and the villa that were thrown wide behind the mass of blooms in the crimson dusk of lamp shades there was the glint of a white gown the glow of a cigarette point among cushions a bubble of laughter every minute a dim interior flashed to brightness someone returned and switched on the light a woman took off her hat before the mirror through one window came the jingle of money on a card table through another shouts paulette fleury was singing to friends one of the songs that she had not sung at the empire in london to the left the track of moonlight on the sea kept pace with conrad it was more agreeable in the garden than on the terrace at the onset already it had an air of intimacy the artificial enclosure with its tesselated paving and its affectation of rusticity already he was on good terms with it curiously enough such hotel gardens misnamed as they are have a knack of making a visitor feel at home of endearing themselves to him more quickly than acres of lawns and elms lady bletchworth wanted a brandy and soda and conrad had one too mrs adaile and bletchworth drank champagne presently they referred to the shooting box to the people they expected to see there almost for the first time conrad was blankly sensible of inhabiting a different sphere he hoped they wouldn't ask him if he knew any of the people they were mentioning he got very near to his youth in that moment there was a revival of his boyhood's dumb constraint how odd it was they were all sitting together like this and after to night he was never likely to meet her front doors between them 'gina of course might be useful but how stupid of him not to have got into the right set in town when he came back from the colony he supposed it wouldn't have been difficult with the money londoners boasted that everything the world yielded was to be bought in london and it was true even to dignities and reputations well i am forced to admit that i don't know what women go to the moors for said bletchworth you don't take the sport seriously and therefore you are out of place what do you say mr warrener well i can hardly say anything owned conrad i don't go to the moors but if you did you wouldn't prefer a grouse to a woman i'm sure asked lady bletchworth a man does not go to the moors to talk to women insisted her husband that is my point women always want to flirt just as the birds are rising women are very desirable at a dance but when it comes to birds or it comes to cricket when it comes to anything important i say reluctantly they can't be serious that is my point you don't take the thing seriously now at the eton and harrow were you earnest about it had you got the matter at heart no no all you wanted to do was to walk about and to have lunch a lot of boys playing ball she said and then they take up all the lawn besides so selfish of them ah said bletchworth warningly that is the tone that is going to do the harm that is the tone we have to guard against what has made us what we are what has given england the place she holds i protest i protest absolutely against irresponsible er comment the foreign ideas that are creeping into papers that have always had my er approval will sap the country's manhood if we don't make a stand joan i am sure joan agrees with me she was leaning back absently trifling with a porte bonheur on her wrist the blue fire of the diamonds was ablaze it caught conrad's glance from her wrist his gaze travelled to her eyes they told him i'm so bored yes indeed she assented you're quite right it would have been evident to anyone but bletchworth that she had not heard what he said there were fewer people in the garden by this time in the knowledge that the evening was nearly over a wave of sentiment stirred conrad even her message of comprehension did nothing to subdue his annoyance what likelihood remained of a tte tte the evening from first to last had been wasted in stupidities presently another group went inside presently there was no one left but themselves finally lady bletchworth yawned he wished fervently that she had yawned an hour ago i think it's time we all went to bed she said you've laid down the law quite enough charlie shall we see you in the morning mr warrener oh yes he said of course what time is the boat i don't know ten something isn't it well i'll say 'good night' i wish we were staying on really i do i shall have a racking headache to morrow evening are you ready joan quite said mrs adaile i have a headache now he was hopeless until she let him see her slip the porte bonheur into her chair before she rose good night mr warrener good night mrs adaile he said when he was alone he sat down again and waited for her return her manoeuvre might fail someone return with her the bracelet must be lying where she had dropped it more than five minutes crept by before a step sounded he turned eagerly and with dismay beheld lord armoury approaching the intruder gaped at the view and stood hesitating with his hands in his pockets it was an instant of the keenest suspense would he withdraw no he lounged forward he threw himself into the very chair and stretched his legs across another conrad muttered an anathema on him eh said lord armoury i didn't speak said conrad frigidly the young man took out a cigarette and opened his match box it was empty got a light he inquired i'm sorry i haven't said conrad momentarily encouraged rotten show said the earl where's a waiter he contemplated his cigarette with a semi intoxicated frown and transferred his feet to the table it was apparent that he meant to stop although he could not smoke with his change of position he was liable to come in contact with the bracelet and conrad watched him nervously but he did not seem to be discommoded by it seen paulette he asked no the no of a man who is not to be drawn into conversation pauly's a bit of all right affirmed the earl undeterred i don't pretend to be up to all the patter but wot ho speechlessly conrad hoped the lady wouldn't come back yet three hundred a week she refused for a return engagement at the empire told me so herself to night that's pauly got the hump what's three hundred to pauly i told 'em how she'd catch on before she went over don't i know he winked profoundly look here you'll see an artist in october at the syndicate halls that's wot ho she's going to knock 'em between ourselves she's got some new 'business' that well it's great never been tried i saw her when she was doing the last turn at the south london i said to george 'cocky that's a winner' robey couldn't see it i saw it i can put my finger on the talent every time she's going to make marie sit up my boy she's another marie lloyd don't i know i've got the judgment i can spot 'em with one peeper isn't there a waiter in this damned hotel i could do with a tiddley where's a bell it's no use ringing said conrad nobody ever comes it wants someone to go in and stir them up but now mrs adaile reappeared oh she murmured and then i've dropped a bracelet somewhere i came down to look for it good evening lord armoury a bracelet echoed conrad with concern good evening mrs adaile a bracelet crumbs said armoury yes isn't it a nuisance i don't know how i could have lost it i suppose the clasp was loose i had it on out here let me help you said conrad in an undertone he added don't find it yet let's look further off oh my dearest it was so sweet of you i'm in such a rage i'm so wretched where were you sitting mrs adaile asked armoury peering about over here over there i don't know she said hurriedly is it still in the chair she whispered yes whispered conrad are you sorry you're going from me a little to leave you like this he sighed it's awful joan well let me come to your room to say 'good bye' she started hallo have you got it exclaimed armoury no she said i i thought i had joan i daren't she faltered my maid come and say 'good bye' to me then do find it she said agitatedly he'll guess what's that cried conrad here it is why in one of our chairs may i he fastened the bracelet on her wrist make me happy come to me he begged will you number seventeen her fingers touched his hand i'm so immensely grateful to you both she said serenely lucky for her we were here the intruder remarked when she had gone one of the servants might have pinched it by the morning yes i suppose it was as well we were here said conrad amiably if it hadn't been for you i should have turned in before this he dropped back into his seat resigning himself to tedium a little longer he lolled there discreetly making civil responses and gradually he realised that flossie coburg's son was not wholly to be blamed for the tedium he recognised that there was a dulness of his own spirit while he countenanced the garrulity of a fool his thoughts were with scenes of twenty years before and sadly the man strove to revive in his heart the idolatry and illusions of the boy oh for the enchantment of the summer when he had called her mrs adaile if he could only keep remembering it was the same woman but never had she seemed so different to him as in these minutes never had he desired so little as now when she had promised all the ground floor of the hotel was partially dark when he crossed it a purposeless waiter hovered in obscurity upstairs along the passage the tan and black rows of boots shapely on boot trees indicated that most of the visitors had retired a drowsy lady's maid put forth an expectant face and withdrew it wearily conrad felt about the wall for the electric button which seemed always in a different spot and found it then he closed his door as completely as was possible without turning the knob as he put down his watch he saw that it was late but he knew that it was not yet late enough and his movements were leisurely he wanted a cigarette the more because he had deprived himself of one outside by saying that he had no match but he was reluctant to give the odour of tobacco to the room a superfluous grace perhaps now that most women smoked still he was reluctant he threw down his cigarette case too and the rest of the things that had been in his pockets he looked at himself ruminatingly in the mirror and brushed his moustache one of the lights hung above the pillow it was convenient to read by presently it occurred to him that nearly two acts of le marquis de priola remained to divert him he put forth his arm for it and stretching reached it he turned the leaves une dame viendra de deux trois ah yes this was as far as he had read the effort to give his attention to the play grew gradually less mournfulness faded and in the next scene his interest was alert once he laughed his thoughts were no longer with the boy who had lain wakeful through a night just to hear her footstep in the hall the wind was rising and intermittently it tricked and irritated him the blustering wind and the chiming of a clock made the only sounds again the clock rang out this time he counted the strokes with annoyance he yawned his interest was wandering from the play now it began to seem to him that priola talked too much what was keeping her had she repented her promise he tossed the book aside and lay watching the door after he had watched it for nearly half an hour it was gently opened and swiftly closed and mrs adaile stood on the threshold she paused there diffidently with downcast eyes she wore a long clinging robe of crpe de chine veiled partly by a stole of venetian point the sleeves of the deep toned lace dividing at the shoulders drooped from her like wings one daring touch of colour the flame of nasturtium at her breast threw into dazzling relief the gleaming whiteness of her skin the burnished gold of her hair she paused awaiting doubtless the words of welcome of encouragement that would vanquish her timidity but conrad slept a respiration too loud to be thought rapture and too faint to be called a snore smote the lady's hearing startled she looked up forked lightning flashed at him from her indignant eyes but tranquil conrad slept what an offence wasn't it enough to enrage the sweetest of women put yourself i mean it was unpardonable for a second she seemed about to escape even more surreptitiously than she had entered and then a smile half sad half whimsical twitched her lips a sense of humour how much it spares us how far it goes in life a little pathetic that often a sense of humour wins affection and the noble qualities get nothing but a dull respect she looked at a pencil case on the table and stood tempted her fingers at her mouth dared she do it she would not have roused him for a coronet and the creak of a board even the scratching of the lead might be fatal she wavered she moved towards the pencil slowly stealthily inch by inch the table was gained there was nothing to write on a paper covered volume lay to her hand with infinite precaution she tore the title page tremulously she scribbled holding her breath where to leave the message where to put it so that it couldn't be overlooked again she hesitated conrad slept sound a glance assured her of it again she ventured an instant her gaze dwelt upon him still with that smile half mirthful and half melancholy on her face she nodded wide eyed and on the tips of her toes crept out unheard unseen when conrad woke a servant was admitting the sunshine through the window his coffee steamed by his side as he sat up and almost before memory thudded in him his view met the front page of le marquis de priola pinned to the bed curtain he rolled towards it haggardly on it was written dreamer good bye there is no way back to rouen chapter xiii i must say i was very happy on the stage sighed the countess of darlington lifting the teapot the earl of armoury's mother threw up her eyes a shapeless waddling woman the duchess with a sanctimonious voice there were elderly gentlemen who remembering flossie's agility with a tambourine at the old pavilion felt reformation to be a sad affair when they looked at her not 'happy' she said piously dazzled only dazzled dear lady darlington ladies like you and i can't be happy on the stage it goes against the grain with you and i lady darlington pouted she was provokingly pretty when she pouted she had pouted at darlington on the day he met her but i was happy she declared you weren't satisfied in your heart i'm sure you always felt there was better work to be done oh yes but i hoped to get leading parts in time i mean purer work explained the duchess wincing social helpful work lady darlington laughed she was prettier still when she laughed she had laughed at darlington on the day he proposed no really not she said frankly i never thought about it for a moment do you know duchess i've always wanted to ask you didn't you ache to go back to it after you married oh never exclaimed the duchess i was grateful to providence for letting me get away from it all circumstances made me go into the business but i was never a pro i mean to say a 'professional' by nature my father the captain died when i was quite a child and i had my dear mother to support m'yes murmured lady darlington looking at the ceiling you were before my time but of course i've heard perhaps if i had been in the music halls i should have been glad to get away from it all she added i was in the theatres you know the 'smalls' i think i mean to say the 'minor provincial towns' said the duchess a shade tartly one of jenkinson's number ii companies wasn't it lots of people considered it was better than the number i returned lady darlington with pride and the rotherham advertiser said a voice of such diapason as mine wasn't often heard in musical comedy such what as yours diapason won't you have some muffin they always serve me out so said the duchess but i will have just a mossel she regarded her hostess anxiously i hope you aren't going to be mad she said i am mad admitted rosalind her name was rosalind mad with the longing for auld lang syne if i weren't crazy i shouldn't own it because you can't enter into my feelings a bit but you're the only woman i meet who ought to be able to understand them long sometimes for a treat i tell the servants i'm not at home to anyone and i shut myself up and long the tears into my eyes you cry for the stage oh but my dear lady darlington you mustn't give way you must be firm with yourself think just think what an example you'd be setting if you took to it again in our position we have the country to consider the middle classes say 'what's good enough for the aristocracy must be good enough for us' we have to consider our influence on those in a humbler sphere i'm not going to take to it again said rosalind how can i besides i don't want so much to act i've no ambition except to be jolly it's the life i ache for i'm dull dull dull i want to be among the people i remember my heart turns back to dixie i wouldn't say 'thank you' to be with actors and actresses in london in the west end they're only imitations of the lords and ladies that bore me i want to be on the road with a number ii crowd yes and a number iii crowd for preference i want to arrive in a hole and corner town on a sunday night and have supper in lodgings and see stout in a jug again and call the landlady 'ma' oh how soul stirring it would be to call a landlady 'ma' lodgings look at your drawing room with louis cans furniture said the duchess admonishingly you can't be serious serious i'm pathetic of course i should find i had been spoilt for it the pleasure wouldn't last the stout would taste sour soon and i should find the landlady impudent and the lodgings dirty i daresay i should wish myself back in st james' square before i had been away a month but i don't want to give up st james' square i only want a week end sometimes as a tonic that's all i want just week ends if i could be rosalind heath again from saturday to monday sometimes i'd be lady darlington all the rest of the year cheerfully enough this was the moment when her idea was born as the idea had consequences it is noteworthy that this was the moment if she could be rosalind heath again from saturday to monday she had never debated the possibility but why not why not even for a week she couldn't call herself rosalind heath again because everybody in theatre land knew that rosalind heath had married the earl of darlington but who among a lowly band of players would know her face she had not been a star all she needed for the freak was a confidante what had become of tattie lascelles lady darlington blushed with self reproach that she should have to question what had become of tattie she sat after the duchess had departed remembering days when she and tattie had been bosom friends they had shared hopes and lodgings they had told each other their peccadilloes and even their salaries and now she didn't know where tattie was could st james' square have made her heartless how had their correspondence died ah yes in tattie's last letter ages ago she had asked for the sum of five pounds just for a fortnight but how monstrous of tattie to feel constrained because she hadn't sent it back who had expected it on the seventeenth day of december when darlington looking a ridiculous object had boomed away in a new car of which he was inordinately proud rosalind stole guiltily into a news agent's she would not meet her lord again for a month her beautiful eyes sparkled and her cheeks were flushed she tendered two pennies to a vulgar man smoking a clay pipe behind the counter and asked for the stage to the happily constituted there can seem nothing calculated to kindle the emotions in the act of buying a twopenny paper in a squalid shop but rosalind had a temperament and temperaments play queer tricks see conrad's the tender grace of a day that was dead hallowed the damp copy of a journal in which she had formerly advertised that she was resting the touch of vanished hands sent little thrills to her heart as her gaze embraced familiar names she went back to the drawing room fire and read them diligently dusk and a footman crept in before she discovered miss tattie lascelles but that artist's announcement leapt to her with the electric light miss tattie lascelles informed the kingdom that she was specially engaged to create the part of delicia potts in the maritime musical farce entitled little miss kiss and tell on blithepoint pier the date chosen for this perfectly unimportant production was monday december nd then rosalind who was to go to the marrables in leicestershire for christmas wrote lady marrable a note of grieved excuse and scribbled a letter to tattie which began take two bedrooms in blithepoint and don't breathe a word to a soul till you see me and though the happily constituted may be sceptical again she felt more joyous than she had done for five illustrious years blithepoint is about thirty three miles by rail from sweetbay it is a grey bleak place with the plainest female population in england on three hundred days of the year the wind is due east but on the other sixty five it is southeast and then the residents go about saying what lovely weather they're having blithepoint is much larger than sweetbay and more fashionable it is also nearly as dull nobody is aware how much can be spent on being deadly dull until he has stayed in a blithepoint hotel rosalind was a shade uneasy in the thought that someone among the visitors might recognise her she knew that at christmas eccentric londoners occasionally went down there and wished afterwards they had been economical and gone to egypt but she didn't falter she ran away on sunday the st she had put on her simplest costume and her portmanteau told no tales to make believe to the fullest extent she travelled in a third class compartment already she was greatly excited as the train crawled out of victoria she could have clapped her hands when she arrived it was eight o'clock and a bitter evening the scramble for luggage kept her shivering on the platform for ten minutes and then a fly bumped her through the shuttered town it was the hour of local dissipation on one side of the favourite thoroughfare the blades of blithepoint paraded jauntily crying pip pip to stolid faced young women on the other who took no notice of them lady darlington reckless for sensations envied these roysterers who could feel devilish gay so innocently the cab shaved a corner and rattled into a neighbourhood of obscure apartment houses her mutinous heart warmed with sentiment and she forgot how cold her pretty feet were the cab stopped she saw the blind of the ground floor window dragged aside an impetuous figure appeared and vanished the street door was pulled wide and a girl with a cloud of hair and a string of barbaric beads dangling to the waist flew down the steps and hugged her you trump you've really come you duck how jolly to see you 'ere two bob missie said the flyman when you've done canoodling they ran into the parlour and laughed at each other in the gaslight take your things off said tattie let me help you i hope you'll like the diggings i wrote to the swellest address i could hear of when i got your letter but you shouldn't have what for well for you i wanted everything just as it used to be that was it how funny but i don't suppose these will strike you as very swagger after what you've got at home they don't won't they be good enough they're heavenly oh tattie how good it is to be back did anybody bring in my trunk 'in the shade of the palm' and a vocal folio on the piano and professional photographs on the shelf oh let me see the photographs 'to mrs cheney from miss bijou chamberlain wishing you a merry christmas' who is she she was here last week a variety artist she seems to have been comfortable as she gave the landlady her photograph are you ready for supper stout of course in a jug well i thought after what you had come from i had better order guinness for a moment rosalind looked downcast ah well never mind she said we'll have it in a jug to morrow they drew their chairs to the ham and beef and the landlady brought in the guinness good evening ma said rosalind with youth in her bosom good evening my dear said mrs cheney you'll be glad of your supper i daresay after your journey she put comestibles on the table in three paper bags i was meaning to tell you miss lascelles that if you'd like a bit of something hot in the evening when you come back from the show you can have it i'm not one to fuss about hotting something up sundays we let the fire out but in the week you can have it and welcome good business said miss lascelles in some places you 'get it hot' if you ask for it by rights some places shouldn't take professionals returned mrs cheney i've 'eard many tales miss chamberlain her on the mantelpiece was telling me that where she was in brighton they wouldn't allow her to have her uncle in to see her such a quiet ladylike gal too can such things be cried rosalind is a poor girl to be cut off from her own flesh and blood because she's in diggings ah i don't wonder at your asking said mrs cheney not mind you she added but what letting lodgings over a number of years makes one a bit suspicious of uncles i've known a gentleman brought to these very rooms after the show on three different monday evenings as the uncle of three different young ladies and dreadful taken aback he was when he see me each time i'm afraid those were flighty girls said rosalind severely untruthful they was said mrs cheney and so i told 'em i say nothing about visitors i'm not that evil minded so long as the lady pays a bit extra for the gas and the gentleman don't slam the door when he goes i like to think well of everyone but i 'ate lies she drew the cork and retired and rosalind said well what about the show tat what sort of part have you got the part's rather good said miss lascelles hurrah what screw rotten thirty five shillings i had to take what i could get i've been 'out' a long time they're paying awful salaries in this crowd the chorus only get about fifteen bob i believe they're half of them novices i say whose crowd is it it's a syndicate nobody ever heard of it before and the tenor has such a cold he could hardly speak at the dress rehearsal last night goodness knows how he's going to sing to morrow who is your principal woman she has backed out they've put somebody else into the part at the last minute and the scenery has still to come down it's a bit of a muddle all round i wish i could have got into a better thing but i was so hard up you ought to have seen where i was lodging i tried to get 'shopped' last month as an extra that speaks an extra no tat why didn't you write to me exclaimed rosalind reproachfully oh i don't know i heard the 'great' miss hayward wanted thirty extra ladies to go on in the ball scene it was twenty five bob a week she wanted picked women it would just have done me lil rayburn lent me her little squirrel coat and a black velvet hat i tell you i looked a treat when i went down there were three hundred and forty girls waiting we were sent across the stage thirty at the time the great hayward sat in the stalls with her pince nez up 'you' she said pointing 'the one in the squirrel coat' so i went to her 'i think you'll do' she drawled 'you know what the money is' 'twenty five miss hayward' i said 'isn't it' 'no a guinea' she said 'it doesn't matter to you' 'thank you' i said 'i've got to keep myself out of my salary i haven't got a man and a flat' potter the agent was in an awful stew 'oh you shouldn't have spoken to miss hayward like that' 'to hell' i said cat cried rosalind because you were well dressed yes and if i had gone shabby she wouldn't have noticed me at all you know i've been in the variety business since you saw me the music halls you haven't straight i was one of the four sisters tarantelle jolly good money i got five pounds a week when we worked two shows a night i never got less than three ten i can't get it on the stage why did you give them up but the tips are very heavy aren't they they weren't heavy for me i didn't tip anybody except the dresser chloe made the engagements so chloe could pay the tips trust this child what does make you sick in that business is the comedians with the red noses and the umbrellas they're always after you there was a little brute in one show his wife was in the bill too she did sentimental ballads well how he could let her travel i don't know it was her last week but she wasn't fit to be working so long we almost expected any night and there he was after me all the time 'i shall write to you tattie i see you go to balham and walham green next week' 'who gave you leave to call me tattie' i said 'you low cur i wish i was a man to give you a good hiding' i did pity his wife she never spoke to me she used to pass me in the wings with her head turned away i suppose she thought i was as bad as he was i said to her one evening when she was ill 'can i get you anything miss ' i forget what her name was 'no i thank you miss tarantelle' she said like that wouldn't look at me i was so sorry for her poor little woman what a life rosalind shuddered after a pause she said you're well out of it dear except for the money i expect i'll go back to it as soon as i can i had a contract for a year they wanted the option of renewing for another year they were to have the option yes all on their side i didn't think it was good enough to sign that so i said i'd like to but i was going to be married at the end of the summer you weren't really not much no marriage for me not in the profession anyhow but lots of them think a contract doesn't bind you any more if you marry lil rayburn put me up to that dodge she lent me her song when the tarantelles wanted me it was a great concession her big success whenever she doesn't want to sign an option and is afraid to refuse point blank she looks bashful and says she's going to be married at the end of the summer she has been going to be married 'at the end of the summer' for the last nine years they turned to the fire and lit cigarettes rosalind's she had remembered to put a hundred in her trunk 'what is the use of loving a girl if the girl don't love you' hummed tattie the song was just published they are fine cigarettes 'what is the use of loving a girl when you know she don't want yer to' of course you have the best of everything now it does seem curious my having the best of everything no your wanting the worst 'what if she's fair beyond all compare and what if her eyes are blue ' fancy living in your style and coming to rooms like these for fun oh tattie said rosalind that's just what i did come for i haven't any fun at home but i thought in society they had no end of a good time so they do in a way but it's the wrong way for me i never rehearsed for it i'm not easy in the part i wasn't meant for high class comedy and i miss you i've no pal now i've missed you i can tell you oh the tour after you left wasn't that damn dull the girl i lived with was so 'off' common well you can tell i'm a perfect lady i just said 'damn' but i usedn't to did i remember good hearted girl but she was so horrid at table and under that silk blouse all anyhow not that i like to see a girl with too smart underlinen i always think it looks fishy but hers was well if she had been run over one day when we were out i'd have been ashamed to own her let's go and look up some of the company shall we said rosalind what name had i better have what's the matter with 'heath' there are plenty of 'miss heaths' about yes but you're sure to let the 'rosalind' slip and that will give me away introduce me as 'miss daintree' do you know where any of the women are staying we'll find them on the pier we always make for the pier on sunday evenings when there's a concert it's something to do i suppose i'm to say you're in the profession i'm an actress out of an engagement assented rosalind throwing her cigarette in the fender make haste or we shall be too late the boards of little miss kiss and tell were big outside the pier at the turnstile miss lascelles nodded towards them saying in the company the man answered all right miss come in through the gate then at the pay box of the theatre she showed her card saying can you oblige me with a couple of seats the business manager answered with pleasure my dear the gas stoves glowed redly and the theatre was much better warmed than the majority of theatres in london they sat down in the third row of the stalls and listened to a dispirited soprano who was supposed to be singing the holy city she was not really singing the holy city from beginning to end she articulated not a word save jerusalem she simply kept her mouth ajar and wailed the air but she was successful there were only about twenty people in the crimson velvet seats and most of these were kiss and tell people the others were very young men in caps who bore the sacred music on sunday evening for the sake of an advance view of the girls who were to perform on monday the very young men watched the arrivals with much interest and if the ladies in the stalls were unattractive it was said in a blithepoint club on sunday night that the piece on the pier to morrow was no good when the dispirited soprano had finished the actresses applauded her warmly in the hope of cheering her up and the sixpenny balcony rattled its umbrellas in the hope of getting a song more than it had paid for then one of the actresses murmured to miss lascelles how badly she holds herself doesn't she and miss lascelles presented miss daintree rosalind soon discovered that nobody was sanguine of little miss kiss and tell being well received and having forgotten something of the world she was revisiting it surprised her to note the light heartedness of the professionals who tottered on the brink of disaster they were all pitiably poor they were likely to fall out of employment at the worst time of year but they said gaily oh well let's hope for the best it may be all right at night it's no use looking on the black side of things and most of them were totally dependent on their salaries though that was not the belief of the very young men who endured the holy city only miss jinman a large elderly lady who spoke in a bass voice was pessimistic years ago she had sung in parts of dignity and hectored first rate touring companies to day she was engaged for an amorous old woman in turkish trousers whom the low comedian was to pelt with insults as often as she came on the stage i don't think the piece will last a month she said to rosalind in her lugubrious bass it isn't amusing at all vulgar very vulgar i may be too critical i'm used to such high class things as you know my notices as 'buttercup' were immense but i call it a 'rotter' i see a frost a killing frost my dear i keep my opinion to myself she was disseminating it with gusto i don't want to give the others the hump but i see us all out of a shop till the spring comes oh you're always croaking miss jinman snapped a black eyed girl with golden hair give us a chance do a chance returned miss jinman heavily chit you have no chance it's only kindness to tell you so thanks for being so kind said the girl she had not been long on the stage her married sister kept dining rooms in holloway and less than a year ago the artiste had served as waitress there and been ordered to 'urry up with that there yorkshire pudden you will never do any better than you're doing affirmed miss jinman and i could say as much to others present if i hadn't too much consideration for their feelings to more than one she added significantly look at me with all my experience and i am clever and i can sing my notices as 'buttercup' were immense and where am i now on a pier with amateurs amateurs and novices i don't know what the profession is coming to it's a very different thing to what it was when i was in my prime i expect most things have woke up a bit since then said the golden haired brunette the bringing in of railways must have made such a difference small part people were taught to respect the principals said miss jinman sternly minxes kept their places it's a pity you couldn't keep yours said the dark one with the golden locks but harmony was restored during the next selection by the band there was a little sleet blowing when the audience straggled homeward the lights of the belle vue hotel were not put out yet and carelessly miss jinman observed that the people inside must be warmer than she was rosalind took the hint it is only in the lowest ranks of the theatrical profession that the ladies refresh themselves in bars a second rate provincial actress would wither the person who invited her but miss jinman and miss lascelles had adapted their manners to their company and it was a very humble company indeed so they went into the lounge and sat down another professional lady came in and inquired generously are you drinking girls miss lascelles said yes we've got port wine serve you right said the other lady with a pretty wit though she was on the high road to prague lady darlington was relieved to see that the clock pointed to five minutes to ten when the lounge closed the party shook hands with her heartily and hoped they would meet her again in the morning distressingly ill bred of them to drink port in a smoky bar not at all the sort of thing i can ask you to condone but some of the sirens who had lolled in velvet fauteuils were financing on coppers until the first week's treasury was paid and tea and bread and butter was all they had had to support their internal economies during the day how amused the very young men in the stalls would be at my simplicity in believing it chapter xiv since the last chapter went away to be typewritten i myself have been in the theatre on blithepoint pier a pantomime was being performed the seat i was in yielded me a view of more than i had paid to look at i could see the prompt entrance which is the place where they signal for the sunset and the moonbeams and where the players come to peep at the doings on the stage last night a young woman came there she wore a brief blue skirt and a silver crown and for the nonce an unlovely wrap hung over her whitened back and bosom since you may get rheumatism in the prompt entrance as well as moonbeams before the footlights two comic men were bawling a duet i knew they were comic because they had made their faces so repulsive and the spirit moving her the woman broke into lazy dance steps to the refrain in the glare and the distance she was pretty as i watched i felt instinctively for the hand of rosalind i knew the craving that was in her blood and turned to meet her gaze if she had been there i think she would have liked me i said those who saw that would understand rosalind the tawdry figure dancing in the draught says everything that was why i brought the picture at home to show it to you but somehow all at once i doubt whether you will understand any better than you did however i beg you to believe that on the morrow rosalind accompanied tattie lascelles to a rehearsal with infinite zest she had no right to accompany her but a discussion was in progress when they arrived and she passed unchallenged mr omee the local manager who stood in the pit was talking to mr quisby the travelling manager who stood on the stage it appeared that owing to the pressure of christmas traffic the railway company had failed to dispatch the scenery well but who has been to the station what do they say i tell you the fools at this end don't know anything about it what the bleak helvellyn's the good of bringing the piece without any scenery isn't there any scenery in your theatre i've told you what cloth you can have my boy that's the best we can do it's no use offering us hyde park corner when we want a blooming mosque well let's have a look at it mr omee shouted for bates there was a lull and then from unseen heights a voice announced that bates had just stepped outside mr omee ramped in the pit the shouts for bates were resumed the rafters rang with the name of bates and after some minutes a discomfited working man slouched onto the stage to be received with a volley of abuse he was understood to retort that he was unable to be in two places at once and parties who expected it might find someone else to do the work that was the straight tip those nearest to him also learnt that he had a poor opinion of the job at its blessed best let's have that hyde park cloth commanded mr omee come on look alive man hurry up what i want to know grunted the low comedian is 'ow i'm to get that wheeze of mine into that song that's what's bothering me what song inquired miss lascelles what song why 'all the winners' i was going to say the blithepoint football team was 'all the winners' in the match on saturday and now i'm told that sweetbay beat 'em my luck again that queers my wheeze why not say suggested rosalind that the next time sweetbay is rash enough to play them blithepoint will be all the winners wot ho said the low comedian brightening he added promptly of course that's what i was thinking of doing but i must see if i can get all that cackle into the tune where's the conductor of the blooming band presently the cloth was displayed it was no faithful representation of hyde park corner but it was still less like a mosque and the players stood about and sneered and muttered contemptuous criticisms miss jinman said that in all her experience she had never known such disgraceful mismanagement before she was to figure in her turkish trousers in this scene and she pointed morosely to the omnibuses painted outside the hospital clear the stage please cried mr quisby we'll just run through miss vavasour's scenes come on miss vavasour we don't want to be here all day he told her this indignantly as if the delay in lowering the cloth were directly attributable to her she was the girl who had been suddenly promoted to the leading part the manager of the theatre lounged from the pit into the stalls where rosalind sat now too he chewed his cigar and there was gloom on his face this should have been a week of large receipts but the outlook was unpromising miss vavasour was rendered additionally nervous by the fact that she had not had time to learn the lines she advanced constrainedly and said in a timid voice 'we are alone at last oh rapture' speak up my dear said mr quisby say it as if you meant it 'rapture' do a bit of a caper there be fetching 'we are alone at last' repeated miss vavasour with a mechanical jump 'oh rapture' oh rats said the manager of the theatre he turned to rosalind can she sing he asked she sings even better than she acts said rosalind innocently good lord groaned the manager well what are they waiting for now it was the cue for an embrace and miss vavasour was hanging forward to be clasped in the tenor's arms but the tenor had a request to make mr quisby he said disregarding her i think it would be better if somebody read my part i don't know how i shall get through to night as it is my cold is so severe oh my sufferings muttered the manager of the theatre now the tenor's got a cold this is going to be a great draw this show is don't you think you could just 'walk through' the 'business' my boy mr quisby asked the girl's a bit uneasy in the love scenes she'll be all over the shop to night if she don't know what you're going to do i am really very ill insisted the tenor feebly i'm not fit to rehearse i ought to be in bed oh all right then answered mr quisby he beckoned to the prompter here read the lines give miss vavasour her cues do get on miss vavasour we shall be in the theatre till doomsday if you don't wake up 'we are alone at last' go back please 'we are alone at last oh rapture' faltered miss vavasour for the third time with the mechanical jump that's marked 'kiss' said the prompter he was a slovenly man with a dirty face i know it is snapped miss vavasour do let's get to the next line i was 'elping yer said the prompter aggrieved if yer don't want no 'elp sye so he read 'my prize my pearlikins' 'sometimes' continued miss vavasour simulating maiden modesty 'i wonder if it's all a dream why do you love me you might have married delicia who has millions i am a very poor girl' you're a very poor actress too said mr omee under his breath 'why do i love yer sweetheart' mumbled the prompter 'your question reminds me of what the apple blossom said to the moon' band cue shouted mr quisby have you got that there in the orchestra 'the apple blossom and the moon' song go on mr er song over get on with the lines excuse me exclaimed the tenor reappearing that's a cue for the limelight i don't think it has been marked i didn't get it at the dress rehearsal oh yes it is marked declared the prompter i marked it he referred resentfully to the typescript 'moonlight' there it is in its proper plice its proper place is on me said the tenor well we'll see it's all right to night said mr quisby with impatience if you're so ill you had better get home and rest your voice hadn't you i should be only too glad to be at home rejoined the tenor stiffly i just called attention to the matter for the sake of the scene interests of the show at heart where do i speak from now mr quisby murmured miss vavasour you're on the balcony my dear up left 'and now ta ta my romeo' get on with it get on one moment miss vavasour put in the tenor coming back you mustn't speak too soon there i expect an encore take your cue from me she nodded helplessly 'and now ta ta my romeo' ''t is not the nightingale let's have a lark' read the prompter 'come out to supper 'for thou art as glorious to this night being o'er my 'ead ' come to cues said mr quisby stamping 'when 'e bestrides the liezy piecing clouds and siles upon the bosom of the air' gabbled the prompter 'bosom of the air' bellowed mr quisby pick up your cues miss vavasour for gawd's sake i beg your pardon i didn't hear it mr quisby she stammered well then listen my girl what do you suppose we're here for 'bosom of the air' caper down centre lightly lightly great scot not like that you come down like a sack o' coals the girl has no experience remarked miss jinman in a deep undertone to all about her go back shouted mr quisby 'bosom of the air' now again what have you to say as you run down i forget she whimpered what's the line mr er you i i'm just looking to see said the prompter looking to see yelled mr quisby furiously throwing up his arms upon my life and soul it's maddening what's your business what are you engaged as what is it you're supposed to be are you the prompter or are you not good is it asking too much of a man with the book in his hand to follow the lines i've got the whole weight of the production on me i've done the work of twenty men i'm wearing myself out and nobody takes the trouble to study a part or to read the 'scrip ladies and gentlemen the ensanguined rehearsal is dismissed while the prompter looks for the line 'supper oh it will be a merry evening' read the prompter sulkily very well then now miss vavasour let's have it i think it's v v very hard on me said miss vavasour beginning to cry i've only had the p part three days come come do your best you've nothing to cry about i've been very patient with you 'supper oh it will be a merry evening' trip down pretty speak as you come very hard on me she sobbed i think it's m m most unfeeling bring me a chair called mr quisby to no one in particular look here my girl i'm going to see you do it if we have to stop on the stage till the doors open understand if i keep you here till the curtain rises i'll see you do it 'bosom of the air' now take it up sharp a bit of all right keeping the company 'ere to see a novice taught her business i don't think grumbled the low comedian miss vavasour still sobbing drooped to where the balcony was to be imagined she sniffed violently and with an effort at sprightly grace scuttled down the stage again 'supper oh it will be a merry evening' she quavered it'll be a merry evening to morrow about sixpence in the house growled the manager of the theatre he caught rosalind's eye are the rest of you as good as this my dear he said bitterly oh yes said cheerful rosalind i think you'll like us all presently miss lascelles wanted to see where she was to dress and with a heartful of memories rosalind explored with her the pencilled lists of names on most of the doors were lengthy but miss lascelles was to share a room with no one but miss vavasour this week so she was jubilant and had been in no hurry to annex a gas burner as a rule the ladies scamper on monday morning to secure the best places the room was very comfortably furnished oh my said miss lascelles enraptured oh dear said lady darlington disappointed why there's a full length mirror where's the single washstand for five people where's the one chair broken why you've got two rugs this is a blow tattie miss lascelles was doing coon steps before the mirror is the rehearsal hateful enough for you it's a dream of delight said rosalind but even she was rather tired of it when it finished at five o'clock it was nearly half past five when they reached their lodging and they were glad to hear from mrs cheney that the kittle was on the bile at a quarter to seven miss lascelles had to hurry to the theatre again rosalind went later the wind had risen and on the pier she had to fight against it the lamps streaked a heaving sea the little wooden theatre was fairly full and a few christmas trippers in the balcony were comporting themselves with less decorum than prevails in blithepoint as a rule knowing what she knew of affairs behind the curtain rosalind heard the whistles with misgiving she feared that if the whistlers found the entertainment meagre they were likely to create entertainment for themselves however they listened to the opening chorus with polite attention it was surprising how attractive many of the chorus ladies had become they represented the seamen of the battleship deadly oyster and wore sailors' jackets and trousers made of silk or a material that passed for it some of the seamen also wore paste necklaces they sang that there was no life so jolly as jack's and when one watched their saucy gambols and remembered that they were actually paid to be there it looked as if there could be no life so jolly as a chorus girl's as it happened the first to provoke dissatisfaction was the tenor he had been refused permission to beg indulgence for his cold but resolving that the audience should understand that they were not hearing him to advantage he kept laying his hand on his chest with an air of suffering it made him a depressing figure and when he exclaimed 'beware my temper's hot' a humourist in the balcony cried how's your poultice a man in the pit said hush but several persons giggled and the humourist was stimulated to further witticisms other humourists began to envy him his successes as the piece proceeded the interruptions were frequent once the low comedian attempted a repartee but it came too late in the evening to turn the scale the malcontents had grown spiteful and as a rejoinder he was hissed his companions stared at one another haggardly behind they stood quaking dreading the cues that would recall them to the stage at every exit they came off gasping the brutes the pigs oh what a wicked house it is the house would have been astonished at the emotion displayed at the extraordinary sensitiveness of such people to the stalls there were just a few noisy young fellows upstairs who made jokes indeed it seemed a long time between the jokes to the stalls they wore an air of superior detachment but they were secretly amused only rosalind understood rosalind felt faint miss lascelles had been accepted by the balcony while they were still good humoured and she was among those who escaped contumely but miss jinman's record availed her little derisive cheers greeted her every entrance and a lifetime on the boards could not save her from the sickness of the senses which attacks a player who is being guyed as for miss vavasour she trembled as if she had ague when a youth mimicked her high notes in her solo and on her bloodless face while she sang the make up stood out in patches like paint on the cheeks of a corpse at the conclusion of the song she clung hysterically to tattie lascelles in the wings when the end was reached the audience rose murmuring that it was a silly piece and not worth going to they shouldn't think it would be a success no one but rosalind suspected the despair that was hidden by the curtain she made her way to the stage door tedious as the performance had been a number of young men had preceded her and were assembling to address the chorus ladies when they came out thirty were waiting there that night when the chorus came out at last an old woman a dresser was hurrying in with two glasses containing whisky from the refreshment room one of the young men asked her jauntily if she would take a message for him to the sixth girl on the right she said she was in a hurry and pushed the door open as the door keeper wasn't there to be obstructive rosalind followed her inside many of the players were in the flaring passage they had not begun to doff their costumes yet they were lingering in groups a tinselled nerveless crowd with harassed eyes miss vavasour sat crying on a clothes hamper miss jinman was waiting weakly for her whisky as it appeared her gaze fell on the huddled girl here have half of this child she said gently the brunette with golden hair exclaimed no no take yours miss jinman queenie can have half of mine everybody kept casting anxious glances in the direction of the stage where voices could be heard disputing poor old tat murmured rosalind now miss lascelles as we know had had less than the majority to unhinge her but so infectious was the atmosphere so easily swayed are some of these extraordinarily sensitive people of the theatre that as rosalind's arm was slipped round her waist she immediately burst into tears and sobbed as if her heart would break cheer up said rosalind it'll go all right after a few more rehearsals i shall be b better directly gulped miss lascelles d don't mind me i'm a fool but i can't help it i'm broke up we're all of us broke up groaned miss jinman did you ever see such a house as it was in all my experience i never saw anything like it what were they saying as they came out do you think we shall go on my dear i sha'n't be kept anyhow wailed miss vavasour mr quisby's been bullying me as if it was all my fault i shall be out of a shop again and i did hope i was settled till the spring i don't know what i shall do i'm sure where is he inquired rosalind that's him quarrelling with mr omee there said miss lascelles mr omee says he won't let the piece go on to morrow night not go on they say he says so put in the demi blonde that's all gas he'd have to shut the theatre he won't do that if you ask me said the low comedian taking part in the conference gloomily it puts the kybosh on the tour we may as well pack up our props and git there's no good health for miss kiss and tell after to night's show git demanded miss jinman git where i shall have my rights i've got a contract take it to your uncle's said the low comedian see what he'll lend you on it if you ask me the syndicate's a wrong 'un if we strike it lucky we'll get our fares and if we don't strike it lucky we can travel on our luggage i see it sticking out a foot a shudder ran through the players they gathered about him dumbly we can all claim a fortnight's salary in lieu of notice asserted miss jinman rallying that's the law it's the rule of the profession the company perked up a little they turned their eyes to miss jinman so i've been led to believe said the low comedian and in such circs the pros always get it i don't think claim oh we can claim we'll all get fat claiming won't we you're better off to claim from the post office than from a syndicate at all events you do know where st martin's le grand is the company collapsed the long and the short of it he continued is that we're out with a stumour of a piece why didn't it go is there anything wrong with us no a jolly clever crowd if you ask me the piece has got no stamina stamina was not the word he used that's what's the matter and that 'iyde park corner cloth settled us i'll lay anyone 'ere ten to one that the tour dries up and the syndicate does a guy 'oo's quisby quisby they gasped 'who's quisby' quisby repeated the low comedian emphatically i say 'oo's quisby i'll lay anybody 'ere ten to one that quisby calls us to morrow to say he ain't responsible now i wish all syndicates were in 'ell the dispute between the powers had ended and suddenly the prompter's voice rang through the passage he bawled everybody on the stige please principals and chorus are wanted on the stige the eyes met for a moment and then the players trooped away with sinking hearts the cold bare stage was in shadow for the floats and battens had been extinguished and the only light was shed by a single burner of the t piece by the t piece mr quisby stood his back to the dark emptiness of the auditorium the prompter was still heard calling in the distance everybody on the stige please principals and chorus on the stige shivering they flocked there some in their plumes and spangles others already in their shabby street clothes many were in a state of transition the faces daubed with grease the undergarments and naked necks revealed by hasty ulsters nobody spoke when the last comer had scrambled to the crowd all looked at mr quisby the suspense that held them mute was pitiable outside the thirty young men had collected to accost the merry chorus girls ladies and gentlemen said mr quisby there will be no performance to morrow he forced a hearty air i'm going to talk to you like a pal things look a bit rocky but we must hope for the best i won't disguise from you that there may be no tour now you all know as much as i do there may be no tour whether there is or not i've no doubt we shall all get what's due to us i hope we shall i'm sure god knows i can't afford to lose what they owe me he made a slight pause to let this sink as soon as i hear from london what the management intends to do we'll put our heads together again you worked nobly to night nobly one and all some of you ought to be in london getting your thirty and forty quid a week if the thing's a frost it won't be the fault of the artists and i mean to let the management know it what management cried the low comedian 'ave you left off being manager all of a sudden ladies and gentlemen as you're all aware the management is a syndicate mr quisby proceeded with difficulty if this was my crowd i should talk very different do you know what i should say if this was my crowd i should say 'between you and i i'm a bit doubtful of the piece that's straight but i've got a first class company of artists and by george i mean to keep 'em' i should say 'if i can't pull this piece together then i'll cast the whole blessed crowd for another' that's what i should say if i was manager but i'm not no i'm one of you we're all in the same boat i'm engaged at a salary like yourselves still he smeared the perspiration round his lying lips still it's always darkest before dawn there's a silver lining to every cloud and we may find as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it mr omee won't have the piece and er you're all to clear your props out of the theatre first thing in the morning but there are plenty of other theatres in the kingdom we must stick together where there's a will there's a way we must stick together like englishmen in the hour of trouble all the world over and er er be loyal to the show ladies and gentlemen boys and girls mr omee is waiting to see me in his office that's all well he couldn't have spoken any fairer many of the poor wretched women said to one another as they lagged through the forsaken streets chapter xv indeed it was mr omee whom the company censured mr omee who had been inhuman enough to banish a worthless performance from his theatre never said miss jinman in all her experience had she known artists to be so grossly insulted mr quisby's position might be ambiguous mr quisby might be shirking his responsibilities not to put too fine a point upon it mr quisby might be a rogue but he had paid them compliments and mr omee had shut his doors against them mr omee was the innocent person whom they execrated and reviled in the quarter where the professional apartments of blithepoint are most numerous the landladies looked anxious in the morning on every doorstep in corporation road and half way down alfreton terrace the news was known by nine o'clock the lodgers were obliged to fence with searching questions at breakfast and many of the houris heating curling tongs in the parlour fire were told that it would save trouble if they got in their dinner themselves towards midday the company straggled off the pier with baskets and parcels and the baggageman was busy collecting the clothes hampers the boards of little miss kiss and tell had gone from the turnstiles and later bill stickers came along and splashed up advertisements of a stopgap the rejected comedians stood on the parade and eyed the work morosely they had hoped the theatre would have to be closed miss jinman said it was very strange to say the least she didn't understand how the bills had been printed since last night it looked to her as if mr omee had been playing them false from the start then striking proof of mr omee's perfidy was forthcoming his brutal nature was revealed to the full he offered to make the stranded performers by whom he had lost money a present of their fares if they liked to return to their homes ah said the chorus that shows what a dirty trick he served us he has exposed his hand there said miss jinman wants to get us out of the town and mr quisby who meant to pay them nothing but was endeavouring to make use of them in slocombe on the swamp the following week before he decamped told them there was a reviving prospect of a three months' tour so not more than a third of the company profited by mr omee's generosity and the others warned them that they were being very unwise and by this time the tidings of the disaster had spread from corporation road and alfreton terrace as far as the grand hotel where it provided languid amusement and the plight of the players was known to all the visitors on the front including conrad but it was not until friday december th that one of those incidents which may occur to anybody associated him with the matter it had been misty since morning and towards the close of day the fog deepened when he left a house where he had been lunching with a man he took the wrong turning so far as he was able to see at all he saw that he had blundered into a neighbourhood which was strange to him a humble neighbourhood apparently with nothing of a watering place about it this being boxing day the little shops to which he came were shuttered and owing to the weather few people were abroad he wandered amid dim desertion then as he paused hesitating two girls emerged suddenly from the fog and stopped before him oh exclaimed one of them could you tell us where gandy's the greengrocer's is i am so sorry said conrad i can't can you direct me to the parade she answered absurdly that he was coming away from it though he was standing still it's over there she said you go down there and take the first on the left and keep straight on you can't miss it i have missed it demurred conrad thank you for rescuing me i wish i could direct you to gandy's the greengrocer's in return the other girl had not spoken yet but now she said oh never mind thanks we shall find it they say it's quite near but it's too dark to make out the names it was also too dark to make out her features but her voice was delicious and if the fog didn't flatter her she was dowered with the eyes that he most ardently admired he was all at once sensible of a keen interest in the whereabouts of the greengrocer's that seems to be a shop at the corner i'll go over and see what it is he said promptly but it was a general dealer's and he came back not displeased bother we must find it cried the first girl may i come and help you he asked oh you can come if you like she said and added as a pure concession to formality it's awf'ly kind of you so they all proceeded through the fog it's such a nuisance everything being shut to day the first girl went on that's why we want gandy's they say gandy's live there and might oblige us we can ring 'em up fruit he inquired no she said flowers violets we want some for the concert to night are you going certainly i am said conrad what concert i haven't heard about it oh well it was only settled this morning we're giving a concert at the victoria hall the little miss kiss and tell company it's to help us all mr quisby our manager only let me know just now i'm going to sing a 'flower song' and i want some 'button holes' to throw among the audience i can't do the song without throw one to me said conrad i will she promised we ought to get some people in as it's bank holiday don't you think so and if the show 'goes' we can have the hall again to morrow the tickets are only sixpence and a shilling did you see us on the pier no he said i wasn't here then i was just too late how many tickets can you let me have oh you'll get them at the door we haven't got any you'll really come won't you i'll come if i miss my dinner to get there he vowed where is victoria hall it's i don't know the name of the street it's near the station anybody'll tell you we begin at eight o'clock this was all very well but the girl of the voice had not spoken again and he wished she would say something shall i hear you sing too he asked looking across at her he looked across at her just as they approached a lamp post and his most sanguine hopes were realised he found her adorable no i am not in the programme said rosalind here's a policeman cried miss lascelles can you tell us where gandy's the greengrocer's is she begged again the constable did not know and official though useless took a long time to say so more intelligently he remarked that it was nasty weather for boxing day and conrad gave him a half crown the next instant they deciphered the name of gandy themselves what a stupid policeman exclaimed rosalind pouting she pulled the bell and glanced at conrad conrad happened to be glancing at her your troubles are nearly over she said with a smile i am not impatient owned conrad there were descending footsteps and a woman opened the door he said ingratiatingly i am sorry to disturb you but we're trying to get some flowers can you let me have some flowers said the woman she had a vacant stare a few bunches of violets rosalind explained y e s murmured the woman she made a long pause we 'aven't got no flowers now she said n no i'm sorry we can't oblige you can you tell us where we can get some put in miss lascelles sharply no no i couldn't say i'm sure faltered the woman there's peters' opperzite p'raps they might be able to oblige you do you know where there's a florist's questioned conrad florist's she shook her head n no i can't say as i do not one as is likely to be open to day let's try peters' they said and scurried across the road here they pulled without effect the bell yielded to them immoderately but no tinkle came they regarded one another discouraged you had better leave us to our fate sighed rosalind are you dismissing me his tone was reproachful releasing you she said in her best st james' manner my chains are flowers said he ornately i wish you'd give 'em to me said tattie lascelles you shall have them before we part ladies i have an inspiration you know the way to the parade let's go down there and get a fly then we've nothing more to do the responsibility's the flyman's we'll take him by the hour and make him drive us about blithepoint till we find a florist's is it carried unanimously cried rosalind right about face quick march and there was a belated fly dozing by the pier when the man had recovered from his astonishment at being hailed he grew quite brisk and developed ideas he suggested mitchell's and drove them to a fashionable florist's in the mall nothing could have been happier mr mitchell accepted their apologies and lit the gas as amiably as if bank holidays were of no importance bountifully he brought forward his best for them and his best was as beauteous as it was expensive the warm perfumed air was agreeable after the fog and rosalind among the azaleas was divine there are few keener pleasures than taking out a nice woman and spending money on her and it is unnecessary that one should go out fond of the woman it's so easy to get fond of her in the process oh no really she protested and she meant it for miss lascelles was already laden no none for me really just these pleaded conrad they're so pretty it's a shame to leave them behind he put them in her hands i'd like you to see some roses i've got here sir said the proprietor it's not often you can see roses like those exquisite assented conrad and just a few roses won't you well one then she said succumbing we'll have some roses commanded conrad magnificently and those look nice those lilies of the valley you might give us some lilies of the valley will you i'll have nothing else she told him in her first undertone the woman's first undertone is so sweet a few he entreated you ought to wear lilies of the valley i wish you were going to sing to night do you i shall see you there sha'n't i she nodded yes i shall be in 'front' i'm so glad i met you he thought of taking them in to the hotel to tea but her companion's toilette had been very hasty the fly was as fragrant as a flower show when they drove away she buried her fair face in the blossoms he had given to her it's permissible but it may stir the man's imagination it stirred conrad's he had rarely wanted a kiss from a woman so much in the scented dusk as their gaze met her eyes were luminous like stars the fly rattled into corporation road and he wondered whether she was going to ask him if he would 'come in' the fly stopped au revoir he said victoria hall i have the name right won't you come and help us put the flowers in water she suggested it was of interest to see her without a hat when she took off her coat he was captivated he stayed about ten minutes and the other girl didn't go out of the room both went to the door with him when he left eight o'clock then he said eight o'clock whom shall i ask for if i don't see you 'miss daintree' but you're sure to see me you won't be late no i shall be there when it begins good bye and thanks oh good bye he saw her smile to him again from the step and the cab turned what a lark i say isn't he mashed on you do you like his moustache hasn't he got lovely teeth exclaimed tattie in the passage y e s he's rather nice said rosalind chapter xvi eight o'clock had just struck when conrad arrived at the slum where he was to spend the evening the exterior of the hall had no sanguine air four opaque gas globes glimmered over a narrow entrance and in the obscurity a written appeal affixed by wafers was barely legible he made it out to be help the poor kiss and tell girls stranded in the town through no fault of their own show your sympathy by patronising us behind a portire a disreputable looking man wearing a queer overcoat sat at a small table with tickets he asked sixpence or a shilling and conrad said a shilling and the man said front row there was a piano on a shallow platform in lieu of footlights some pots of ferns had been disposed at wide intervals there was no curtain but a screen behind which giggles were audible turned a corner of the hall into the most limited of artists' rooms those artists who were not making their toilettes sat quietly among the audience perhaps two hundred chairs were ranged across the hall and about fifty of them were occupied one of them was occupied by rosalind good evening she said good evening said conrad may i sit down these are the shilling ones said she oh of course if you have i'm afraid we're leading you into awful extravagance it isn't very full no i'm sorry i wish i could have sent some people have you got another concert to morrow they're talking about it they've got the hall very cheap i might take some tickets and see what i can do with them i suppose that would be a good plan wouldn't it perhaps said rosalind doubtfully why 'perhaps' i thought it was to help you all yes she answered oh it's meant to there's a reservation in your manner he said that what's the use of our being such old friends if you don't confide in me ah i didn't think of that she laughed well did you see the man with a coat i saw him with aversion i thought it would please you that's the manager mr quisby your manager do you mean i'm telling you the manager of the company that came to grief the girls are supposed to have got this up for themselves but you may have noticed that you paid your shilling to mr quisby a ah said conrad there seems a weak spot in the business arrangements well what do you propose a youth in a very shabby tweed suit came on to the platform he sat down at the piano and rattled the introduction to the well known music hall song entitled my little baby boy on bounced the golden haired brunette she wore a skirt to the knees and had made up her face as if for the glare of a theatre her appearance lowered the concert to the level of a penny gaff several women of the shop keeping class hitherto sympathetic murmured oh and tightened their mouths isn't the costume a mistake whispered conrad do you think so how would you have dressed her well said conrad a long frock mm what sort of frock well i should have made her look quiet and very er respectable i know go on i should have said 'be pale and pathetic' that's right i wanted them to but they've all got themselves up wrong except my friend miss lascelles sh the vocalist's blackened eyelids drooped to the paper that she held 'some folks want power and riches and really will not be denied and when they've accomplished their object they are very far from satisfied a fig for your wealth and your power for riches i care not a jot contented am i yes and happy i'm quite satisfied with my lot' inappropriate said rosalind under her breath isn't it the vocalist looked up again for now she knew the words 'i'm not tired of england i've no wish to roam there's a little six roomed house that's my home sweet home my house is my castle who is my pride and joy why his royal highness the king of the castle my little baby boy' when she had shrilled the chorus times without number she withdrew and conrad said can't we go and sit further back where we can talk look at all those chairs over there if you like what do you think of her she can't sing oh that's a detail but she doesn't work the song how do you mean didn't you feel what she ought to do well of course you wouldn't 'his royal highness the king' line ought to bring the house down wouldn't i make it 'go' show me he begged there's nobody looking so in the corner that they had found she hummed the bars and showed him oh aren't you clever he exclaimed what a pretty voice you have perhaps you're er fond of babies if you mean 'have i got any children' no i haven't that was an actress not a mother i've no ring on did you think i was married well you looked so very devoted i wondered for a moment are you suddenly said conrad gazing at her 'suddenly' what devoted i meant 'married' she explained i he said good heavens don't be so astonished such a thing has happened to men yes but i'm not a marrying man i think most men say they aren't marrying men till they say 'will you marry me' it's a pity they change their mind so often i have pitied them myself them she said the girls you mean a man begins to be in love much sooner than a woman but he finishes much sooner too well that's why marriage was invented said conrad the man brings the fervour and the woman brings the faithfulness you can't combine better qualities yes and what about his fervour afterwards he wants to go and be in love all over again haven't i seen in this profession travelling about a girl often meets a good fellow i don't say he's often rich the ones who mean well are generally hard up perhaps he's a clerk or something in the town he's taken with her from the 'front' and gets to know her then he waits for her at the stage door every evening and sees her home and makes her talk 'shop' he always makes her talk 'shop' that's the fascination to him after she goes away he writes to her and by and by perhaps they marry they do sometimes of course she's to leave the stage he generally asks for that the kind of man i'm talking about well what's the result she's sorry she gave it up no she isn't there are exceptions don't i know it but in most cases she's only too thankful to give it up there's no glamour about it for the girl she has lived all that out the 'little six roomed house and home sweet home' is the only ambition she has left it's the man who finds the marriage dull he was in love with being in love with an actress he liked waiting for that smile over the footlights about the middle of the first verse of her solo it flattered him to know he was the one man in all the audience who was going to talk to her directly when they're married she's just an ordinary girl like miss smith and miss brown and the other girls he knew the fairy has lost her wings she's a very good little wife perhaps but just a drab little mortal he says 'how romantic it used to be when she was a fairy' and goes fairy catching outside another stage door poor little mortal men want romances when you find them out the most unlikely men are romantic but when you find them out nine hundred and ninety women in a thousand are domesticated are you there are the other ten laughed rosalind and i'm not talking of society women of course i don't know anything about them i'm talking of every day women and us look at my friend i suppose you'd take her for a bohemian through and through she has had to earn her living in the profession since she was sixteen and she's slangy and she'd shock your sort of woman out of her wits marriage is the last thing she thinks of now but let a man she liked come along she'd marry him on two pounds a week and go through fire and water for him and thank heaven for the joy of hanging up the washing in her own back yard miss lascelles with a hint of coon steps was singing 'what is the use of loving a girl when you know she don't want yer to' i shouldn't have thought it said conrad she doesn't suggest domesticity in back yards does she suggest a boarding school for young ladies his eyebrows asked a question there was a time when tattie was among little girls who walked two and two in kensington really do you know that hurts rather i'm sorry i'm sorry sighed rosalind but her heart's sweet she added it's only the bloom that has gone she smiled clap your hands she's my pal you've got to applaud her she's very good he said applauding i thought she was going to do a flower song but i like that one isn't it pretty i like the way it goes yes rag time all against the beat don't hum it out of tune she said plaintively she's going to do the flower song next by the bye i may have to introduce you to some of the girls what shall i call you my name conrad answered deferentially is 'warrener' she bent her head thank you said lady darlington when the concert was over he walked with her as far as mrs cheney's tattie of course was with them at the foot of the steps tattie shook hands with him and went indoors and he remained a minute saying 'good night' to rosalind the other girl might well have heard all they said but the minute had charm to him because the other girl had left them it implied something and underneath to both these shuttlecocks of temperament there was another charm not defined yet to be savoured in the first moments of solitude the charm of recapturing a mood of years ago at a doorstep late you look tired oh it's nothing a pause i shall see you to morrow yes come in to tea a whiff of the fragrance of his youth a touch of the sentimentality of her girlhood idealised corporation road as they parted in the fog i wish it were to morrow good night do you good night the old tune was not classical but it was pretty chapter xvii i want something substantial said conrad gravely shaking his head for the follow say a chateaubriand two days had passed and in his mind a new and disquieting thought had risen the thought that rosalind couldn't pay for enough to eat truly she was paying for a great deal to eat conjuring steaks and puddings on to the tables of a dozen lodgings and inventing strange stories to account for her having half sovereigns to lend but conrad could not know that he only knew that the necessities of the kiss and tell company were more urgent than he had understood and he felt very sorry for all the girls but his heart bled for lady bountiful a chateaubriand he repeated firmly it was nourishing and pommes souffles no well i'll leave the potatoes to you with a chestnut pure eh and let us have nice sweets don't give me the table d'hte sweets special what about peaches well send for the best fruit you can get you've plenty of time where's the wine list a quarter to two that table in the corner for three persons there is one place in blithepoint where the chef can cook though he shirks pommes souffles you go downstairs to it unless you choose the hotel entrance and it was in the restaurant downstairs that conrad ordered the luncheon on monday he meant to say things at luncheon but when rosalind and tattie arrived there was a bomb shell with the hors d'oeuvres mr quisby has bolted they cried taking their seats bolted he echoed how do you know queenie vavasour and miss jinman have been to his rooms this morning they went to tell him they must have some money he has gone he went last night with our concert sixpences i say exclaimed conrad he was by this time almost a member of the company what are we all going to do it's a nice fix continued rosalind reproachfully i told you this would happen i never thought he'd be able to take us on anywhere else never for a moment didn't i warn you you did said conrad oh i admit it will you have a sardine or miss lascelles let me give you some of the pretty ones with the red and yellow i told you all along repeated rosalind that girls could do nothing for themselves in a matter like that that it needed a man to take it up now didn't i say so you said so several times but you didn't suggest what i should do i couldn't menace him with a revolver men are so lazy she smiled you may smile said conrad reprovingly but it's very serious for us we are all out of an engagement yes she agreed and goodness only knows when you'll get one again that's sheer spite you're jealous of my talent miss lascelles tell her i can't be out of an engagement long with all his experience cried tattie his notices as 'buttercup' were immense poor miss jinman sighed rosalind i'm sorry for that old woman she nodded at conrad you should see her this morning i want to see her he declared or rather i want one of you to see her for me you know we've all got to stick together in this thing and and 'be loyal to the show' said tattie no but joking aside i want you girls to help me straighten things out i was going to talk to you about it anyhow now tell me what do they all want i suppose they all want a 'shop' tattie answered i can't give them a 'shop' i'm not in the business but i might send them home with a few of the best in their pockets how would that do they lifted their heads and looked at him and the waiter put the soup on the table did you mean it murmured rosalind when the waiter had turned his back well of course now this looks very good let's enjoy our lunch we seem to be getting on a bit so we needn't worry don't you think you ought to take your jacket off you'll be cold when you go out no i've loosened it she said but er do you know i'd rather you didn't do that i i think they could all manage without now why interfere said conrad peevishly this is my department you have bungled hopelessly yourself by your own showing you distrusted the man and you let him escape instead of patrolling his doorstep like a bright young woman then when i bring intelligence to bear on the matter and we're all happy you must cut in and throw cold water on the scheme take your soup and be good isn't it nice said tattie now that's a sensible remark i turn to you we won't be interfered with suppose you help me miss lascelles will you be santa claus in corporation road for me oh she faltered you had better go yourself i gasped conrad i wouldn't do it for a million they'd thank me some people have got no tact they'd cry over you she said with tears in her own voice you don't know what it is you're doing they aren't used to men who you're a trump oh pickles he said where's that waiter i say we're all being awfully solemn i thought this was going to be a jolly party miss daintree mr warrener please talk i'm going to talk later on she said i'm going to talk like a mother to you won't you talk like yourself in the meanwhile i don't want anything better then she talked like herself and the plates were changed and the hour was pleasurable it was a very uncommon hour because her friend was so nice the pretty girl's friend is nearly always an infliction and makes mischief afterwards because she hasn't been sufficiently admired it was such a pleasurable hour that conrad knew a pang of regret in reflecting that there would be few more like it rosalind no doubt would flee from blithepoint as soon as the other women would he meet her again of course she would drift into another company meet another man in another town damn i'm going to miss that girl he mused and know she's flirting with somebody else while i'm remembering her 'the world' he exclaimed indulging his weakness for quotation 'is a comedy to those that think a tragedy to those who feel' and neither rosalind nor tattie found it needful to inquire to which category he was assigning himself there may be sentimental seconds even over a chateaubriand he added let me fill up that glass for you you've nothing there but froth it was more than half past three when the waiter abased himself in letting them out and as they turned along the parade tattie recollected that she had promised to be with miss vavasour at four they all stopped for a minute and conrad tried to look as if he didn't want her to go however she went and he and rosalind sauntered on without her what shall we do he said shall we go and hear the band there isn't one in the afternoon this time of year not in the band stand but i think there is on the pier the band stand is retained chiefly as a rendezvous i believe when he says 'where will you meet me this evening' she always says 'opposite the band stand' rosalind replied how do you know i gather it pensive figures watch the clock and look up and down they all turn hopefully when they hear you and scowl at you as you come in sight i passed once in the evening i felt myself such a general disappointment that i always walk on the other side now the man at the turnstiles told them that the orchestra was playing in the theatre and as they drew close they heard it but for some little time they could find no way inside no charge was made for admission to the theatre in the afternoon and only the entrance to the balcony was open they saw nobody to guide them there were no other footsteps on the pier there was no sound but the plaintive music that they couldn't reach they wandered round and round the terrace trying locked doors the tide was out and the sheen of the smooth wet sand was violet under a paling sky little white waves were hurrying and in the faded distance the star of the lightship gleamed and hid through the window of an unexpected office they spied the girl who sold the stall tickets in the evening oh yes she said and ran out to show them where to go only two or three figures inhabited the roomy balcony below the body of the house was soulless shrouded in white wrappers faint daylight touched the auditorium wanly but gas jets yellowed the faces of the orchestra in the narrow line of glare amid the emptiness they played rosalind and conrad sat down in the last row and spoke in low voices he knew that the impression of the scene was going to linger with him after she had gone in a few minutes she whispered let's go on the terrace again and they crept to the door we couldn't talk in there she said look here what you were saying to tattie i want you to tell me straight i don't know anything about you can you afford to do all that oh yes he said that's all right but really tell me the truth how well off are you oh well i'm very well off because if you're going to miss the money there's another way out that's why i shouldn't forgive myself if i put you in a hole i bar that sort of thing lunch and flowers are all very well but the other's rather steep i sha'n't miss the money honour bright honour bright oh well then it's awfully good of you i sha'n't forget it she said 'warrener' is really your name isn't it i thought you understood that at the time yes she said i did i only wondered for a moment i'm sorry oh it's nothing he answered you know what i want you to tell me what about yourself what can i do for you oh you needn't count me or tattie we don't want anything that's all bosh but you don't come in with the rest i want to do more than that for you treat me as a pal you're on the rocks and i'm not i've been there and i know what it means let me give you a hundred to set you right you want to give me a hundred pounds she threw back her astonished face at him she was all white throat and eyes d' ye like me so much damnably said conrad the music had stopped and now the bandsmen came hurrying past them they stood looking shoreward in a pause on the dusk of the parade the chain of electric globes quivered into light it's rather rough on you she murmured isn't it i've always drawn the line it's no good i didn't think it was i shouldn't have told you if you hadn't asked me i know if a man cared about you you'd expect him to want to marry you why shouldn't i oh why not only i'm one of the men who aren't designed for husbands i could make a beautiful lover while it lasted a very staunch friend to a man or a woman all my life but everybody has his limitations women are just the same there are women who are made to be daughters they're perfect as daughters but they should never marry there are women who're meant for mothers they should never marry i mean they make very poor wives not many of us are first class all round still that's nothing to do with it i haven't asked you for anything and i'm not going to if you had been different well for my own sake i should have been very glad i never played 'faust' though everybody's morality begins somewhere it's just my luck that i've got fond of a girl who isn't 'different' but there it is we needn't talk about it put that aside and let me help you as if i were your brother i don't feel like your brother but you can trust me just as much i quite understand i'm not vain enough to suppose you like me but i quite understand that it would be 'no use' if you did she looked beyond him pensively and pensively she hummed 'what is the use of loving a girl if the girl don't love you what is the use of loving a girl when you know she don't want yer to' don't do that said conrad i'm trying to talk to you like a chum if you sing that song i shall kiss you well what do you want me to say she asked strolling on i don't want you to say anything you'll get the money for the others in the morning and i'll send you the hundred during the day you're not to she exclaimed i don't need it i swear i don't you're not to send tattie or me a shilling if you do i'll send it back why because i don't need it that's why no it isn't it's because you don't believe what i've said my dear girl i don't suppose i shall ever see you again after you leave here when do you go we go to morrow you and tattie i mean 'miss lascelles' oh 'tattie' doesn't hurt yes she's going to stay we're going to be together for a little while where don't you want me to ask london she said have you got any people there no the only relation that counts is in the country now now mind you're not to send anything for us two or you'll offend me whatever you send will go to the others all of it have it your own way he said quietly they walked once round the terrace without speaking are you angry she asked you've hurt rather you've pitched it back at me i don't mean the beastly money but the intention i think you might have trusted me on my honour i'd have taken no advantage of it after another pause she said i'm a fool to tell you but i can't help it i'm not on the stage any more i'm not hard up i'm married married i've been married five years good lord he said well not on the stage what are you doing here then i wasn't acting i only came down to be in it all again i her smile was wistful i was 'trying back' i wanted to feel as i used to feel i was dull he nodded comprehension oh yes i've done a lot of 'trying back' myself do you care for him she gave the faintest shrug i wish you weren't going away he sighed i shall often see you again we're the only people left on the pier said rosalind don't you think we're having more than our twopenn'orth i shall go to town on wednesday he told her as they turned homeward shall you you haven't answered what i asked you i don't know she said besides you'll soon forget that you wanted to if i don't forget well you may write to me where i'll post you a line before i leave she promised we shall leave as early as we can as soon as we've done your business for you i sha'n't see you before i go by the bye i don't know if you're staying at the hotel where we lunched there'll be letters for you from the company to morrow too no i'm at the grand he said my christian name is 'conrad' it seemed a very short distance to corporation road it seemed untrue that it was only four days since he had stood at the door with her for the first time they went up the steps and she did not turn the knob are you coming in she murmured i daresay tattie is back do you know i think i'd rather say 'au revoir' to you alone au revoir she said her hand was formal he was rather chilled you mean to post me that line he questioned she nodded and then in the darkness of the doorway she laughed and began to hum the song that he had warned her not to sing chapter xviii he found the evening very long he was restless the memory of her kiss was exquisite but it did not make for repose it seemed to him intolerably stupid that he was boring himself in the billiard room of the grand when corporation road was so near still she had taken leave of him if he went he might be unwelcome to her she might be disappointing to him early next afternoon he received the line she had promised it arrived with letters from the company they were such deeply grateful letters that they hurt him a little when he read them but he guessed which was hers and he opened that one first mixed with the pleasure with which he opened it there was the curiosity even the he would have refused to acknowledge it even the slight touch of apprehension with which a man who likes a woman better than he knows her always opens her first letter he smiled he heard her speaking if you ever write the address is 'miss tattie lascelles co madame hermiance bis great titchfield street w' you understand you aren't to put my name on the outside envelope at all blithepoint is blessing you rd if he ever wrote did she say by his halidom he was going to write immediately his impulse was to beg her to dine with him but probably she would find it easier to meet him during the day luncheon then but where the choice of a restaurant bothered him she might be afraid of acquaintances seeing her he bethought himself of the caf anonyme in soho and entreated her to lunch with him on thursday at two o'clock as a postscript he scribbled you won't say you can't will you if i don't hear from you i shall be waiting for you at the door to enable her to reply though he prayed that no reply would come he added that he should stay at the carlton he was glad to leave blithepoint when the woman one liked there has gone a place is always distressing in the train it was agreeable to reflect that she had read his note by this time again he imagined her as she read it looking down looking up putting it in her pocket the little caf anonyme had been a good idea they would do their best for him there and their soles la marguery were unequalled in london the private rooms too were not unhomely they hit the happy medium there was no riot of red velvet and gilding nor were there rag roses hanging askew in dusty glass epergnes it would have been unappreciative it would have been an insult to ask rosalind to be made love to in a vulgar room he wandered about the carlton after dinner until the last post was delivered and was relieved to find there was nothing for him he was sure that if she hadn't meant to go she would have declined at once she wouldn't raise his hopes only to dash them to the parquetry as the clock was preparing to strike she wouldn't be thoughtless unfeeling oh no she wasn't like that and there was no letter on thursday either and he sallied to soho with delight the exterior of the caf anonyme when he reached it looked to him a shade less ingenuous than it had been but upstairs all was well the view of the grim houses opposite was screened by lace firelight flashed on the dutch hearth cheerfully and the little white table set for tte tte invited confidences he forced his attention upon the menu and lounged back into the street it was a fine day for london the sky was funereal and the pavements were muddy but there was no rain falling he loitered before the restaurant happily and glanced at his watch at five minutes to two expectation began to swell at two o'clock he couldn't hold back a smile at any instant now her face might irradiate the blank he wondered which way she would come and if she would drive or walk he could see for some distance both to right and left and his only regret was that he couldn't see both ways at once he kept turning his head fearful that he might miss a second's joy there was a leaping moment in which a figure suggested her as it hove in sight the girl proved offensively plain and he was furious with her as she passed somehow he did not rebound from the mistake it was the first fall in the temperature the girl had killed his elation he watched now eagerly but he repressed no smile she was late oh of course she would come but the fish would be spoilt rather stupid of her there was nothing more irritating than to have a careful luncheon ruined because a woman took twenty minutes to tie her veil a melancholy church clock boomed the quarter he began to feel that he was looking a fool traversing these twelve paving stones he was annoyed with her he should be at no pains to conceal it constantly hansoms rattled into view with disappointing people in them there appeared to him discouragement in the gaze of the portier now and a pair of loafers outside the public house at the corner were taking interest in him he supposed she would come into the tension of his mood there entered the first sick qualm of doubt and the church clock boomed again hope was breathing its last in him annoyance had melted into despair he longed for her too intensely to be reproachful if she came he would rejoice over her he would unbutton her gloves he would say how pretty her frock was and that the chef was delighted to have been given more time five and twenty minutes to three well he had better see what he had to pay it was no use hoping any longer well just five minutes the last stake if she weren't here then she wouldn't come at all she wouldn't expect him to wait at the door all day at the door his heart stopped the words bore suddenly a new significance in blithepoint at the door might have meant at the door of her lodgings could it be possible she had misunderstood had she thought he would be on the doorstep in great titchfield street no how could she she had told him she was married but the address was tattie's yes she might have thought so good heavens had she been waiting there for him perspiration broke out on him what was he to do look at the time she had given him up long ago she had gone away oh how could she have thought it he had named the restaurant still it was very odd she hadn't come he must find her he must explain but but but she was a married woman he couldn't go and peal the bell and ask for her wait a moment what had she said was she to stay with tattie or was tattie to stay with her anyhow tattie was there yes he could go he could go there and ask for tattie his head was spinning what the devil had become of all the cabs two minutes later the portier had blown his whistle and soho was behind the pace was reckless but to conrad's fevered stare even the omnibuses seemed to mock his hansom alternately he threw bribes and objurgations through the trap where was great titchfield street hidden were they making a tour of the west end slums the cab jerked to a stoppage at last and he leapt out and hesitated nothing but shops confronted him had he forgotten the number wasn't it bis the next moment he saw the name painted over a window madame hermiance french laundress it was very warm inside three girls and a moist loosely clothed woman whose opulent bosom was partially concealed stood at work behind a long table it fluttered with aerial frills and scraps of pink tissue paper one of the girls was folding things up and making them look pretty he said bonjour madame and the woman said good afternoon sare miss lascelles is she staying here is she in oh no sare she is gone gone ejaculated conrad she did lodge 'ere added the laundress i let 'er a room upstairs but she go away she get an engagement you mean an actress isn't it yes yes he said i know all about the engagement but she came back she came back the day before yesterday didn't she mais non monsieur she shook her head she is not come back damn he faltered er but there was a letter sent here for her it must have been delivered yesterday morning what has become of the letter ah letters she banged an iron about a shirt with double cuffs perturbed as he was he shuddered to see the havoc she was wreaking mees lascelles 'as writ me a post carte she ask if 'er letters come i send 'em on i zink she gives up ze thtre i zink she takes a situation wiz a lady of title julie she called zat letter zat come yesterday for mees lascelles it go to ze post hein j' n' sais pas called julie she sent a button flying off a waistcoat without turning a hair ameliarran yes'm ze letter for mees lascelles where ees it there yer are replied ameliar ann she was sewing a red cotton hieroglyphic into a customer's tying bow near one of the ends her nod indicated a shelf piled with packages and conrad perceived his letter lying neglected among the washing ah said madame hermiance alors i post it to night myself but this is no trifling matter exclaimed conrad trembling with rage miss lascelles may lose a very large salary through this that's a business letter from an impresario it should have been forwarded without delay tiens said madame hermiance calmly julie pack up ze collars he tramped across the shop and the three girls' heads turned to the left this much was certain rosalind had said that she and tattie would be together sheer babble that about the situation if the note reached tattie at once there was hope yet he strode back and the three girls' heads turned to the right madame monsieur i must apologise for occupying your time but a ne fait rien said the laundress julie pack up ze shirts but i want you to do me a kindness i want you to be good enough to send the letter to miss lascelles now by a messenger i suppose it won't take very long mais monsieur i 'ave nobody to send well but my dear lady he said and talked to her persuasively of paying for the service and the hansom that was outside alors said madame hermiance expectancy bubbled in him anew he would scrawl a line explaining what he had suffered beseeching rosalind to meet him still would madame have the kindness to provide him with an envelope it was provided and a sheet of note paper he was abased by the trouble he was causing her alas her note paper was not in the shop but she could offer him a price list it was very long and the back was blank this was no moment to finick the case was urgent he put his foot on a laundry basket and the price list on his knee and at the back of blouses bodices and white petticoats from d he pencilled his appeal when ameliarran had cast off her apron he promised her a sovereign to buy feathers she was given the post card bearing the address and he let her depart without a question it was evident now that rosalind had withheld her address very deliberately to ascertain where she lived wouldn't be playing the game but would the appeal find her at home she might be shopping visiting taking an aimless fatal walk hope tottered in him again the girls who remained eyed him sympathetically he was conscious that they placed no credence in his narrative of the impresario and he withdrew to wait where he would be less interesting the street was not picturesque for the scene of a lover's impatience it might be called preposterous the narrow pavements were so busy that he was forced to choose the narrow road and the road was made narrower by stalls of vegetables and tin pots ameliarran he had heard might accomplish her mission in half an hour he escaped from the marketing and lit a cigar in a grey thoroughfare of comparative seclusion would she be at home when he turned back he braced himself to meet the crisis he had consulted his watch frequently but he had not returned before ameliarran might be expected nevertheless he was too soon he withdrew again and fumed once more among the cabbages and pans the next time he was not too soon he found her in the shop and she had a note for him from rosalind or tattie rosalind he knew the writing let the girls gape he wasn't going outside to read it among the vegetables he opened it with elaborate listlessness she had not protracted his pain while she framed graceful messages her response consisted of eight words but they sufficed wait at the laundry throwing on my hat he doubled the girl's sovereign and drove no bargain with her mistress but the laundry cooped him now he closed the door and loitered gratefully on the step yes indeed he would wait in the sweetness of relief he was scarcely impatient a little drizzle was in the air but he did not heed it the day and the morrow and a hundred days broke into smiles before him and while he lingered there on the laundress's step in the squalid street under the rain conrad suddenly awoke to the exhilaration that sparkled in him was startled by its freshness he realised that fizzing in his pulses and his mind was the zest the buoyancy that he had mourned as dead it was here alive he reviewed with gusto his emotions of the afternoon the hope the suspense the desperation the quiver of rejoicing it had been good he had lived and felt this afternoon he would not have abated those emotions by a jot the immoral truth was clear to him he had made his great discovery that a man is young as often as he falls in love that rosalind had beauty was an irrelevance again to her lover a woman is what she makes him feel whether she is fair or ill favoured whether she is worthy or worthless whether she is formed like venus or clasps him in arms as thin as penholders to him she is supreme and while he adores her he is young the rain was pattering more smartly and he waited under his umbrella exultation was in his heart her promise was in his pocket ten years of his age had been shed behind the door and at this point it may be discreet of us to take leave of conrad as rosalind's
