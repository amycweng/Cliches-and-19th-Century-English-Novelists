xvii hercules and aphrodite xviii pardon you are mademoiselle girard xix how tricotrin saw london xx the infidelity of monsieur noulens introduction these disjointed thoughts about one of leonard merrick's most articulate books must begin with a personal confession for many years i walked about this earth avoiding the works of leonard merrick as other men might have avoided an onion this insane aversion was created in my mind chiefly by admirers of what is called the cheerful note in fiction such people are completely agreed in pronouncing mr merrick to be a pessimistic writer i hate pessimistic writers years ago when i was of an age when the mind responds acutely to exterior impressions some well meaning uncle or other fool gave me a pessimistic book to read this was a work of fiction which the british public had hailed as a masterpiece of humour it represented with an utter fury of pessimism the spiritual inadequacies of but why go into details now i have to confess that for a long time i did mr merrick the extraordinary injustice of believing him to be the author of that popular masterpiece the mistake though intellectually unpardonable may perhaps be condoned on other grounds by virtue of that process of thought which we call the association of ideas i naturally connected mr merrick with this work of super pessimism my friends being so confirmed in their belief that he was a super pessimist but by virtue of a fortunate accident i at last got the truth about mr merrick this event arose from the action of a right minded butcher who having exhausted his stock of the pigeon fancier's gazette sent me my weekly supply of dog bones wrapped about with leonard merrick these dog bones happened to reach my house at a moment when no other kind of literary nutriment was to be had having nothing better to read i read the dog bone wrappers thus by dog bones was i brought to merrick the most jolly amusing and optimistic of all spiritual friends the book to which these utterances are prefixed is to my mind one of the few really amusing books which have been published in england during my lifetime but then i think that all of mr merrick's books are amusing even his earnest books such as the actor manager when love flies out o' the window or the position of peggy harper it is of course true that such novels as these are unlikely to be found congenial by those persons who derive entertainment from fiction like my uncle's present on the other hand there are people in the world with a capacity for being amused by psychological inquiry to such people i would say don't miss merrick the extraordinary cheerfulness of mr merrick's philosophy is a fact which will impress itself upon all folk who are able to take a really cheerful view of life all of mr merrick's sermons i do not hesitate to call his novels sermons because no decent novel can be anything else all his sermons i say point to this conclusion that people who go out deliberately to look for happiness to kick for it and fight for it or who try to buy it with money will miss happiness this being a state of heart a mere outgrowth more often to be found by a careless and self forgetful vagrant than by the deliberate and self conscious seeker a cheerful doctrine this not only cheerful but self evidently true how right it is and how cheerful it is to think that while philosophers and clergymen strut about this world looking out and smelling out for its prime experiences more careless and less celebrated men are continually finding such things without effort without care in irregular and unconsecrated places in novel after novel mr merrick has preached the same good humoured cheerful doctrine the doctrine of anti fat he asks us to believe he makes us believe that a man or woman is not merely virtuous but merely sane who exchanges the fats of fulfilment for the little lean pleasures of honourable hope and high endeavour oh wise oh witty mr merrick mr merrick has not to my knowledge written one novel in which his hero is represented as having achieved complacency mr merrick's heroes all undergo the very human experience of hitting a snag they are none of them represented as enjoying this experience but none of them whimper and none of them rat if anybody could prove to me that mr merrick had ever invented a hero who submitted tamely to tame success to fat prosperity or who had stepped were it ever so lightly into the dirty morass of accepted comfort then would i cheerfully admit to anybody that leonard merrick is a pessimistic writer but until this proof be forthcoming i stick to my opinion i stick to the conviction that mr merrick is the gayest cheer fullest and most courageous of living humorists this opinion is a general opinion applicable to mr merrick's general work this morning however i am asked to narrow my field of view to contemplate not so much mr merrick at large as mr merrick in particular to look at mr merrick in his relationship to this one particular book a chair on the boulevard now if i say as i have said that mr merrick is cheerful in his capacity of solemn novelist what am i to say of mr merrick in his lighter aspect that of a writer of feuilletons addressing myself to an imaginary audience of magazine enthusiasts i ask them to tell me whether judged even by comparison with their favourite fiction some of the stories to be found in this volume are not exquisitely amusing the first story in the book that which mr merrick calls the tragedy of a comic song is in my view the funniest story of this century but i don't ask or expect the magazine enthusiast to share this view or to endorse that judgment the tragedy of a comic song is essentially one of those productions in which the reader is expected to collaborate the author has deliberately contrived certain voids of narrative and his reader is expected to populate these anecdotal wastes this is asking more than it is fair to ask of a magazine enthusiast no genuine magazine reader cares for the elusive or allusive style in fiction the tragedy of a comic song won't do for bouverie street however well and completely it may do for me but there are other stories in this book there is that screaming farce called the suicides in the rue sombre now then you magazine zealots speak up and tell me truly is there anything too difficult for you in this if so the psychology of what is called public taste becomes a subject not suited to public discussion the foregoing remarks and considerations apply equally to such stories as the dress clothes of m pomponnet and tricotrin entertains there are other stories which delight me as for example little flower of the wood but this jerks us back again to the essential mr merrick he who demands collaboration there are again other stories and yet others but to write down all their titles here would be merely to transcribe the index page of the book neither the reader nor i can afford to waste our time like that i have said nothing about the technical qualities of mr merrick's work i don't intend to do so it has long been a conceit of mine to believe that professional vendors of letterpress should reserve their mutual discussions of technique for technical occasions such as those when men of like mind and occupation sit at table with a bottle between them i am convinced that mr merrick is a very great and gifted man deeply skilled in his profession i can bring forth arguments and proofs to support this conviction but i fail utterly to see why i should do so to people who have a sense of that which is sincere and fresh in fiction these facts will be apparent to them my arguments and illustrations would be profitless as for those honest persons to whom the excellencies of merrick are not apparent i can only think that nothing which i or any other man could say would render them obvious happiness is in ourselves as the vicar remarked to the donkey who was pulling the lawn mower good luck leonard merrick and good cheer i shout my greeting to you across the ripples of that inky lake which is our common fishery a neil lyons a chair on the boulevard the tragedy of a comic song i like to monopolise a table in a restaurant unless a friend is with me so i resented the young man's presence besides he had a melancholy face if it hadn't been for the piano organ i don't suppose i should have spoken to him as the organ that was afflicting lisle street began to volley a comic song of a day that was dead he started that tune he murmured in french if i did not deceive myself tears sprang to his eyes i was curious certainly on both sides of the channel we had long ago had more than enough of the tune no self respecting organ grinder rattled it now that the young frenchman should wince at the tune i understood but that he should weep i smiled sympathetically we suffered from it over here as well i remarked i did not know he said in english that reproved my french it was sung in london also 'partant pour le moulin' under another name i told him it was an epidemic clearly the organ had stirred distressing memories in him for though we fell to chatting i could see that he neither talked nor dined with any relish as luck would have it too the instrument of torture resumed its repertoire well within hearing and when partant pour le moulin was reached again he clasped his head you find it so painful i inquired painful he exclaimed monsieur it is my 'istory that comic tune it is to me romance tragedy ruin will you hear wait i shall range my ideas listen it is paris at montmartre we are before the door of a laundress a girl approaches her gaze is troubled she frowns a little what ails her i shall tell you the laundress has refused to deliver her washing until her bill is paid and the girl cannot pay it not till saturday and she has need of things to put on it is a moment of anxiety she opens the door some minutes pass the girl reappears holding under her arm a little parcel good she has triumphed in coming out she sees a young man pale abstracted who stands before the shop he does not attempt to enter he stands motionless regarding the window with an air forlorn ah she says to herself here is another customer who cannot pay his bill but wait a little after 'alf an hour what happens she sees the young man again this time he stands before a modest restaurant does he go in no again no he regards the window sorrowfully he sighs the dejection of his attitude would melt a stone poor boy she thought he cannot pay for a dinner either the affair is not finished how the summer day is beautiful she will do some footing figure yourself that once more she perceives the young man now it is before the mont de piete the pawnbroker's she watches him attentively here at least he will enter she does not doubt she is wrong it is the same thing he regards he laments he turns away oh mon dieu she said nothing remains to him to pawn even it is too strong she addressed him monsieur but when she has said monsieur there is the question how she shall continue now the young man regards the girl instead of the pawnbroker's her features are pretty or pretty well her costume has been made by herself but it is not bad and she has chic above all she has chic he asks what can i have the pleasure to do for you remark that she is bohemian and he also the conversation was like this monsieur three times this morning i have seen you it was impossible that i resist speaking you have grief frightful he said perhaps she added timidly you have hunger also a hunger insupportable mademoiselle i myself am extremely hard up monsieur but will you permit that i offer you what i can angel the young man exclaimed there must be wings under your coat but i beg of you not to fly yet i shall tell you the reason of my grief if you will do me the honour to seat yourself at the cafe opposite we shall be able to talk more pleasantly this appeared strange enough this invitation from a young man who she had supposed was starving but wait a little her amazement increased when to pay for the wine he had ordered her companion threw on to the table a bank note with a gesture absolutely careless she was in danger of distrusting her eyes is it a dream she cried is it a vision from the thousand and one nights or is it really a bank note mademoiselle it is the mess of pottage the young man answered gloomily it is the cause of my sadness for that miserable money and more that is to come i have sold my birthright she was on a ship no what is it your expression at sea i am a poet he explained but perhaps you may not know my work i am not celebrated i am tricotrin mademoiselle gustave tricotrin at your feet for years i have written aided by ambition and an uncle who manufactures silk in lyons well the time is arrived when he is monstrous this uncle he says to me 'gustave this cannot last you make no living you make nothing but debts my tragedies he ignores either you must be a poet who makes money or you must be a partner who makes silk' how could i defy him he holds the purse it was unavoidable that i stooped he has given me a sum to satisfy my creditors and monday i depart for lyons in the meantime i take tender farewells of the familiar scenes i shall perhaps never behold again how i have been mistaken she exclaimed and then but the hunger you confessed of the soul mademoiselle said the poet the most bitter and you have no difficulties with the laundress none he groaned but in the bright days of poverty that have fled for ever i have had many difficulties with her this morning i reconstituted the situation i imagined myself without a sou and without a collar the little restaurant she questioned where i saw you dining on the odour i figured fondly to myself that i was ravenous and that i dared not enter it was sublime the mont de piete there imagination restored to me the vanished moments when i have mounted with suspense and my least deplorable suit of clothes his emotion was profound it is my youth to which i am bidding adieu he cried it is more than that it is my aspirations and my renown but you have said that you have no renown she reminded him so much the more painful said the young man the hussy we could not win is always the fairest i part from renown even more despairingly than from youth she felt an amusement an interest but soon it was the turn of him to feel an interest the interest that had consequences so important so 'eart breaking so fatales he had demanded of her most naturally her history and this she related to him in a style dramatic myself i have not the style dramatic though i avow to you i admire that we are in a provincial town she said to the young man we are in rouen the workroom of a modiste have no embarrassment monsieur tricotrin you at least are invisible to the girls who sew they sew all day and talk little already they are tristes resigned among them sits one who is different one passionate ambitious a girl who burns to be divette singer who is devoured by longings for applause fashion wealth she has made the acquaintance of a little pastrycook he has become fascinated they are affianced in a month she will be married the young man tricotrin well understood that the girl she described was herself what does she consider while she sits sewing she continued that the pastrycook loves her that he is generous that she will do her most to be to him a good wife not at all far from that she considers on the contrary that she was a fool to promise him she considers how she shall escape from him from rouen from her ennui she seeks to fly to paris alas she has no money not a franc and she sews always she sews in the dull room and her spirit rebels good said the poet it is a capital first instalment the time goes on there remains only a week to the marriage morning the little home is prepared the little pastrycook is full of joy alors one evening they go out for her the sole attraction in the town is the hall of varieties yes it is third class it is not great things however it is the only one in rouen he purchases two tickets what a misfortune it is the last temptation to her they stroll back she takes his arm under the moon under the stars but she sees only the lamps of paris she sees only that he can say nothing she cares to hear ah unhappy man murmured the poet they sit at a cafe table and he talks the fiance of the bliss that is to come to them she attends to not a word not a syllable while she smiles she questions herself frenzied how she can escape she has commanded a sirop as she lifts her glass to the syphon her gaze falls on the ring she wears the ring of their betrothal 'to the future cher ange' says the fiance 'to the future vieux cheri' she says and she laughs in her heart for she resolves to sell the ring tricotrin had become absolutely enthralled she obtained for the ring forty five francs the next day and for the little pastrycook all is finished she wrote him a letter 'good bye' he has lost his reason mad with despair he has flung himself before an electric car and is killed it is strange she added to the poet who regarded her with consternation that i did not think sooner of the ring that was always on my finger n'est ce pas it may be that never before had i felt so furious an impulse to desert him it may be also that there was no ring and no pastrycook and she broke into peals of laughter ah mon dieu exclaimed the young man but you are enchanting let us go to breakfast you are the kindred soul i have looked for all my life by the bye i may as well know your name then monsieur this poor girl who had trembled before her laundress she told him a name which was going in a while to crowd the ambassadeurs and be famous through all paris a name which was to mean caprices folly extravagance the most wilful and reckless she answered and it said nothing yet my name is paulette fleury the piano organ stopped short as if it knew the frenchman had reached a crisis in his narrative he folded his arms and nodded impressively voila monsieur i 'ave introduced you to paulette fleury it was her beginning he offered me a cigarette and frowned lost in thought at the lady who was chopping bread behind the counter listen he resumed they have breakfasted they have fed the sparrows around their chairs and they have strolled under the green trees in the sunshine she was singing then at a little cafe concert the most obscure it is arranged before they part that in the evening he shall go to applaud her he had a friend young also a composer named nicolas pitou i cannot express to you the devotion that existed between them pitou was employed at a publisher's but the publisher paid him not much better than his art the comrades have shared everything the loans from the mont de piete the attic and the dreams in montmartre it was said tricotrin and pitou as one says orestes and pylades it is beautiful such affection hein listen tricotrin has recounted to his friend his meeting with paulette and when the hour for the concert is arrived pitou accompanied him the musician however was perhaps the more sedate he has gone with little expectation his interest was not high what a surprise he has had he has found her an actress an artist to the ends of the fingers tricotrin was astonished also the two friends the poet and the composer said mon dieu they regarded the one the other they said mon dieu again soon pitou has requested of tricotrin an introduction it is agreed tricotrin has presented his friend and invited the chanteuse to drink a bock a glass of beer a propos you take a liqueur monsieur yes what liqueur you take sst garcon well you conjecture no doubt what i shall say before the bock was finished they were in love with her both at the door of her lodging paulette has given to each a pressure of the hand and said gently till to morrow i worship her tricotrin told pitou i have found my ideal pitou answered tricotrin it is superb such friendship hein in the mind of the poet who had accomplished tragedies majestic in the mind of the composer the most classical in montmartre there had been born a new ambition it was to write a comic song for paulette fleury it appears to you droll perhaps monsieur to her lover the humblest divette is more than patti in all the world there can be no joy so thrilling as to hear the music of one's brain sung by the woman one adores unless it be to hear the woman one adores give forth one's verse i believe it has been accepted as a fact this nevertheless it is true yes already the idea had come to them and paulette was well pleased when they told her of it oh she knew they loved her both and with both she coquetted but with their intention she did not coquet as to that she was in earnest every day they discussed it with enthusiasm they were to write a song that should make for her a furore what happened i shall tell you monday when tricotrin was to depart for lyons he informed his uncle that he will not go no less than that his uncle was furious i do not blame him but naturally tricotrin has argued if i am to create for paulette her great chance i must remain in paris to study paulette i cannot create in an atmosphere of commerce i require the montmartrois the boulevards the inspiration of her presence isn't it and pitou whose very soul had been enraptured in his leisure by a fugue he was composing pitou would have no more of it he allowed the fugue to grow dusty while day and night he thought always of refrains that ran zim la zim la zim boum boum constantly they conferred the comrades they told the one the other how they loved her and then they beat their heads and besought of providence a fine idea for the comic song it was their thought supreme the silk manufacturer has washed his 'ands of tricotrin but he has not cared there remained to him still one of the bank notes as for pitou who neglected everything except to find his melody for paulette the publisher has given him the sack their acquaintances ridiculed the sacrifices made for her but monsieur when a man loves truly to make a sacrifice for the woman is to make a present to himself nevertheless i avow to you that they fretted because of her coquetry one hour it seemed that pitou had gained her heart the next her encouragement has been all to tricotrin sometimes they have said to her paulette it is true we are as orestes and pylades but there can be only one king of eden at the time is it orestes or pylades that you mean to crown then she would laugh and reply how can i say i like you both so much i can never make up my mind which to like best it was not satisfactory and always she added in the meantime where is the song ah the song that song how they have sought it on the butte and in the bois and round the halles often they have tramped paris till daybreak meditating the great chance for paulette and at last the poet has discovered it for each verse a different phase of life but through it all the pursuit of gaiety the fever of the dance the gaiety of youth the gaiety of dotage the gaiety of despair it should be the song of the pleasure seekers the voices of paris when the lamps are lit monsieur if we sat 'ere in the restaurant until it closed i could not describe to you how passionately tricotrin the devoted tricotrin worked for her he has studied her without cease he has studied her attitudes her expressions he has taken his lyric as if it were material and cut it to her figure he has taken it as if it were plaster and moulded it upon her mannerisms there was not a moue that she made not a pretty trick that she had not a word that she liked to sing for which he did not provide an opportunity at the last line when the pen fell from his fingers he shouted to pitou comrade be brave i have won her and pitou monsieur if we sat 'ere till they prepared the tables for dejeuner to morrow i could not describe to you how passionately pitou the devoted pitou worked that she might have a grand popularity by his music at dawn when he has found that strepitoso passage which is the hurrying of the feet he wakened the poet and cried mon ami i pity you she is mine it was the souls of two men when it was finished that comic song they made for her it was the song the organ has ground out partant pour le moulin and then they rehearsed it the three of them over and over inventing always new effects and then the night for the song is arrived it has rained all day and they have walked together in the rain the singer and the men who loved her both to the little cafe concert where she would appear they tremble in the room among the crowd pitou and tricotrin they are agitated there are others who sing it says nothing to them in the room in the future there is only paulette it is very hot in the cafe concert and there is too much noise at last they ask her is she nervous she shakes her head mais non she smiles to them attend it is her turn ouf but it is hot in the cafe concert and there is too much noise she mounts the platform the audience are careless it continues the jingle of the glasses the hum of talk she begins beneath the table tricotrin has gripped the hand of pitou wait regard the crowd that look at her the glasses are silent now hein the talk has stopped to a great actress is come her chance there is not too much noise in the cafe concert but when she finished what an uproar never will she forget it a thousand times she has told the story how it was written the song and how it made her famous before two weeks she was the attraction of the ambassadeurs and all paris has raved of paulette fleury tricotrin and pitou were mad with joy certainly paris did not rave of pitou nor tricotrin there have not been many that remembered who wrote the song and it earned no money for them either because it was hers the gift of their love still they were enraptured to both of them she owed equally and more than ever it was a question which would be the happy man listen when they are gone to call on her one afternoon she was not at 'ome what had happened i shall tell you there was a noodle rich what you call a johnnie in the stalls who became infatuated with her at the ambassadeurs he whistled partant pour le moulin all the days and went to hear it all the nights well she was not at 'ome because she had married him absolutely they were married her lovers have been told it at the door what a moment figure yourself what they have suffered both they had worshipped her they had made sacrifices for her they had created for her her grand success and as a consequence of that song she was the wife of the johnnie in the stalls far down the street but yet distinct the organ revived the tune again my frenchman shuddered and got up i cannot support it he murmured you understand the associations are too pathetic they must be harrowing i said before you go there is one thing i should like to ask you if i may have i had the honour of meeting monsieur tricotrin or monsieur pitou he stroked his hat and gazed at me in sad surprise ah but neither monsieur he groaned the associations are much more 'arrowing than that i was the 'johnnie in the stalls' tricotrin entertains one night when pitou went home an unaccustomed perfume floated to meet him on the stairs he climbed them in amazement if we lived in an age of miracles i should conclude that tricotrin was smoking a cigar he said to himself what can it be the pair occupied a garret in the rue des trois freres at this time where their window in sore need of repairs commanded an unrivalled view of the dirty steps descending to the passage des abbesses to night behold tricotrin pacing the garret with dignity between his lips an havannah that could have cost no less than a franc the composer rubbed his eyes have they made you an academician he stammered or has your uncle the silk manufacturer died and left you his business my friend replied the poet prepare yourself forthwith for 'a new and powerful serial of the most absorbing interest' i am no longer the young man who went out this evening i am a celebrity i thought said the composer that it couldn't be you when i saw the cigar figure yourself continued tricotrin that at nine o'clock i was wandering on the grand boulevard with a thirst that could have consumed a brewery i might mention that i had also empty pockets but it would be to pad the powerful serial shamelessly said pitou there are things that one takes for granted at the corner of the place de l'opera a fellow passed me whom i knew and yet did not know i could not recall where it was we had met i turned and followed him racking my brains the while suddenly i remembered pardon me interrupted the composer but i have read bel ami myself oh it is quite evident that you are a celebrity you have already forgotten how to be original there is a resemblance it is true admitted tricotrin however maupassant had no copyright in the place de l'opera i say that i remembered the man i had known him when he was in the advertisement business in lyons well we have supped together he is in a position to do me a service he will ask an editor to publish an interview with me an interview exclaimed pitou you are to be interviewed ah no my poor friend too much meat has unhinged your reason go to sleep you will be hungry and sane again to morrow it will startle some of them hein 'gustave tricotrin at home' in the illustrated edition of le demi mot illustrated gasped pitou he looked round the attic did i understand you to say 'illustrated' well well said tricotrin we shall move the beds and when the concierge nods perhaps we can borrow the palm from the portals with a palm and an amiable photographer an air of splendour is easily arrived at i should like a screen we will raise one from a studio in the rue ravignan mon dieu with a palm and a screen i foresee the most opulent effects 'a corner of the study' we can put the screen in front of the washhand stand and litter the table with manuscripts you will admit that we have a sufficiency of manuscripts no one will know that they have all been rejected also a painter in the rue ravignan might lend us a few of his failures 'before you go let me show you my pictures' said monsieur tricotrin 'i am an ardent collector' in montmartre the sight of two types shifting household gods makes no sensation the sails of the remaining windmills still revolve on the day that it had its likeness taken the attic was temporarily transformed at least a score of unappreciated masterpieces concealed the dilapidation of the walls the broken window was decorated with an eastern fabric that had been a cherished property of half the ateliers in paris the poet himself with the palm drooping gracefully above his head mused in a massive chair in which solomon had been pronouncing judgment until when the poet had called for it the appearance of exhaustion observed by admirers of the poet's portrait was due to the chair's appalling weight as he staggered under it up the steps of the passage des abbesses the young man had feared he would expire on the threshold of his fame however the photographer proved as resourceful as could be desired and perhaps the most striking feature of the illustration was the spaciousness of the apartment in which monsieur tricotrin was presented to readers of le demi mot the name of the thoroughfare was not obtruded with what pride was that issue of the journal regarded in the rue des trois freres aha cried tricotrin who in moments persuaded himself that he really occupied such noble quarters those who repudiated me in the days of my struggles will be a little repentant now hein stone heart will discover that i was not wrong in relying on my genius i assume said pitou that 'stone heart' is your newest pet name for the silk manufacturing uncle you catch my meaning precisely i propose to send a copy of the paper to lyons with the interview artistically bordered by laurels i cannot draw laurels myself but there are plenty of persons who can we will find someone to do it when we palter with starvation at the cafe du bel avenir this evening or perhaps we had better fast at the lucullus junior instead there is occasionally some ink in the bottle there i shall put the address in the margin my uncle will not know where it is and on the grounds of euphony i have no fault to find with it it would not surprise me if i received an affectionate letter and a bank note in reply the perversity of human nature delights in generosities to the prosperous it is a fact said pitou that human nature who knows he may even renew the allowance that he used to make me upon my word more unlikely things have happened pitou conceded mon dieu nicolas we shall again have enough to eat ah visionary exclaimed pitou are there no bounds to your imagination now the perversity to which the poet referred did inspire monsieur rigaud of lyons to loosen his purse strings he wrote that he rejoiced to learn that gustave was beginning to make his way and enclosed a present of two hundred and fifty francs more after an avuncular preamble which the poet skipped having a literary hatred of digression in the works of others he even hinted that the allowance might be resumed what a banquet there was in bohemia how the glasses jingled afterwards in la lune rousse and oh the beautiful hats that germaine and marcelle displayed on the next fine sunday even when the last ripples of the splash were stilled the comrades swaggered gallantly on the boulevard rochechouart for by any post might not the first instalment of that allowance arrive weeks passed and tricotrin began to say it looks to me as if we needed another interview and then came a letter which was no less cordial than its predecessor but which stunned the unfortunate recipient like a warrant for his execution monsieur rigaud stated that business would bring him to paris on the following evening and that he anticipated the pleasure of visiting his nephew he trusted that his dear gustave would meet him at the station the poet and composer stared at each other with bloodless faces you must call at his hotel instead faltered pitou at last but you may be sure he will wish to see my elegant abode 'it is in the hands of the decorators how unfortunate' he would propose to offer them suggestions he is a born suggester 'fever is raging in the house a most infectious fever' we will ask a medical student to give us one it would not explain my lodging in a slum meanwhile well let us admit that there is nothing to be done you will have to own up are you insane it is improvident youths like you who come to lament their wasted lives if i could receive him this once as he expects to be received we cannot doubt that it would mean an income of two thousand francs to me prosperity dangles before us shall i fail to clutch it mon dieu what a catastrophe his coming to paris why cannot he conduct his business in lyons is there not enough money in the city of lyons to satisfy him o grasper what greed nicolas my more than brother if it were night when i took him to a sumptuous apartment he might not notice the name of the street i could talk brilliantly as we turned the corner also i could scintillate as i led him away he would never know that it was not the rue des trois freres you are right agreed pitou but which is the pauper in our social circle whose sumptuous apartment you propose to acquire one must consider said tricotrin obviously i am compelled to entertain in somebody's fortunately i have two days to find it in i shall now go forth it was a genial morning and the first person he accosted in the rue ravignan was goujaud painting in the patch of garden before the studios tell me goujaud exclaimed the poet have you any gilded acquaintance who would permit me the use of his apartment for two hours to morrow evening goujaud reflected for some seconds with his head to one side i have never done anything so fine as this before he observed regard the atmosphere of it it is execrable replied tricotrin and went next door to flamant my old one he explained i have urgent need of a regal apartment for two hours to morrow have you a wealthy friend who would accommodate me you may beautify your bedroom with all my possessions returned flamant heartily i have a stuffed parrot that is most decorative but i have not a friend that is wealthy you express yourself like a first course for the foreigner said tricotrin much annoyed devil take your stuffed parrot the heat of the sun increased towards midday and drops began to trickle under the young man's hat by four o'clock he had called upon sixty two persons exclusive of sanquereau whom he had been unable to wake he bethought himself of lajeunie the novelist but lajeunie could offer him nothing more serviceable than a pass for the elysee montmartre now how is it possible that i spend my life among such imbeciles groaned the unhappy poet one offers me a parrot and another a pass for a dancing hall can i assure my uncle who is a married man and produces silk in vast quantities that i reside in a dancing hall besides we know those passes they are available only for ladies it is true that you could not get in by it assented lajeunie but i give it to you freely take it my poor fellow though it may appear inadequate to the occasion who knows but what it will prove to be the basis of a fortune you are as crazy as the stories you write said tricotrin still it can go in my pocket and he made exhausted for a bench in the place dancourt where he apostrophised his fate thus occupied he fell asleep and presently a young woman sauntered from the sidewalk across the square in the shady little place dancourt is the little white theatre montmartre and she first perused the play bill and then contemplated the sleeping poet it may have been that she found something attractive in his bearing or it may have been that ragamuffins sprawled elsewhere but having determined to wait awhile she selected the bench on which he reposed and forthwith woke him now this is nice he exclaimed realising his lapse with a start oh monsieur said she blushing pardon i referred to my having dozed when every moment is of consequence he explained and yet he went on ruefully upon my soul i cannot conjecture where i shall go next her response was so sympathetic that it tempted him to remain a little longer and in five minutes she was recounting her own perplexities it transpired that she was a lady's maid with a holiday and the problem before her was whether to spend her money on a theatre or on a ball now that is a question which is disposed of instantly said tricotrin you shall spend your money on a theatre and go to a ball as well and out fluttered the pink pass presented to him by lajeunie the girl's tongue was as lively as her gratitude she was she told him maid to the famous colette aubray who had gone unattended that afternoon to visit the owner of a villa in the country where she would stay until the next day but one so you see monsieur we poor servants are left alone in the flat to amuse ourselves as best we can mon dieu ejaculated tricotrin and added mentally it was decidedly the good kind fairies that pointed to this bench he proceeded to pay the young woman such ardent attentions that she assumed he meant to accompany her to the ball and her disappointment was extreme when he had to own that the state of his finances forbade it all i can suggest my dear leonie he concluded is that i shall be your escort when you leave it is abominable that you must have other partners in the meantime but i feel that you will be constant to me in your thoughts i shall have much to tell you i shall whisper a secret in your ear for incredible as it may sound my sweet child you alone in paris have the power to save me oh monsieur faltered the admiring lady's maid it has always been my great ambition to save a young man especially a young man who used such lovely language i am sure by the way you talk that you must be a poet extraordinary mused tricotrin that all the world recognises me as a poet excepting when it reads my poetry and this led him to reflect that he must sell some of it in order to provide refreshment for leonie before he begged her aid accordingly he arranged to meet her when the ball finished and limped back to the attic where he made up a choice assortment of his wares he had resolved to try the office of le demi mot but his reception there was cold you should not presume on our good nature demurred the editor only last month we had an article on you saying that you were highly talented and now you ask us to publish your work besides there must be a limit to such things he examined the collection nevertheless with a depreciatory countenance and offered ten francs for three of the finest specimens from le demi mot i would counsel you to accept low terms he said with engaging interest on account of the prestige you derive from appearing in it in truth it is a noble thing prestige admitted tricotrin but monsieur i have never known a man able to make a meal of it when he was starving or to warm himself before it when he was without a fire still though it is a jumble sale price let them go payment will be made in due course said the editor and became immersed in correspondence tricotrin paled to the lips and the next five minutes were terrible indeed he did not doubt that he would have to limp elsewhere at last he cried well let us say seven francs cash seven francs in one's fist are worth ten in due course and thus the bargain was concluded it was well for hercules that none of his labours was the extraction of payment from an editor panted the poet on the doorstep but he was now enabled to fete the lady's maid in grand style and not to be outdone in generosity she placed mademoiselle aubray's flat at his disposal directly he asked for it you have accomplished a miracle averred pitou in the small hours when he heard the news tricotrin waved a careless hand to a man of resource all things are possible he murmured the next evening the silk manufacturer was warmly embraced on the platform and not a little surprised to learn that his nephew expected a visit at once however the young man's consternation was so profound when objections were made that in the end they were withdrawn tricotrin directed the driver after monsieur rigaud was in the cab and on their reaching the courtyard there was leonie all frills ready to carry the handbag your servant inquired monsieur rigaud with some disapproval as they went upstairs she is rather fancifully dressed hein is it so answered tricotrin perhaps a bachelor is not sufficiently observant in these matters still she is an attentive domestic take off your things my dear uncle and make yourself at home what joy it gives me to see you here mon dieu exclaimed the silk manufacturer looking about him you have a place fit for a prince it must have cost a pretty penny between ourselves said tricotrin i often reproach myself for what i spent on it i could make very good use to day of some of the money i squandered what curtains murmured monsieur rigaud fingering the silk enraptured the quality is superb what may they have charged you for these curtains it was years ago upon my word i do not remember drawled tricotrin who had no idea whether he ought to say five hundred francs or five thousand also you must not think i have bought everything you see many of the pictures and bronzes are presents from admirers of my work it is gratifying hein i i to confess the truth we had not heard of your triumphs admitted monsieur rigaud i did not dream you were so successful ah it is in a very modest way tricotrin replied i am not a millionaire i assure you on the contrary it is often difficult to make both ends meet although he added hurriedly i live with the utmost economy my uncle the days of my thoughtlessness are past a man should save a man should provide for the future at this moment he was astonished to see leonie open the door and announce that dinner was served she had been even better than her word dinner cried monsieur rigaud ah now i understand why you were so dejected when i would not come bah it will be a very simple meal said his nephew but after a journey one must eat let us go in he was turning the wrong way but leonie's eye saved him come he proceeded taking his seat some soup some good soup what will you drink my uncle on the sideboard i see champagne chuckled monsieur rigaud you treat the old man well you rogue hah said tricotrin who had not observed it the cellar i own is an extravagance of mine alone i drink only mineral waters or a little claret much diluted but to my dearest friends i must give the dearest wines leonie champagne it was a capital dinner and the cigars and cigarettes that leonie put on the table with the coffee were of the highest excellence agreeable conversation whiled away some hours and tricotrin began to look for his uncle to get up but it was raining smartly and monsieur rigaud was reluctant to bestir himself another hour lagged by and at last tricotrin faltered i fear i must beg you to excuse me for leaving you my uncle it is most annoying but i am compelled to go out the fact is i have consented to collaborate with capus and he is so eccentric this dear alfred we shall be at work all night go my good gustave said his uncle readily and as i am very tired if you have no objection i will occupy your bed tricotrin's jaw dropped and it was by a supreme effort that he stammered how pleased the arrangement would make him to intensify the fix leonie and the cook had disappeared doubtless to the mansarde in which they slept and he was left to cope with the catastrophe alone however having switched on the lights he conducted the elderly gentleman to an enticing apartment he wished him an affectionate good night and after promising to wake him early made for home leaving the manufacturer sleepily surveying the room's imperial splendour what magnificence soliloquised monsieur rigaud what toilet articles he got into bed what a coverlet there must be twenty thousand francs on top of me he had not slumbered under them long when he was aroused by such a commotion that he feared for the action of his heart blinking in the glare he perceived leonie in scanty attire distracted on her knees and by the bedside a beautiful lady in a travelling cloak raging with the air of a lioness go away quavered the manufacturer what is the meaning of this intrusion intrusion raved the lady that is what you will explain monsieur how comes it that you are in my bed yours ejaculated monsieur rigaud what is it you say you are making a grave error for which you will apologise madame ah hold me back pleaded the lady throwing up her eyes hold me back or i shall assault him she flung to leonie wretched girl you shall pay for this not content with lavishing my champagne and my friend's cigars on your lover you must put him to recuperate in my room oh gasped the manufacturer and hid his head under the priceless coverlet such an imputation is unpardonable he roared reappearing i am monsieur rigaud of lyons the flat belongs to my nephew monsieur tricotrin i request you to retire imbecile screamed the lady the flat belongs to me colette aubray and your presence may ruin me i expect a visitor on most important business he has not my self control if he finds you here he will most certainly send you a challenge he is the best swordsman in paris i advise you to believe me for you have just five minutes to save your life monsieur wailed leonie you have been deceived and between her sobs she confessed the circumstances which he heard with the greatest difficulty owing to the chattering of his teeth the rain was descending in cataracts when monsieur rigaud got outside but though the trams and the trains had both stopped running and cabs were as dear as radium his fury was so tempestuous that nothing could deter him from reaching the poet's real abode his attack on the front door warned tricotrin and pitou what had happened and they raised themselves blanched from their pillows to receive his curses it was impossible to reason with him and he launched the most frightful denunciation at his nephew for an hour when the abatement of the downpour permitted him to depart more at noon who should arrive but leonie in tears she had been dismissed from her employment and came to beg the poet to intercede for her what calamities groaned tricotrin how fruitless are man's noblest endeavours without the favouring breeze i shall drown myself at eight o'clock however i will readily plead for you first if your mistress will receive me by the maid's advice he presented himself late in the day and when he had cooled his heels in the salon for some time a lady entered who was of such ravishing appearance that his head swam monsieur tricotrin she inquired haughtily i have heard your name from your uncle monsieur are you here to visit my servant mademoiselle he faltered i am here to throw myself on your mercy at eight o'clock i have decided to commit suicide for i am ruined the only hope left me is to win your pardon before i die i suppose your uncle has disowned you she said naturally it was a pretty situation to put him in how would you care to be in it yourself alas mademoiselle sighed tricotrin there are situations to which a poor poet may not aspire after regarding him silently she exclaimed i cannot understand what a boy with eyes like yours saw in leonie merely good nature and a means to an end believe me if you would ease my last moments reinstate her in your service do not let me drown with the knowledge that another is suffering for my fault mademoiselle i entreat you take her back and why should i ease your last moments she demurred because i have no right to ask it because i have no defence for my sin towards you because you would be justified in trampling on me and to pardon would be sublime you are very eloquent for my maid returned the lady he shook his head ah no i fear i am pleading for myself for if you reinstate the girl it will prove that you forgive the man and i want your forgiveness so much he fell at her feet does your engagement for eight o'clock press monsieur murmured the lady smiling if you could dine here again to night i might relent by degrees and she is adorable he told pitou i passed the most delicious evening of my life it is fortunate observed pitou for that and your uncle's undying enmity are all you have obtained by your imposture remember that the evening cost two thousand francs a year ah misanthrope cried tricotrin radiantly there must be a crumpled roseleaf in every eden the fatal florozonde before pitou the composer left for the hague he called on theophile de fronsac the poet la voix parisienne had lately appointed de fronsac to its staff on condition that he contributed no poetry good evening said de fronsac mon dieu what shall i write about write about my music said pitou whose compositions had been rejected in every arrondissement of paris let us talk sanely demurred de fronsac my causerie is half a column short tell me something interesting woman replied pitou de fronsac flicked his cigarette ash you remind me he said how much i need a love affair my sensibilities should be stimulated to continue to write with fervour i require to adore again it is very easy to adore observed pitou not at forty lamented the other especially to a man in class a don't forget my young friend that i have loved and been loved persistently for twenty three years i cannot adore a repetition and it is impossible for me to discover a new type all of which i understand said pitou excepting 'class a' there are three kinds of men explained the poet class a are the men to whom women inevitably surrender class b consists of those whom they trust by instinct and confide in on the second day these men acquire an extensive knowledge of the sex but they always fall short of winning the women for themselves class c women think of merely as 'the others' they do not count eventually they marry and try to persuade their wives that they were devils of fellows when they were young however such reflections will not assist me to finish my causerie for i wrote them all last week talking of women remarked pitou a little blonde has come to live opposite our lodging so far we have only bowed from our windows but i have christened her 'lynette' and tricotrin has made a poem about her it is pathetic the last verse the others are not written yet goes 'o window i watched in the days that are dead are you watched by a lover to day are glimpses caught now of another blonde head by a youth who lives over the way does she repeat words that lynette's lips have said and does he say what i used to say' what is the answer asked de fronsac is it a conundrum in any case it is a poor substitute for a half a column of prose in la voix how on earth am i to arrive at the bottom of the page if i am short in my copy i shall be short in my rent if i am short in my rent i shall be put out of doors if i am put out of doors i shall die of exposure and much good it will do me that they erect a statue to me in the next generation upon my word i would stand a dinner at the two franc place where you may eat all you can hold if you could give me a subject it happens said pitou that i can give you a very strange one as i am going to a foreign land i have been to the country to bid farewell to my parents i came across an extraordinary girl one who disliked presents inquired de fronsac i am not jesting she is a dancer in a travelling circus the flare and the drum wooed me one night and i went in as a circus well you may imagine a tent in a fair my fauteuil was a plank and the orchestra surpassed the worst tortures of the inquisition and then after the decrepit horses and a mangy lion a girl came into the ring with the most marvellous eyes i have ever seen in a human face they are green eyes with golden lights in them really murmured the poet i have never been loved by a girl who had green eyes with golden lights in them i am glad you have never been loved by this one returned the composer gravely she has a curious history all her lovers without exception have committed suicide what said de fronsac staring it is very queer one of them had just inherited a hundred thousand francs he hanged himself another an author from italy took poison while all rome was reading his novel to be infatuated by her is harmless enough but to win her is invariably fatal within a few weeks some time ago she attached herself to one of the troupe and soon afterwards he discovered she was deceiving him he resolved to shoot her he pointed a pistol at her breast she simply laughed and looked at him he turned the pistol on himself and blew his brains out de fronsac had already written here is the extraordinary history of a girl whom i discovered in a fair the next moment but you repeat a rumour he objected la voix parisienne has a reputation odd as the fact may appear to you people read it if this is published in la voix it will attract attention soon she will be promoted from a tent in a fair to a stage in paris well what happens you tell me she is beautiful so she will have hundreds of admirers among the hundreds there will be one she favours and then unless he committed suicide in a few weeks the paper would be proved a liar i should not be able to sleep of nights for fear he would not kill himself my dear exclaimed pitou with emotion would i add to your anxieties rather than you should be disturbed by anybody's living let us dismiss the subject and the dinner and talk of my new symphony on the other hand i fail to see that the paper's reputation is your affair it is not your wife and i am more than usually empty to day your argument is sound said de fronsac besides the editor refuses my poetry and he wrote without cessation for ten minutes the two franc table d'hote excelled itself that evening and pitou did ample justice to the menu behold how capricious is the jade fame the poet whose verses had left him obscure accomplished in ten minutes a paragraph that fascinated all paris on the morrow people pointed it out to one another the morning after other journals referred to it in the afternoon the editor of la voix parisienne was importuned with questions no one believed the story to be true but not a soul could help wondering if it might be so when a day or two had passed pitou received from de fronsac a note which ran send to me at once i entreat thee the name of that girl and say where she can be found the managers of three variety theatres of the first class have sought me out and are eager to engage her decidedly said pitou i have mistaken my vocation i ought to have been a novelist and he replied the girl whose eyes suggested the story to me is called on the programmes 'florozonde' for the rest i know nothing except that thou didst offer a dinner and i was hungry however when he had written this he destroyed it though i am unappreciated myself and shall probably conclude in the morgue he mused that is no excuse for my withholding prosperity from others doubtless the poor girl would rejoice to appear at three variety theatres of the first class or even at one of them he answered simply her name is 'florozonde' she will be found in a circus at chartres and nearly suffocated with laughter then a little later the papers announced that mlle florozonde whose love by a strange series of coincidences had always proved fatal would be seen at la coupole posters bearing the name of florozonde yellow on black invaded the boulevards her portrait caused crowds to assemble and that girl who they say deals death that florozonde was to be heard as constantly as ragtime by now pitou was at the hague his necessities having driven him into the employment of a parisian who had opened a shop there for the sale of music and french pianos when he read the paris papers pitou trembled so violently that the onlookers thought he must have ague hilarity struggled with envy in his breast ma foi he would say to himself it seems that my destiny is to create successes for others here am i exiled and condemned to play cadenzas all day in a piano warehouse while she whom i invented dances jubilant in paris i do not doubt that she breakfasts at armenonville and dines at paillard's and it was a fact that florozonde was the fashion as regards her eyes at any rate the young man had not exaggerated more than was to be forgiven in an artist her eyes were superb supernatural and now that the spangled finery of a fair was replaced by the most triumphant of audacities now that a circus band had been exchanged for the orchestra of la coupole she danced as she had not danced before you say that a gorgeous costume cannot improve a woman's dancing let a woman realise that you improve her appearance and you improve everything that she can do nevertheless one does not pretend that it was owing to her talent or her costume or the weird melody proposed by the chef d'orchestre that she became the rage not at all that was due to her reputation sceptics might smile and murmur the french for rats but again nobody could say positively that the tragedies had not occurred and above all there were the eyes it was conceded that a woman with eyes like that ought to be abnormal la coupole was thronged every night and the stage doorkeeper grew rich so numerous were the daring spirits coquetting with death who tendered notes inviting the fatal one to supper somehow the suppers were rather dreary the cause may have been that the guest was handicapped by circumstances to be good company without discarding the fatal air was extremely difficult also the cause may have been that the daring spirits felt their courage forsake them in a tete a tete but it is certain that once when florozonde drove home in the small hours to the tattered aunt who lived on her she exclaimed violently that all this silly fake was giving her the hump and that she wished she were 'on the road' again with a jolly good fellow who was not afraid of her then the tattered aunt cooed to her reminding her that little ducklings had run to her already roasted and adding that she the tattered aunt had never heard of equal luck in all the years she had been in the show business ah zut cried florozonde it does not please me to be treated as if i had scarlet fever if i lean towards a man he turns pale life is good said her aunt philosophically and men have no wish to die for the sake of an embrace remember your reputation ii faut souffrir pour etre fatale look at your salary sweetie and you have had nothing to do but hold your tongue ah was anything ever heard like it a miracle of le bon dieu it was monsieur de fronsac the journalist who started it said florozonde i supposed he had made it up to give me a lift but ma foi i think he half believes it too what can have put it in his head i have a mind to ask him the next time he comes behind what a madness exclaimed the old woman you might queer your pitch never never perform a trick with a confederate when you can work alone that is one of the first rules of life if he thinks it is true so much the better now get to bed lovey and think of pleasant things what did you have for supper florozonde was correct in her surmise de fronsac did half believe it and de fronsac was accordingly much perturbed consider his dilemma the nature of his pursuits had demanded a love affair and he had endeavoured conscientiously to comply for the man was nothing if not an artist but as he had said to pitou he had loved so much and so many that the thing was practically impossible for him he was like the pastrycook's boy who is habituated and bilious then suddenly a new type which he had despaired of finding was displayed his curiosity awoke and fascinated in the first instance by her ghastly reputation he was fascinated gradually by her physical charms again he found himself enslaved by a woman and the woman who owed her fame to his services was clearly appreciative but he had a strong objection to committing suicide his eagerness for her love was only equalled by his dread of what might happen if she gave it to him alternately he yearned and shuddered on monday he cried idiot to be frightened by such blague and on tuesday he told himself all the same there may be something in it it was thus tortured that he paid his respects to florozonde at the theatre on the evening after she complained to her aunt she was in her dressing room making ready to go you have danced divinely he said to her there is no longer a programme at la coupole there is only 'florozonde' she smiled the mysterious smile that she was cultivating what have you been doing with yourself monsieur i have not seen you all the week de fronsac sighed expressively at my age one has the wisdom to avoid temptation may it not be rather unkind to temptation she suggested raising her marvellous eyes de fronsac drew a step back also i have had a great deal to do he added formally i am a busy man for example much as i should like to converse with you now but his resolution forsook him and he was unable to say that he had looked in only for a minute much as you would like to converse with me questioned florozonde i ought by rights to be seated at my desk he concluded lamely i am pleased that you are not seated at your desk she said because murmured de fronsac with unspeakable emotions because i have never thanked you enough for your interest in me and i want to tell you that i remember she gave him her hand he held it battling with terror mademoiselle he returned tremulously when i wrote the causerie you refer to my interest in you was purely the interest of a journalist so for that i do not deserve your thanks but since i have had the honour to meet you i have experienced an interest altogether different the interest of a man of a a here his teeth chattered and he paused of a what she asked softly with a dreamy air of a friend he muttered a gust of fear had made the friend an iceberg but her clasp tightened i am glad she said ah you have been good to me monsieur and if in spite of everything i am sometimes sad i am at least never ungrateful you are sad faltered the vacillating victim why her bosom rose is success all a woman wants ah exclaimed de fronsac in an impassioned quaver is that not life to all of us there is the unattainable to you to me to you she murmured her eyes were transcendental admiration and alarm tore him in halves in truth he gasped i am the most miserable of men what is genius what is fame when one is lonely and unloved she moved impetuously closer so close that the perfume of her hair intoxicated him his heart seemed to knock against his ribs and he felt the perspiration burst out on his brow for an instant he hesitated on the edge of his grave he thought then he dropped her hand and backed from her but why should i bore you with my griefs he stammered au revoir mademoiselle outside the stage door he gave thanks for his self control also pale with the crisis he registered an oath not to approach her again meanwhile the expatriated pitou had remained disconsolate though the people at the hague spoke french they said foreign things to him in it he missed montmartre the interests of home while he waxed eloquent to customers on the tone of pianos or the excellence of rival composers' melodies he was envying florozonde in paris florozonde whom he had created obsessed the young man in the evening he read about her at van der pyl's on sundays when the train carried him to drink beer at scheveningen he read about her in the kurhaus and then the unexpected happened in this way pitou was discharged few things could have surprised him more and to tell the truth few things could have troubled him less it is better to starve in paris than grow fat in holland he observed he jingled his capital in his trouser pocket in fancy savoured his dinner cooking at the cafe du bel avenir and sped from the piano shop as if it had been on fire the clock pointed to a quarter to six as nicolas pitou composer emerged from the gare du nord and lightly swinging the valise that contained his wardrobe proceeded to the rue des trois freres never had it looked dirtier or sweeter he threw himself on tricotrin's neck embraced the concierge which took her breath away since she was ill favoured and most disagreeable fared sumptuously for one franc fifty at the cafe du bel avenir where he narrated adventures abroad that surpassed de rougemont's and went to la coupole and there jostled by the crowd the poor fellow looked across the theatre at the triumphant woman he had invented and fell in love with her one would have said there was more than the width of a theatre between them one would have said the distance was interminable who in the audience could suspect that florozonde would have been unknown but for a boy in the promenoir yes he fell in love with her beauty her grace perhaps also with the circumstances the theatre rang with plaudits the curtain hid her and he went out dizzy with romance he could not hope to speak to her to night but he was curious to see her when she left he decided that on the morrow he would call upon de fronsac whom she doubtless knew now and ask him for an introduction promising himself this he reached the stage door where de fronsac with trembling limbs stood giving thanks for his self control my friend cried pitou enthusiastically how rejoiced i am to meet you and nearly wrung his hand off aie gently expostulated de fronsac writhing aie aie i did not know you loved me so much so you are back from sweden hein yes i have not been there but why should we argue about geography what were you doing as i came up reciting your poems by the way i have a favour to ask i want you to introduce me to florozonde never answered the poet firmly i have too much affection for you i have just resolved not to see her again myself besides i thought you knew her in the circus i never spoke to her there i simply admired her from the plank come take me inside and present me it is impossible persisted de fronsac i tell you i will not venture near her any more also she is coming out that is her coupe that you see waiting she came out as he spoke and affecting not to recognise him moved rapidly towards the carriage but this would not do for pitou at all mademoiselle he exclaimed sweeping his hat nearly to the pavement yes well she said sharply turning i have just begged my friend de fronsac to present me to you and he feared you might not pardon his presumption may i implore you to pardon mine she smiled there was the instant in which neither the man nor the woman knows who will speak next nor what is to be said the instant on which destinies hang pitou seized it mademoiselle i returned to france only this evening all the journey my thought was to see you as soon as i arrived your friend she said with a scornful glance towards de fronsac who sauntered gracefully away would warn you that you are rash i am not afraid of his warning are you not afraid of me afraid only that you will banish me too soon mon dieu then you must be the bravest man in paris she said at any rate i am the luckiest for the moment it was a delightful change to florozonde to meet a man who was not alarmed by her and it pleased her to show de fronsac that his cowardice had not left her inconsolable she laughed loud enough for him to hear i ought not to be affording you the luck she answered i have friends waiting for me at the cafe de paris i expected some such blow said pitou and how can i suppose you will disappoint your friends in order to sup with me at the cafe du bel avenir instead the cafe du she was puzzled bel avenir i do not know it nor would your coachman we should walk there and our supper would cost three francs wine included is it an invitation it is a prayer who are you my name is nicolas pitou of paris of bohemia what do you do in it hunger and make music unsuccessful not to night take me to the bel avenir she said and sent the carriage away de fronsac looking back as they departed was distressed to see the young man risking his life at the bel avenir their entrance made a sensation she removed her cloak and pitou arranged it over two chairs then she threw her gloves out of the way in the bread basket and the waiter and the proprietress and all the family did homage to her toilette who would have supposed she smiled and her smile forgot to be mysterious that the restaurant would be so proud that i should be supping with you in it tell me you had no hope of this on your journey it was true about your journey hein ah really no how could i hope i went round after your dance simply to see you closer and then i met de fronsac and then and then you were very cheeky answer why do i interest you because of what they say of me not altogether what else because you are so beautiful answer why did you come to supper with me to annoy some other fellow not altogether what else because you were not frightened of me are you sure you are not frightened oh remember remember your horrible fate if i should like you too much it would be a thumping advertisement for you said pitou let me urge you to try to secure it reckless boy she laughed pour out some more wine ah it is good this it is like old times the strings of onions on the dear dirty walls and the serviettes that are so nice and damp it was in restaurants like this if my salary was paid i used to sup on fete days and if it was not paid i supped in imagination my dear i have had a cigarette for a supper and the grass for a bed i have tramped by the caravan while the stars faded and breakfasted on the drum in the tent and you on a bench in the champs elysees hein it has occurred and you watched the sun rise and made music and wished you could rise too i must hear your music some day you shall write me a dance is it agreed the contract is already stamped said pitou i am glad i met you it is the best supper i have had in paris why are you calculating the expenses on the back of the bill of fare i am not i am composing your dance said pitou don't speak for a minute it will be sublime also it will be a souvenir when you have gone but she did not go for a long while it was late when they left the cafe du bel avenir still talking and there was always more to say by this time pitou did not merely love her beauty he adored the woman as for florozonde she no longer merely loved his courage she approved the man listen he was young fervid and an artist his proposal was made before they reached her doorstep and she consented their attachment was the talk of the town and everybody waited to hear that pitou had killed himself his name was widely known at last but weeks and months went by florozonde's protracted season came to an end and still he looked radiantly well pitou was the most unpopular man in paris in the rue dauphine one day he met de fronsac so you are still alive snarled the poet never better declared pitou it turns out he added confidentially there was nothing in that story it was all fudge evidently i must congratulate you said de fronsac looking bomb shells the opportunity of petitpas in bordeaux on the st of december monsieur petitpas a clerk with bohemian yearnings packed his portmanteau for a week's holiday in paris on the same date monsieur tricotrin poet and pauper was commissioned by the editor of le demi mot to convert a rough translation into literary french these two disparate incidents were destined by fate always mysterious in her workings to be united in a narrative for the present volume three evenings later the poet's concierge climbed the stairs and rapped peremptorily at the door well cried tricotrin raising bloodshot eyes from the manuscript who disturbs me now come in i have come in panted madame dubois who had not waited for his invitation and i am here to tell you monsieur that you cannot be allowed to groan in this agonised fashion your lamentations can be heard even in the basement is it in my agreement madame that i shall not groan if i am so disposed inquired the poet haughtily there are things tacitly understood it is enough that you are in arrears with your rent without your doing your best to drive away the other tenants for two days they have all complained that it would be less disturbing to reside in a hospital well they have my permission to remove there said tricotrin now that the matter is settled let me get on with my work and with the groan of a soul in hades he perused another line there you go again expostulated the woman angrily it is not to be endured monsieur what is the matter with you for goodness' sake with me madame there is nothing the matter the fault lies with an infernal spanish novel a misguided editor has commissioned me to rewrite it from a translation made by a foreigner how can i avoid groans when i read his rot miranda exclaims 'may heaven confound you bandit' and the fiance of the ingenue addresses her as 'angel of this house' well at least groan quietly begged the concierge do not bellow your sufferings to the cellar to oblige you i will be as spartan as i can agreed tricotrin now i have lost my place in the masterpiece ah here we are 'i feel she brings bad tidings she wears a disastrous mien' it is sprightly dialogue if the hundred and fifty francs were not essential to keep a roof over my head i would send the editor a challenge for offering me the job perspiration bespangled the young man's brow as he continued his task when another hour had worn by he thirsted to do the foreign translator a bodily injury and so intense was his exasperation that by way of interlude he placed the manuscript on the floor and jumped on it but the climax was reached in chapter xxvii under the provocation of the love scene in chapter xxvii frenzy mastered him and with a yell of torture he hurled the whole novel through the window and burst into hysterical tears the novel which was of considerable bulk descended on the landlord who was just approaching the house to collect his dues what does it mean gasped monsieur gouge when he had recovered his equilibrium and his hat what does it mean that i cannot approach my own property without being assaulted with a ton of paper who has dared to throw such a thing from a window monsieur stammered the concierge i do not doubt that it was the top floor poet he has been behaving like a lunatic for days aha the top floor poet snorted monsieur gouge i shall soon dispose of him and tricotrin's tears were scarcely dried when bang came another knock at his door so monsieur exclaimed the landlord with fine satire your poems are of small account it appears since you use them as missiles the value you put upon your scribbling does not encourage me to wait for my rent mine faltered tricotrin casting an indignant glance at the muddy manuscript restored to him you accuse me of having perpetrated that atrocity oh this is too much i have a reputation to preserve monsieur and i swear by all the immortals that it was no work of mine did you not throw it throw it yes assuredly i threw it but i did not write it morbleu what do i care who wrote it roared monsieur gouge purple with spleen does its authorship improve the condition of my hat my grievance is its arrival on my head not its literary quality let me tell you that you expose yourself to actions at law pitching weights like this from a respectable house into a public street i should plead insanity said tricotrin twenty seven chapters of that novel translated into a spaniard's french would suffice to people an asylum nevertheless if it arrived on your hat i owe you an apology you also owe me two hundred francs shouted the other and i have shown you more patience than you deserve well my folly is finished you settle up or you get out right off have you reflected that it is christmas eve do we live in a melodrama that i should wander homeless on christmas eve seriously you cannot expect a man of taste to lend himself to so hackneyed a situation besides i share this apartment with the composer monsieur nicolas pitou consider how poignant he would find the room's associations if he returned to dwell here alone monsieur pitou will not be admitted when he returns there is not a pin to choose between the pair of you you hand me the two hundred francs or you go this minute and i shall detain your wardrobe till you pay where is it it is divided between my person and a shelf at the pawnbroker's explained the poet but i have a soiled collar in the left hand corner drawer however i can offer you more valuable security for this trifling debt than you would dare to ask the bureau is full of pearls metrical but beyond price i beg your tenderest care of them especially my tragedy in seven acts do not play jinks with the contents of that bureau or posterity will gibbet you and the name of 'gouge' will one day be execrated throughout france garbage farewell here take your shaving paper with you cried monsieur gouge flinging the spanish novel down the stairs and the next moment the man of letters stood dejected on the pavement with the fatal manuscript under his arm ah miranda miranda thou little knowest what mischief thou hast done he murmured unconsciously plagiarising she brought bad tidings indeed with her disastrous mien he added what is to become of me now the moon to which he had naturally addressed this query made no answer and fingering the sou in his trouser pocket he trudged in the direction of the rue ravignan the situation would look well in print he reflected but the load under my arm should dramatically be a bundle of my own poems doubtless the matter will be put right by my biographer i wonder if i can get half a bed from goujaud encouraged by the thought of the painter's hospitality he proceeded to the studio but he was informed in sour tones that monsieur goujaud would not sleep there that night so much the better he remarked for i can have all his bed instead of half of it believe me i shall put you to no trouble madame i believe it fully answered the woman for you will not come inside not monsieur goujaud nor you nor any other of his vagabond friends so there ah is that how the wind blows the fellow has not paid his rent said tricotrin how disgraceful of him to be sure fortunately sanquereau lives in the next house he pulled the bell there forthwith and the peal had scarcely sounded when sanquereau rushed to the door crying welcome my beautiful mon dieu what worthless acquaintances i possess moaned the unhappy poet since you are expecting your beautiful i need not go into details what on earth did you want muttered sanquereau crestfallen i came to tell you the latest stop press news goujaud's landlord has turned him out and i have no bed to lie on au revoir after another apostrophe to the heavens that inane moon which makes no response is beginning to get on my nerves he soliloquised let me see now there is certainly master criqueboeuf but it is a long journey to the quartier latin and when i get there his social engagements may annoy me as keenly as sanquereau's it appears to me i am likely to try the open air cure to night in the meanwhile i may as well find miranda a seat and think things over accordingly he bent his steps to the place dancourt and having deposited the incubus beside him stretched his limbs on a bench beneath a tree his attitude and his luxuriant locks to say nothing of his melancholy aspect rendered him a noticeable figure in the little square and monsieur petitpas from bordeaux under the awning of the cafe opposite stood regarding him with enthusiasm upon my word of honour mused petitpas rubbing his hands i believe i see a genius in the dumps at last i behold the paris of my dreams if i have read my murger to any purpose i am on the verge of an epoch what a delightful adventure taking out his marylands petitpas sauntered towards the bench with a great show of carelessness and made a pretence of feeling in his pockets for a match tschut he exclaimed then affecting to observe tricotrin for the first time may i beg you to oblige me with a light monsieur he asked deferentially a puff of wind provided an excuse for sitting down to guard the flame and the next moment the genius had accepted a cigarette and acknowledged that the weather was mild for the time of year excitement thrilled petitpas how often after business hours he had perused his well thumbed copy of la vie de boheme and in fancy consorted with the gay descendants of rodolphe and marcel how often he had regretted secretly that he himself did not woo a muse and jest at want in a garret instead of totting up figures and eating three meals a day in comfort and now positively one of the fascinating beings of his imagination lolled by his side the little clerk on a holiday longed to play the generous comrade in his purse he had a couple of louis designed for sight seeing and with a rush of emotion he pictured himself squandering five or six francs in half an hour and startling the artist by his prodigality if i am not mistaken i have the honour to address an author monsieur he ventured your instincts have not misled you replied the poet i am tricotrin monsieur gustave tricotrin the name however is to be found as yet on no statues my own name said the clerk is adolphe petitpas i am a stranger in paris and i count myself fortunate indeed to have made monsieur tricotrin's acquaintance so soon he expresses himself with some discretion this person reflected tricotrin and his cigarette was certainly providential to meet an author has always been an ambition of mine petitpas continued i dare to say that i have the artistic temperament though circumstances have condemned me to commercial pursuits you have no idea how enviable the literary life appears to me monsieur its privileges are perhaps more monotonous than you suppose drawled the homeless poet also i had to work for many years before i attained my present position this noble book for instance began the clerk laying a reverent hand on the abominable manuscript hein exclaimed its victim starting to have written this noble book must be a joy compared with which my own prosperity is valueless the damned thing is no work of mine cried tricotrin and if we are to avoid a quarrel i will ask you not to accuse me of it a joy indeed in that block of drivel you view the cause of my deepest misfortunes a thousand apologies stammered his companion my inference was hasty but what you say interests me beyond words this manuscript of seeming innocence is the cause of misfortunes may i crave an enormous favour may i beg you to regard me as a friend and give me your confidence i see no reason why i should refuse it answered tricotrin on whom the boast of prosperity had made a deep impression you must know then that this ineptitude inflicted on me by an eccentric editor for translation drove me to madness and not an hour ago i cast it from my window in disgust it is a novel entirely devoid of taste and tact and it had the clumsiness to alight on my landlord's head being a man of small nature he retaliated by demanding his rent which it was not convenient to pay interrupted petitpas all the pages of la vie de boheme playing leapfrog through his brain i regret to bore you by so trite a situation 'which it was not convenient to pay' indeed i was not responsible for all of it for i occupied the room with a composer named pitou well you can construct the next scene without a collaborator the landlord has a speech and the tragedy is entitled 'tricotrin in quest of a home' what of the composer inquired the delighted clerk what has become of monsieur pitou monsieur pitou was not on in that act the part of pitou will attain prominence when he returns and finds himself locked out but my dear monsieur tricotrin in such an extremity you should have sought the services of a friend i had that inspiration myself i sought a painter called goujaud and observe how careless is reality in the matter of coincidences i learnt from his concierge that precisely the same thing had befallen monsieur goujaud he too is christmassing alfresco mon dieu faltered the clerk how it rejoices me that i have met you all my life i have looked forward to encountering a genius in such a fix alas sighed tricotrin with a pensive smile to the genius the fix is less spicy without a supper without a supper crowed petitpas without a bed without a bed babbled petitpas enravished with nothing but a pen and the sacred fire one may be forgiven sadness not so not so shouted petitpas smacking him on the back you are omitting me from your list of assets listen i am staying at an hotel you cannot decline to accord me the honour of welcoming you there as my guest for the night hang the expense i am no longer in business i am a bohemian like yourself some supper a bed and a little breakfast will not ruin me what do you say monsieur i say drop the 'monsieur' old chap responded tricotrin your suggestions for the tragedy are cordially accepted i have never known a collaborator to improve a plot so much and understand this i feel more earnestly than i speak henceforth we are pals you and i brothers cried petitpas in ecstasy you shall hear all about a novel that i have projected for years i should like to have your opinion of it i shall be enchanted said tricotrin his jaw dropping you must introduce me to your circle the painters and the models and the actresses your friends shall be my friends in future don't doubt it when i tell them what a brick you are they will be proud to know you no ceremony mind not a bit you shall be another chum already i feel as if we had been confidants in our cradles it is the same with me how true it is that kindred spirits recognise each other in an instant what is environment bah a man may be a bohemian and an artist although his occupations are commercial perfectly i nearly pined amid commercial occupations myself what an extraordinary coincidence ah that is the last bond between us you can realise my most complex moods you can penetrate to the most distant suburbs of my soul gustave if i had been free to choose my career i should have become a famous man my poor adolphe still prosperity is not an unmixed evil you must seek compensation in your wealth murmured the poet who began to think that one might pay too high a price for a bed oh er to be sure said the little clerk reminded that he was pledged to a larger outlay than he had originally proposed that is to say i am not precisely 'wealthy' he saw his pocket money during the trip much curtailed and rather wished that his impulse had been less expansive a snug income is no stigma whether one derives it from parnassus or the bourse continued tricotrin hold who is that i see slouching over there as i live it's pitou the composer whose dilemma i told you of another quavered the clerk dismayed he nicolas turn your symphonic gaze this way 'tis i gustave ah mon vieux exclaimed the young musician joyfully i was wondering what your fate might be i have only just come from the house madame dubois refused me admission she informed me that you had been firing spanish novels at gouge's head why spanish is the spanish variety deadlier so the villain has had the effrontery to turn us out let me make your affinities known to each other said tricotrin my brother nicolas my brother adolphe brother adolphe has received a scenario of the tragedy already and he has a knack of inventing brilliant 'curtains' behind pitou's back he winked at petitpas as if to say he little suspects what a surprise you have in store for him oh er i am grieved to hear of your trouble monsieur pitou said petitpas feebly what 'grieved' come that isn't all about it cried tricotrin who attributed his restraint to nothing but diffidence in an undertone he added don't be nervous dear boy your invitation won't offend him in the least petitpas breathed heavily he aspired to prove himself a true bohemian but his heart quailed at the thought of such expense two suppers two beds and two little breakfasts as a supplement to his bill would be no joke it was with a very poor grace that he stammered at last i hope you will allow me to suggest a way out monsieur pitou a room at my hotel seems to dispose of the difficulty hem exclaimed pitou is that room a mirage or are you serious 'serious' echoed tricotrin he is as serious as an english adaptation of a french farce he went on under his breath you mustn't judge him by his manner i can see that he has turned a little shy believe me he is the king of trumps well upon my word i shall be delighted monsieur responded pitou it was evidently the good kind fairies that led me to the place dancourt i would ask you to step over the way and have a bock but my finances forbid your finances need cause no drought adolphe will be paymaster declared tricotrin gaily shouldering his manuscript come let us adjourn and give the reveillon its due petitpas suppressed a moan by all means he assented i was about to propose it myself i am a real bohemian you know and think nothing of ordering several bocks at once are you sure he is all you say whispered pitou to tricotrin with misgiving a shade embarrassed that is all pronounced the poet and then as the trio moved arm in arm toward the cafe a second solitary figure emerged from the obscurity of the square bless my soul ejaculated tricotrin am i mistaken or look look adolphe i would bet ten to one in sonnets that it is goujaud the painter whose plight i mentioned to you yet another gasped petitpas panic stricken sst he goujaud come here you vagrant and be entertaining well met you fellows sighed goujaud where are you off to we are going to give miranda a drink said the poet she is drier than ever let there be no strangers my brother adolphe my brother theodose what is your secret woe theo your face is as long as this spaniard's novel adolphe have you a recipe in your pocket for the hump perhaps monsieur goujaud will join us in a glass of beer said petitpas very coldly there are more unlikely things than that affirmed the painter and when the cafe was entered he swallowed his bock like one who has a void to fill the fact is he confided to the group i was about to celebrate the reveillon on a bench that insolent landlord of mine has kicked me out and you will not get inside said tricotrin 'not you nor i nor any other of your vagabond friends so there' i had the privilege of conversing with your concierge earlier in the evening ah then you know all about it well now that i have run across you you can give me a shakedown in your attic good business i discern only one drawback to the scheme said pitou we haven't any attic it must be something in the air all the landlords seem to have the same complaint but if you decide in the bench's favour after all you may pillow your curls on miranda put in tricotrin she would be exhilarating company for him adolphe hein what do you think he murmured aside give him a dig in the ribs and say 'you silly ass i can fix you up all right' that's the way we issue invitations in montmartre the clerk's countenance was livid his tongue stuck to his front teeth at last wrenching the words out he groaned if monsieur goujaud will accept my hospitality i shall be charmed he was not without a hope that his frigid bearing would beget a refusal ah my dear old chap shouted goujaud without an instant's hesitation consider it done and now there were to be three suppers three beds and three little breakfasts distorting the account petitpas sipped his bock faintly affecting not to notice that his guests' glasses had been emptied with all his soul he repented the impulse that had led to his predicament amid the throes of his mental arithmetic he recognised that he had been deceived in himself that he had no abiding passion for bohemia how much more pleasing than to board and lodge this disreputable collection would have been the daily round of amusements that he had planned even now he caught his breath even now it was not too late he might pay for the drinks and escape why shouldn't he run away gentlemen cried petitpas i shall go and fetch a cab for us all make yourselves comfortable till i come back when the cafe closed messieurs tricotrin goujaud and pitou crept forlornly across the square and disposed themselves for slumber on the bench well there is this to be said yawned the poet if the little bounder had kept his word it would have been an extraordinary conclusion to our adventures as persons of literary discretion we can hardly regret that a story did not end so improbably my children miranda good night and a merry christmas the cafe of the broken heart on the last day of the year towards the dinner hour a young and attractive woman whose costume proclaimed her a widow entered the cafe of the broken heart that modest restaurant is situated near the cemetery of mont martre the lady quoting from an announcement over the window requested the proprietor to conduct her to the apartment reserved for those desirous of weeping alone the proprietor's shoulders became apologetic a thousand regrets madame he murmured the weeping alone apartment is at present occupied this visibly annoyed the customer it is the second anniversary of my bereavement she complained and already i have wept here twice the woe of an habituee should find a welcome her reproof still more her air of being well to do had an effect on brochat he looked at his wife and his wife said hesitatingly perhaps the young man would consent to oblige madame if you asked him nicely after all he engaged the room for seven o'clock and it is not yet half past six that is true said brochat alors i shall see what can be arranged i beg that madame will put herself to the trouble of sitting down while i make the biggest endeavours but he returned after a few minutes to declare that the young man's sorrow was so profound that no reply could be extracted from him the lady showed signs of temper has this person the monopoly of sorrowing on your premises she demanded whom does he lament surely the loss of a husband should give me prior claim i cannot rightly say whom the gentleman laments stammered brochat the circumstances are in fact somewhat unusual i would mention however that the apartment is a spacious one as madame doubtless recalls and no further mourners are expected for half an hour if in the meantime madame would be so amiable as to weep in the young man's presence i can assure her that she would find him too stricken to stare the widow considered well she said after the pause if you can guarantee his abstraction so be it it is a matter of conscience with me to behave in precisely the same way each year and rather than miss my meditations there altogether i am willing to make the best of him brochat having taken her order for refreshments for which he always charged slightly higher prices on the first floor preceded her up the stairs the single gas flame that had been kindled in the room was very low and the lady received but a momentary impression of a man's figure bowed over a white table she chose a chair at once with her back towards him and resting her brow on her forefinger disposed herself for desolation it may have been that the stranger's proximity told on her nerves or it may have been that time had done something to heal the wound whatever the cause the frame of mind that she invited was slow in arriving and when the bouillon and biscottes appeared she was not averse from trifling with them meanwhile for any sound that he had made the young man might have been as defunct as henri iv but as she took her second sip a groan of such violence escaped him that she nearly upset her cup his abandonment of despair seemed to reflect upon her own insensibility and partly to raise herself in his esteem the lady a moment later uttered a long drawn wistful sigh no sooner had she done so however than she deeply regretted the indiscretion for it stimulated the young man to a howl positively harrowing an impatient movement of her graceful shoulders protested against these demonstrations but as she had her back to him she could not tell whether he observed her stealing a glance she discovered that his face was buried in his hands and that the white table seemed to be laid for ten covers scrutiny revealed ten bottles of wine around it the neck of each bottle embellished with a large crape bow curiosity now held the lady wide eyed and as luck would have it the young man at this moment raised his head i trust that my agony does not disturb you madame he inquired meeting her gaze with some embarrassment i must confess monsieur said she that you have been carrying it rather far he accepted the rebuke humbly if you divined the intensity of my sufferings you would be lenient he murmured nevertheless it was dishonest of me to moan so bitterly before seven o'clock when my claim to the room legally begins i entreat your pardon it is accorded freely said the lady mollified by his penitence she would be a poor mourner who quarrelled with the affliction of another again she indulged in a plaintive sigh and this time the young man's response was tactfully harmonious life is a vale of tears madame he remarked with more solicitude than originality you may indeed say so monsieur she assented to have lost one who was beloved it must be a heavy blow i can imagine it he had made a curious answer she stared at him perplexed you can 'imagine' it very well but you yourself have experienced such a loss monsieur faltered the widow nervously had trouble unhinged his brain no said the young man to speak by the clock my own loss has not yet occurred a brief silence fell during which she cast uneasy glances towards the door he added as if anxious that she should do him justice but i would not have you consider my lamentations premature how true it is breathed the lady that in this world no human soul can wholly comprehend another mine is a very painful history he warned her taking the hint yet if it will serve to divert your mind from your own misfortune i shall be honoured to confide it to you stay the tenth invitation which an accident prevented my dispatching would explain the circumstances tersely but i much fear that the room is too dark for you to decipher all the subtleties have i your permission to turn up the gas do so by all means monsieur said the lady graciously and the light displayed to her first as personable a young man as she could have desired to see second an imposing card which was inscribed as follows monsieur achille flamant artist forewarns you of the death of his career the interment will take place at the cafe of the broken heart on december st valedictory nb a sympathetic costume victuals will be appreciated pm i would call your attention to the border of cypress and to the tomb in the corner said the young man with melancholy pride you may also look favourably on the figure with the shovel which of course depicts me in the act of burying my hopes it is a symbolic touch that no hope is visible it is a very artistic production altogether said the widow dissembling her astonishment so you are a painter monsieur flamant again speaking by the clock i am a painter he concurred but at midnight i shall no longer be in a position to say so in the morning i am pledged to the life commercial you will not marvel at my misery when i inform you that the existence of achille flamant the artist will terminate in five hours and twenty odd minutes well i am commercial myself she said i am madame aurore the beauty specialist of the rue baba do not think me wanting in the finer emotions but i assure you that a lucrative establishment is not a calamity madame aurore demurred the painter with a bow your own business is but a sister art in your atelier the saffron of a bad complexion blooms to the fairness of a rose and the bunch of a lumpy figure is modelled to the grace of galatea with me it will be a different pair of shoes i shall be condemned to perch on a stool in the office of a wine merchant and invoice vintages which my thirty francs a week will not allow me to drink no comparison can be drawn between your lot and my little certainly i should not like to perch she confessed would you rejoice at the thirty francs a week well and the thirty francs a week are also poignant but you may rise monsieur who shall foretell the future once i had to make both ends meet with less to coax them than the salary you mention even when my poor husband was taken from me heigho she raised a miniature handkerchief delicately to her eyes when i was left alone in the world monsieur my affairs were greatly involved i had practically nothing but my resolve to succeed and the witchery of your personal attractions madame said the painter politely ah a pensive smile rewarded him the business was still in its infancy monsieur yet to day i have the smartest clientele in paris i might remove to the rue de la paix to morrow if i pleased but i say why should i do that i say why a reckless rental for the sake of a fashionable address when the fashionable men and women come to me where i am you show profound judgment madame said flamant why indeed and you too will show good judgment i am convinced continued madame aurore regarding him with approval you have an air of intellect if your eyebrows were elongated a fraction towards the temples an improvement that might be effected easily enough by regular use of my persian pomade you would acquire the appearance of a born conqueror alas sighed flamant my finances forbid my profiting by the tip monsieur you wrong me murmured the specialist reproachfully i was speaking with no professional intent on the contrary if you will permit me i shall take joy in forwarding a pot to you gratis is it possible cried flamant you would really do this for me you feel for my sufferings so much indeed i regret that i cannot persuade you to reduce the sufferings she replied but tell me why you have selected the vocation of a wine merchant's clerk fate not i has determined my cul de sac in life rejoined her companion it is like this my father who lacks an artistic soul consented to my becoming a painter only upon the understanding that i should gain the prix de rome and pursue my studies in italy free of any expense to him this being arranged he agreed to make me a minute allowance in the meanwhile by a concatenation of catastrophes upon which it is unnecessary to dwell the beaux arts did not accord the prize to me and at the end of last year my parent reminded me of our compact with a vigour which nothing but the relationship prevents my describing as 'inhuman' he insisted that i must bid farewell to aspiration and renounce the brush of an artist for the quill of a clerk distraught i flung myself upon my knees i implored him to reconsider my tribulation would have moved a rock it even moved his heart he showed you mercy he allowed me a respite it was for twelve months precisely what rapid intuitions you have if i could remain in paris we should become great friends he allowed me twelve months' respite if at the end of that time art was still inadequate to supply my board and lodging it was covenanted that without any more ado i should resign myself to clerical employment at nantes the merchant there is a friend of the family and had offered to demonstrate his friendship by paying me too little to live on enfin fame has continued coy the year expires to night i have begged a few comrades to attend a valedictory dinner and at the stroke of midnight despairing i depart is there a train i do not depart from paris till after breakfast to morrow but at midnight i depart from myself i depart psychologically the achille flamant of the hitherto will be no more i understand said madame aurore moved as you say in my own way i am an artist too there is a bond between us poor fellow it is indeed a crisis in your life who put the crape bows on the bottles they are badly tied shall i tie them properly for you it would be a sweet service said flamant and i should be grateful how gentle you are to me pomade bows nothing is too much for you you must give me your nantes address she said and i will post the pot without fail i shall always keep it he vowed not the pomade but the pot as a souvenir will you write a few lines to me at the same time her gaze was averted she toyed with her spoon the directions will be on the label she said timidly it was not of my eyebrows i was thinking murmured the man what should i say the latest quotation for artificial lashes or a development in dimple culture would hardly be engrossing to you i am inclined to believe that anything that concerned you would engross me it would be so unconventional she objected dreamily to send a brief message of encouragement have we not talked like confidants that is queerer still i admit it just now i was unaware of your existence and suddenly you dominate my thoughts how do you work these miracles madame do you know that i have an enormous favour to crave of you what another one actually is it not audacious of me yet for a man on the verge of parting from his identity i venture to hope that you will strain a point the circumstances are in the man's favour she owned nevertheless much depends on what the point is well i ask nothing less than that you accept the invitation on the card that you examined i beg you to soothe my last hours by remaining to dine oh but really she exclaimed i am afraid you cannot urge that you are required at your atelier so late and as to any social engagement i do not hesitate to affirm that my approaching death in life puts forth the stronger claim on me when all is said a new acquaintance what is time demanded the painter and she was not prepared with a reply your comrades will be strangers to me she argued it is a fact that now i wish they were not coming acknowledged the host but they are young men of the loftiest genius and some day it may provide a piquant anecdote to relate how you met them all in the period of their obscurity my friend she said hurt if i consented it would not be to garner anecdotes ah a million regrets he cried i spoke foolishly it was tactless yes i am a man do you forgive yes i am a woman well i must take my bonnet off oh you are not a woman but an angel what beautiful hair you have and your hands how i should love to paint them i have painted them myself with many preparations my hands have known labour believe me they have washed up plates and dishes and often the dishes had provided little to eat poor girl one would never suspect that you had struggled like that how feelingly you say it there have been few to show me sympathy oh i assure you my life has been a hard one it is a hard one now in spite of my success constantly when customers moan before my mirrors i envy them if they did but know it i think 'yes you have a double chin and your eyes have lost their fire and nasty curly little veins are spoiling the pallor of your nose but you have the affection of husband and child while i have nothing but fees' what is my destiny to hear great grandmothers grumble because i cannot give them back their girlhood for a thousand francs to devote myself to making other women beloved while i remain loveless in my shop honestly my heart aches for you if i might presume to advise i would say 'do not allow the business to absorb your youth you were meant to be worshipped' and yet while i recommend it i hate to think of another man worshipping you why should you care my dear but there is no likelihood of that i am far too busy to seek worshippers a propos an idea has just occurred to me which might be advantageous to us both if you could inform your father that you would be able to earn rather more next year by remaining in paris than by going to nantes would it be satisfactory satisfactory ejaculated flamant it would be ecstatic but how shall i acquire such information would you like to paint a couple of portraits of me i should like to paint a thousand my establishment is not a picture gallery listen i offer you a commission for two portraits one present day let us say moderately attractive i decline to libel you o flatterer the other depicting my faded aspect before i discovered the priceless secrets of the treatment that i practise in the rue baba i shall hang them both in the reception room i must look at least a decade older in the 'before' than in the 'after' and it must of course present the appearance of having been painted some years ago that can be faked perfectly you accept i embrace your feet you have saved my life you have preserved my hopefulness you have restored my youth it is my profession to preserve and restore ah mon dieu gasped flamant in a paroxysm of adoration aurore i can no longer refrain from avowing that at this instant the door opened and there entered solemnly nine young men garbed in such habiliments of woe as had never before been seen perambulating even on the figures of undertakers the foremost bore a wreath of immortelles which he laid in devout silence on the dinner table permit me said flamant recovering himself by a stupendous effort monsieur tricotrin the poet madame aurore enchanted said the poet in lugubrious tones i have a heavy cold thank you owing to my having passed the early hours of christmas day on a bench in default of a bed it is superfluous to inquire as to the health of madame monsieur goujaud a colleague overjoyed responded goujaud with a violent sneeze goujaud was with me said tricotrin monsieur pitou the composer i ab hodoured i trust badabe is dot dervous of gerbs there is nothing to fear said pitou so was pitou added tricotrin monsieur sanquereau the sculptor monsieur lajeunie the novelist continued the host but before he could present the rest of the company brochat was respectfully intimating to the widow that her position in the weeping alone apartment was now untenable he was immediately commanded to lay another cover madame and comrades declaimed tricotrin unrolling a voluminous manuscript as they took their seats around the pot au feu i have composed for this piteous occasion a brief poem i must beseech your pardon stammered flamant rising in deep confusion i have nine apologies to tender gentlemen this touching wreath for the tomb of my career finds the tomb unready these affecting garments which you have hired at i fear ruinous expense should be exchanged for bunting that immortal poem with which our friend would favour us has been suddenly deprived of all its point explain explain volleyed from nine throats i shall still read it insisted tricotrin it is good the lady nay the goddess whom you behold has showered commissions and for one year more i shall still be in your midst brothers in art brothers in heart i ask you to charge your glasses and let your voices ring the toast is 'madame aurore and her gift of the new year' madame aurore and her gift of the new year shrieked the nine young men springing to their feet in a year much may happen said the lady tremulously and when they had all sat down again flamant was thrilled to find her hand in his beneath the table the dress clothes of monsieur pomponnet it was thanks to touquet that she was able to look so chic the little baggage yet of all her suitors touquet was the one she favoured least he was the costumier at the corner of the rue des martyrs and made a very fair thing of the second hand clothes it was to touquet's that the tradesmen of the quarter turned as a matter of course to hire dress suits for their nuptials it was in the well cleaned satins of touquet that the brides' mothers and the lady guests cut such imposing figures when they were photographed after the wedding breakfasts it was even touquet who sometimes supplied a gown to one or another of the humble actresses at the theatre montmartre and received a couple of free tickets in addition to his fee i tell you that touquet was not a person to be sneezed at though he had passed the first flush of youth and was never an adonis besides who was she this little lisette who had the impudence to flout him a girl in a florist's if you can believe me with no particular beauty herself and not a son by way of dot and yet one must confess it she turned a head as swiftly as she made a buttonhole and pomponnet the pastrycook was paying court to her too to say nothing of the homage of messieurs tricotrin the poet and goujaud the painter and lajeunie the novelist you would never have guessed that her wages were only twenty francs a week as you watched her waltz with tricotrin at the ball on saturday evening or as you saw her enter pomponnet's shop when the shutters were drawn to feast on his strawberry tarts her costumes were the cynosure of the boulevard rochechouart and they were all due to touquet touquet the infatuated who lent the fine feathers to her for the sake of a glance or a pressure of the hand and wept on his counter afterwards while he wondered whose arms might be embracing her in the costumes that he had cleaned and pressed with so much care often he swore that his folly should end that she should be affianced to him or go shabby but lo in a day or two she would make her appearance again to coax for the loan of a smart blouse or that hat with the giant rose and the ostrich plume and touquet would be as weak as ever judge then of his despair when he heard that she had agreed to marry pomponnet she told him the news with the air of an amiable gossip when she came to return a ball dress that she had borrowed enfin she said perched on the counter and swinging her remorseless feet it is arranged i desert the flowers for the pastry and become the mistress of a shop i shall have to beg from my good friend monsieur touquet no more not at all i shall be his client like the rest it will be better hein touquet groaned you know well lisette he answered that it has been a joy to me to place the stock at your disposal even though it was to make you more attractive in the eyes of other men everything here that you have worn possesses a charm to me i fondle the garments when you bring them back i take them down from the pegs and dream over them truly there is no limit to my weakness for often when a client proposes to hire a frock that you have had i cannot bear that she should profane it and i say that it is engaged you dear kind monsieur touquet murmured the coquette how agreeable you are i have always hoped for the day when the stock would be all your own lisette and by and by we might have removed to a better position even down the hill who knows we might have opened a business in the madeleine quarter that would suit you better than a little cake shop up a side street and i would have risked it for you i know how you incline to fashion when i have taken you to a theatre did you choose the montmartre where we might have gone for nothing or the moncey not you that might do for other girls you have always demanded the theatres of the grand boulevard a cup of coffee at the cafe de la paix is more to your taste than a bottle of beer and hard boiled eggs at the nimble rabbit heaven knows i trust you will be happy but i cannot persuade myself that this pomponnet shares your ambitions with his slum and his stale pastry he is quite content it is not stale she said well we will pass his pastry though word of honour i bought some there last week that might have been baked before the commune but to recur to his soul is it an affinity affinities are always hard up she pouted zut exclaimed touquet now your mind is running on that monsieur tricotrin by 'affinities' i do not mean hungry poets why not have entrusted your happiness to me i adore you i have told you a thousand times that i adore you lisette consider before it is too late you cannot love this this obscure baker she gave a shrug it is a fact that devotion has not robbed me of my appetite she confessed but what would you have his business goes far better than you imagine i have seen his books and anyhow my sentiment for you is friendship and no more to the devil with friendship cried the unhappy wardrobe dealer did i dress you like the empress josephine for friendship do not mock yourself of it she said reprovingly remember that 'friendship is a beautiful flower of which esteem is the stem' and having thrown the adage to him coupled with a glance that drove him to distraction the little flirt jumped off the counter and was gone much more reluctantly she contemplated parting with him whom the costumier had described as a hungry poet but matrimony did not enter the poet's scheme of things nor for that matter had she ever regarded him as a possible parti yet a woman may give her fancy where her reason refuses to follow and when she imparted her news to tricotrin there was no smile on her lips we shall not go to balls any more old dear she said monsieur pomponnet has proposed marriage to me and i settle down heartless girl exclaimed the young man with tears in his eyes so much for woman's constancy mon dieu she faltered did you then love me gustave really i do not know said tricotrin but since i am to lose you i prefer to think so ah do not grieve for me fortunately there is always the seine and first i shall pour my misery into song and in years to come fair daughters at your side will read the deathless poem little dreaming that the lisette i sang to is their mother some time long after i am in my grave when france has honoured me at last you may stand before a statue that bears my name and think 'he loved me and i broke his heart' oh she whimpered rather than break your heart i i might break the engagement i might consider again gustave no no returned tricotrin i will not reproach myself with the thought that i have marred your life i will leave you free besides as i say i am not certain that i should want you so much but for the fact that i have lost you after all you will not appreciate the poem that immortalises you and if i lived many of your remarks about it would doubtless infuriate me why shall i not appreciate it am i so stupid it is not that you are stupid my soul he explained it is that i am transcendentally clever to understand the virtues of my work one must have sipped from all the flowers of literature 'there is to be found in it racine voltaire flaubert renan and always gustave tricotrin' as lemaitre has written he wrote ' and always anatole france' but i paraphrase him slightly so you are going to marry pomponnet mon dieu when i have any sous in my pocket i will ruin myself for the rapture of regretting you among the pastry i thought she said a little mortified that you were going to drown yourself am i not to write my lament to you i must eat while i write it why not pastry also when i am penniless and starving you may sometimes in your prosperity and yet perhaps it is too much to ask give you tick do you mean dear but yes gustave how can you doubt that i will do that in memory of in memory of the love that has been you will permit me to run up a small score for cakes will you not lisette i will indeed she promised but but oh it's quite true i should never understand you a minute ago you made me think of you in the morgue and now you make me think of you in the cake shop what are you laughing at i laugh like figaro said tricotrin that i may not be obliged to weep when are you going to throw yourself away my little lisette has my accursed rival induced you to fix a date' we are to be married in a fortnight's time she said and if you could undertake to be sensible i would ask alphonse to invite you to the breakfast in a fortnight's time hunger and a hopeless passion will probably have made an end of me replied the poet however if i survive the breakfast will certainly be welcome where is it to be held i can recommend a restaurant that is especially fine at such affairs and most moderate 'photographs of the party are taken gratuitously in the jardin d'acclimatation and pianos are at the disposal of the ladies' i quote from the menu i study it in the window every time i pass there are wedding breakfasts from six to twelve francs per head at six francs the party have their choice of two soups and three hors d'oeuvres then comes 'poisson' i fear it may be whiting filet de boeuf with tomates farcies bouchees a la reine chicken pigeons salad two vegetables an ice assorted fruits and biscuits the wines are madeira a bottle of macon to each person a bottle of bordeaux among four persons and a bottle of champagne among ten persons also coffee and liqueurs at six francs a head it is good hein at seven francs there is a bottle of champagne among every eight persons pomponnet will of course do as he thinks best at eight francs a bottle is provided for every six persons i have too much delicacy to make suggestions but should he be willing to soar to twelve francs a head i might eat enough to last a week and of such quality the soups would then be bisque d'ecrevisse and consomme rachel rissoles de foies gras would appear asparagus 'in branches' and compote of peaches flavoured with maraschino would be included also in the twelve franc breakfast the champagne begins to have a human name on the label now it is not certain how much of this information lisette repeated to pomponnet but pomponnet having a will of his own refused to entertain monsieur tricotrin at any price at all more over he found it unconventional that she should desire the poet's company considering the attentions that he had paid her and she was forced to listen with an air of humility which she was far from feeling to a lecture on the responsibilities of her new position i am not a jealous man said the pastrycook who was as jealous a man as ever baked a pie but it would be discreet that you dropped this acquaintance now that we are engaged i know well that you have never taken the addresses of such a fellow seriously and that it is only in the goodness of your heart you wish to present him with a blow out nevertheless the betrothal of a man in my circumstances is much remarked all the daughters of the hairdresser next door have had their hopes of me indeed there is scarcely a neighbour who is not chagrined at the turn events have taken and the world would be only too glad of an excuse to call me 'fool' pomponnet's wife must be above suspicion you will remember that a little lightness of conduct which might be forgiven in the employee of the florist would be unseemly in my fiancee no more conversation with monsieur tricotrin lisette some dignity some coldness in the bow when you pass him the boulevard will observe it it will be approved you of course know best my dear alphonse she returned meekly i am only an inexperienced girl and i am thankful to have your advice to guide me but let me say that never never has there been any 'lightness of conduct' to distress you monsieur tricotrin and i have been merely friends if i have gone to a ball with him sometimes and i acknowledge that has happened it has been because nobody more to my taste has offered to take me she had ground her little teeth under the infliction of his homily and it was only by dint of thinking hard of his profits that she abstained from retorting that he might marry all the daughters of the hairdresser and go to uganda however during the next week or so she did not chance to meet the poet on the boulevard and since she wished to conquer her tenderness for him one cannot doubt that all would have been well but for the editor of l'echo de la butte by a freak of fate the editor of l'echo de la butte was moved to invite monsieur tricotrin to an affair of ceremony two days previous to the wedding what followed naturally tricotrin must present himself in evening dress naturally also he must go to touquet's to hire the suit regard said the costumier here is a suit that i have just acquired monsieur will observe that it is of the most distinguished cut quite in the latest fashion i will whisper to monsieur that it comes to me through the valet of the comte de st nom la breteche foret de marly mon dieu said tricotrin let me try it on and he was so gratified by his appearance in it that he barely winced at the thought of the expense i am improving my position he soliloquised if i have not precisely inherited the mantle of victor hugo i have at any rate hired the dress suit of the comte de st nom la breteche foret de marly never had a more impressive spectacle been witnessed in montmartre than tricotrin's departure from his latest lodging shortly after six o'clock wearing a shirt of pitou's flamant's patent leather boots and a white tie contributed by goujaud the young man sallied forth with the deportment of the count himself only one thing more did he desire a flower for his buttonhole and lisette remained in her situation until the morrow what more natural finally than that he should hie him to the florist's it was the first time that she had seen her lover in evening dress and sentiment overpowered her as he entered thou she murmured paling on the poet too the influence of the clothes was very strong attired like a jeune premier he craved with all the dramatic instinct of his nature for a love scene and instead of fulfilling his intention to beg for a rosebud at cost price he gazed at her soulfully and breathed lisette so we have met again she said the world is small returned the poet ignoring the fact that he had come to the shop and am i yet remembered it is not likely i should forget you in a few days she said more practically i didn't forget about the breakfast either but alphonse put his foot down pig said the poet and yet it may be better so how could i eat in such an hour however you are not disconsolate this evening she suggested mais vrai what a swell you are flute some fashionable assembly that will bore me beyond endurance he sighed with you alone lisette have i known true happiness the train rides on summer nights that were joyous because we loved the simple meals that were sweetened by your smile ah gustave she said wait i must give you a flower for your coat i shall keep it all my life vowed tricotrin tell me little one i dare not stay now because my host lives a long way off but this evening could you not meet me once again for the last time to say farewell i have nearly two francs fifty and we might go to supper if you agree it was arranged before he took leave of her that she should meet him outside the debit at the corner of the rue de sontay at eleven o'clock and sup with him there in a locality where she was unlikely to be recognised rash enough this conduct for a young woman who was to be married to another man on the next day but one but a greater imprudence was to follow they supped they sentimentalised and when they parted in the champs elysees and the moonshine she gave him from her bosom a little rose coloured envelope that contained nothing less than a lock of her hair the poet placed it tenderly in his waistcoat pocket and after he had wept and quoted poetry to the stars forgot it he began to wish that he had not mixed his liquors quite so impartially and on the morrow when he woke he was mindful of nothing more grievous than a splitting headache now touquet who could not sleep of nights because the pastrycook was going to marry lisette made a practice of examining the pockets of all garments returned to him with an eye to stray sous and when he proceeded to examine the pockets of the dress suit returned by monsieur tricotrin what befell but that he drew forth a rose tinted envelope containing a tress of hair and inscribed to gustave from lisette adieu and the editor who invited monsieur tricotrin had never heard of lisette never heard of pomponnet did not know that such a person as touquet existed yet the editorial caprice had manipulated destinies how powerful are editors how complicated is life but a truce to philosophy let us deal with the emotions of the soul the shop reeled before touquet all the good and the bad in his character battled tumultuously in one moment he aspired to be generous and restore to lisette the evidence of her guilt in the next he sank to the base thought of displaying it to pomponnet and breaking off the match the discovery fired his brain no longer was he a nonentity the odd man out chance had transformed him to the master of the situation full well he knew that there would be no nuptials next day were pomponnet aware of his fiancee's perfidy it needed but to go to him and say monsieur my sense of duty compels me to inform you how easy it would be he laughed hysterically but lisette would never pardon such a meanness she would always despise and hate him he would have torn her from his rival's arms it was true yet his own would still be empty ah lisette lisette groaned the wretched man and swept to evil by the force of passion he cudgelled his mind to devise some piece of trickery some diabolical artifice by which the incriminating token might be placed in the pastrycook's hands as if by accident and while he pondered his whole soul a chaos in that hour pomponnet entered to hire a dress suit for his wedding touquet raised his head blanched to the lips regard he said with a forced calm terrible to behold here is a suit that i have just acquired monsieur will observe that it is of the most distinguished cut quite in the latest fashion i will whisper to monsieur that it comes to me through the valet of the comte de st nom la breteche foret de marly and unseen by the guileless bridegroom he slipped the damning proof into a pocket of the trousers where his knowledge of the pastrycook's attitudes assured him that it was even more certain to be found than in the waistcoat mon dieu said the other duly impressed by the suit's pedigree let me try it on the coat is rather tight he complained but it has undeniably an air no more than one client has worn it gasped the wardrobe dealer haggardly monsieur gustave tricotrin the poet who hired it last night the suit is practically new i have no other in the establishment to compare with it listen monsieur pomponnet to an old client like yourself i will be liberal wear it this evening for an hour in your home if you find it not to your figure there will be time to make another selection before the ceremony to morrow you shall have this on trial i will make no extra charge such munificence was bound to have its effect and five minutes later touquet's plot had progressed but the tension had been frightful the door had scarcely closed when he sank into a chair trembling in every limb and for the rest of the day he attended to his business like one moving in a trance meanwhile the unsuspecting pomponnet reviewed the arrangement with considerable satisfaction and when he came to attire himself after the cake shop was shut his reflected image pleased him so well that he was tempted to stroll abroad he decided to call on his betrothed and to exhibit himself a little on the boulevard accordingly he put some money in the pocket of the waistcoat oiled his silk hat to give it an additional lustre and sallied forth in high good humour how splendid you look my dear alphonse exclaimed lisette little dreaming it was the same suit that she had approved on tricotrin the previous evening her innocent admiration was agreeable to pomponnet he patted her on the cheek in truth he said carelessly i had forgotten that i had it on but i was so impatient for to morrow my pet angel that i could not remain alone and i had to come to see you they were talking on her doorstep for she had no apartment in which it would have been convenable to entertain him and it appeared to him that the terrace of a cafe would be more congenial run upstairs and make your toilette my loving duck he suggested and i shall take you out for a tasse while you are getting ready i will smoke a cigar and he drew his cigar case from the breast pocket of the coat and took a match box from the pocket where he had put his cash it was a balmy evening sweet with the odour of spring and the streets were full of life as he promenaded with her on the boulevard pomponnet did not fail to remark the attention commanded by his costume he strutted proudly and when they reached the cafe and took their seats he gave his order with the authority of the president ah he remarked it is good here hein and then stretching his legs he thrust both his hands into the pockets of his trousers comment he murmured what have i found now is not this amusing i swear it is a billet doux he bent chuckling to the light and bounded in his chair with an oath that turned a dozen heads towards them traitress roared pomponnet miserable traitress it is your name it is your writing it is your hair do not deny it give me your head it matches to a shade jezebel last night you met monsieur tricotrin you have deceived me lisette who had jumped as high as he in recognising the envelope sat like one paralysed now her tongue refused to move for an instant the catastrophe seemed to her of supernatural agency it was as if a miracle had happened as she saw her fiance produce her lover's keepsake all she could stammer at last was let us go away pay for the coffee i will not pay shouted monsieur pomponnet pay for it yourself jade i have done with you and leaving her spellbound at the table he strode from the terrace like a madman before the waiters could stop him oh of course he was well known at the cafe and they did not detain lisette but it was a most ignominious position for a young woman and there was no wedding next day and everybody knew why the little coquette who had mocked suitors by the dozen was jilted almost on the threshold of the mairie she smacked tricotrin's face in the morning but her humiliation was so acute that it demanded the salve of immediate marriage and at the moment she could think of no one better than touquet so touquet won her after all and though by this time she may guess how he accomplished it he will tell you word of honour that never never has he had occasion for regret the suicides in the rue sombre having bought the rope tournicquot wondered where he should hang himself the lath and plaster ceiling of his room might decline to support him and while the streets were populous a lamp post was out of the question as he hesitated on the kerb he reflected that a pan of charcoal would have been more convenient after all but the coil of rope in the doorway of a shop had lured his fancy and now it would be laughable to throw it away tournicquot was much averse from being laughed at in private life perhaps because fate had willed that he should be laughed at so much in his public capacity could he have had his way indeed tournicquot would have been a great tragedian instead of a little droll whose portraits with a bright red nose and a scarlet wig grimaced on the hoardings and he resolved that at any rate the element of humour should not mar his suicide as to the motive for his death it was as romantic as his heart desired he adored la belle lucerce the fascinating snake charmer and somewhere in the background the artiste had a husband little the audience suspected the passion that devoured their grotesque comedian while he cut his capers and turned love to ridicule little they divined the pathos of a situation which condemned him behind the scenes to whisper the most sentimental assurances of devotion when disfigured by a flaming wig and a nose that was daubed vermilion how nearly it has been said one half of the world does not know how the other half loves but such incongruities would distress tournicquot no more to day he was to die he had worn his chessboard trousers and his little green coat for the last time for the last time had the relentless virtue of lucrece driven him to despair when he was discovered inanimate hanging to a beam nothing comic about him perhaps the world would admit that his soul had been solemn though his line of business had been funny perhaps lucrece would even drop warm tears on his tomb it was early in the evening dusk was gathering over paris the promise of dinner was in the breeze the white glare of electric globes began to flood the streets and before the cafes waiters bustled among the tables bearing the vermouth and absinthe of the hour instinctively shunning the more frequented thoroughfares tournicquot crossed the boulevard des batignolles and wandered lost in reverie along the melancholy continuation of the rue de rome until he perceived that he had reached a neighbourhood unknown to him that he stood at the corner of a street which bore the name rue sombre opposite one of the houses was being rebuilt and as he gazed at it this skeleton of a home in which the workmen's hammers were silenced for the night tournicquot recognised that his journey was at an end here he could not doubt that he would find the last grim hospitality that he sought the house had no door to bar his entrance but as if in omen above the gap where a door had been the sinister number was still to be discerned he cast a glance over his shoulder and grasping the rope with a firm hand crept inside it was dark within so dark that at first he could discern nothing but the gleam of bare walls he stole along the passage and mounting a flight of steps on which his feet sprung mournful echoes proceeded stealthily towards an apartment on the first floor at this point the darkness became impenetrable for the volets had been closed and in order to make his arrangements it was necessary that he should have a light he paused fumbling in his pocket and then with his next step blundered against a body which swung from the contact like a human being suspended in mid air tournicquot leapt backwards in terror a cold sweat bespangled him and for some seconds he shook so violently that he was unable to strike a match at last when he accomplished it he beheld a man apparently dead hanging by a rope in the doorway ah mon dieu gasped tournicquot and the thudding of his heart seemed to resound through the deserted house humanity impelled him to rescue the poor wretch if it was still to be done shuddering he whipped out his knife and sawed at the cord desperately the cord was stout and the blade of the knife but small an eternity seemed to pass while he sawed in the darkness presently one of the strands gave way he set his teeth and pressed harder and harder yet suddenly the rope yielded and the body fell to the ground tournicquot threw himself beside it tearing open the collar and using frantic efforts to restore animation there was no result he persevered but the body lay perfectly inert he began to reflect that it was his duty to inform the police of the discovery and he asked himself how he should account for his presence on the scene just as he was considering this he felt the stir of life as if by a miracle the man groaned courage my poor fellow panted tournicquot courage all is well the man groaned again and after an appalling silence during which tournicquot began to tremble for his fate anew asked feebly where am i you would have hanged yourself explained tournicquot thanks to heaven i arrived in time to save your life in the darkness they could not see each other but he felt for the man's hand and pressed it warmly to his consternation he received for response a thump in the chest morbleu what an infernal cheek croaked the man so you have cut me down you meddlesome idiot by what right did you poke your nose into my affairs hein dismay held tournicquot dumb hein wheezed the man what concern was it of yours if you please never in my life before have i met with such a piece of presumption my poor friend stammered tournicquot you do not know what you say you are not yourself by and by you will be grateful you will fall on your knees and bless me by and by i shall punch you in the eye returned the man just as soon as i am feeling better what have you done to my collar too i declare you have played the devil with me his annoyance rose who are you and what are you doing here anyhow you are a trespasser i shall give you in charge come come said tournicquot conciliatingly if your misfortunes are more than you can bear i regret that i was obliged to save you but after all there is no need to make such a grievance of it you can hang yourself another day and why should i be put to the trouble twice grumbled the other do you figure yourself that it is agreeable to hang i passed a very bad time i can assure you if you had experienced it you would not talk so lightly about 'another day' the more i think of your impudent interference the more it vexes me and how dark it is get up and light the candle it gives me the hump here i have no candle i have no candle babbled tournicquot i do not carry candles in my pocket there is a bit on the mantelpiece replied the man angrily i saw it when i came in go and feel for it hunt about do not keep me lying here in the dark the least you can do is to make me as comfortable as you can tournicquot not a little perturbed by the threat of assault groped obediently but the room appeared to be of the dimensions of a park and he arrived at the candle stump only after a prolonged excursion the flame revealed to him a man of about his own age who leant against the wall regarding him with indignant eyes revealed also was the coil of rope that the comedian had brought for his own use and the man pointed to it what is that it was not here just now it belongs to me admitted tournicquot nervously i see that it belongs to you why do you visit an empty house with a coil of rope hein i should like to understand that upon my life you were here on the same business as myself now if this does not pass all forbearance you come to commit suicide and yet you have the effrontery to put a stop to mine well exclaimed tournicquot i obeyed an impulse of pity it is true that i came to destroy myself for i am the most miserable of men but i was so much affected by the sight of your sufferings that temporarily i forgot my own that is a lie for i was not suffering i was not conscious when you came in however you have some pretty moments in front of you so we will say no more when you feel yourself drop it will be diabolical i promise you the hair stands erect on the head and each spot of blood in the veins congeals to a separate icicle it is true that the drop itself is swift but the clutch of the rope as you kick in the air is hardly less atrocious do not be encouraged by the delusion that the matter is instantaneous time mocks you and a second holds the sensations of a quarter of an hour what has forced you to it we need not stand on ceremony with each other hein i have resolved to die because life is torture said tournicquot on whom these details had made an unfavourable impression the same with me a woman of course yes sighed tournicquot a woman is there no other remedy cannot you desert her desert her i pine for her embrace hein she will not have anything to do with me comment then it is love with you what else an eternal passion oh mon dieu i took it for granted you were married but this is droll you would die because you cannot get hold of a woman and i because i cannot get rid of one we should talk we two can you give me a cigarette with pleasure monsieur responded tournicquot producing a packet i also will take one my last if i expressed myself hastily just now said his companion refastening his collar i shall apologise no doubt your interference was well meant though i do not pretend to approve it let us dismiss the incident you have behaved tactlessly and i on my side have perhaps resented your error with too much warmth well it is finished while the candle burns let us exchange more amicable views is my cravat straight it astonishes me to hear that love can drive a man to such despair i too have loved but never to the length of the rope there are plenty of women in paris if one has no heart there is always another i am far from proposing to frustrate your project holding as i do that a man's suicide is an intimate matter in which 'rescue' is a name given by busybodies to a gross impertinence but as you have not begun the job i will confess that i think you are being rash i have considered replied tournicquot i have considered attentively there is no alternative i assure you i would make another attempt to persuade the lady i swear i would make another attempt you are not a bad looking fellow what is her objection to you it is not that she objects to me on the contrary but she is a woman of high principle and she has a husband who is devoted to her she will not break his heart it is like that young no more than thirty and beautiful with a beauty like an angel's she has a dimple in her right cheek when she smiles that drives one to distraction myself i have no weakness for dimples but every man to his taste there is no arguing about these things what a combination young lovely virtuous and i make you a bet the oaf of a husband does not appreciate her is it not always so now i but of course i married foolishly i married an artiste if i had my time again i would choose in preference any sempstress the artistes are for applause for bouquets for little dinners but not for marriage i cannot agree with you said tournicquot with some hauteur your experience may have been unfortunate but the theatre contains women quite as noble as any other sphere in proof of it the lady i adore is an artiste herself really is it so would it be indiscreet to ask her name there are things that one does not tell but as a matter of interest there is nothing derogatory to her in what you say quite the reverse true well the reason for reticence is removed she is known as 'la belle lucrece' hein ejaculated the other jumping what ails you she is my wife your wife impossible i tell you i am married to her she is 'madame beguinet' mon dieu faltered tournicquot aghast what have i done so you are her lover never has she encouraged me recall what i said there are no grounds for jealousy am i not about to die because she spurns me i swear to you you mistake my emotion why should i be jealous not at all i am only amazed she thinks i am devoted to her ho ho not at all you see my 'devotion' by the fact that i am about to hang myself rather than live with her and you you cannot bear to live because you adore her actually you adore her is it not inexplicable oh there is certainly the finger of providence in this meeting wait we must discuss we should come to each other's aid give me another cigarette some seconds passed while they smoked in silent meditation listen resumed monsieur beguinet in order to clear up this complication a perfect candour is required on both sides alors as to your views is it that you aspire to marry madame i do not wish to appear exigent but in the position that i occupy you will realise that it is my duty to make the most favourable arrangements for her that i can now open your heart to me speak frankly it is difficult for me to express myself without restraint to you monsieur said tournicquot because circumstances cause me to regard you as a grievance to answer you with all the delicacy possible i will say that if i had cut you down five minutes later life would be a fairer thing to me good said monsieur beguinet we make progress your income does it suffice to support her in the style to which she is accustomed what may your occupation be i am in madame's own profession i too am an artiste so much the more congenial i foresee a joyous union come we go famously your line of business snakes ventriloquism performing rabbits what is it my name is 'tournicquot' responded the comedian with dignity all is said a ah is it so now i understand why your voice has been puzzling me monsieur tournicquot i am enchanted to make your acquaintance i declare the matter arranges itself i shall tell you what we will do hitherto i have had no choice between residing with madame and committing suicide because my affairs have not prospered and though my pride has revolted her salary has been essential for my maintenance now the happy medium jumps to the eyes for you for me for her the bright sunshine streams i shall efface myself i shall go to a distant spot say monte carlo and you shall make me a snug allowance have no misgiving crown her with blossoms lead her to the altar and rest tranquil i shall never reappear do not figure yourself that i shall enter like the villain at the amibigu and menace the blissful home not at all i myself may even re marry who knows indeed should you offer me an allowance adequate for a family man i will undertake to re marry i have always inclined towards speculation that will shut my mouth hein i could threaten nothing even if i had a base nature for i also shall have committed bigamy suicide bigamy i would commit anything rather than live with lucrece but madame's consent must be gained demurred tournicquot you overlook the fact that madame must consent it is a fact that i do not understand why she should have any consideration for you but if she continues to harp upon her 'duty' what then do you not tell me that her only objection to your suit has been her fear that she would break my heart what an hallucination i shall approach the subject with tact with the utmost delicacy i shall intimate to her that to ensure her happiness i am willing to sacrifice myself should she hesitate i shall demand to sacrifice myself rest assured that if she regards you with the favour that you believe your troubles are at an end the barrier removes itself and you join hands the candle is going out shall we depart i perceive no reason why we should remain in truth we might have got out of it sooner you are right a cafe will be more cheerful suppose we take a bottle of wine together how does it strike you if you insist i will be your guest if not ah monsieur you will allow me the pleasure murmured tournicquot well well said beguinet you must have your way your rope you have no use for hein we shall leave it but certainly why should i burden myself the occasion has passed true good come my comrade let us descend who shall read the future awhile ago they had been strangers neither intending to quit the house alive now the pair issued from it jauntily arm in arm both were in high spirits and by the time the lamps of a cafe gave them welcome and the wine gurgled gaily into the glasses they pledged each other with a sentiment no less than fraternal how i rejoice that i have met you exclaimed beguinet to your marriage mon vieux to your joy fill up again a glass there are plenty of bottles in the cellar mon dieu you are my preserver i must embrace you never till now have i felt such affection for a man this evening all was black to me i despaired my heart was as heavy as a cannon ball and suddenly the world is bright roses bloom before my feet and the little larks are singing in the sky i dance i skip how beautiful how sublime is friendship better than riches than youth than the love of woman riches melt youth flies woman snores but friendship is again a glass it goes well this wine let us have a lobster i swear i have an appetite they make one peckish these suicides n'est ce pas i shall not be formal if you consider it your treat you shall pay a lobster and another bottle at your expense or mine ah the bill all in one declared tourniequot well well said beguinet you must have your way what a happy man i am already i feel twenty years younger you would not believe what i have suffered my agonies would fill a book really by nature i am domesticated but my home is impossible i shudder when i enter it it is only in a restaurant that i see a clean table cloth absolutely i pig all lucrece thinks about is frivolity no no protested tournicquot to that i cannot agree what do you know you 'cannot agree' you have seen her when she is laced in her stage costume when she prinks and prattles with the paint and the powder and her best corset on it is i who am 'behind the scenes' mon ami not you i see her dirty peignoir and her curl rags at four o'clock in the afternoon every day you 'cannot agree' curl rags faltered tournicquot but certainly i tell you i am of a gentle disposition i am most tolerant of women's failings it says much that i would have hanged myself rather than remain with a woman her untidiness is not all her toilette at home revolts my sensibilities but well one cannot have everything and her salary is substantial i have closed my eyes to the curl rags however snakes are more serious snakes ejaculated tournicquot naturally the beasts must live do they not support us but 'everything in its place' is my own motto the motto of my wife 'all over the place' her serpents have shortened my life word of honour they wander where they will i never lay my head beside those curl rags of hers without anticipating a cobra decapello under the bolster it is not everybody's money lucrece has no objection to them well it is very courageous very fortunate since snakes are her profession but i i was not brought up to snakes i am not at my ease in a zoological gardens it is natural is it not i desire to explain myself to you you understand are we not as brothers oh i realise well that when one loves a woman one always thinks that the faults are the husband's believe me i have had much to justify my attitude snakes dirt furies what a menage furies gasped tournicquot i am an honest man affirmed beguinet draining another bumper i shall not say to you 'i have no blemish i am perfect' not at all without doubt i have occasionally expressed myself to lucrece with more candour than courtesy such things happen but he refilled his glass and sighed pathetically but to every citizen whatever his position whether his affairs may have prospered or not his wife owes respect hein she should not throw the ragout at him she should not menace him with snakes he wept my friend you will admit that it is not gentil to coerce a husband with deadly reptiles tournicquot had turned very pale he signed to the waiter for the bill and when it was discharged sat regarding his companion with round eyes at last clearing his throat he said nervously after all do you know now one comes to think it over i am not sure upon my honour that our arrangement is feasible what exclaimed beguinet with a violent start not feasible how is that pray because i have opened my heart to you do you back out oh what treachery never will i believe you could be capable of it however it is a fact on consideration i shall not rob you of her base fellow you take advantage of my confidence a contract is a contract no stammered tournicquot i shall be a man and live my love down monsieur i have the honour to wish you 'good night' he stop cried beguinet infuriated what then is to become of me insolent poltroon you have even destroyed my rope the conspiracy for claudine once remarked tricotrin pitching his pen in the air there were four suitors for the most beautiful of her sex the first young man was a musician and he shut himself in his garret to compose a divine melody to be dedicated to her the second lover was a chemist who experimented day and night to discover a unique perfume that she alone might use the third who was a floriculturist aspired constantly among his bulbs to create a silver rose that should immortalise the lady's name and the fourth inquired pitou what did the fourth suitor do the fourth suitor waited for her every afternoon in the sunshine while the others were at work and married her with great eclat the moral of which is that instead of cracking my head to make a sonnet to claudine i shall be wise to put on my hat and go to meet her i rejoice that the denoument is arrived at pitou returned but it would be even more absorbing if i had previously heard of claudine miserable dullard cried the poet do you tell me that you have not previously heard of claudine she is the only woman i have ever loved a ah rejoined pitou certainly i have heard of her a thousand times only she has never been called 'claudine' before let us keep to the point said tricotrin claudine represents the devotion of a lifetime i think seriously of writing a tragedy for her to appear in i shall undertake to weep copiously at it if you present me with a pass affirmed pitou she is an actress then this claudine at what theatre is she blazing the montmartre how often i find occasion to lament that your imagination is no larger than the quartier claudine is not of montmartre at all at all my poor friend have you never heard that there are theatres on the grand boulevard ah so you betake yourself to haunts of fashion now i begin to understand why you have become so prodigal with the blacking for some time i have had the intention of reproaching you with your shoes our finances are not equal to such lustre ah when one truly loves money is no object said tricotrin however if it is time misspent to write a sonnet to her it is even more unprofitable to pass the evening justifying one's shoes and picking up his hat the poet ran down the stairs and made his way as fast as his legs would carry him to the comedie moderne he arrived at the stage door with no more than three minutes to spare and disposing himself in a graceful attitude waited for mademoiselle claudine hilairet to come out it might have been observed that his confidence deserted him while he waited for although it was perfectly true that he adored her he had omitted to add that the passion was not mutual he was conscious that the lady might resent his presence on the door step and in fact when she appeared she said nothing more tender than mon dieu again you what do you want how can you ask sighed the poet i came to walk home with you lest an electric train should knock you down at one of the crossings what a magnificent performance you have given this evening superb were you in the theatre in spirit my spirit which no official can exclude is present every night though sordid considerations force me to remain corporally in my attic transported by admiration i even burst into frantic applause there how perfect is the sympathy between our souls listen my little one she said i am sorry for your relatives if you have any your condition must be a great grief to them but all the same i cannot have you dangling after me and talking this bosh what do you suppose can come of it fame shall come of it averred the poet fame for us both do not figure yourself that i am a dreamer not at all i am practical a man of affairs are you content with your position in the comedie moderne no you are not you occupy a subordinate position you play the role of a waiting maid which is quite unworthy of your genius and understudy the ingenue who is a portly matron in robust health the opportunity to distinguish yourself appears to you as remote as mars do i romance or is it true it is true she said well well i propose to alter all this i i have the intention of writing a great tragedy and when it is accepted i shall stipulate that you and you alone shall thrill paris as my heroine when the work of my brain has raised you to the pinnacle for which you were born when the theatre echoes with our names i shall fall at your feet and you will murmur 'gustave i love thee' why does not your mother do something she asked is there nobody to place you where you might be cured a tragedy imbecile i am comedienne to the finger tips what should i do with your tragedy even if it were at the francais itself you are right said tricotrin i shall turn out a brilliant comedy instead and when the work of my brain has raised you to the pinnacle for which you were born when the theatre echoes with our names she interrupted him by a peal of laughter which disconcerted him hardly less than her annoyance it is impossible to be angry with you long she declared you are too comic also as a friend i do not object to you violently come i advise you to be content with what you can have instead of crying for the moon well i am not unwilling to make shift with it in the meantime returned tricotrin but friendship is a poor substitute for the heavens and we shall see what we shall see tell me now they mean to revive la curieuse at the comedie i hear what part in it have you been assigned ah exclaimed mademoiselle hilairet is it not always the same thing i dust the same decayed furniture with the same feather brush and i say 'yes' and 'no' and 'here is a letter madame' that is all i swear it is infamous cried the poet it amazes me that they fail to perceive that your gifts are buried one would suppose that managers would know better than to condemn a great artiste to perform such ignominious roles the critics also why do not the critics call attention to an outrage which continues year by year it appears to me that i shall have to use my influence with the press and so serious was the tone in which he made this boast that the fair claudine began to wonder if she had after all underrated the position of her out at elbows gallant your influence she questioned with an eager smile have you influence with the critics then we shall see what we shall see repeated tricotrin significantly i am not unknown in paris and i have your cause at heart i may make a star of you yet but while we are on the subject of astronomy one question when my services have transformed you to a star shall i still be compelled to cry for the moon mademoiselle hilairet's tones quivered with emotion as she murmured how grateful to him she would be and it was understood when he took leave of her that if he indeed accomplished his design his suit would be no longer hopeless the poet pressed her hand ardently and turned homeward in high feather and it was not until he had trudged a mile or so that the rapture in his soul began to subside under the remembrance that he had been talking through his hat in fact he admitted to pitou when the garret was reached my imagination took wings unto itself i am committed to a task beside which the labours of hercules were child's play the question now arises how this thing of which i spoke so confidently is to be effected what do you suggest i suggest that you allow me to sleep replied pitou for i shall feel less hungry then your suggestion will not advance us demurred tricotrin we shall on the contrary examine the situation in all its bearings listen claudine is to enact the waiting maid in la curieuse which will be revived at the comedie moderne in a fortnight's time she will dust the empire furniture and say 'yes' and 'no' with all the intellect and animation for which those monosyllables provide an opening have you grasped the synopsis so far good on the strength of this performance it has to be stated by the foremost dramatic critic in paris that she is an actress of genius now how is it to be done how shall we induce labaregue to write of her with an outburst of enthusiasm in la voix labaregue faltered pitou i declare the audacity of your notion wakes me up capital said tricotrin we are making progress already yes we must have labaregue it has never been my custom to do things by halves dramatically of course i should hold a compromising paper of labaregue's i should say 'monsieur the price of this document is an act of justice to mademoiselle claudine hilairet it is agreed good sit down you will write from my dictation' however said pitou however i anticipate your objection i do not hold such a paper therefore that scene is cut well let us find another where is your fertility of resource mon dieu why should i speak to him at all i do not figure myself that you will speak to him you will never get the chance precisely my own suspicion what follows instead of wasting my time seeking an interview which would not be granted and which would lead to nothing even if it were granted and which would lead to nothing even if it were granted as you point out instead of doing this it is evident that i must write labaregue's criticism myself hein ejaculated pitou sitting up in bed i confess that i do not perceive yet how it is to be managed but obviously it is the only course i must write what is to be said and la voix must believe that it has been written by labaregue come we are getting on famously we have now decided what we are to avoid by d'artagnan athos porthos and aramis cried pitou this will be the doughtiest adventure in which we have engaged you are right it is an adventure worthy of our steel pens we shall enlighten the public crown an artiste and win her heart by way of reward that is to say i shall win her heart by way of reward what your own share of the booty will be i do not recognize but i promise you at least a generous half of the dangers my comrade murmured pitou ever loyal but do you not think that la voix will smell a rat what about the handwriting it is a weak point which had already presented itself to me could i have constructed the situation to my liking labaregue would have the custom to type write his notices however as he is so inconsiderate as to knock them off in the cafe de l'europe he has not that custom and we must adapt ourselves to the circumstances that exist the probability is that a criticism delivered by the accredited messenger and signed with the familiar 'jl' will be passed without question the difference in the handwriting may be attributed to an amanuensis when the great man writes his next notice i shall make it my business to be taking a bock in the cafe de l'europe in order that i may observe closely what happens there is to be a repetition generale at the vaudeville on monday night on monday night therefore i hope to advise you of our plan of campaign now do not speak to me any more i am about to compose a eulogy on claudine for which labaregue will in due course receive the credit the poet fell asleep at last murmuring dithyrambic phrases and if you suppose that in the soberness of daylight he renounced his harebrained project it is certain that you have never lived with tricotrin in montmartre no indeed he did not renounce it on monday night or rather in the small hours of tuesday morning he awoke pitou with enthusiasm mon vieux he exclaimed the evening has been well spent i have observed and i have reflected when he quitted the vaudeville labaregue entered the cafe de l'europe seated himself at his favourite table and wrote without cessation for half an hour when his critique was finished he placed it in an envelope and commanded his supper all this time i sipping a bock leisurely accorded to his actions a scrutiny worthy of the secret police presently a lad from the office of la voix appeared he approached labaregue received the envelope and departed at this point my bock was finished i paid for it and sauntered out keeping the boy well in view his route to the office lay through a dozen streets which were all deserted at so late an hour but i remarked one that was even more forbidding than the rest a mere alley that seemed positively to have been designed for our purpose our course is clear we shall attack him in the rue des cendres really inquired pitou somewhat startled but really we will not shed his blood we will make him turn out his pockets and then disgusted by the smallness of the swag toss it back to him with a flip on the ear needless to say that when he escapes he will be the bearer of my criticism not of labaregue's he will have been too frightened to remark the exchange it is not bad your plan it is an inspiration but to render it absolutely safe we must have an accomplice why is he so powerful your boy no mon ami the boy is not so powerful but the alley has two ends i do not desire to be arrested while i am giving a lifelike representation of an apache i think we will admit lajeunie to our scheme as a novelist he should appreciate the situation if lajeunie keeps guard at one end of the alley while you stand at the other i can do the business without risk of being interrupted and removed to gaol it is true as a danger signal i shall whistle the first bars of my fugue good and we will arrange a signal with lajeunie also mon dieu will not claudine be amazed next day i shall not breathe a word to her in the meantime i shall let her open la voix without expectation and then ah what joy will be hers 'the success of the evening was made by the actress who took the role of the maidservant and who had perhaps six words to utter but with what vivacity with what esprit were they delivered every gesture every sparkle of the eyes betokened the comedienne for myself i ceased to regard the fatuous ingenue i forgot the presence of the famous leading lady i watched absorbed the facial play of this maidservant whose brains and beauty i predict will speedily bring paris to her feet' is that what you mean to write i shall improve upon it i am constantly improving that is why the notice is still unfinished it hampers me that i must compose in the strain of labaregue himself instead of allowing my eloquence to soar by the way we had better speak to lajeunie on the subject soon lest he should pretend that he has another engagement for that night he is a good boy lajeunie but he always pretends that he has engagements in fashionable circles the pair went to him the following day and when they had climbed to his garret found the young literary man in bed it shocks me said pitou to perceive that you rise so late lajeunie why are you not dashing off chapters of a romance mon dieu replied lajeunie i was making studies among the beau monde until a late hour last night at a reception and to complete my fatigue it was impossible to get a cab when i left naturally it happens to everybody when he lacks a cab fare said tricotrin now tell me have you any invitation from a duchess for next thursday evening thursday thursday repeated lajeunie thoughtfully no i believe that i am free for thursday now that is fortunate exclaimed tricotrin well we want you to join us on that evening my friend indeed we should be most disappointed if you could not put in pitou certainly i shall have much pleasure said lajeunie is it a supper no said tricotrin it is a robbery i shall explain doubtless you know the name of 'mademoiselle claudine hilairet' i have never heard it in my life is she in society society she is in the comedie moderne she is a great actress but like us all unrecognised my heart bleeds for her another comrade i was sure i could depend upon your sympathy well on thursday night they will revive la curieuse at the comedie and i myself propose to write labaregue's critique of the performance do you tumble it is a gallant action yes i grasp the climax but at present i do not perceive how the plot is to be constructed labaregue's notices are dispatched by messenger began pitou from the cafe de l'europe added tricotrin so much i know said lajeunie i shall attack the messenger and make a slight exchange of manuscripts tricotrin went on a blunder proclaimed lajeunie you show a lack of invention now be guided by me because i am a novelist and i understand these things the messenger is an escaped convict and you say to him 'i know your secret you do my bidding or you go back to the galleys i shall give you three minutes to decide' you stand before him stern dominant inexorable your watch in your hand it is at the pawn shop well well of course it is since when have you joined the realists somebody else's watch or a clock are there no clocks in paris you say 'i shall give you until the clock strikes the hour' that is even more literary you obtain the solemn note of the clock to mark the crisis but there is no convict demurred tricotrin there are clocks but there is no convict no convict the messenger is not a convict not at all he is an apple cheeked boy oh it is a rotten plot said lajeunie i shall not collaborate in it consider cried tricotrin do not throw away the chance of a lifetime think what i offer you you shall hang about the end of a dark alley and whistle if anybody comes how literary again is that you may develop it into a novel that will make you celebrated pitou will be at the other end i and the apple cheeked boy who is to die that is to say to be duped will occupy the centre of the stage i mean the middle of the alley and on the morrow when all paris rings with the fame of claudine hilairet i who adore her shall have won her heart humph said lajeunie well since the synopsis has a happy ending i consent but i make one condition i must wear a crepe mask without a crepe mask i perceive no thrill in my role madness objected pitou now listen to me i am serious minded and do not commit follies like you fellows crepe masks are not being worn this season believe me if you loiter at a street corner with a crepe mask on some passer by will regard you he may even wonder what you are doing there it might ruin the whole job pitou is right announced tricotrin after profound consideration well then said lajeunie you must wear a crepe mask put it on when you attack the boy i have always had a passion for crepe masks and this is the first opportunity that i find to gratify it i insist that somebody wears a crepe mask or i wash my hands of the conspiracy agreed in the alley it will do no harm indeed it will prevent the boy identifying me good on thursday night then in the meantime we shall rehearse the crime assiduously and you and pitou can practise your whistles with what diligence did the poet write each day now how lovingly he selected his superlatives never in the history of the press had such ardent care been lavished on a criticism truly it was not until thursday afternoon that he was satisfied that he could do no more he put the pages in his pocket and too impatient even to be hungry roamed about the quartier reciting to himself the most hyperbolic of his periods and dusk gathered over paris and the lights sprang out and the tense hours crept away it was precisely half past eleven when the three conspirators arrived at the doors of the comedie moderne and lingered near by until the audience poured forth labaregue was among the first to appear he paused on the steps to take a cigarette and stepped briskly into the noise and glitter of the boulevard the young men followed exchanging feverish glances soon the glow of the cafe de l'europe was visible the critic entered made a sign to a waiter and seated himself gravely at a table many persons gazed at him with interest to those who did not know habitues whispered there is labaregue see he comes to write his criticism on the revival of la curieuse labaregue affected unconsciousness of all this but secretly he lapped it up occasionally he passed his hand across his brow with a gesture profoundly intellectual few there remarked that at brief intervals three shabby young men strolled in who betrayed no knowledge of one another and merely called for bocks none suspected that these humble customers plotted to consign the celebrity's criticism to the flames without a sign of recognition taciturn and impassive the three young men waited their eyes bent upon the critic's movements by and by labaregue thrust his copy into an envelope that was provided some moments afterwards one of the young men asked another waiter for the materials to write a letter the paper he crumpled in his pocket in the envelope he placed the forged critique a quarter of an hour passed then a youth of about sixteen hurried in and made his way to labaregue's table at this instant lajeunie rose and left as the youth received the copy tricotrin also sauntered out when the youth again reached the door it was just swinging behind pitou the conspirators were now in the right order lajeunie pressing forward tricotrin keeping pace with the boy pitou a few yards in the rear the boy proceeded swiftly it was late and even the boulevard showed few pedestrians now in the side streets the quietude was unbroken tricotrin whipped on his mask at the opening of the passage when the messenger was half way through it the attack was made suddenly with determination fat one exclaimed the poet i starve give me five francs comment stammered the youth jumping i haven't five francs i give me all you have empty your pockets let me see if you obey i shall not harm you if you resist you are a dead boy the youth produced with trepidation a sou half a cigarette a piece of string a murderous clasp knife a young lady's photograph and labaregue's notice the next moment the exchange of manuscripts had been deftly accomplished devil take your rubbish cried the apache i want none of it there be off or i shall shoot you for wasting my time the whole affair had occupied less than a minute and the three adventurers skipped to montmartre rejoicing and how glorious was their jubilation in the hour when they opened la voix and read tricotrin's pronouncement over the initials jl there it was printed word for word the leading lady was dismissed with a line the ingenue received a sneer and for the rest the column was a panegyric of the waiting maid the triumph of the waiting maid was unprecedented and supreme certainly when labaregue saw the paper he flung round to the office furious but la voix did not desire people to know that it had been taken in so the matter was hushed up and labaregue went about pretending that he actually thought all those fine things of the waiting maid the only misfortune was that when tricotrin called victoriously upon claudine to clasp her in his arms he found her in hysterics on the sofa and it transpired that she had not represented the waiting maid after all on the contrary she had at the last moment been promoted to the part of the ingenue while the waiting maid had been played by a little actress whom she much disliked it is cruel it is monstrous it is heartrending gasped tricotrin when he grasped the enormity of his failure but light of my life why should you blame me for this villainy of labaregue's i do not know she said however you bore me you and your 'influence with the press' get out the doll in the pink silk dress how can i write the fourth act with this ridiculous thing posed among my papers what thing it is a doll in a pink silk dress an elaborate doll that walks and talks and warbles snatches from the operas a terrible lot it cost why does an old dramatist keep a doll on his study table i do not keep it there it came in a box from the boulevard an hour ago and i took it from its wrappings to admire its accomplishments again and ever since it has been reminding me that women are strange beings yes women are strange and this toy sets me thinking of one woman in particular that woman who sued supplicated for my help and then when she had all my interest confound the doll here is the incident just as it happened it happened when all paris flocked to see my plays and paul de varenne was a name to conjure with fashions change to day i am a little out of the running perhaps younger men have shot forward in those days i was still supreme i was master of the stage listen it was a spring morning and i was lolling at my study window scenting the lilac in the air maximin my secretary came in and said mademoiselle jeanne laurent asks if she can see you monsieur who is mademoiselle jeanne laurent i inquired she is an actress begging for an engagement monsieur i regret that i am exceedingly busy tell her to write the lady has already written a thousand times he mentioned going 'jeanne laurent' has been one of the most constant contributors to our waste paper basket then tell her that i regret i can do nothing for her mon dieu is it imagined that i have no other occupation than to interview nonentities by the way how is it you have bothered me about her why this unusual embassy i suppose she is pretty hein yes monsieur and young yes monsieur i wavered let us say my sympathy was stirred but perhaps the lilac was responsible lilac and a pretty girl seem to me a natural combination like coffee and a cigarette send her in i said i sat at the table and picked up a pen monsieur de varenne she paused nervously on the threshold maximin was a fool she was not pretty she was either plain or beautiful to my mind she had beauty and if she hadn't been an actress come to pester me for a part i should have foreseen a very pleasant quarter of an hour i can spare you only a moment mademoiselle i said ruffling blank paper it is most kind of you to spare me that i liked her voice too be seated i said more graciously monsieur i have come to implore you to do something for me i am breaking my heart in the profession for want of a helping hand will you be generous and give me a chance my dear mademoiselle er laurent i said i sympathise with your difficulties and i thoroughly understand them but i have no engagement to offer you i am not a manager she smiled bitterly you are de varenne a word from you would 'make' me i was wondering what her age was about eight and twenty i thought but alternately she looked much younger and much older you exaggerate my influence like every other artist that i consent to see hundreds have sat in that chair and cried that i could 'make' them it is all bosh be reasonable i cannot 'make' anybody you could cast me for a part in paris you are 'not a manager' but any manager will engage a woman that you recommend oh i know that hundreds appeal to you i know that i am only one of a crowd but monsieur think what it means to me without help i shall go on knocking at the stage doors of paris and never get inside i shall go on writing to the paris managers and never get an answer without help i shall go on eating my heart out in the provinces till i am old and tired and done for her earnestness touched me i had heard the same tale so often that i was sick of hearing it but this woman's earnestness touched me if i had had a small part vacant i would have tried her in it again i said as a dramatist i fully understand the difficulties of an actress's career but you as an actress do not understand a dramatist's there is no piece of mine going into rehearsal now therefore i have no opening for you myself and it is impossible for me to write to a manager or a brother author advising him to entrust a part even the humblest to a lady of whose capabilities i know nothing i am not applying for a humble part she answered quietly hein my line is lead i stared at her pale face speechless the audacity of the reply took my breath away you are mad i said rising i sound so to you monsieur stark staring mad you bewail that you are at the foot of the ladder and at the same instant you stipulate that i shall lift you at a bound to the top either you are a lunatic or you are an amateur she too rose resigned to her dismissal it seemed then suddenly with a gesture that was a veritable abandonment of despair she laughed that's it i am an amateur she rejoined passionately i will tell you the kind of 'amateur' i am monsieur de varenne i was learning my business in a fit up when i was six years old yes i was playing parts on the road when happier children were playing games in nurseries i was thrust on for lead when i was a gawk of fifteen and had to wrestle with half a dozen roles in a week and was beaten if i failed to make my points i have supered to stars not to earn the few francs i got by it for by that time the fit ups paid me better but that i might observe and improve my method i have waited in the rain for hours at the doors of the milliners and modistes that i might note how great ladies stepped from their carriages and spoke to their footmen and when i snatched a lesson from their aristocratic tones i was in heaven though my feet ached and the rain soaked my wretched clothes i have played good women and bad women beggars and queens ingenues and hags i was born and bred on the stage have suffered and starved on it it is my life and my destiny she sobbed an 'amateur' i could not let her go like that she interested me strongly somehow i believed in her i strode to and fro considering sit down again i said i will do this for you i will go to the country to see your performance when is your next show i have nothing in view bigre well the next time you are playing write to me you will have forgotten all about me she urged feverishly or your interest will have faded or fate will prevent your coming why do you say so something tells me you will help me now or you will never help me my chance is to day monsieur i entreat you to day i can do nothing at all because i have not seen you act i could recite to you zut i could rehearse on trial and if you made a mess of it a nice fool i should look after fighting to get you in a servant interrupted us to tell me that my old friend de lavardens was downstairs and now i did a foolish thing when i intimated to mademoiselle jeanne laurent that our interview must conclude she begged so hard to be allowed to speak to me again after my visitor went that i consented to her waiting why i had already said all that i had to say and infinitely more than i had contemplated perhaps she impressed me more powerfully than i realised perhaps it was sheer compassion for she had an invincible instinct that if i sent her away at this juncture she would never hear from me any more i had her shown into the next room and received general de lavardens in the study since his retirement from the army de lavardens had lived in his chateau at st wandrille in the neighbourhood of caudebec en caux and we had met infrequently of late but we had been at college together i had entered on my military service in the same regiment as he and we had once been comrades i was glad to see him how are you my dear fellow i didn't know you were in paris i have been here twenty four hours he said i have looked you up at the first opportunity now am i a nuisance be frank i told the servant that if you were at work you weren't to be disturbed don't humbug about it if i am in the way say so you are not in the way a bit i declared put your hat and cane down what's the news how is georges georges was captain de lavardens his son a young man with good looks and brains an officer for whom people predicted a brilliant future georges is all right he said hesitatingly he is dining with me to night i want you to come too if you can are you free to night yes certainly i shall be delighted that was one of the reasons i came round to ask you to join us he glanced towards the table again are you sure you are not in a hurry to get back to that have a cigar and don't be a fool what have you got to say for yourself why are you on the spree here i came up to see georges he said as a matter of fact my dear chap i am devilish worried not about georges i asked surprised he grunted about georges really i'm very sorry yes i wanted to talk to you about it you may be able to give me a tip georges the boy i hoped so much for his gruff voice quivered is infatuated with an actress georges what do you say to that are you certain it is true true he makes no secret of it that isn't all the idiot wants to marry her georges wants to marry an actress voila my dear old friend i stammered isn't it amazing one thinks one knows the character of one's own son hein and then suddenly a boy a boy a man georges will soon be thirty a man one is proud of who is distinguishing himself in his profession he loses his head about some creature of the theatre and proposes to mar his whole career as for that it might not mar it i said we are not in england in france gentlemen do not choose their wives from the stage i can speak freely to you you move among these people because your writing has taken you among them but you are not of their breed have you reasoned with him reasoned yes what did he say prepare to be amused he said that 'unfortunately the lady did not love him' what then there is no danger do you mean to say that it takes you in you may be sure her 'reluctance' is policy she thinks it wise to disguise her eagerness to hook him he told me plainly that he would not rest till he had won her it is a nice position the honour of the family is safe only till this adventuress consents consents to accept his hand what can i do i can retard the marriage by refusing my permission but i cannot prevent it if he summons me of course if i could arrange matters with her i would do it like a shot at any price who is she a nobody he tells me she is quite obscure i don't suppose you have ever heard of her but i thought you might make inquiries for me that you might ascertain whether she is the sort of woman we could settle with i will do all i can you may depend where is she in paris yes just now what's her name jeanne laurent my mouth fell open hein do you know her she is there what in the next room she just called on business mon dieu that's queer it's lucky it was the first time i had ever met her what's she like have you never seen her you shall do so in a minute she came to beg me to advance her professionally she wants my help this ought to save you some money my friend we'll have her in i shall tell her who you are how shall i talk to her leave it to me i crossed the landing and opened the salon door the room was littered with the illustrated journals but she was not diverting herself with any of them she was sitting before a copy of la joconde striving to reproduce on her own face the enigma of the smile i had discovered an actress who never missed an opportunity please come here she followed me back and my friend stood scowling at her this gentleman is general de lavardens i said she bowed slightly perfectly that bow acknowledged de lavardens' presence and rebuked the manner of my introduction with all the dignity of the patricians whom she had studied in the rain mademoiselle when my servant announced that the general was downstairs you heard the name you did not tell me that you knew his son dame non monsieur she murmured and when you implored me to assist you you did not tell me that you aspired to a marriage that would compel you to leave the stage i never waste my influence good morning i do not aspire to the marriage she faltered pale as death rubbish i know all about it of course it is your aim to marry him sooner or later and of course he will make it a condition that you cease to act well i have no time to help a woman who is playing the fool that's all about it i needn't detain you i have refused to marry him she gasped on my honour you can ask him it is a fact but you see him still broke in de lavardens wrathfully he is with you every day that is a fact too isn't it if your refusal is sincere why are you not consistent why do you want him at your side because monsieur she answered i am weak enough to miss him when he goes ah you admit it you profess to be in love with him no monsieur she dissented thoughtfully i am not in love with him and my refusal has been quite sincere incredible as it may seem that a woman like myself rejects a man like him i could never make a marriage that would mean death to my ambition i could not sacrifice my art the stage is too dear to me for that so it is evident that i am not in love with him for when a woman loves the man is dearer to her than all else de lavardens grunted i knew his grunts there was some apology in this one the position is not fair to my son he demurred you show good sense in what you say you are an artist you are quite right to devote yourself to your career but you reject and encourage him at the same time if he married you it would be disastrous to you and to him you would ruin his life and spoil your own enfin give him a chance to forget you send him away what do you want to keep seeing him for she sighed it is wrong of me i own it is highly unnatural said i no monsieur it is far from being unnatural and i will tell you why he is the only man i have ever known in all my vagabond life who realised that a struggling actress might have the soul of a gentlewoman before i met him i had never heard a man speak to me with courtesy excepting on the stage i had never known a man to take my hand respectfully when he was not performing behind the footlights i met him first in the country i was playing the queen in ruy blas and the manager brought him to me in the wings in everything he said and did he was different from others we were friends for months before he told me that he loved me his friendship has been the gift of god to brighten my miserable lot never to see him any more would be awful to me i perceived that if she was not in love with him she was so dangerously near to it that a trifle might turn the scale de lavardens had the same thought his glance at me was apprehensive however you acknowledge that you are behaving badly i exclaimed it is all right for you friendship is enough for you and you pursue your career but for him it is different he seeks your love and he neglects his duties for him to spend his life sighing for you would be monstrous and for him to marry you would be fatal if you like him so much be just to him set him free tell him that he is not to visit you any more he does not visit me he has never been inside my lodging well that he is not to write there that there are to be no more dinners drives bouquets and i do not let him squander money on me i am not that kind of woman we do not accuse you mademoiselle on the contrary we appeal to your good heart be considerate be brave say good bye to him you are asking me to suffer cruelly she moaned it is for your friend's benefit also the more you suffer the better you will act every actress should suffer monsieur i have served my apprenticeship to pain there are other things than friendship you have your prospects to think about what prospects she flashed back well i cannot speak definitely to day as you know but you would not find me unappreciative de lavardens grunted again emotionally this time i checked him with a frown what use would it be for me to refuse to see him she objected chokily when i am playing anywhere he can always see me i cannot kill his love by denying myself his companionship besides he would not accept the dismissal one night when i left the theatre i should find him waiting there again this was unpalatably true if a clever woman desires to dismiss a man she can dismiss him thoroughly especially a clever actress i said you could talk to him in such a fashion that he would have no wish to meet you again such things have been done what you want me to teach him to despise me much better if he did to turn his esteem to scorn hein it would be a generous action to falsify and degrade myself for your hero's good i will not do it she flamed you demand too much what have you done for me that i should sacrifice myself to please you i entreat your help and you give me empty phrases i cry that i despair this morning and you answer that by and by some time in the vague future you will remember that i exist i shall not do this for you i keep my friend your rhetoric has no weight with me i said i do not pretend that i have a claim on you in such circumstances a noble woman would take the course i suggest not for my sake not for the sake of general de lavardens but for the sake of the man himself you will 'keep your friend' bien but you will do so because you are indifferent to his welfare and too selfish to release him she covered her face there were tears on it the general and i exchanged glances again i went on you charge me with giving you only empty phrases that is undeserved i said all that was possible and i meant what i said i could not pledge myself to put you into anything without knowing what you are capable of doing but if you retain my good will i repeat that i will attend your next performance and then she queried then if i think well of it you shall have a good part lead bigre i cannot say that a good part in paris it is a promise emphatically if i think well of your performance of my next the very next part i play of the very next part you play she paused reflecting the pause lasted so long that it began to seem to my suspense as if none of us would ever speak again i took a cigarette and offered the box in silence to de lavardens he shook his head without turning it to me his gaze was riveted on the woman all right she groaned i agree ah good girl all you require is that captain de lavardens shall no longer seek me for his wife is that it that's it very well i know what would repel him it shall be done to night but you gentlemen will have to make the opportunity for me you will have to bring him to my place both of you you can find some reason for proposing it tonight at nine o'clock he knows the address she moved weakly to the door de lavardens took three strides and grasped her hands mademoiselle he stuttered i have no words to speak my gratitude i am a father and i love my son but mon dieu if if things had been different upon my soul i should have been proud to call you my daughter in law oh how she could bow that woman the eloquence of her ill fed form au revoir gentlemen she said phew we dropped into chairs paul he grunted at me we have been a pair of brutes i know it but you feel much relieved i feel another man what is she going to say to him i wish it were over i should find it devilish difficult to propose going to see her you know it will have to be your suggestion and supposing he won't take us he will take us right enough i declared and rejoice at the chance hourra hourra hourra i sprang up and clapped him on the back my friend if that woman had thrown herself away on georges it might have been a national calamity what he roared purpling oh no slight to georges i think i think i am afraid to say what i think i am afraid to think it i paced the room struggling to control myself only once in a blue moon jules there is a woman born of the people with a gift that is a blessing and a curse and her genius makes an epoch and her name makes theatrical history and if a lover of the stage like me discovers such a woman you stodgy old soldier and blazes her genius in his work he feels like cheops chephrenus and asychis rearing the pyramids for immortality my excitement startled him you believe she is a genius really i dare not believe i panted i refuse to let myself believe for i have never seen blue moons but but i wonder we dined at voisin's it had been arranged that he should make some allusion to the courtship and i said to georges i hope you don't mind your father having mentioned the subject to me we are old friends you know the topic was led up to very easily it was apparent that georges thought the world of her i admired the way he spoke it was quiet and earnest as i feigned partial sympathy with his matrimonial hopes i own that i felt a judas i too am an artist i said to me social distinctions naturally seem somewhat less important than they do to your father indeed monsieur he answered gravely mademoiselle laurent is worthy of homage if she were willing to accept me every man who knew her character would think me fortunate her education has not qualified her to debate with professors and she has no knowledge of society small talk but she is intelligent and refined and good it was child's play a sudden notion over the liqueurs take us to see her come along mon ami astonishment amateurish persuasion masterly georges's diffidence to intrude but his obvious delight at the thought of the favourable impression she would create he had never called there yet it would be very unconventional at such an hour zut among artists my card will be a passport i assure you poor fellow the trap made short work of him at half past eight we were all rattling to the left bank in a cab the cab stopped before a dilapidated house in an unsavoury street i knew that the aspect of her home went to his heart mademoiselle laurent has won no prize in her profession he observed and she is an honest girl well said in the dim passage a neglected child directed us to the fourth floor on the fourth floor a slattern who replied at last to our persistent tapping told us shortly that mademoiselle was out i realised that we had committed the error of being before our time and the woman evidently unprepared for our visit did not suggest our going in it seemed bad stage management will it be long before mademoiselle is back i inquired annoyed mais non we will wait i said and we were admitted sulkily to a room of which the conspicuous features were a malodorous lamp and a brandy bottle i had taken the old drab for a landlady rather the worse for liquor but more amiably she remarked now it's a pity jeanne didn't know you were coming at the familiar jeanne i saw georges start mademoiselle is a friend of yours i asked dismayed a friend she is my daughter she sat down by design the girl was out the thought flashed on me it flashed on me that she had plotted for her lover to learn what a mother in law he would have the revelation must appal him i stole a look his face was blanched the general drew a deep breath and nodded to himself the nod said plainly he is saved thank god will you take a little drop while you are waiting gentlemen nothing for us thank you she drank alone and seemed to forget that we were present none of us spoke i began to wonder if we need remain then drinking she grew garrulous it was of jeanne she talked she gave us her maternal views and incidentally betrayed infamies of her own career i am a man of the world but i shuddered at that woman the suitor who could have risked making her child his wife would have been demented or sublime and while she maundered on gulping from her glass and chuckling at her jests the ghastliness of it was that in the gutter face before us i could trace a likeness to jeanne i think georges must have traced it too the menace of heredity was horrible we were listening to jeanne wrecked jeanne thirty years older jeanne as she might become ciel to choose a bride with this blood in her a bride from the dregs let us go georges i murmured courage you will forget her we'll be off he was livid i saw that he could bear no more but the creature overheard and in those bleary eyes intelligence awoke what hold on she stammered is one of you the toff that wants to marry her ah i've been letting on finely haven't i it was a plant was it you've come here ferreting and spying she turned towards me in a fury you certainly i had made a comment from time to time but i could not see why she should single me out for her attack she lurched towards me savagely her face was thrust into mine and then so low that only i could hear and like another woman she breathed a question can i act jeanne herself every nerve in me jumped the next instant she was back in her part railing at georges i took a card from my case and scribbled six words when your daughter comes in give her that i said i had scribbled i write you a star role she gathered the message at a glance and i swear that the moroseness of her gaze was not lightened by so much as a gleam she was representing a character the actress sustained the character even while she read words that were to raise her from privation to renown not that i care if i have queered her chance she snarled a good job too the selfish cat i've got nothing to thank her for serve her right if you do give her the go by my jackanapes i don't blame you madame laurent georges answered sternly and his answer vibrated through the room i have never admired pitied or loved jeanne so much as now that i know that she has been motherless all three of us stood stone still the first to move was she i saw what was going to happen she burst out crying it's i jeanne i love you i thought i loved the theatre best i was wrong instinctively she let my card fall to the ground forgive me i did it for your sake too it was cruel i am ashamed oh my own if my love will not disgrace you take me for your wife in all the world there is no woman who will love you better in all my heart there is no room for anything but you they were in each other's arms de lavardens whom the proclamation of identity had electrified dragged me outside the big fool was blubbering with sentiment this is frightful he grunted atrocious said i but she is a woman in a million she is a great actress i said reverently i could never approve the marriage he faltered what do you think out of the question i have no sympathy with either of them you humbug why there is a tear running down your nose there are two running down yours i snapped a general should know better and why has the doll in the pink silk dress recalled this to me well you see to morrow will be new year's day and the doll is a gift for my godchild and the name of my godchild's mother is jeanne de lavardens oh i have nothing to say against her as a mother the children idolise her i admit that she has conquered the general and that georges is the proudest husband in france but when i think of the parts i could have written for her of the lustre the stage has lost when i reflect that just to be divinely happy the woman deliberately declined a worldwide fame morbleu i can never forgive her for it never the darling the last effect jean bourjac was old and lazy why should he work any more in his little cottage he was content enough if the place was not precisely gay could he not reach paris for a small sum and if he had no neighbours to chat with across the wall weren't there his flowers to tend in the garden occasionally because one cannot shake off the interests of a lifetime he indulged in an evening at the folies bergere or olympia curious to witness some illusion that had made a hit at such times old bourjac would chuckle and wag his head sagely for he saw no illusions now to compare with those invented by himself when he was in the business and there were many persons who admitted that he had been supreme in his line at the folies bergere he was often recognised and addressed as maitre one summer evening when old bourjac sat reading le journal margot the housekeeper who had grown deaf and ancient in his service announced a stranger she was a girl with a delicate oval face and eyes like an angel's monsieur bourjac she began as if reciting a speech that she had studied i have come out here to beg a favour of you i thirst for a career behind the footlights alas i cannot sing or dance or act there is only one chance for me to possess an illusion that shall take paris by storm i am told that there is nothing produced to day fit to hold a candle to the former 'miracles bourjac' will you help me will you design for me the most wonderful illusion of your life mademoiselle said bourjac with a shrug i have retired i implore you she urged but i have not finished i am poor i am employed at a milliner's i could not pay down a single franc my offer is a share of my salary as a star i am mad for the stage it is not the money that i crave for but the applause i would not grudge you even half my salary oh monsieur it is in your power to lift me from despair into paradise say you consent bourjac mused her offer was very funny if she had been of the ordinary type he would have sent her packing with a few commercial home truths excitement had brought a flush to the oval face her glorious eyes awoke in him emotions which he had believed extinct she was so captivating that he cast about him for phrases to prolong the interview though he could not agree he didn't want her to go yet and when she did rise at last he murmured well well see me again and we will talk about it i have no wish to be hard you understand her name was laure she was in love with a conjurer a common flashy fellow who gave his mediocre exhibitions of legerdemain at such places as le jardin exterieur and had recently come to lodge at her mother's she aspired to marry him but did not dare to expect it her homage was very palpable and monsieur eugene legrand who had no matrimonial intentions would often wish that the old woman did not keep such a sharp eye upon her needless to say bourjac's semi promise sent her home enraptured she had gone to him on impulse without giving her courage time to take flight now in looking back she wondered at her audacity and that she had gained so much as she had i have no wish to be hard he had said oh the old rascal admired her hugely if she coaxed enough he would end by giving in what thumping luck she determined to call upon him again on sunday and to look her best bourjac however did not succumb on sunday fascinating as he found her he squirmed at the prospect of the task demanded of him his workshop in the garden had been closed so long that rats had begun to regard it as their playroom the more he contemplated resuming his profession the less inclined he felt to do it she paid him many visits and he became deeply infatuated with her yet he continued to maintain that he was past such an undertaking that she had applied to him too late then one day after she had flown into a passion and wept and been mollified he said hesitatingly i confess that an idea for an illusion has occurred to me but i do not pledge myself to execute it i should call it 'a life' an empty cabinet is examined it is supported by four columns there is no stage trap no obscurity no black velvet curtain concealed in the dark to screen the operations the cabinet is raised high above the ground and the lights are full up you understand some of the inventor's enthusiasm had crept into his voice you understand go on she said holding her breath listen the door of the cabinet is slammed and in letters of fire there appears on it 'scene i' instantly it flies open again and discloses a baby the baby moves it wails in fine it is alive slam letters of fire 'scene ii' instantly the baby has vanished in its place is a beautiful girl you you smile triumphantly at your reflection in a mirror your path is strewn with roses the world is at your feet slam 'scene iii' in a moment twenty years have passed your hair is grey you are matronly stout your face is no longer oval yet unmistakably it is you yourself the same woman slam 'scene iv' you are enfeebled a crone toothless tottering on a stick once more it is the last effect the door flies open and reveals a skeleton you can make this she questioned i could make it if i chose he answered will you it depends on what on you take any share you want she cried i will sign anything you like after all would not the success be due to you so you begin to see that said the old man drily but i repeat it depends in spite of everything you may think my terms too high what do you want me to do she stammered marry me said bourjac he did not inquire if she had any affection for him he knew that if she said yes it would be a lie but he adored this girl who of a truth had nothing but her beauty to recommend her and he persuaded himself that his devotion would evoke tenderness in her by degrees she found the price high indeed not only was she young enough to be his granddaughter she had given her fancy to another man immediately she could not consent when she took leave of him it was understood that she would think the offer over and she went home and let legrand hear that bourjac had proposed for her hand if by any chance the news piqued legrand into doing likewise but legrand said nothing to the point though he was a little chagrined by the intelligence it never even entered his mind to attempt to cut the inventor out how should it she was certainly an attractive girl but as to marrying her he thought bourjac a fool as for himself if he married at all it would be an artist who was drawing a big salary and who would be able to provide him with some of the good things of life i pray you will be very happy mademoiselle he said putting on a sentimental air so after she had cried with mortification laure promised to be old bourjac's wife a few weeks later they were married and in that lonely little cottage she would have been bored to death but for the tawdry future that she foresaw the man's dream of awakening her tenderness was speedily dispelled he had been accepted as the means to an end and he was held fast to the compact she grudged him every hour in which he idled by her side driven from her arms by her impatience old bourjac would toil patiently in the workroom planning failing surmounting obstacles atom by atom for the sake of a woman whose sole interest in his existence was his progress with the illusion that was to gratify her vanity he worshipped her still if he had not worshipped her he would sooner or later have renounced the scheme as impracticable only his love for her supported him in the teeth of the impediments that arose of these she heard nothing for one reason her interest was so purely selfish that she had not even wished to learn how the cabinet was to be constructed all those figures gave her a headache she declared for another when early in the winter he had owned himself at a deadlock she had sneered at him as a duffer who was unable to fulfil his boasts old bourjac never forgot that his reputation was very dear to him he did not speak to her of his difficulties again but they often talked of the success she was to achieve she liked to go into a corner of the parlour and rehearse the entrance that she would make to acknowledge the applause it will be the great moment she would say when i reappear as myself and bow no it will be expected that will not surprise anybody bourjac would insist the climax the last effect will be the skeleton it was the skeleton that caused him the most anxious thought of all in order to compass it he almost feared that he would be compelled to sacrifice one of the preceding scenes the babe the girl the matron the crone for all these his mechanism provided but the skeleton the last effect baffled his ingenuity laure began to think his task eternal ever since the wedding she had dilated proudly to her mother and legrand on her approaching debut and it angered her that she could never say when the debut was to be now that there need be no question of his marrying her legrand's manner towards her had become more marked she went to the house often one afternoon when she rang the door was opened by him he explained that the old woman was out marketing laure waited in the kitchen and the conjurer sat on the table talking to her how goes the illusion he asked oh big she said it's going to knock them i can tell you her laugh was rather derisive it's a rum world the shop girl will become an artist with a show that draws all paris we expect to open at the folies bergere she knew that legrand could never aspire to an engagement at the folies bergere as long as he lived i hope you will make a hit he said understanding her resentment perfectly you did not foresee me a star turn hein he gave a shrug how could i foresee if you had not married bourjac of course it would not have happened i suppose not she murmured she was sorry he realised that she would have liked him to feel that she might have had the illusion anyhow and been a woman worth his winning indeed added legrand pensively rolling a cigarette you have done a great deal to obtain a success it is not every girl who would go to such lengths what she coloured indignantly i mean it is not every girl who would break the heart of a man who loved her they looked in each other's eyes for a moment then she turned her head scornfully away why do you talk rot to me do you take me for a kid he decided that a pained silence would be most effective if you cared about me why didn't you say so she flashed putting the very question he had hoped for because my position prevented it he sighed i could not propose a poor devil like me do i lodge in an attic from choice but you are the only woman i ever wanted for my wife after a pause she said softly i never knew you cared i shall never care for anybody else he answered and then her mother came in with the vegetables it is easy to believe what one wishes and she wished to believe legrand's protestations she began to pity herself profoundly feeling that she had thrown away the substance for the shadow in the sentimentality to which she yielded even the prospect of being a star turn failed to console her and during the next few weeks she invented reasons for visiting at her mother's more frequently than ever after these visits legrand used to smirk to himself in his attic he reflected that the turn would probably earn a substantial salary for a long time to come if he persuaded her to run away with him when the show had been produced it would be no bad stroke of business for him accordingly in their conversations he advised her to insist on the illusion being her absolute property one can never tell what may occur he would say if the managers arranged with bourjac not with you you would always be dependent on your husband's whims for your engagements and affecting unconsciousness of his real meaning the woman would reply that's true yes i suppose it would be best yes i shall have all the engagements made with me but by degrees even such pretences were dropped between them they spoke plainly he had the audacity to declare that it tortured him to think of her in old bourjac's house old bourjac who plodded all day to minister to her caprice she no less shameless acknowledged that her loneliness there was almost unendurable so legrand used to call upon her to cheer her solitude and while bourjac laboured in the workroom the lovers lolled in the parlour and talked of the future they would enjoy together when his job was done see monsieur your luncheon mumbled margot carrying a tray into the workroom on his busiest days and madame has madame her luncheon shouted bourjac margot was very deaf indeed madame entertains monsieur legrand again returned the housekeeper who was not blind as well bourjac understood the hint and more than once he remonstrated with his wife but she looked in his eyes and laughed suspicion out of him for the time eugene was an old friend whom she had known from childhood enfin if jean objected she would certainly tell him not to come so often it was very ridiculous however and afterwards she said to legrand we must put up with him in the meanwhile be patient darling we shall not have to worry about what he thinks much longer then as if to incense her more bourjac was attacked by rheumatism before the winter finished he could move only with the greatest difficulty and took to his bed day after day he lay there and she fumed at the sight of him passive under the blankets while his work was at a standstill more than ever the dullness got on her nerves now especially as legrand had avoided the house altogether since the complaint about the frequency of his visits he was about to leave paris to fulfil some engagements in the provinces it occurred to her that it would be a delightful change to accompany him for a week she had formerly had an aunt living in rouen and she told bourjac that she had been invited to stay with her for a few days bourjac made no objection only as she hummed gaily over her packing he turned his old face to the wall to hide his tears her luggage was dispatched in advance and by legrand's counsel it was labelled at the last minute with an assumed name if he could have done so without appearing indifferent to her society legrand would have dissuaded her from indulging in the trip for he had resolved now to be most circumspect until the illusion was inalienably her own as it was he took all the precautions possible they would travel separately he was to depart in the evening and laure would follow by the next train when she arrived he would be awaiting her with the removal of her trunk her spirits rose higher still but the day passed slowly at dusk she sauntered about the sitting room wishing that it were time for her to start she had not seen legrand since the previous afternoon when they had met at a cafe to settle the final details when the clock struck again she reckoned that he must be nearly at his destination perhaps he was there already pacing the room as she paced this one she laughed not a tinge of remorse discoloured the pleasure of her outlook her au revoir to her husband was quite careless the average woman who sins longs to tear out her conscience for marring moments which would otherwise be perfect this woman had absolutely no conscience the shortest route to the station was by the garden gate as she raised the latch she was amazed to see legrand hurriedly approaching thank goodness i have caught you he exclaimed i nearly went round to the front what has happened nothing serious i am not going that is all they have changed my date the matter has been uncertain all day or i would have let you know earlier it is lucky i was in time to prevent your starting she was dumb with disappointment it is a nuisance about your luggage he went on we must telegraph about it don't look so down in the mouth we shall have our trip next week instead what am i to say to jean he will think it so strange i have said good bye to him oh you can find an excuse you 'missed your train' come out for half an hour and we can talk his glance fell on the workroom is that fastened up i don't know do you want to see what he has done i may as well he had never had an opportunity before bourjac had always been in there no it isn't locked she said come on then wait till i have shut it after us before you strike a match margot might see the light a rat darted across their feet as they lit the lamp and he dropped the matchbox ugh the beastly things she shivered make haste on the floor stood a cabinet that was not unlike a gloomy wardrobe in its outward aspect legrand examined it curiously too massive he remarked it will cost a fortune for carriage and where are the columns i heard of he stepped inside and sounded the walls humph of course i see his idea the fake is a very old one but it is always effective really he knew nothing about it but as he was a conjurer she accepted him as an authority show me is there room for us both she said getting in after him and as she got in the door slammed instantaneously they were in darkness black as pitch jammed close together their four hands flew all over the door at once but they could touch no handle the next moment some revolving apparatus that had been set in motion flung them off their feet round and round it swirled striking against their bodies and their faces they grovelled to escape it but in that awful darkness their efforts were futile they could not even see its shape stop it she gasped i don't know how he panted after a few seconds the whir grew fainter the gyrations stopped automatically she wiped the blood from her face and burst into hysterical weeping the man cursing horribly rapped to find the spring that she must have pressed as she entered it seemed to them both that there could be no spot he did not rap a thousand times but the door never budged his curses ceased he crouched by her snorting with fear what shall we do she muttered he did not answer her eugene let us stamp perhaps the spring is in the floor still he paid no heed he was husbanding his breath when a minute had passed she felt his chest distend and a scream broke from him help mon dieu she clutched him panic stricken we mustn't be found here it would ruin everything feel for the spring eugene feel for the spring don't call help don't you understand jean will guess it will be the end of my hopes i shall have no career i have myself to think about he whimpered and pushing away her arms he screamed again and again but there was no one to hear him no neighbours no one passing in the fields none but old bourjac and deaf margot beyond earshot in the house the cabinet was of course ventilated and the danger was not suffocation but that they would be jammed here while they slowly starved to death soon her terror of the fate grew all powerful in the woman and though she loathed him for having been the first to call she too shrieked constantly for help now by turns legrand would yell distraught and heave himself helplessly against the door they were so huddled that he could bring no force to bear upon it in their black pent prison like a coffin on end the night held a hundred hours the matchbox lay outside where it had fallen and though they could hear his watch ticking in his pocket they were unable to look at it after the watch stopped they lost their sense of time altogether they disputed what day of the week it was their voices had been worn to whispers now they croaked for help in the workroom the rats missed the remains of old bourjac's luncheons the rats squeaked ravenously as she strove to scream with the voice that was barely audible she felt that she could resign herself to death were she but alone she could not stir a limb nor draw a breath apart from the man she craved at last less ardently for life than for space the relief of escaping even for a single moment from the oppression of contact it became horrible the contact as revolting as if she had never loved him the ceaseless contact maddened her the quaking of his body the clamminess of his flesh the smell of his person poisoning the darkness seemed to her the eternities of hell bourjac lay awaiting his wife's return for more than a fortnight then he sent for her mother and learnt that the aunt in rouen had been buried nearly three years the old man was silent it is a coincidence added the visitor hesitatingly that monsieur legrand has also disappeared people are always ringing my bell to inquire where he is as soon as he was able to rise bourjac left for paris and as the shortest route to the station was by the garden gate he passed the workroom on his way he nodded thinking of the time that he had wasted there but he did not go inside he was too impatient to find laure and incidentally to shoot legrand though his quest failed he never went back to the cottage he could not have borne to live in it now he tried to let it but the little house was not everybody's money and it stood empty for many years indeed before it was reoccupied bourjac was dead and forgotten when the new owners planned their renovations they had the curiosity to open a mildewed cabinet in an outhouse and uttered a cry of dismay not until then was the last effect attained but there were two skeletons instead of one an invitation to dinner the creators of eau d'enfer invited designs for a poster calling the attention of the world to their liqueur's incomparable qualities it occurred to theodose goujaud that this was a first class opportunity to demonstrate his genius for an article with such a glistening name it was obvious that a poster must be flamboyant one could not advertise a water of hell by a picture of a village maiden plucking cowslips and goujaud passed wakeful nights devising a sketch worthy of the subject he decided at last upon a radiant brunette sharing a bottle of the liqueur with his satanic majesty while she sat on his knee but where was the girl to be found though his acquaintance with the models of paris was extensive he could think of none with a face to satisfy him one girl's arms wreathed themselves before his mind another girl's feet were desirable but the face which was of supreme importance eluded his most frenzied search mon dieu groaned goujaud here i am projecting a poster that would conquer paris and my scheme is frustrated by the fact that nature fails to produce women equal to the heights of my art it is such misfortunes as this that support the morgue i recommend you to travel said tricotrin a tour in the east might yield your heart's desire it's a valuable suggestion rejoined goujaud i should like a couple of new shirts also but i lack the money to acquire them well said tricotrin the ball of the willing hand is nearer try that goujaud looked puzzled the ball of the willing hand he repeated i do not know any ball of the willing hand is it possible cried the poet where do you live why the willing hand my recluse is the most fascinating resort in paris i have been familiar with it for fully a week it is a bal de barriere where the criminal classes enjoy their brief leisure every saturday night they frisk the cut throats' quadrille is a particularly sprightly measure and the damsels there are often striking and their escorts too if one of the willing hands planted a knife in my back there would be no sprightliness about me in the interests of art one must submit to a little annoyance come if you are conscientious i will introduce you to the place and give you a few hints for example the company have a prejudice against collars and assuming for a moment that you possessed more than a franc you would do well to leave the surplus at home goujaud expanded his chest as a matter of fact he announced languidly i possess five hundred francs and so dignified was his air that tricotrin came near to believing him you possess five hundred francs you how no such things do not occur besides you mentioned a moment since that you were short of shirts it is true that i am short of shirts but nevertheless i have five hundred francs in my pocket it is like this my father who is not artistic has always desired to see me renounce my profession and sink to commerce well i was at the point of yielding man cannot live by hope alone and my pictures were strangely unappreciated then while consent trembled on my lips up popped this eau d'enfer i saw my opportunity i recognised that of all men in paris i was the best qualified to execute the poster you may divine the sequel i addressed my father with burning eloquence i persuaded him to supply me with the means to wield my brush for a few months longer if my poster succeeds i become a celebrity if it fails i become a petrole merchant this summer decides my fate in the meanwhile i am a capitalist but it would be madness for me to purchase shirts for i shall require every son to support existence until the poster is acclaimed you have a practical head exclaimed tricotrin admiringly i foresee that you will go far let us trust that the willing hand will prove the ante chamber to your immortality i have no faith in your willing hand demurred the painter the criminal classes are not keen on sitting for their portraits the process has unpleasant associations to them think again i can spare half an hour this morning evolve a further inspiration on the subject do you imagine i have nothing to do but to provide you with a model my time is fully occupied i am engaged upon a mystical play which is to be called the spinster's prayer or the goblin child's mother and take paris by storm a propos yes now i come to think of it there is something in comoedia there that might suit you my preserver returned goujaud what is it tricotrin picked the paper up and read wanted a hundred ladies for the stage beauty more essential than talent no dilapidations need apply agence lavalette rue baba thursday to mon dieu now you are beginning to talk said goujaud a hundred one among them should be suitable hein but all the same he hesitated 'twelve to five' it will be a shade monotonous standing on a doorstep from twelve to five especially if the rain streams do you expect a cleopatra to call at your attic or to send an eighty horse power automobile that you may cast your eye over her anyhow there may be a cafe opposite you can order a bock on the terrace and make it last you are right i shall go and inspect the spot at once a hundred beauties i declare the advertisement might have been framed to meet my wants how fortunate that you chanced to see it to morrow evening you shall hear the result dine with me at the bel avenir at eight o'clock for one occasion i undertake to go a buster i should be lacking in gratitude if i neglected to stuff you to the brim oh my dear chap said tricotrin the invitation is a godsend i have not viewed the inside of a restaurant for a week while our pal pitou is banqueting with his progenitors in chartres i have even exhausted my influence with the fishmonger i did not so much as see my way to a nocturnal herring in the garret mind you are not late i shall come prepared to do justice to your hospitality i promise you right cocky said the artist and he set forth in high spirits to investigate the rue baba he was gratified to discover a cafe in convenient proximity to the office and twelve o'clock had not sounded next day when he took a seat at one of the little white topped tables his gaze bent attentively upon the agent's step for the earliest arrival he had not long to wait a dumpy girl with an enormous nose approached swinging her sac a main she cast a complacent glance at the name on the door opened the bag whipped out a powder puff and vanished morbleu thought the painter if she is a fair sample i have squandered the price of a bock he remained in a state of depression for two or three minutes and then the girl reappeared evidently in a very bad temper ah he mused rubbing his hands monsieur lavalette is plainly a person of his word no beauty no engagement this is going to be all right where is the next applicant a sip to venus venus however did not irradiate the street yet the second young woman was too short in the back and at sight of her features he shook his head despondently no good my dear he said to himself little as you suspect it there is a disappointment for you inside word of honour within three minutes i shall behold you again and sure enough she made her exit promptly looking as angry as the other i am becoming a dramatic prophet soliloquised goujaud if i had nothing more vital to do i might win drinks betting on their chances with the proprietor of the cafe however i grow impatient for the bevy of beauty it is a long time on the road as if in obedience to his demand girls now began to trip into the rue baba so rapidly that he was kept busy regarding them by twos and threes and in quartettes they tripped tall girls little girls plain girls pretty girls girls shabby and girls chic but though many of them would have made agreeable partners at a dance there was none who possessed the necessary qualifications for the girl on satan's knee he rolled a cigarette and blew a pessimistic puff another day lost groaned goujaud all is over i feel it posterity will never praise my poster the clutch of commerce is upon me already the smell of the petrole is in my nostrils and scarcely had he said it when his senses reeled for stepping from a cab disdainfully imperially was his ideal her hair revealing the lobes of the daintiest ears that ever listened to confessions of love had the gleam of purple grapes her eyes were a mystery her mouth was a flower her neck was an intoxication so violently was the artist affected that during several moments he forgot his motive for being there to be privileged merely to contemplate her was an ecstasy while he sat transfixed with admiration her dainty foot graced the agent's step and she entered goujaud caught his breath and rose the cab had been discharged dared he speak to her when she came out it would be a different thing altogether from speaking to the kind of girl that he had foreseen but to miss such a model for lack of nerve that would be the regret of a lifetime now the prospect of the poster overwhelmed him and he felt that he would risk any rebuff commit any madness to induce her to sit the estimate that he had by this time formed of monsieur lavalette's taste convinced him that her return would not be yet he sauntered to and fro composing a preliminary and winning phrase what was his surprise after a very few seconds to see that she had come out already and was hastening away he overtook her in a dozen strides and with a bow that was eloquent of his homage exclaimed mademoiselle hein she said turning oh it's all right there are too many people there i've changed my mind i shan't wait he understood that she took him for a minion of the agent's and he hesitated whether to correct her mistake immediately however candour seemed the better course i do not bring a message from monsieur lavalette mademoiselle he explained no no what then i have ventured to address you on my own account on a matter of the most urgent importance i have no small change she said curtly making to pass mademoiselle his outraged dignity was superb you mistake me first for an office boy and then for a beggar i am a man of means though my costume may be unconventional my name is theodosc goujaud her bow intimated that the name was not significant but her exquisite eyes had softened at the reference to his means for weeks i have been seeking a face for a picture that i have conceived he went on a face of such peculiar beauty that i despaired of finding it i had the joy to see you enter the agency and i waited trembling with the prayer that i might persuade you to come to my aid mademoiselle will you do me the honour to allow me to reproduce the magic of your features on my canvas i entreat it of you in the sacred name of art during this appeal the lady's demeanour had softened more still a faint smile hovered on her lips her gaze was half gratified half amused oh you're a painter she said you want me to sit to you for the salon i don't know i'm sure it is not precisely for the salon he acknowledged but i am absorbed by the scheme it will be the crown of my career i will explain it is a long story if if we could sit down where there appears to be a cafe close to the agency said goujaud timidly oh she dismissed the cafe's pretensions with her eyebrows you are right he stammered now that i look at it again i see that it is quite a common place well will you permit me to walk a little way with you we will go to breakfast at armenonville if you like she said graciously where you can explain to me at your leisure it seemed to goujaud that his heart dropped into his stomach and turned to a cannon ball there armenonville what would such a breakfast cost perhaps a couple of louis never in his life had he contemplated breakfasting at armenonville she smiled as if taking his consent for granted her loveliness and air of fashion confused him dreadfully and if he made excuses there would be no poster oh he must seize the chance at any price oh course i shall be enchanted he mumbled and before he half realised that the unprecedented thing had happened they were rattling away side by side in a fiacre it was astounding it was breathless it was an episode out of a novel but goujaud felt too sick in thinking of the appalling expense to enjoy his sudden glory accustomed to a couple of louis providing meals for three weeks he was stupefied by the imminence of scattering the sum in a brief half hour even the cab fare weighed upon him he not infrequently envied the occupants of omnibuses it was clear that the lady herself was no stranger to the restaurant while he blinked bewildered on the threshold she was referring to her pet table and calling a waiter jules the menu was a fresh embarrassment to the bohemian but she and the deferential waiter relieved him of that speedily and in five minutes an epicurean luncheon had been ordered and he was gulping champagne it revived his spirits since he had tumbled into the adventure of his life by all means let him savour the full flavour of it his companion's smiles had become more frequent her eyes were more transcendental still how funnily things happen she remarked presently i had not the least idea of calling on lavalette when i got up this morning if i had not had a tiff with somebody and decided to go on the stage to spite him i should never have met you oh you are not on the stage yet then no but i have often thought about it and the quarrel determined me so i jumped into a cab drove off and then well there was such a crowd of girls there and they looked so vulgar i changed my mind can an angel quarrel demanded goujaud sentimentally i cannot imagine you saying an angry word to anyone oh she laughed can't i though i'm a regular demon when i'm cross people shouldn't vex me certainly not he agreed and no one but a brute would do so besides some women are attractive even in a rage on the whole i think i should like to see you in a rage with me providing always that you 'made it up' as nicely as i should wish do you fancy that i could she asked looking at the table cloth my head swims in fancying her laughter rippled again and her fascination was so intense that the poor fellow could scarcely taste a mouthful of his unique repast talk to me she commanded sensibly i mean where do you live i am living in the rue ravignan the rue ravignan where is that montmartre oh really she seemed chilled it is not a very nice quarter in the daytime is it my studio suits me murmured goujaud perceiving his fall in her esteem for that reason i am reluctant to remove an artist becomes very much attached to his studio and what do i care for fashion i you may judge by my coat you're eccentric aren't you hitherto i have lived only for art but now i begin to realise that there may be something more potent and absorbing still what is that love added goujaud feeling himself the embodiment of all the heroes of romance oh her glance mocked encouraged i am dying to hear about your picture though what is the subject it is not exactly what you mean by a 'picture' he fiddled with his glass it is in fact a poster that i project a poster she exclaimed and you ask me to oh no i couldn't possibly mademoiselle i really don't think i could a poster ah no to save me he implored because my whole life depends on your decision how can a poster matter so much to you the proposal is absurd she regarded her peche melba with a frown if you think of becoming an actress remember what a splendid advertisement it would be he urged feverishly oh flute but she had wavered at that all paris would flock to your debut they would go saying 'can she be as beautiful as her portrait' and they would come back saying 'she is lovelier still' let me give you some more wine no more i'll have coffee and a grand marnier red doubtless the more expensive colour reflected goujaud but the time had passed for dwelling on minor troubles listen he resumed i shall tell you my history you will then realise to what an abyss of despair your refusal will plunge me to what effulgent heights i may be raised by your consent you cannot be marble my father indeed i am not marble she put in i am instinct with sensibility it is my great weakness so much the better be weak to me my father oh let us get out of this first she suggested you can talk to me as we drive and the attentive jules presented the discreetly folded bill for fully thirty seconds the pavilion d'armenonville swirled round the unfortunate painter so violently that he felt as if he were on a roundabout at a fair he feared that the siren must hear the pounding of his heart to think that he had dreaded paying two louis two louis why it would have been a bagatelle speechlessly he laid a fortune on the salver with a culminating burst of recklessness he waved four francs towards jules and remarked that that personage eyed the tip with cold displeasure what a lucrative career a waiter's moaned the artist he turns up his nose at four francs well he had speculated too heavily to accept defeat now bracing himself for the effort goujaud besought the lady's help with such a flood of blandishment during the drive that more than once she seemed at the point of yielding only one difficult detail had he withheld that he wished to pose her on the knee of mephistopheles and to propitiate her further before breaking the news he stopped the cab at a florist's she was so good humoured and tractable after the florist had pillaged him that he could scarcely be callous when she showed him that she had split her glove but to this day he protests that until the glove shop had been entered it never occurred to him that it would be necessary to present her with more than one pair as they came out goujaud moving beside her like a man in a trance she gave a faint start mon dieu she muttered there's my friend he has seen us i must speak to him or he will think i am doing wrong wait a minute and a dandy with a monocle was indeed casting very supercilious glances at the painter at eight o'clock that evening monsieur tricotrin with a prodigious appetite sat in the cafe du bel avenir awaiting the arrival of his host when impatience was mastering him there arrived instead a petit bleu the impecunious poet took it from the proprietress paling and read i discovered my ideal she ruined and then deserted me to morrow there will be a painter the less and a petrole merchant the more pardon my non appearance i am spending my last sous on this message monsieur will give his order now inquired the proprietress er thank you i do not dine to night said tricotrin the judgment of paris in the summer of the memorable year but the date doesn't matter robichon and quinquart both paid court to mademoiselle brouette mademoiselle brouette was a captivating actress robichon and quinquart were the most comic of comedians and all three were members of the theatre supreme robichon was such an idol of the public's that they used to laugh before he uttered the first word of his role and quinquart was so vastly popular that his silence threw the audience into convulsions professional rivalry apart the two were good friends although they were suitors for the same lady and this was doubtless due to the fact that the lady favoured the robust robichon no more than she favoured the skinny quinquart she flirted with them equally she approved them equally and at last when each of them had plagued her beyond endurance she promised in a pet that she would marry the one that was the better actor tiens not a player on the stage not a critic on the press could quite make up his mind which the better actor was only suzanne brouette could have said anything so tantalising but how shall we decide the point suzanne stammered robichon helplessly whose pronouncement will you accept how can the question be settled queried quinquart dismayed who shall be the judge paris shall be the judge affirmed suzanne we are the servants of the public i will take the public's word of course she was as pretty as a picture or she couldn't have done these things then poor quinquart withdrew plunged in reverie so did robichon quinquart reflected that she had been talking through her expensive hat robichon was of the same opinion the public lauded them both was no less generous to one than to the other to wait for the judgment of paris appeared equivalent to postponing the matter sine die no way out presented itself to quinquart none occurred to robichon mon vieux said the latter as they sat on the terrace of their favourite cafe a day or two before the annual vacation let us discuss this amicably have a cigarette you are an actor therefore you consider yourself more talented than i i too am an actor therefore i regard you as less gifted than myself so much for our artistic standpoints but we are also men of the world and it must be obvious to both of us that we might go on being funny until we reached our death beds without demonstrating the supremacy of either enfin our only hope lies in versatility the conqueror must distinguish himself in a solemn part he viewed the other with complacence for the quaint quinquart had been designed for a droll by nature right said quinquart he contemplated his colleague with satisfaction for it was impossible to fancy the fat robichon in tragedy i perceive only one drawback to the plan continued robichon the management will never consent to accord us a chance is it not always so in the theatre one succeeds in a certain line of business and one must be resigned to play that line as long as one lives if my earliest success had been scored as a villain of melodrama it would be believed that i was competent to enact nothing but villains of melodrama it happened that i made a hit as a comedian wherefore nobody will credit that i am capable of anything but being comic same here concurred quinquart well then what do you propose robichon mused since we shall not be allowed to do ourselves justice on the stage we must find an opportunity off it a private performance good yet if it is a private performance how is paris to be the judge ah murmured robichon that is certainly a stumbling block they sipped their aperitifs moodily many heads were turned towards the little table where they sat there are quinquart and robichon how amusing they always are said passers by little guessing the anxiety at the laughter makers' hearts what's to be done sighed quinquart at last robichon shrugged his fat shoulders with a frown both were too absorbed to notice that after a glance of recognition one of the pedestrians had paused and was still regarding them irresolutely he was a tall burly man habited in rusty black and the next moment as if finding courage he stepped forward and spoke gentlemen i ask pardon for the liberty i take impulse urges me to seek your professional advice i am in a position to pay a moderate fee will you permit me to explain myself monsieur returned robichon we are in deep consideration of our latest parts we shall be pleased to give you our attention at some other time alas persisted the newcomer with me time presses i too am considering my latest part and it will be the only speaking part i have ever played though i have been 'appearing' for twenty years what you have been a super for twenty years said quinquart with a grimace no monsieur replied the stranger grimly i have been the public executioner and i am going to lecture on the horrors of the post i have resigned the two comedians stared at him aghast across the sunlit terrace seemed to have fallen the black shadow of the guillotine i am jacques roux the man went on i am 'trying it on the dog' at appeville sous bois next week and i have what you gentlemen call 'stage fright' i who never knew what nervousness meant before is it not queer as often as i rehearse walking on to the platform i feel myself to be all arms and legs i don't know what to do with them formerly i scarcely remembered my arms and legs but of course my attention used to be engaged by the other fellow's head well it struck me that you might consent to give me a few hints in deportment probably one lesson would suffice sit down said robichon why did you abandon your official position because i awakened to the truth roux answered i no longer agree with capital punishment it is a crime that should be abolished the scruples of conscience hein that is it fine said robichon what dramatic lines such a lecture might contain and of what is it to consist it is to consist of the history of my life my youth my poverty my experiences as executioner and my remorse magnificent said robichon the spectres of your victims pursue you even to the platform your voice fails you your eyes start from your head in terror you gasp for mercy and imagination splashes your outstretched hands with gore the audience thrill women swoon strong men are breathless with emotion suddenly he smote the table with his big fist and little quinquart nearly fell off his chair for he divined the inspiration of his rival listen cried robichon are you known at appeville sous bois my name is known yes bah i mean are you known personally have you acquaintances there oh no but why there will be nobody to recognize you it is very unlikely in such a place what do you estimate that your profits will amount to it is only a small hall and the prices are very cheap perhaps two hundred and fifty francs and you are nervous you would like to postpone your debut i should not be sorry i admit but again why i will tell you why i offer you five hundred francs to let me take your place monsieur is it a bargain i do not understand i have a whim to figure in a solemn part you can explain next day that you missed your train that you were ill there are a dozen explanations that can be made you will not be supposed to know that i personated you the responsibility for that is mine what do you say it is worth double the money demurred the man not a bit of it all the press will shout the story of my practical joke paris will be astounded that i robichon lectured as jacques roux and curdled an audience's blood millions will speak of your intended lecture tour who otherwise would never have heard of it i am giving you the grandest advertisement and paying you for it besides enfin i will throw a deportment lesson in is it agreed agreed monsieur said roux oh the trepidation of quinquart who could eclipse robichon if his performance of the part equalled his conception of it at the theatre that evening quinquart followed suzanne about the wings pathetically he was garbed like a buffoon but he felt like romeo the throng that applauded his capers were far from suspecting the romantic longings under his magenta wig for the first time in his life he was thankful that the author hadn't given him more to do and oh the excitement of robichon he was to put his powers to a tremendous test and if he made the effect that he anticipated he had no fear of quinquart's going one better suzanne to whom he whispered his project proudly announced an intention of being present to see the fun quinquart also promised to be there robichon sat up all night preparing his lecture if you wish to know whether suzanne rejoiced at the prospect of his winning her history is not definite on the point but some chroniclers assert that at this period she made more than usual of quinquart who had developed a hump as big as the pantheon and they all went to appeville sous bois though no one in the town was likely to know the features of the executioner it was to be remembered that people there might know the actor's and robichon had made up to resemble roux as closely as possible arriving at the humble hall he was greeted by the lessee heard that a good house was expected and smoked a cigarette in the retiring room while the audience assembled at eight o'clock the lessee reappeared all is ready monsieur roux he said robichon rose he saw suzanne and quinquart in the third row and was tempted to wink at them ladies and gentlemen all eyes were riveted on him as he began even the voice of the executioner exercised a morbid fascination over the crowd the men nudged their neighbours appreciatively and women gazed at him half horrified half charmed the opening of his address was quiet enough there was even a humorous element in it as he narrated imaginary experiences of his boyhood people tittered and then glanced at one another with an apologetic air as if shocked at such a monster's daring to amuse them suzanne whispered to quinquart too cheerful he hasn't struck the right note quinquart whispered back gloomily wait he may be playing for the contrast and quinquart's assumption was correct gradually the cheerfulness faded from the speaker's voice the humorous incidents were past gruesome hideous grew the anecdotes the hall shivered necks were craned and white faces twitched suspensively he dwelt on the agonies of the condemned he recited crimes in detail he mirrored the last moments before the blade fell he shrieked his remorse his lacerating remorse i am a murderer he sobbed and in the hall one might have heard a pin drop there was no applause when he finished that set the seal on his success he bowed and withdrew amid tense silence still none moved in the hall until with a rush the representatives of the press sped forth to proclaim jacques roux an unparalleled sensation the triumph of robichon how generous were the congratulations of quinquart and how sweet the admiring tributes of suzanne and there was another compliment to come nothing less than a card from the marquis de thevenin requesting an interview at his home ah exclaimed robichon enravished an invitation from a noble that proves the effect i made hein who may he be inquired quinquart i never heard of the marquis de thevenin it is immaterial whether you have heard of him replied robichon he is a marquis and he desires to converse with me it is an honour that one must appreciate i shall assuredly go and being a bit of a snob he sought a fiacre in high feather the drive was short and when the cab stopped he was distinctly taken aback to perceive the unpretentious aspect of the nobleman's abode it was indeed nothing better than a lodging a peasant admitted him and the room to which he was ushered boasted no warmer hospitality than a couple of candles and a decanter of wine however the sconces were massive silver monsieur le marquis he was informed had been suddenly compelled to summon his physician and begged that monsieur roux would allow him a few minutes' grace robichon ardently admired the candlesticks but began to think he might have supped more cozily with suzanne it was a long time before the door opened the marquis de thevenin was old so old that he seemed to be falling to pieces as he tottered forward his skin was yellow and shrivelled his mouth sunken his hair sparse and grey and from this weird face peered strange eyes the eyes of a fanatic monsieur i owe you many apologies for my delay he wheezed my unaccustomed exertion this evening fatigued me and on my return from the hall i found it necessary to see my doctor your lecture was wonderful monsieur roux most interesting and instructive i shall never forget it robichon bowed his acknowledgments sit down monsieur roux do not stand let me offer you some wine i am forbidden to touch it myself i am a poor host but my age must be my excuse to be the guest of monsieur le marquis murmured robichon is a privilege an honour which er ah sighed the marquis i shall very soon be in the republic where all men are really equals and the only masters are the worms my reason for requesting you to come was to speak of your unfortunate experiences of a certain unfortunate experience in particular you referred in your lecture to the execution of one called 'victor lesueur' he died game hein as plucky a soul as i ever dispatched said robichon savouring the burgundy ah not a tremor he strode to the guillotine like a man like a hero said robichon who knew nothing about him that was fine said the marquis that was as it should be you have never known a prisoner to die more bravely there was a note of pride in his voice that was unmistakable i shall always recall his courage with respect declared robichon mystified did you respect it at the time pardon monsieur le marquis i inquire if you respected it at the time did you spare him all needless suffering there is no suffering said robichon so swift is the knife that the host made a gesture of impatience i refer to mental suffering cannot you realise the emotions of an innocent man condemned to a shameful death innocent as for that they all say that they are innocent i do not doubt it victor however spoke the truth i know it he was my son your son faltered robichon aghast my only son the only soul i loved on earth yes he was innocent monsieur roux and it was you who butchered him he died by your hands i i was but the instrument of the law stammered robichon i was not responsible for his fate myself you have given a masterly lecture monsieur roux said the marquis musingly i find myself in agreement with all that you said in it you are his murderer' i hope the wine is to your taste monsieur roux do not spare it the wine gasped the actor he started to his feet trembling he understood it is poisoned said the old man calmly in an hour you will be dead great heavens moaned robichon already he was conscious of a strange sensation his blood was chilled his limbs were weighted there were shadows before his eyes ah i have no fear of you continued the other i am feeble i could not defend myself but your violence would avail you nothing fight or faint as you please you are doomed for some seconds they stared at each other dumbly the actor paralysed by terror the host wearing the smile of a lunatic and then the lunatic slowly peeled court plaster from his teeth and removed features and lifted a wig and when the whole story was published a delighted paris awarded the palm to quinquart without a dissentient voice for while robichon had duped an audience quinquart had duped robichon himself robichon bought the silver candlesticks which had been hired for the occasion and he presented them to quinquart and suzanne on their wedding day the fairy poodle they were called the two children because they were so unpractical even in bohemia where practicality is the last virtue to flourish their improvidence was surprising but really they were not children at all they had been married for three years though to watch their billing and cooing you would have supposed them to be bride and bridegroom julian and juliette had fallen in love and run to the mairie as joyously as if chateaubriands were to be gathered from the boughs in the jardin des buttes chaumont and since then their home had been the studio under the slates where they were often penniless indeed if it had not been for the intermittent mercies of madame cochard the concierge they would have starved under the slates however they were sure that the pictures which julien painted would some day make him celebrated and that the fairy tales which juliette weaved would some day be as famous as hans andersen's so they laughed and painted and scribbled and spent their money on bonbons instead of saving it for bread and when they had no dinner they would kiss each other and say there is a good time coming and they were called the two children as you know but even the patience of madame cochard was taxed when juliette brought back the poodle she found him a strayed muddy unhappy little poodle in the rue de rivoli one wet afternoon in november and what more natural than that she should immediately bear him home and propose to give him a bath and adopt him it was the most natural thing in the world since she was juliette yet this madame cochard who objected to a dog on her stairs as violently as if it were a tiger was furious is it not enough she cried that you are the worst tenants in the house you two that you are always behindhand with your rent and that i must fill your mouths out of my own purse is a concierge an angel from heaven do you think that you expect her to provide also for lost dogs dear kind madame cochard cooed juliette you will learn to love the little creature as if it were your own child see how trustfully he regards you it is a fact added julien he seems to take to her already it is astonishing how quickly a dog recognises a good heart good heart or not exclaimed the concierge it is to be understood that i do not consent to this outrage the poodle shall not remain be discreet urged juliette i entreat you to be discreet for your own sake if you must have the whole truth he is a fairy poodle what do you say ejaculated madame cochard he is a fairy poodle and if we treat him ungenerously we shall suffer remember the history of the lodgers the concierge and the pug i have never heard of such a history returned madame cochard and i do not believe that there ever was one she has never heard the history of the lodgers the concierge and the pug cried juliette oh then listen madame once upon a time there were two lodgers a young man and his wife and they were so poor that often they depended on the tenderness of the concierge to supply them with a dinner did they also throw away their good money on bonbons and flowers asked madame cochard trying her utmost to look severe it is possible admitted juliette who was perched on the table with the dirty little animal in her lap for though they are our hero and heroine i cannot pretend that they were very wise well this concierge who suffered badly from lumbago and stairs had sometimes a bit of temper so you may figure yourself what a fuss she raised when the poor lodgers brought home a friendless pug to add to their embarrassments however there is no 'however' persisted madame cochard she raises a fuss and that is all about it pardon dear madame put in julien you confuse the cases we are now concerned with the veracious history of the pug not the uncertain future of the poodle quite so said juliette she raised a terrible fuss and declared that the pug should go but finally she melted to it and made it welcome and then what do you suppose happened why it turned out to be an enchanted prince who rewarded them all with wealth and happiness the young man's pictures were immediately accepted by the salon did i mention that he was an artist the young woman's stories did i tell you that she wrote stories became so much the fashion that her head swam with joy and the concierge the dear kind concierge was changed into a beautiful princess and never had to walk up any stairs again as long as she lived thus we see that one should never forbid lodgers to adopt a dog thus we see that they do well to call you a pair of 'children' replied madame cochard that is what we see well well keep the dog since you are so much bent on it only i warn you that if it gives me trouble it will be sausages in no time i advise you to wash it without delay for a more deplorable little beast i never saw julien and juliette set to work with delight and after he was bathed and dry the alteration in the dog was quite astonishing although he did not precisely turn into a prince he turned into a poodle of the most fashionable aspect obviously an aristocrat among poodles a poodle of high estate the metamorphosis was so striking that a new fear assailed his rescuers the fear that it might be dishonest of them to retain him probably some great lady was disconsolate at his loss sure enough a few days later when sanquereau called upon them he said by the way did i not hear that you had found a poodle my children doubtless it is the poodle for which they advertise see and he produced a copy of a journal in which a handsome reward was promised for the restoration of an animal which resembled their protege to a tuft the description was too accurate for the children to deceive themselves and that afternoon juliette carried the dog to a magnificent house which was nothing less than the residence of the comtesse de grand ecusson she was left standing in a noble hall while a flunkey bore the dog away then another flunkey bade her follow him upstairs and in a salon which was finer than anything that juliette had ever met with outside the pages of a novel the countess was reclining on a couch with the poodle in her arms i am so grateful to you for the recovery of my darling said the great lady my distress has been insupportable ah naughty naughty racine she made a pretence of chastising the poodle on the nose i can understand it madame said juliette much embarrassed where did you find him and has he been well fed well taken care of i hope he has not been sleeping in a draught oh indeed madame he has been nourished like a beloved child doubtless not so delicately as with madame but it was most kind of you said the lady i count myself blessed that my little racine fell into such good hands now as to the reward what sum would you think sufficient juliette looked shy i thank you madame but we could not accept anything she faltered what exclaimed the countess raising her eyebrows in surprise you cannot accept anything how is that well said juliette it would be base to accept money for a simple act of honesty it is true that we did not wish to part with the dog we had grown to love him but as to our receiving payment for giving him up that is impossible the countess laughed merrily what a funny child you are and who are 'we' you and your parents oh no said juliette my parents are in heaven madame but i am married your husband must be in heaven too said the countess who was a charming woman ah demurred juliette but although i have a warm heart i have also a healthy appetite and he is not rich he is a painter i must go to see his pictures some day replied the comtesse de grand ecusson give me the address and believe that i am extremely grateful to you it need not be said that juliette skipped home on air after this interview the hint of such patronage opened the gates of paradise to her and the prospect was equally dazzling to julien for fully a week they talked of nothing but a visit from the comtesse de grand ecusson having no suspicion that fine ladies often forgot their pretty promises as quickly as they made them and the week and a fortnight and a month passed and at last the expectation faded they ceased to indulge their fancies of a carriage and pair dashing into the street with a lady bountiful and what was much more serious madame cochard ceased to indulge their follies the truth was that she had never pardoned the girl for refusing to accept the proffered reward the delicacy that prompted the refusal was beyond her comprehension and now that the pair were in arrears with their rent again she put no bridle on her tongue it appears to me that it would have been more honourable to accept money for a poodle than to owe money to a landlord she grunted it must be perfectly understood that if the sum is not forthcoming on the first of january you will have to get out i have received my instructions and i shall obey them on the first day of january my children you pay or you go le bon dieu alone knows what will become of you but that is no affair of mine i expect you will die like the babes in the wood for you are no more fit to make a living than a cow is fit to fly dear madame cochard they answered peacefully why distress yourself about us the first of january is more than a week distant in a week we may sell a picture or some fairy tales in a week many things may happen and they sunned themselves on the boulevard the same afternoon with as much serenity as if they had been millionaires nevertheless they did not sell a picture or some fairy tales in the week that followed and the first of january dawned with relentless punctuality as we all remember in the early morning when madame cochard made her ascent to the attic her arms folded inexorably the glare of a creditor in her eye she found that juliette had already been out if you can believe me she had been out to waste her last two francs on an absurd tie for julien eh bien demanded the concierge sternly where is your husband i am here as arranged for the rent no doubt he has it ready on the mantelpiece for me he is not in answered juliette coaxingly and i am sorry to say we have had disappointments the fact is there is something wrong with the construction of a story of which i had immense hopes it needs letting out at the waist and a tuck put in at the hem when i have made the alterations i am sure it will fit some journal elegantly all this passes forbearance exclaimed madame cochard well you have thoroughly understood and all is said you will vacate your lodging by evening so much grace i give you but at six o'clock you depart promptly or you will be ejected and do not reckon on me to send any meal up here during the day for you will not get so much as a crust what is it that you have been buying there it is a little gift for julien i rose early to choose it before he woke and surprise him but when i returned he was out a gift cried the concierge you have no money to buy food and you buy a gift for your husband what for what for repeated juliette wonderingly why because it is new year's day and that reminds me i wish you the compliments of the season madame may you enjoy many happy years kind words pay no bills snapped the concierge i have been lenient far too long i have my own reputation to consider with the landlord by six o'clock bear in mind and then to complete her resentment what should happen but that julien entered bearing a bouquet to see julien present juliette with the roses and to watch juliette enchant julien with the preposterous tie was as charming a little comedy of improvidence as you would be likely to meet with in a lifetime mon dieu gasped madame cochard purple with indignation it is indeed well that you are leaving here monsieur a madhouse is the fitting address for you you have nothing to eat and you buy roses for your wife what for what for echoed julien astonished why because it is new year's day and i take the opportunity to wish you the compliments of the season madame may your future be as bright as juliette's eyes by six o'clock reiterated the concierge who was so exasperated that she could barely articulate by six o'clock you will be out of the place and to relieve her feelings she slammed the door with such violence that half a dozen canvases fell to the floor well this is a nice thing remarked julien when she had gone it looks to me mignonne as if we shall sleep in the bois with the moon for an eiderdown at least you shall have a comfy pillow sweetheart cried juliette drawing his head to her breast my angel there is none so soft in the elysee and as we have nothing for dejeuner in the cupboard i propose that we breakfast now on kisses ah julien whispered the girl as she folded him in her arms ah juliette it was as if they had been married that morning and yet continued the young man releasing her at last to own the truth your kisses are not satisfying as a menu they are the choicest of hors d'oeuvres they leave one hungry for more they were still making love when sanquereau burst in to wish them a happy new year how goes it my children he cried you look like a honeymoon i swear am i in the way or may i breakfast with you you are not in the way mon vieux returned julien but i shall not invite you to breakfast with me because my repast consists of juliette's lips mon dieu said sanquereau so you are broke well in my chequered career i have breakfasted on much worse fare than yours at this reply juliette blushed with all the bashfulness of a bride and julien endeavoured to assume the air of a man of the world tell me he said we are in difficulties about the rent have you by chance a louis that you could lend me sanquereau turned out his pockets like the good fellow he was but he could produce no more than a sou what a bother he cried i would lend you a louis if i had it as readily as a cigarette paper but you see how i am situated on my honour it rends my heart to have to refuse you are a gallant comrade said julien much touched come back and sup with us this evening and we will open the new year with a festivity hein but there will be no supper faltered juliette that's true said julien there will be no supper i was forgetting still who knows there is plenty of time i shall have an idea perhaps i may be able to borrow something from tricotrin i shall be enchanted responded sanquereau depend on my arrival if i am not mistaken i recognize tricotrin's voice on the stairs his ears had not deceived him tricotrin appeared with pitou at this very moment greeting my children they cried how wags the world may the new year bring you laurels and lucre to you also dear gustave and nicolas cried the children may your poems and your music ignite the seine and may sanquereau rise to eminence and make statues of you both in the meantime added sanquereau can either of you put your hands on a few francs there is a fine opening for them here a difference of opinion exists between ourselves and the landlord julien explained we consider that he should wait for his rent and he holds a different view if you could lend us fifteen francs we might effect a compromise the poet and the composer displayed the lining of their pockets as freely as the sculptor had done but their capital proved to be a sou less than his own tears sprang to their eyes as they confessed their inability to be of use we are in despair they groaned my good kind friends exclaimed julien your sympathy is a noble gift in itself join us in a little supper this evening in celebration of the date we shall be delighted declared tricotrin and pitou but but stammered juliette again where is it to come from this supper and where shall we be by supper time well our address is on the lap of the gods admitted julien but while there is life there is hope possibly i may obtain a loan from lajeunie not many minutes had passed before lajeunie also paid a visit to the attic aha cried the unsuccessful novelist as he perceived the company well met my children my brothers may your rewards equal your deserts this year may france do honour to your genius and may lajeunie be crowned the new balzac shouted the assembly may his abode be in the champs elysees and his name in the mouth of all the world but extraordinary as it appears lajeunie proved to be as impecunious as the rest there and he was so much distressed that julien deeply moved said come back to supper lajeunie we will drink toasts to the muses and now there were four guests invited to the impracticable supper and when the children were left alone they clapped their hands at the prospect how merry we shall be julien exclaimed and awhile ago we talked of passing the night in the bois it only shows you that one can never tell what an hour may bring forth yes yes assented juliette blithely and as for the supper we shall not require it till nine o'clock at the earliest and now it is no more than midday why there is an eternity for things to arrange themselves just so the sky may rain truffles in such an interval said the painter and they drew their chairs closer to the fire and pretended to each other that they were not hungry the hours crept past and the sunshine waned and snow began to flutter over paris but no truffles fell by degrees the fire burnt low and died to beg for more fuel was impossible and juliette shivered a little you are cold sweetheart sighed julien i will fetch a blanket from the bed and wrap you in it no she murmured wrap me in your arms it will be better darker and darker grew the garret and faster and faster fell the snow i have a fancy said juliette breaking a long silence that it is the hour in which a fairy should appear to us let us look to see if she is coming they peered from the window but in the twilight no fairy was to be discerned only an old clo' man was visible trudging on his round i declare cried julien he is the next best thing to your fairy i will sell my summer suit and my velvet jacket what do i want of a velvet jacket coffee and eggs will be much more cheerful and i vowed juliette can spare my best hat easily indeed it is an encumbrance if we make madame cochard a small peace offering she may allow us to remain until the morning what a grand idea we shall provide ourselves with a night's shelter and the means to entertain our friends as well hasten to collect our wardrobe mignonette while i crack my throat to make him hear he he at the repeated cries the old clo' man lifted his gaze to the fifth floor window at last and in a few minutes julien and juliette were kneeling on the boards above a pile of garments which they raised one by one for his inspection regard monsieur said julien this elegant summer suit it is almost as good as new i begin to hesitate to part with it what shall we say for this elegant summer suit the dealer fingered it disdainfully show me boots he suggested we can do business in boots alas replied julien the only boots that i possess are on my feet we will again admire the suit what do you estimate it at ten francs are you insane are you a lunatic returned the dealer to a reckless man it might be worth ten sous let us talk of boots i cannot go barefoot expostulated julien juliette my heart do you happen to possess a second pair of boots juliette shook her head forlornly but i have a hat with daisies in it she said observe monsieur the delicate tints of the buds how like to nature how exquisite they are they make one dream of courtship in the woods i will take five francs for it from me i swear you will not take them said the old clo' man boots he pleaded for the love of god boots morbleu what a passion for boots you have moaned the unhappy painter they obsess you they warp your judgment can you think of nothing in the world but boots look we come to the gem of the exhibition a velvet jacket a jacket like this confers an air of greatness one could not feel the pinch of poverty in such a jacket it is i confess a little white at the elbows but such high lights are very effective and observe the texture as soft as a darling's cheek the other turned it about with indifferent hands and the children began to realise that he would prove no substitute for a fairy after all then while they watched him with sinking hearts the door was suddenly opened and the concierge tottered on the threshold monsieur madame she panted with such respect that they stared at each other eh bien a visitor she leant against the wall overwhelmed who is it madame la comtesse de grand ecusson actually the countess had kept her word after all and now she rustled in before the old clo' man could be banished white as a virgin canvas julien staggered forward to receive her a pair of trousers which he was too agitated to remember dangling under his arm madame this honour he stammered and making a piteous effort to disguise his beggary one's wardrobe accumulates so that really in a small menage one has no room to i have suffered from the inconvenience myself monsieur said the countess graciously your charming wife was so kind as to invite me to view your work and see my little racine has come to wish his preservers a happy new year and on the honour of an historian he brought one before they left she had given a commission for his portrait at a thousand francs and purchased two landscapes for which a thousand francs more would be paid on the morrow when sanquereau and lajeunie and tricotrin and pitou arrived expecting the worst they were amazed to discover the children waltzing round the attic to the music of their own voices what hurras rang out when the explanation was forthcoming what loans were promised to the guests and what a gay quadrille was danced it was not until the last figure had concluded that julien and juliette recognised that although they would be wealthy in the morning they were still penniless that night helas but we have no supper after all groaned julien pardon it is here monsieur shouted madame cochard who entered behind a kingly feast comment shall the artist honoured by madame la comtesse de grand ecusson have no supper pot au feu monsieur leg of mutton monsieur little tarts monsieur dessert monsieur and for each person a bottle of good wine and the justice that was done to it and the laughter that pealed under the slates the children didn't forget that it was all due to the dog juliette raised her glass radiantly gentlemen she cried i ask you to drink to the fairy poodle little flower of the wood janiaud used to lie abed all day and drink absinthe all night when he contrived to write his poetry is a mystery but he did write it and he might have written other things too if he had had the will it was often said that his paramount duty was to publish a history of modern paris for the man was an encyclopaedia of unsuspected facts since he can never publish it now however i am free to tell the story of the cafe du bon vieux temps as he told it to an english editor and me one night on the terrace of the cafe itself it befell thus when we entered that shabby little montmartre restaurant janiaud chanced to be seated at a table in a corner sipping his favourite stimulant he was deplorably dirty and suggested a scarecrow and the english editor looked nervous when i offered an introduction still janiaud was janiaud the offer was accepted and janiaud discoursed in his native tongue at midnight the editor ordered supper being unfamiliar with the cafe du bon vieux temps in those days i said that i would drink beer janiaud smiled sardonically and the waiter surprised us with the information that beer could not be supplied what after midnight nothing but champagne he answered really well let us go somewhere else i proposed but the editor would not hear of that he had a princely soul and besides he was doing paris all the same what does it mean he inquired of janiaud janiaud blew smoke rings it is the rule during the evening the bock drinker is welcomed here as elsewhere but at midnight well you will see what you will see and we saw very soon the bourgeoisie of montmartre had straggled out while we talked and in a little while the restaurant was crowded with a rackety crew who had driven up in cabs everybody but ourselves was in evening dress where the coppers had been counted carefully gold was scattered a space was cleared for dancing and mademoiselle nan joliquette obliged the company with her latest comic song the editor was interested it is a queer change though has it always been like this ask janiaud i said i don't know oh not at all replied janiaud no indeed it was not always like this it used to be as quiet at midnight as at any other hour but it became celebrated as a supper place and now it is quite the thing for the ardent spirits with money to come and kick up their heels here until five in the morning curious how such customs originate remarked the editor here we have a restaurant which is out of the way which is the reverse of luxurious and which for all that seems to be a gold mine to the proprietor look at him look at his white waistcoat and his massive watch chain his air of prosperity how did he come to rake it in like this janiaud you know everything i said the poet stroked his beard and glanced at his empty glass the editor raised a bottle i cannot talk on clicquot demurred janiaud if you insist i will take another absinthe they will allow it in the circumstances sst adolphe the waiter whisked over to us monsieur pays for champagne but i prefer absinthe there is no law against that hein adolphe smiled tolerantly shall we sit outside suggested the editor what do you think it's getting rather riotous in here isn't it so we moved on to the terrace and waited while janiaud prepared his poison it is a coincidence that you have asked me for the history of the bon vieux temps tonight he began after a gulp if you had asked for it two days earlier the climax would have been missing the story completed itself yesterday and i happened to be here and saw the end listen dupont the proprietor whom monsieur has just admired used to be chef to a family on the boulevard haussmann he had a very fair salary and probably he would have remained in the situation till now but for the fact that he fell in love with the parlourmaid she was a sprightly little flirt with ambitions and she accepted him only on condition that they should withdraw from domestic service and start a business of their own dupont was of a cautious temperament he would have preferred that they should jog along with some family in the capacities of chef and housekeeper still he consented and with what they had saved between them they took over this little restaurant where monsieur the editor has treated me with such regal magnificence it was not they who christened it it was called the cafe du bon vieux temps already how it obtained its name is also very interesting but i have always avoided digressions in my work that is one of the first principles of the literary art he swallowed some more absinthe they took the establishment over and they conducted it on the lines of their predecessor they provided a dejeuner at one franc fifty and a dinner at two francs these are side shows of the bon vieux temps to day but in the period of which i speak they were all that it had to say for itself they were its foundation stone and its cupola when i had two francs to spare i used to dine here myself well the profits were not dazzling and after marriage the little parlourmaid developed extravagant tastes she had a passion for theatres i janiaud have nothing to say against theatres excepting that the managers have never put on my dramas but in the wife of a struggling restaurateur a craze for playgoing is not to be encouraged monsieur will agree also madame had a fondness for dress she did little behind the counter but display new ribbons and trinkets she was very stupid at giving change and always made the mistake on the wrong side for dupont at last he had to employ a cousin of his own as dame de comptoir the expenses had increased and the returns remained the same in fine dupont was in difficulties the bon vieux temps was on its last legs listen there was at that time a dancer called 'little flower of the wood' she was very chic very popular she had her appartement in the avenue wagram she drove to the stage doors in her coupe her photographs were sold like confetti at a carnival well one afternoon when dupont's reflections were oscillating between the bankruptcy court and the morgue he was stupefied to receive a message from her she bade him reserve a table for herself and some friends for supper that night dupont could scarcely credit his ears he told his wife that a practical joker must be larking with him he declared that he would take no notice of the message that he was not such an ass to be duped by it finally he proposed to telegraph to little flower of the wood inquiring if it was genuine monsieur as an editor will have observed that a woman who is incapable in the daily affairs of life may reveal astounding force in an emergency it was so in this case madame put her foot down she showed unsuspected commercial aptitude she firmly forbade dupont to do anything of the sort 'what' she exclaimed 'you will telegraph to her inquiring never in this life you might as well advise her frankly not to come what would such a question mean that you do not think the place is good enough for her well if you do not think so neither will she she will decide that she had a foolish impulse and stay away 'mon dieu do you dream that a woman accustomed to the cafe de paris would choose to sup in an obscure little restaurant like ours' said dupont fuming 'do you dream that i am going to buy partridges and peaches and wines and heaven knows what other delicacies in the dark do you dream that i am going to ruin myself while every instinct in me protests it would be the act of a madman' 'my little cabbage' returned madame 'we are so near to ruin as we are that a step nearer is of small importance if little flower of the wood should come it might be the turning point in our fortunes people would hear of it the bon vieux temps might become renowned yes we shall buy partridges and peaches and bonbons and flowers also and we shall hire a piano and if our good angel should indeed send her to us i swear she shall pass as pleasant an evening as if she had gone to maxim's or the abbaye bien she convinced him for the rest of the day the place was in a state of frenzy never before had such a repast been seen in its kitchen never before had he cooked with such loving care even when he had been preparing a dinner of ceremony on the boulevard haussmann madame herself ran out to arrange for the piano the floor was swept the waiter was put into a clean shirt dupont shed tears of excitement in his saucepans he served the two franc dinner that evening with eyes that watched nothing but the clock all his consciousness now was absorbed by the question whether the dancer would come or not the dinner passed somehow it is to be assumed that the customers grumbled but in his suspense dupont regarded them with indifference the hours crept by it was a quarter to twelve twelve o'clock he trembled behind the counter as if with ague now it was time that she was here his face was blanched his teeth chattered in his head what if he had been hoaxed after all half past twelve the sweat ran down him terror gripped his heart a vision of all the partridges wasted convulsed his soul hark a carriage stopped he tottered forward the door opened she had come women are strange little flower of the wood who yawned her pretty head off at armenonville was enraptured with the bon vieux temps the rest of the party took their tone from her and everything was pronounced 'fun' the coarse linen the dirty ceiling the admiring stares of the bock drinkers the lady herself declared that she had 'never enjoyed a supper so much in her life' and the waiter it was not adolphe then was dumfounded by a louis tip figure yourself the exultation of madame 'ah' she chuckled when they shut up shop at sunrise 'what did i tell you my little cabbage' monsieur as an editor will have observed that a woman who reveals astounding force in an emergency may triumph pettily when the emergency is over 'it remains to be seen whether they will come any more however' said dupont 'let us go to bed mon dieu how sleepy i am' it was the first occasion that the bon vieux temps had been open after two o'clock in the morning it was the first occasion and for some days they feared it might be the last but no the dancer came again a few eccentrics who came with her flattered themselves on having made a 'discovery' they boasted of it gradually the name of the bon vieux temps became known by the time that little flower of the wood had had enough there was a supper clientele without her folly is infectious and in paris there are always people catching a fresh craze dupont began to put up his prices and levied a charge on the waiter for the privilege of waiting at supper the rest of the history is more grave comment monsieur since you insist again an absinthe janiaud paused and ran his dirty fingers through his hair this man can talk said the editor in an undertone gentlemen resumed the poet two years passed little flower of the wood was on the italian riviera the italian riviera was awake again after the heat of the summer the little town that had dozed for many months began to stir almost every day now she saw new faces on the promenade the sky was gentler the sea was fairer and she sat loathing it all craving to escape from it to the bleak streets of paris two winters before she had been told 'your lungs will stand no more of the pranks you have been playing you must go south and keep early hours or ' the shrug said the rest and she had sold some of her diamonds and obeyed of course it was an awful nuisance but she must put up with it for a winter in order to get well as soon as she was well she would go back and take another engagement she had promised herself to be dancing again by may but when may had come she was no better and travelling was expensive and all places were alike to her since she was forbidden to return to paris she had disposed of more jewellery and looked forward to the autumn and in the autumn she had looked forward to the spring so it had gone on at first while letters came to her sometimes telling her how she was missed the banishment had been alleviated later in her loneliness it had grown frightful monsieur her soul that little soul that pleasure had held dumb cried out under misfortune like a homeless child for its mother her longing took her by the throat and the doctor had difficulty in dissuading her from going to meet death by the first train she did not suspect that she was doomed in any case he thought it kinder to deceive her he had preached 'patience mademoiselle a little patience' and she had wrung her hands but yielded sustained by the hope of a future that she was never to know by this time the last of her jewels was sold and most of the money had been spent the fact alarmed her when she dwelt upon it but she did not dwell upon it very often in the career of little flower of the wood so many financial crises had been righted at the last moment no although there was nobody now to whom she could turn for help it was not anxiety that bowed her the thoughts by which she was stricken as she sauntered feebly on the eternal promenade were that in paris they no longer talked of her and that her prettiness had passed away she was forgotten ugly the tragedy of her exile was that now it was that she found out the truth she learnt that there was no chance of her recovering she made no reproaches for the lies that had been told her she recognized that they had been well meant all she said was 'i am glad that it is not too late i may see paris still before the curtain tumbles i shall go at once' not many months of life remained to her but they were more numerous than her louis it was an unfamiliar paris that she returned to she had quitted the paris of the frivolous and feted she came back to the paris of the outcast poor the world that she had remembered gave her no welcome she peered through its shut windows friendless in the streets gentlemen last night all the customers had gone from the little cafe du bon vieux temps but a woman in a shabby opera cloak a woman with tragic eyes and half a lung she sat fingering her glass of beer absently though the clock over the desk pointed to a quarter to midnight and at midnight beer drinkers are no longer desired in the bon vieux temps but she was a stranger it was concluded that she didn't know adolphe approached to enlighten her 'madame wishes to order supper' he asked the stranger shook her head 'madame will have champagne' 'don't bother me' said the woman adolphe nodded toward the bock contemptuously 'after midnight only champagne is served here' he said 'it is the rule of the house' 'a fig for the rule' scoffed the woman 'i am going to stop' adolphe retired and sought the patron and dupont advanced to her with dignity 'madame is plainly ignorant of our arrangements' he began 'at twelve o'clock one cannot remain here for the cost of a bock the restaurant becomes very gay' 'so i believe' she said 'i want to see the gaiety' 'it also becomes expensive i will explain during the evening we serve a dinner at two francs for our clients in the neighbourhood and until twelve o'clock one may order bocks or what one wishes at strictly moderate prices but at twelve o'clock there is a change we have quite a different class of trade the world that amuses itself arrives here to sup and to dance as a supper house the bori vieux temps is known to all paris' 'one lives and learns' said the woman ironically 'but i know more about the bon vieux temps than you seem to think i can tell you the history of its success' 'madame' dupont regarded her with haughty eyes 'three years ago monsieur there was no different class of trade at twelve o'clock and no champagne the dinners at two francs for your clients in the neighbourhood were all that you aspired to you did the cooking yourself in those days and you did not sport a white waistcoat and a gold watch chain' 'these things have nothing to do with it you will comply with the rule or you must go all is said' 'one night little flower of the wood had a whim to sup here' continued the woman as if he had not spoken 'she had passed the place in her carriage and fancied its name or its flowerpot or she wanted to do something new anyhow she had the whim i see you have the telephone behind the desk monsieur your little restaurant was not on the telephone when she wished to reserve a table that night she had to reserve it by a messenger' 'well well' said dupont impatiently 'but you were a shrewd man you saw your luck and leapt at it and when she entered with her party you received her like a queen you had even hired a piano you said in case little flower of the wood might wish to play i notice that a piano is in the corner now no doubt you soon saved the money to buy one' 'how do you know all this you' dupont's gaze was curious 'her freak pleased her and she came again and again and others came just to see her here then you recognized that your clients from the neighbourhood were out of place among the spendthrifts who yielded more profit in a night than all the two franc dinners in a month you said at twelve o'clock there shall be no more bocks only champagne i had made your restaurant famous and you introduced the great rule that you now command me to obey' 'you you are little flower of the wood' 'yes it was i who did it for you' she said quietly 'and the restaurant flourished after little flower of the wood had faded well to night i want to spend an hour here again for the sake of what i used to be time brings changes you understand and i cannot conform with the great rule' she opened the opera cloak trembling and he saw that beneath it little flower of the wood was in rags 'i am very poor and ill' she went on 'i have been away in the south for more than two years they told me i ought to stop there but i had to see paris once more what does it matter i shall finish here a little sooner that is all i lodge close by in a garret the garret is very dirty but i hear the muisc from the bal tabarin across the way i like that i persuade myself i am living the happy life i used to have when i am tossing sleepless i hear the noise and laughter of the crowd coming out and blow kisses to them in the dark you see although one is forgotten one cannot forget i pray that their laughter will come up to me right at the end before i die' 'you cannot afford to enter tabarin's' faltered dupont 'you are so stony as that' 'so stony as that' she said 'and i repeat that to night i want to pass an hour in the midst of the life i loved monsieur remember how you came to make your rule break it for me once let me stay here to night for a bock' dupont is a restaurateur but he is also a man he took both her hands and the waiters were astonished to perceive that the patron was crying 'my child' he stammered 'you will sup here as my guest' adolphe set before her champagne that she sipped feverishly and a supper that she was too ill to eat and cabs came rattling from the boulevard with boisterous men and women who no longer recalled her name and with other 'little flowers of the wood' who had sprung up since her day the woman who used to reign there sat among them looking back until the last jest was bandied and the last bottle was drained then she bade her host 'good bye' and crawled home to the garret where she 'heard the music of the ball' the garret where she 'prayed that the laughter would come up to her right at the end before she died' janiaud finished the absinthe and lurched to his feet that's all great scott said the editor i wish he could write in english but but it's very pitiable she may starve there something ought to be done can you tell us where she is living monsieur the poet shrugged his shoulders is there no satisfying you you asked me for the history of the bon vieux temps and there are things that even i do not know however i have done my best i cannot say where the lady is living but i can tell you where she was born he pointed with a drunken laugh to his glass there a miracle in montmartre lajeunie the luckless novelist went to pitou the unrecognized composer saying i have a superb scenario for a revue let us join forces i promise you we shall make a fortune we shall exchange our attics for first floors of fashion and be wealthy enough to wear sable overcoats and panama hats at the same time in ordinary circumstances of course pitou would have collaborated only with tricotrin but tricotrin was just then engrossed by a tragedy in blank verse and seven acts and he said to them make a fortune together by all means my comrades i should be unreasonable if i raised objections to having rich friends accordingly the pair worked like heroes of biography and after vicissitudes innumerable patatras was practically accepted at la coupole the manager even hinted that fifi blondette might be seen in the leading part la coupole and blondette pitou and lajeunie could scarcely credit their ears to be sure she was no actress and her voice was rather unpleasant and she would probably want everything rewritten fifteen times before it satisfied her but she was a beautiful woman and all paris paid to look at her when she graced a stage and she had just ruined prince czernowitz which gave her name an additional value upon my word gasped pitou our luck seems as incredible my dear lajeunie as the plot of any of your novels come and have a drink i feel like rodolphe at the end of la vie de boheme he confided to tricotrin in their garret one winter's night as they went supper less to their beds now that the days of privation are past i recall them with something like regret the shock of the laundress's totals the meagre dinners at the bel avenir these things have a fascination now that i part from them i do not wish to sound ungrateful but i cannot help wondering if my millions will impair the taste of life to me to me they will make it taste much better said tricotrin for i shall have somebody to borrow money from and i shall get enough blankets brrr how cold i am besides you need not lose touch with montmartre because you are celebrated you can invite us all to your magnificent abode also you can dine at the bel avenir still if sentiment pulls you that way i shall certainly dine there averred pitou and i shall buy a house for my parents with a peacock and some deer on the lawn at the same time a triumph is not without its pathos i see my return to the bel avenir the old affections in my heart the old greetings on my lips and i see the fellows constrained and formal in my presence i see madame apologising for the cuisine instead of reminding me that my credit is exhausted and the waiter polishing my glass instead of indicating the cheapest item on the menu such changes hurt he was much moved a fortune is not everything he sighed forgetting that his pockets were as empty as his stomach poverty yielded joys which i no longer know the poet embraced him with emotion i rejoice to find that fame has not spoilt your nature he cried and he too forgot the empty pockets and that the contract from la coupole had yet to come yes we had hard times together you and i and i am still a nobody but we shall be chums as long as we live i feel that you can unbosom yourself to me the poor bohemian more freely than to any immortal with whom you hobnob in scenes of splendour oh indeed indeed assented pitou weeping you are as dear to me now as in the days of our struggles i should curse my affluence if it made you doubt that good night my brother god bless you he lay between the ragged sheets and half an hour crept by gustave well said tricotrin looking towards the other bed not asleep yet i cannot sleep hunger is gnawing at me ah what a relentless realist is this hunger complained the poet how it destroys one's illusions is there nothing to eat in the cupboard not a crumb i am ravenous myself but i recall a broken cigarette in my waistcoat pocket let us cut it in halves they strove shivering to appease their pangs by slow whiffs of a caporal and while they supped in this unsatisfactory fashion there came an impetuous knocking at the street door it must be that la coupole has sent you a sack of gold to go on with tricotrin opined put your head out and see it is lajeunie announced the composer withdrawing from the window with chattering teeth what the devil can he want i suppose i must go down and let him in perhaps we can get some more cigarettes from him said tricotrin it might have been worse but when the novelist appeared the first thing he stammered was give me a cigarette one of you fellows or i shall die well then dictate your last wishes to us returned pitou do you come here under the impression that the house is a tobacconist's what is the matter with you what is up for three hours snuffled lajeunie who looked half frozen and kept shuddering violently for three hours i have been pacing the streets questioning whether i should break the news to you to night or not in one moment i told myself that it would be better to withhold it till the morning in the next i felt that you had a right to hear it without delay hour after hour in the snow i turned the matter over in my mind and mon dieu exclaimed pitou is this an interminable serial at so much a column come to the point lajeunie beat his breast i am distracted he faltered i am no longer master of myself listen it occurred to me this evening that i might do worse than pay a visit to la coupole and inquire if a date was fixed yet for the rehearsals to begin well i went for a long time i could obtain no interview i could obtain no appointment the messenger came back with evasive answers i am naturally quick at smelling a rat i have the detective's instinct and i felt that there was something wrong my heart began to fail me for mercy's sake groaned his unhappy collaborator explode the bomb and bury my fragments enough of these literary introductions did you see the manager or didn't you i did see the miscreant the bandit king i saw him in the street for i was not to be put off i waited till he came out well my friend to compress the tragedy into one act our hope is shattered patatras is again refused oh heavens moaned pitou and fell back upon the mattress as white as death what explanation did he make cried tricotrin what is the reason the reason is that blondette is an imbecile she finds the part 'unworthy of her talents' a part on which i have lavished all the wealth of my invention she finds it beneath her she said she would 'break her contract rather than play it' well blondette is the trump card of his season he would throw over the whole of the academy sooner than lose blondette since she objects to figuring in patatras patatras is waste paper to him alas who would be an author i would rather shovel coke or cut corns for a living he himself admitted that there was no fault to find with the revue but 'you know well monsieur that we must humour blondette' i asked him if he would try to bring her to her senses but it seems that there have been a dozen discussions already he is sick of the subject now it is settled our manuscript will be banged back at us and we may rip oh my mother moaned pitou oh the peacock and the deer what's that you say asked lajeunie are you positive that you haven't got a cigarette anywhere i am positive that i have nothing proclaimed pitou vehemently nothing in life but a broken heart oh you did quite right to come to me but now leave me leave me to perish i have no words i am stricken the next time you see me it will be in the morgue mon dieu that beautiful wretch that creature without conscience or a note in her voice by a shrug of her elegant shoulders she condemns me to the seine ah do not give way exclaimed tricotrin leaping out of bed courage my poor fellow courage are there not other managers in paris there are and patatras has been refused by them la coupole was our last chance and it has collapsed we have no more to expect it is all over is it not so lajeunie all over sobbed lajeunie bowing his head on the washhand stand patatras is dead then for some seconds the only sound to be heard in the attic was the laboured breathing of the three young men's despair at last tricotrin drawing himself upright in his tattered nightshirt said with a gesture of dignity well the case may justify me in the present situation it appears to me that i have the right to use my influence with blondette a signal from mars could not have caused a more profound sensation pitou and lajeunie regarded him with open mouths your influence echoed pitou your influence i was not aware that you had ever met her no rejoined the poet darkly i have not met her but there are circumstances in my life which entitle me to demand a service of this triumphant woman do not question me my friends what i shall say to her must remain a secret even from you i declare however that nobody has a stronger claim on her than gustave tricotrin the poor penny a liner whom she does not know the sudden intervention to say nothing of its literary flavour so excited the collaborators that they nearly wrung his hands off and lajeunie who recognised a promising beginning for another serial was athirst for further hints she has perhaps committed a murder that fair fiend he inquired rapturously perhaps replied tricotrin in that case she dare refuse you nothing why not since i have never heard of it i was only jesting said the novelist in sober earnest i conjecture that you are married to her like athos to miladi as you stand there with that grave air you strongly resemble athos nevertheless athos did not marry a woman to whom he had not spoken and i repeat that i have never spoken to blondette in my life well said lajeunie i have too much respect for your wishes to show any curiosity besides by an expert the mystery is to be divined before the story opens you rendered her some silent aid and your name will remind her of a great heroism i have never rendered her any aid at all demurred tricotrin and there is not the slightest reason to suppose that she has ever heard my name but again i have an incontestable right to demand a service of her and for the sake of the affection i bear you both i shall go and do it when tricotrin thinks that he is living in the three musketeers it is useless to try to pump him said pitou let us content ourselves with what we are told is it not enough our fate is in blondette's hands and he is in a position to ask a favour of her what more can we want but he could not resist putting a question on his own account after lajeunie had skipped downstairs gustave why did you never mention to me that you knew blondette morbleu how often must i say that i do not know her well how shall i express it that some episode in your career gave you a claim on her consideration because by doing so i should have both violated a confidence and re opened a wound which still burns said tricotrin more like athos than ever only the urgency of your need my comrade could induce me to take the course that i project now let me sleep for to morrow i must have all my wits it was however five o'clock already and before either of them had slept long the street was clattering with feet on their way to the laundries and vendors of delicacies were bawling suggestions for appetising breakfasts not only do the shouts of these monsters disturb my slumber but they taunt my starvation yawned the poet yet now i come to think of it i have an appointment with a man who has sworn to lend me a franc so perhaps i had better get up before he is likely to have spent it i shall call upon blondette in the afternoon when she returns from her drive what is your own programme my first attempt will be at a cremerie in the rue st rustique where i am inclined to think i may get credit for milk and a roll if i swagger capital said tricotrin things are looking up with us both and if i raise the franc there will be ten sous for you to squander on a recherche luncheon meet me in the place dancourt in an hour's time so long never had mademoiselle blondette looked more captivating than when her carriage brought her back that day she wore but why particularise suffice it that she had just been photographed as she stepped to the pavement she was surprised by the obeisance of a shabby young man who said in courtly tones mademoiselle may i beg the honour of an interview i came from la coupole having bestowed a glance of annoyance on him she invited him to ascend the stairs and a minute later tricotrin was privileged to watch her take off her hat before the mirror well she inquired what's the trouble there now what do they want so far as i know mademoiselle returned the intruder deferentially they want nothing but your beauty and your genius but i myself want infinitely more i want your attention and your pity let me explain without delay that i do not represent the management and that when i said i came from la coupole i should have added that i did not come from the interior ca par exemple she said sharply who are you then i am tricotrin mademoiselle gustave tricotrin at your feet i have two comrades the parents of patatras you have refused to play in it and i fear they will destroy themselves i come to beg you to save their lives monsieur exclaimed the lady and her eyes were brilliant with temper all that i have to say about patatras i have said the part gave me the hump and yet continued the suppliant firmly i hope to induce you to accept it i am an author myself and i assure you that it teems with opportunities that you may have overlooked in a casual reading it is stupid as you would play it i predict that it would make an epoch and the music is no good if i may venture to differ from you the music is haunting the composer is my lifelong friend i appreciate the argument she said with fine irony but you will scarcely expect me to play a part that i don't like in order to please you frankly that is just what i do expect replied the poet i think you will consent for my sake oh really for your sake would you mind mentioning why before you go because mademoiselle said tricotrin folding his arms in years gone by you ruined me mon dieu she gasped and she did not doubt that she was in the presence of a lunatic do not rush to the bell he begged if it will allay your panic i will open the door and address you from the landing i am not insane i solemnly assert that i am one of the men who have had the honour of being ruined by you i have never seen you in my life before i know it i even admit that i attach no blame to you in the matter nevertheless you cost me two thousand five hundred and forty three francs and as you may judge by my costume i do not own the credit lyonnais if you will deign to hear my story i guarantee that it will convince you do you permit me to proceed the beauty nodded wonderingly and the shabby young man continued in the following words as i have said i am an author i shall 'live' by my poetry but i exist by my prose in fact i turn my pen to whatever promises a dinner be it a sonnet to the spring or a testimonial to a hair restorer one summer when dinners had been even more elusive than usual i conceived the idea of calling attention to my talents by means of an advertisement in reply i received a note bidding me be on the third step of the madeleine at four o'clock the following day and my correspondent proved to be a gentleman whose elegant apparel proclaimed him a parisian of the boulevard 'you are monsieur gustave tricotrin' he inquired 'i have that misfortune monsieur' said i we adjourned to a cafe and after a preliminary chat from which he deduced that i was a person of discretion he made me a proposal he said 'monsieur tricotrin it is evident that you and i were designed to improve each other's condition your dilemma is that being unknown you cannot dispose of your stories mine is that being known so well i am asked for more stories than i can possibly write i suggest that you shall write some for me i will sign them they will be paid for in accordance with my usual terms and you shall receive a generous share of the swag i need not impress upon you that i am speaking in the strictest confidence and that you must never breathe a word about our partnership even to the wife of your bosom' 'monsieur' i returned 'i have no wife to breathe to and my bosom is unsurpassed as a receptacle for secrets' 'good' he said 'well without beating about the bush i will tell you who i am' he then uttered a name that made me jump and before we parted it was arranged that i should supply him with a tale immediately as a specimen of my abilities this tale which i accomplished the same evening pleased him so well that he forthwith gave me an order for two more i can create a plot almost as rapidly as a debt and before long i had delivered manuscripts to him in such wholesale quantities that if i had been paid cash for them i should have been in a position to paint the butte the richest shade of red it was his custom however to make excuses and payments on account and as we were capital friends by now i never demurred well things went on in this fashion until one day he hinted to me that i had provided him with enough manuscripts to last him for two years his study was lumbered with evidence of my talent and his market after all was not unlimited he owed me then close upon three thousand francs and it was agreed that he should wipe the debt out by weekly instalments enfin i was content enough i foresaw an ample income for two years to come and renewed leisure to win immortality by my epics i trust that my narrative does not fatigue you mademoiselle what has it all to do with me however asked the lady you shall hear though the heroine comes on late she brings the house down when she enters for a few weeks my patron fulfilled his compact with tolerable punctuality but i never failed to notice when we met that he was a prey to some terrible grief at last when he had reduced the sum to two thousand five hundred and forty three francs the figures will be found graven on my heart he confided in me he made me a strange request he exclaimed 'tricotrin i am the most miserable of men' 'poor fellow' i responded 'it is of course a woman' 'precisely' he answered 'i adore her her beauty is incomparable her fascinations are unparalleled her intelligence is unique she has only one blemish she is mercenary' 'after all perfection would be tedious' i said 'you are a man of sensibility you understand' he cried 'her tastes have been a considerable strain on my resources and in consequence my affairs have become involved now that i am in difficulties she is giving me the chuck i have implored and besought i have worn myself out in appeals but her firmness is as striking as her other gifts there remains only one chance for me a letter so impassioned that it shall awake her pity i as i tell you am exhausted i can no longer plead no longer phrase i am a wreck will you as a friend as a poet compose such a letter and give it to me to copy' could i hesitate i drove my pen for him till daybreak all the yearnings of my own nature all the romance of my fiery youth i poured out in this appeal to a siren whom i had never seen and whose name i did not know i was distraught pathetic humorous and sublime by turns subtle gleams of wit flashed artistically across the lurid landscape of despair i reminded her of scenes of happiness vaguely because i had no details to elaborate the reminiscences however were so touching that i came near to believing in them mindful of her solitary blemish i referred to 'embarrassments now almost at an end' and so profoundly did i affect myself that while i wrote that i was weeping it was really true well when i saw the gentleman again he embraced me like a brother 'your letter was a masterpiece' he told me 'it has done the trick' mademoiselle i do not wish to say who he was and as you have known many celebrities and had many love letters you may not guess but the woman was you and if i had been a better business man i should have written less movingly for i recognised even during my inspiration that it was against my interests to reunite him to you i was an artist i thrilled your heart i restored you to his arms and you had the two thousand five hundred and forty three francs that would otherwise have come to me never could i extract another sou from him as tricotrin concluded his painful history mademoiselle blondette seemed so much amused that he feared she had entirely missed its pathos but his misgiving was relieved when she spoke it seems to me i have been expensive to you monsieur she said and you have certainly had nothing for your money since this revue which i own that i have merely glanced at is the apple of your eye i promise to read it with more attention a month later patatras was produced at la coupole after all and no one applauded its performance more enthusiastically than the poet who subsequently went to supper arm in arm with its creators mon vieux said the elated pair we will not ask again by what means you accomplished this miracle but let it teach you a lesson tonight's experience proves that nothing is beyond your power if you resolve to succeed it proves replied tricotrin that blondette's first impression was correct for between ourselves my children patatras is no shakes nevertheless lajeunie and pitou wore laurels in montmartre and one is happy to say that their fees raised the young collaborators from privation to prosperity thanks to blondette's attractions for nearly three weeks the danger of being a twin my confessions must begin when i was four years old and recovering from swollen glands as i grew well my twin brother gregoire who was some minutes younger was put to bed with the same complaint what a misfortune exclaimed our mother that silvestre is no sooner convalescent than gregoire falls ill the doctor answered it astonishes me madame lapalme that you were not prepared for it since the children are twins the thing was to be foreseen when the elder throws the malady off the younger naturally contracts it among twins it is nearly always so and it always proved to be so with gregoire and me no sooner did i throw off whooping cough than gregoire began to whoop though i was at home at vernon and he was staying with our grandmother at tours if i had to be taken to a dentist gregoire would soon afterwards be howling with toothache as often as i indulged in the pleasures of the table gregoire had a bilious attack the influence i exercised upon him was so remarkable that once when my bicycle ran away with me and broke my arm our mother consulted three medical men as to whether gregoire's bicycle was bound to run away with him too indeed my brother was distinctly apprehensive of it himself of course the medical men explained that he was susceptible to any abnormal physical or mental condition of mine not to the vagaries of my bicycle as an example madame if the elder of two twins were killed in a railway accident it would be no reason for thinking that an accident must befall a train by which the younger travelled what sympathy can there be between locomotives but if the elder were to die by his own hand there is a strong probability that the younger would commit suicide also however i have not died by my own hand so gregoire has had nothing to reproach me for on that score as to other grounds well there is much to be said on both sides to speak truly that beautiful devotion for which twins are so celebrated in drama and romance has never existed between my brother and myself nor was this my fault i was of a highly sensitive disposition and from my earliest years it was impressed upon me that gregoire regarded me in the light of a grievance i could not help having illnesses yet he would upbraid me for taking them then too he was always our mother's favourite and instead of there being caresses and condolence for me when i was indisposed there was nothing but grief for the indisposition that i was about to cause gregoire this wounded me again at college i shall not pretend that i was a bookworm or that i shared gregoire's ambitions on the contrary the world beyond the walls looked such a jolly place to me that the mere sight of a classroom would sometimes fill me with abhorrence but mon dieu if other fellows were wild occasionally they accepted the penalties and the affair was finished on me rested a responsibility my wildness was communicated to gregoire scarcely had i resigned myself to dull routine again when gregoire the industrious would find himself unable to study a page and commit freaks for which he rebuked me most sternly i swear that my chief remembrance of my college days is gregoire addressing pompous homilies to me in this fashion when he was in disgrace with the authorities i ask you to remember silvestre that you have not only your own welfare to consider you have mine i am here to qualify myself for an earnest career be good enough not to put obstacles in my path your levity impels me to distractions which i condemn even while i yield to them i perceive a weakness in your nature that fills me with misgivings for my future if you do not learn to resist temptation to what errors may i not be driven later on to what outbreaks of frivolity will you not condemn me when we are men well it is no part of my confession to whitewash myself his misgivings were realised so far as i had any serious aspirations at all i aspired to be a painter and after combating my family's objections i entered an art school in paris gregoire on the other hand was destined for the law during the next few years we met infrequently but that my brother continued to be affected by any unusual conditions of my body and mind i knew by his letters which seldom failed to contain expostulations and entreaties if he could have had his way indeed i believe he would have shut me in a monastery upon my word i was not without consideration for him but what would you have i think some sympathy was due to me also regard the situation with my eyes i was young popular an artist my life was no more frivolous than the lives of others of my set yet in lieu of being free like them to call the tune and dance the measure i was burdened with a heavier responsibility than weighs upon the shoulders of any paterfamilias let me but drink a bottle too much and gregoire the grave would subsequently manifest all the symptoms of intoxication let me but lose my head about a petticoat and gregoire the righteous would soon be running after a girl instead of attending to his work i had a conscience thoughts of the trouble that i was brewing for gregoire would come between me and the petticoat and rob it of its charms his abominable susceptibility to my caprices marred half my pleasures for me once when i sat distrait bowed by such reflections a woman exclaimed what's the matter with you one would think you had a family well i said i have a twin and i went away she was a pretty woman too do you suppose that maitre lapalme he was maitre lapalme by then this egregious gregoire do you suppose that he wrote to bless me for my sacrifice not at all of my heroisms he knew nothing he was conscious only of my lapses to read his letters one would have imagined that i was a reprobate a creature without honour or remorse i quote from one of them it is a specimen of them all can you blame me if i had no love for this correspondent my brother the circumstances of our birth your attention is directed to my preceding communications on this subject i desire to protest against the revelry from which you recovered either on the th or th inst on the afternoon of the latter date while engaged in a conference of the first magnitude i was seized with an overwhelming desire to dance a quadrille at a public ball i found it impossible to concentrate my attention on the case concerning which i was consulted i could no longer express myself with lucidity outwardly sedate reliable i sat at my desk dizzied by such visions as pursued st anthony to his cell no sooner was i free than i fled from vernon dined in paris bought a false beard and plunged wildly into the vortex of a dancing hall scoundrel this is past pardon my sensibilities revolt and my prudence shudders who shall say but that one night i may be recognised who can foretell to what blackmail you may expose me i maitre lapalme forbid your profligacies which devolve upon me i forbid etc such admissions my brother sent to me in a disguised hand and unsigned perhaps he feared that his blackmailer might prove to be myself typewriting was not yet general in france our mother still lived at vernon where she contemplated her favourite son's success with the profoundest pride occasionally i spent a few days with her sometimes even more for she always pressed me to remain i think she pressed me to remain not from any pleasure in my society but because she knew that while i was at home i could commit no actions that would corrupt gregoire one summer when i visited her i met mademoiselle leuillet mademoiselle leuillet was the daughter of a widower a neighbour i remembered that when our servant first announced her i thought what a nuisance how bored i am going to be and then she came in and in an instant i was spellbound i am tempted to describe berthe leuillet to you as she entered our salon that afternoon in a white frock with a basket of roses in her little hands but i know very well that no description of a girl ever painted her to anybody yet suffice it that she was beautiful as an angel that her voice was like the music of the spheres more than all that one felt all the time how good she is how good how good i suppose the impression that she made upon me was plainly to be seen for when she had gone my mother remarked you did not say much are you always so silent in girls' company no i answered i do not often meet such girls but afterwards i often met berthe leuillet never since i was a boy had i stayed at vernon for so long as now never had i repented so bitterly as now the error of my ways i loved and it seemed to me sometimes that my attachment was reciprocated yet my position forbade me to go to monsieur leuillet and ask boldly for his daughter's hand while i had remained obscure painters of my acquaintance whose talent was no more remarkable than my own had raised themselves from bohemia into prosperity i abused myself i acknowledged that i was an idler a good for nothing i declared that the punishment that had overtaken me was no more than i deserved and then well then i owned to berthe that i loved her deliberately of course i should not have done this before seeking her father's permission but it happened in the hour of our good bye and i was suffering too deeply to subdue the impulse i owned that i loved her and when i left for paris we were secretly engaged mon dieu now i worked indeed to win this girl for my own to show myself worthy of her innocent faith supplied me with the most powerful incentive in life in the quarter they regarded me first with ridicule then with wonder and finally with respect for my enthusiasm did not fade he has turned over a new leaf they said he means to be famous it was understood no more excursions for silvestre no more junketings and recklessness in the morning as soon as the sky was light i was at my easel in the evening i studied i sketched i wrote to berthe and re read her letters i was another man my ideal of happiness was now a wife and home for a year i lived this new life i progressed men men whose approval was a cachet began to speak of me as one with a future in the salon a picture of mine made something of a stir how i rejoiced how grateful and sanguine i was all paris sang berthe to me the criticisms in the papers the felicitations of my friends the praise of the public all meant berthe berthe with her arms about me berthe on my breast i said that it was not too soon for me to speak now i had proved my mettle and though i foresaw that her father would ask more before he gave his consent i was at least justified in avowing myself i telegraphed to my mother to expect me i packed my portmanteau with trembling hands and threw myself into a cab on the way to the station i noticed the window of a florist i bade the driver stop and ran in to bear off some lilies for berthe the shop was so full of wonderful flowers that once among them i found some difficulty in making my choice hence i missed the train and returned to my studio incensed by the delay a letter for me had just been delivered it told me that on the previous morning berthe had married my brother i could have welcomed a pistol shot my world rocked berthe lost false gregoire's wife i reiterated it i said it over and over i was stricken by it and yet i could not realise that actually it had happened it seemed too treacherous too horrible to be true oh i made certain of it later believe me i was no hero of a great serial to accept such intelligence without proof i assured myself of her perfidy and burnt her love letters one by one tore her photographs into shreds strove also to tear her image from my heart ah that mocked me that i could not tear a year before i should have rushed to the cafes for forgetfulness but now as the shock subsided i turned feverishly to work i told myself that she had wrecked my peace my faith in women that i hated and despised her but i swore that she should not have the triumph of wrecking my career too i said that my art still remained to me that i would find oblivion in my art brave words but one does not recover from such blows so easily for months i persisted denying myself the smallest respite clinging to a resolution which proved vainer daily were art to be mastered by dogged endeavour i should have conquered but alas though i could compel myself to paint i could not compel myself to paint well it was the perception of this fact that shattered me at last i had fought temptation for half a year worked with my teeth clenched worked against nature worked while my pulses beat and clamoured for the draughts of dissipation which promised a speedier release i had wooed art not as art's lover but as a tortured soul may turn to one woman in the desperate hope of subduing his passion for another and art would yield nothing to a suitor who approached like that i recognised that my work had been wasted that the struggle had been useless i broke down i need say little of the months that followed it would be a record of degradations and remorse alternately i fell and was ashamed there were days when i never left the house when i was repulsive to myself i shuddered at the horrors that i had committed no saint has loved virtue better than i did during those long sick days of self disgust no man was ever more sure of defying such hideous temptations if they recurred as my lassitude passed i would take up my brushes and feel confident for an hour or for a week and then temptation would creep on me once more humming in my ears and tingling in my veins and temptation had lost its loathsomeness now it looked again attractive it was a siren it dizzied my conscience and stupefied my common sense back to the mire one afternoon when i returned to my rooms from which i had been absent since the previous day i heard from the concierge that a visitor awaited me i climbed the stairs without anticipation my thoughts were sluggish my limbs leaden my eyes heavy and bloodshot twilight had gathered and as i entered i discerned merely the figure of a woman then she advanced and all hell seemed to leap flaring to my heart my visitor was berthe i think nearly a minute must have passed while we looked speechlessly in each other's face hers convulsed by entreaty mine dark with hate have you no word for me she whispered permit me to offer my congratulations on your marriage madame i said i have had no earlier opportunity forgive me she gasped i have come to beseech your forgiveness can you not forget the wrong i did you do i look as if i had forgotten i was inconstant cruel i cannot excuse myself but o silvestre in the name of the love you once bore me have pity on us reform abjure your evil courses do not i implore you condemn my husband to this abyss of depravity do not wreck my married life now i understood what had procured me the honour of a visit from this woman and i triumphed devilishly that i was the elder twin madame i answered i think that i owe you no explanations but i shall say this the evil courses that you deplore were adopted not vindictively but in the effort to numb the agony that you had made me suffer you but reap as you have sown reform she sobbed she sank on her knees before me silvestre in mercy to us reform i will never reform i said inflexibly i will grow more abandoned day by day my past faults shall shine as merits compared with the atrocities that are to come false girl monster of selfishness you are dragging me to the gutter and your only grief is that he must share my shame you have blackened my soul and you have no regret but that my iniquities must react on him by the shock that stunned him in the first flush of your honeymoon you know what i experienced when i received the news of your deceit by the anguish of repentance that overtakes him after each of his orgies which revolt you you know that i was capable of being a nobler man the degradation that you behold is your own work you have made me bad and you must bear the consequences you cannot make me good now to save your husband humbled and despairing she left me i repeat that it is no part of my confession to palliate my guilt the sight of her had served merely to inflame my resentment and it was at this stage that i began deliberately to contemplate revenge but not the one that i had threatened ah no i bethought myself of a vengeance more complete than that what after all were these escapades of his that were followed by contrition that saw him again and again a penitent at her feet there should be no more of such trifles she should be tortured with the torture that she had dealt to me i would make him adore another woman with all his heart and brain it was difficult for first i must adore and tire of another woman myself as my own passion faded his would be born i swore however that i would compass it that i would worship some woman for a year two years as long as possible he would be at peace in the meantime but the longer my enslavement lasted the longer berthe would suffer when her punishment began for some weeks now i worked again to provide myself with money i bought new clothes and made myself presentable when my appearance accorded better with my plan i paraded paris seeking the woman to adore you may think paris is full of adorable women well so contrary is human nature that never had i felt such indifference towards the sex as during that tedious quest never had a pair of brilliant eyes or a well turned neck appealed to me so little after a month my search seemed hopeless i had viewed women by the thousand but not one with whom i could persuade myself that i might fall violently in love how true it is that only the unforeseen comes to pass there was a model one louise whose fortune was her back and who had long bored me by an evident tenderness one day this louise usually so constrained in my presence appeared in high spirits and mentioned that she was going to be married the change in her demeanour interested me for the first time i perceived that the attractions of louise were not limited to her back a little piqued i invited her to dine with me if she had said yes doubtless that would have been the end of my interest but she refused before i parted from her i made an appointment for her to sit to me the next morning so you are going to be married louise i said carelessly as i set the palette in truth she answered no regrets what regrets could i have he is a very pretty boy and well to do believe me and i am not a pretty boy nor well to do hein ah zut she laughed you do not care for me is it so i said what would you say if i told you that i did care i should say that you told me too late monsieur she replied with a shrug are you ready for me to pose and this changed woman turned her peerless back on me without a scruple a little mortified i attended strictly to business for the rest of the morning but i found myself on the following day waiting for her with impatience and when is the event to take place i inquired more eagerly than i chose to acknowledge this was by no means the sort of enchantress that i had been seeking you understand in the spring she said look at the ring he has given to me monsieur is it not beautiful i remarked that louise's hands were very well shaped and indeed happiness had brought a certain charm to her face do you know louise that i am sorry that you are going to marry i exclaimed oh get out she laughed pushing me away it is no good your talking nonsense to me now don't flatter yourself pouchin the sculptor happened to come in at that moment sapristi he shouted what changes are to be seen the nose of our brave silvestre is out of joint now that we are affianced hein she joined in his laughter against me and i picked up my brush again in a vile humour well as i have said she was not the kind of woman that i had contemplated but these things arrange themselves i became seriously enamoured of her and recognising that fate works with her own instruments i did not struggle for months i was at louise's heels i was the sport of her whims and her slights sometimes even of her insults i actually made her an offer of marriage at which she snapped her white fingers with a grimace and the more she flouted me the more fascinated i grew in that rapturous hour when her insolent eyes softened to sentiment when her mocking mouth melted to a kiss i was in paradise my ecstasy was so supreme that i forgot to triumph at my approaching vengeance so i married louise and yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of our wedding berthe to speak the truth my plot against her was frustrated by an accident you see before i could communicate my passion to gregoire i had to recover from it and this invincible louise i have not recovered from it yet there are days when she turns her remarkable back on me now generally when i am idle but mon dieu the moments when she turns her lips are worth working for therefore berthe has been all the time quite happy with the good gregoire and since i possess louise upon my word of honour i do not mind hercules and aphrodite mademoiselle clairette used to say that if a danseuse could not throw a glance to the conductor of the band without the juggler being jealous the variety profession was coming to a pretty pass she also remarked that for a girl to entrust her life's happiness to a jealous man would be an act of lunacy and then little flouflou the juggling genius who was dying to marry her would suffer tortures he tried hard to conquer his failing but it must be owned that clairette's glances were very expressive and that she distributed them indiscriminately at chartres one night he was so upset that he missed the umbrella and the cigar and the hat one after another and instead of condoling with him when he came off the stage all she said was butter fingers promise to be my wife he would entreat it is not knowing where i am that gives me the pip if you consented i should be as right as rain your word is better to me than any management's contract i trust you it is only myself that i doubt every time you look at a man i wonder 'am i up to that chap's mark is my turn as clever as his isn't it likely he will cut me out with her' if you only belonged to me i should never be jealous again as long as i lived straight and clairette would answer firmly poor boy you couldn't help it you are made like that there'd be ructions every week i should be for ever in hot water i like you very much flouflou but i'm not going to play the giddy goat chuck it nevertheless he continued to worship her from her tawdry tiara to her tinselled shoes and everybody was sure that it would be a match one day that is to say everybody was sure of it until the strong man had joined the troupe hercule was advertised as the great paris star holding himself very erect he strutted in his latticed foot gear with stiff little steps and inflated lungs to the footlights and tore chains to pieces as easily as other persons tear bills he lay down and supported a posse of mere mortals and a van load of properties on his chest and regained his feet with a skip and a smirk he but his achievements are well known preceding these feats of force was a feature of his entertainment which hercule enjoyed inordinately he stood on a pedestal and struck attitudes to show the splendour of his physique wearing only a girdle of tiger skin and bathed in limelight he felt himself to be as glorious as a god the applause was a nightly intoxication to him he lived for it all day he looked forward to the moment when he could mount the pedestal again and make his biceps jump and exhibit the magnificence of his highly developed back to hundreds of wondering eyes no woman was ever vainer of her form than was hercule of his no woman ever contemplated her charms more tenderly than hercule regarded his muscles the latter half of his turn was fatiguing but to posture in the limelight while the audience stared open mouthed and admired his nakedness that was fine it was dominion it was bliss hercule had never experienced a great passion the passion of vanity excepted never waited in the rain at a street corner for a coquette who did not come nor sighed like the juggler under the window of a girl who flouted his declarations he had but permitted homage to be rendered to him so when he fell in love with clairette he didn't know what to make of it for clairette sprightly as she was did not encourage hercule he at once attracted and repelled her when he rent chains and poised prodigious weights above his head she thrilled at his prowess but the next time he attitudinised in the tiger skin she turned up her nose she recognised something feminine in the giant instinct told her that by disposition the strong man was less manly than little flouflou whom he could have swung like an indian club no hercule didn't know what to make of it it was a new and painful thing to find himself the victim instead of the conqueror for once in his career he hung about the wings wistfully seeking a sign of approval for once he displayed his majestic figure on the pedestal blankly conscious of being viewed by a woman whom he failed to impress what do you think of my turn he questioned at last oh i have seen worse was all she granted the giant winced i am the strongest man in the world he proclaimed i have never met a strong man who wasn't said she but there is someone stronger than i am he owned humbly hercule humble do you know what you have done to me clairette you have made a fool of me my dear don't be so cheeky she returned who gave you leave to call me 'clairette' and 'my dear' a little more politeness if you please monsieur and she cut the conversation short as unceremoniously as if he had been a super those who have seen hercule only in his act who think of him superb supreme may find it difficult to credit the statement but honestly the great star used to trot at her heels like a poodle and she was not a beauty by any means with her impudent nose and her mouth that was too big to defy criticism perhaps it was her carriage that fascinated him the grace of her slender figure which he could have snapped as a child snaps jumbles perhaps it was those eyes which unwittingly promised more than she gave perhaps above all it was her indifference yes on consideration it must have been her indifferent air the novelty of being scorned that made him a slave but of course she was more flattered by his bondage than she showed every night he planted himself in the prompt entrance to watch her dance and clap his powerful hands in adulation she could not be insensible to the compliment though her smiles were oftenest for flouflou who planted himself adulating on the opposite side adagio allegretto vivace unperceived by the audience the gaze of the two men would meet across the stage with misgiving each feared the other's attentions to her each wished with all his heart that the other would get the sack they glared at each other horribly and meanwhile the orchestra played its sweetest and clairette pirouetted her best and the public approving the obvious saw nothing of the intensity of the situation imagine the emotions of the little juggler jealous by temperament jealous even without cause now that he beheld a giant laying siege to her affections and then on a certain evening clairette threw but two smiles to flouflou and three to hercule the truth is that she did not attach so much significance to the smiles as did the opponents who counted them but that accident was momentous the strong man made her a burning offer of marriage within half an hour and next the juggler made her furious reproaches now she had rejected the strong man and coming when they did the juggler's reproaches had a totally different effect from the one that he had intended so far from exciting her sympathy towards him they accentuated her compassion for hercule how stricken he had been by her refusal she could not help remembering his despair as he sat huddled on a hamper a giant that she had crushed flouflou was a thankless little pig she reflected for as a matter of fact he had had a good deal to do with her decision she had deserved a better reward than to be abused by him yes her sentiments towards hercule were newly tender and an event of the next night intensified them it was hercule's custom in every town that the constellation visited to issue a challenge he pledged himself to present a purse of gold it contained a ten franc piece to any eight men who vanquished him in a tug of war the spectacle was always an immense success the eight yokels straining and tumbling over one another while hercule wearing a masterful smile kept his ten francs intact a tug of war had been arranged for the night following and by every law of prudence hercule should have abstained from the bottle during the day but he did not his misery sent discretion headlong to the winds every time that he groaned for the danseuse he took another drink and when the time came for him to go to the show the giant was as drunk as a lord the force of habit enabled him to fulfil some of his stereotyped performance he emerged from that without disgrace but when the eight brawny competitors lumbered on to the boards his heart sank the other artists winked at one another appreciatively and the manager hopped with apprehension sure enough the hero's legs made strange trips to night the sixteen arms pulled him not only over the chalk line but all over the stage they played havoc with him and then the manager had to go on and make a speech besides because the purse of gold aroused dissatisfaction the fiasco was hideous ah clairette moaned the strong man pitifully it was all through you elsewhere a strong man had put forth that plea and the other lady had been inexorable but clairette faltered through me she murmured with emotion i'm no boozer muttered hercule whom the disaster had sobered if i took too much today it was because i had got such a hump but why be mashed on me hercule she said why not think of me as a pal you're talking silly grunted hercule perhaps so she confessed but i'm awfully sorry the turn went so rotten don't kid why should i kid about it if you really meant it you would take back what you said yesterday oh the gesture was dismayed you see what's the good of gassing as soon as i ask anything of you you dry up bah i daresay you will guy me just as much as all the rest i know you if you weren't in trouble i'd give you a thick ear for that she said you ungrateful brute she turned haughtily away clairette oh rats don't get the needle i'm off my rocker to night ah that's all right cully her hand was swift i've been there myself clairette he caught her close here what are you at she cried drop it clairette say 'yes' i'm loony about you there's a duck i'll be a daisy of a husband won't you oh i i don't know she stammered and thus were they betrothed to express what flouflou felt would be but to harrow the reader's sensibilities what he said rendered into english was i'd rather you had given me the go by for any cove in the crowd than that swine they were in the ladies' dressing room the two bonbons had not finished their duet and he was alone with her for a moment she was pinning a switch into her back hair in front of the scrap of looking glass against the mildewed wall you don't do yourself any good with me flouflou by calling hercule names she replied icily so he is oh you are jealous of him she retorted of course i am jealous of him owned flouflou you can't rile me by saying that didn't i love you first and a lump better than he does now you're talking through your hat you usedn't to take any truck of him yourself at the beginning he only got round you because he was drunk and queered his business i have been drunk too you didn't say you'd marry me it's not in him to love any girl for long he's too sweet on himself look here she exclaimed i've had enough hook it and don't you speak to me any more understand she put the hairpins aside and began to whitewash her hands and arms that's the straight tip said flouflou brokenly i'm off well i wish you luck old dear running him down to me like that a dirty trick i call it i never meant to straight i sorry clairette he lingered at the door i suppose i shall have to say 'madame' soon footle she murmured moved you've not got your knife into me have you clairette i didn't mean to be a beast i'd have gone to hell for you that's all and i wish i was dead silly kid she faltered blinking and then the two bonbons came back to doff their costumes and he was turned out never had hercule been so puffed up his knowledge of the juggler's sufferings made the victory more rapturous still no longer did flouflou stand opposite prompt to watch clairette's dance no longer did he loiter about the passages after the curtain was down on the chance of being permitted to escort her to her doorstep such privileges were the strong man's alone she was affianced to him at the swelling thought his chest became brobdingnagian his bounce in company was now colossal and it afforded the troupe a popular entertainment to see him drop to servility in her presence her frown was sufficient to reduce him to a cringe they called him the quick change artist but hercule scarcely minded cringing to her at all events he scarcely minded it in a tete a tete she was unique he would have run to her whistle and fawned at her kick she had agreed to marry him in a few weeks' time and his head swam at the prospect visions of the future dazzled him when he saw her to her home after the performance he used to talk of the joint engagements they would get by and by not in snide shows like this but in first class halls and of how tremendously happy they were going to be and then clairette would stifle a sigh and say oh yes of course and try to persuade herself that she had no regrets meanwhile the constellation had not been playing to such good business as the manager had anticipated he had done a bold thing in obtaining hercule who if not so famous as the posters pretended was at least a couple of rungs above the other humble mountebanks and the box office ought to have yielded better results monsieur blond was anxious he asked himself what the public wanted simultaneously he pondered the idea of a further attraction and perspired at the thought of further expense at this time the living statuary turn was the latest craze in the variety halls of fashion and one day poor blond casting an expert eye on his danseuse questioned why she should not be billed a town or two ahead as aphrodite the animated statue direct from paris to question was to act the weather was mild and though clairette experienced pangs of modesty when she learnt that the statue's costume was to be applied with a sponge she could not assert that she would be in danger of taking a chill besides her salary was to be raised a trifle blond rehearsed her assiduously madame blond in attendance and to his joy she displayed a remarkable gift for adopting the poses as the bather she promised to be entrancing and until she wobbled her nymph at the fountain was a pure delight moreover thanks to her accomplishments as a dancer she did not wobble very badly all the same when the date of her debut arrived she was extremely nervous elated by his inspiration blond had for once been prodigal with the printing and on her way to the stage door it seemed to her that the name of aphrodite flamed from every hoarding in the place hercule met her with encouraging words but the ordeal was not one that she wished to discuss with him and he took leave of her very much afraid that she would break down what was his astonishment to hear her greeted with salvos of applause blond's enterprise had undoubtedly done the trick the little hall rocked with enthusiasm and cloaked in a voluminous garment aphrodite had to bow her acknowledgments again and again when the time came for hercule's own postures they fell by comparison quite flat ciel she babbled on the homeward walk who would have supposed that i should go so strong if i knock them like this next week too i shall make blond spring a bit more she looked towards her lover for congratulations so far he had been rather unsatisfactory oh well he mumbled it was a very good audience you know i never saw a more generous house you can't expect to catch on like it anywhere else his tone puzzled her though she was quite alive to the weaknesses of her profession she could not believe that her triumph could give umbrage to her fiance hercule her adorer to be annoyed because she had received more hands than he had oh it was mean of her to fancy such a thing but she was conscious that he had never wished her pleasant dreams so briefly as he did that night and the strong man on his side was conscious of a strange depression he could not shake it off the next evening too he felt it wherever he went he heard praises of her proportions the dancing girl had in fact proved to be beautifully formed and it could not be disputed that aphrodite had wiped hercules out her success was repeated in every town morosely now did he make his biceps jump and exhibit the splendours of his back his poses commanded no more than half the admiration evoked by hers his muscles had been eclipsed by her graces her body had outvied his own oh she was dear to him but he was an artiste there are trials that an artiste cannot bear he hesitated to refer to the subject but when he nursed her on his lap he thought what a great fool the public was to prefer this ordinary woman to a marvellous man he derived less rapture from nursing her he eyed her critically his devotion was cankered by resentment and each evening the resentment deepened and each evening it forced him to the wings against his will he stood watching though every burst of approval wrung his heart soured and sexless he watched her an intense jealousy of the slim nude figure posturing in the limelight took possession of him it had robbed him of his plaudits he grew to hate it to loathe the white loveliness that had dethroned him it was no longer the figure of a mistress that he viewed but the figure of a rival if he had dared he would have hissed her finally he found it impossible to address her with civility and clairette married flouflou after all clairette said flouflou on the day they were engaged if you don't chuck the statuary turn i know that one night i shall massacre the audience won't you give it up for me peach so you are beginning your ructions already laughed clairette i told you what a handful you would be oh well then just as you like old dear in this business a girl may meet with a worse kind of jealousy than yours pardon you are mademoiselle girard a newsvendor passed along the terrace of the cafe d'harcourt bawling la voix parisienne the frenchman at my table made a gesture of aversion our eyes met i said you do not like la voix he answered with intensity i loathe it what's its offence the wastrel frowned he fiddled with his frayed and filthy collar you revive painful associations you ask me for a humiliating story he murmured and regarded his empty glass i can take a hint as well as most people he prepared his poison reflectively i will tell you all he said one autumn the editor of la voix announced to the assistant editor i have a great idea for booming the paper the assistant editor gazed at him respectfully i propose to prove in the public interest the difficulty of tracing a missing person i shall instruct a member of the staff to disappear i shall publish his description and his portrait and i shall offer a prize to the first stranger who identifies him the assistant editor had tact and he did not reply that the idea had already been worked in london with a disappearing lady he replied what an original scheme it might be even more effective that the disappearing person should be a lady added the chief like one inspired that cried the assistant editor is the top brick of genius so the editor reviewed the brief list of his lady contributors and sent for mademoiselle girard his choice fell upon mademoiselle girard for two reasons first she was not facially remarkable a smudgy portrait of her would look much like a smudgy portrait of anybody else second she was not widely known in paris being at the beginning of her career in fact she was so inexperienced that hitherto she had been entrusted only with criticism however the young woman had all her buttons on and after he had talked to her she said cheerfully without a chaperon i should be conspicuous and without a fat purse i should be handicapped so it is understood that i am to provide myself with a suitable companion and to draw upon the office for expenses mademoiselle returned the editor the purpose of the paper is to portray a drama of life not to emulate an opera bouffe i shall explain more fully please figure to yourself that you are a young girl in an unhappy home let us suppose that a stepmother is at fault you feel that you can submit to her oppression no longer you resolve to be free or to end your troubles in the seine weeping you pack your modest handbag you cast a last lingering look at the oil painting of your own dear mother who is with the angels in the drawing room that is to say of your own dear mother in the drawing room who is with the angels it still hangs there your father has insisted on it unheard you steal from the house the mysterious city of paris stretches before your friendless feet can you engage a chaperon can you draw upon an office for expenses the idea is laughable you have saved at a liberal computation forty francs it is necessary for you to find employment without delay but what happens your father is distracted by your loss the thought of the perils that beset you frenzies him he invokes the aid of the police well the object of our experiment is to demonstrate that in spite of an advertised reward in spite of a published portrait in spite of the public's zeal itself you will be passed on the boulevards and in the slums by myriads of unsuspecting eyes for weeks the girl inquired much less blithely how long is this experiment to continue it will continue until you are identified of course the longer the period the more triumphant our demonstration and i am to have no more than forty francs to exist on all the time monsieur the job does not call to me you are young and you fail to grasp the value of your opportunity said the editor with paternal tolerance from such an assignment you will derive experiences that will be of the highest benefit to your future rejoice my child very soon i shall give you final instructions the frenchman lifted his glass which was again empty i trust my voice does not begin to grate upon you he asked solicitously much talking affects my uvula i made a trite inquiry he answered that since i was so pressing he would listen he resumed after a sip i am not in a position to say whether the young lady humoured the editor by rejoicing but she obeyed him by going forth her portrait was duly published la volx professed ignorance of her whereabouts from the moment that she left the rue louis le grand and a prize of two thousand francs was to reward the first stranger who said to her pardon you are mademoiselle girard in every issue the public were urged towards more strenuous efforts to discover her and all paris bought the paper with amusement to learn if she was found yet at the beginning of the week misgivings were ingeniously hinted as to her fate on the tenth day the editor printed a letter which he had written himself hotly condemning him for exposing a poor girl to danger it was signed an indignant parent and teemed with the most stimulating suggestions copies of la voix were as prevalent as gingerbread pigs at a fair when a fortnight had passed the prize was increased to three thousand francs and many young men resigned less promising occupations such as authorship and the fine arts in order to devote themselves exclusively to the search personally i had something else to do i am an author as you may have divined by the rhythm of my impromptu phrases but it happened at that time that a play of mine had been accepted at the grand guignol subject to an additional thrill being introduced and i preferred pondering for a thrill in my garret to hunting for a pin in a haystack enfin i completed the drama to the management's satisfaction and received a comely little cheque in payment it was the first cheque that i had seen for years i danced with joy i paid for a shampoo i committed no end of follies how good is life when one is rich immediately one joins the optimists i feared the future no longer i was hungry and i let my appetite do as it liked with me i lodged in montmartre and it was my custom to eat at the unpretentious bel avenir when i ate at all but that morning my mood demanded something resplendent rumours had reached me of a certain cafe eclatant where for one franc fifty one might breakfast on five epicurean courses amid palms and plush i said i would go the pace i adventured the cafe eclatant the interior realised my most sanguine expectations the room would have done no discredit to the grand boulevard i was so much exhilarated that i ordered a half bottle of barsac though i noted that here it cost ten sous more than at the bel avenir and i prepared to enjoy the unwonted extravagance of my repast to the concluding crumb monsieur there are events in life of which it is difficult to speak without bitterness when i recall the disappointment of that dejeuner at the cafe eclatant my heart swells with rage the soup was slush the fish tasted like washing the meat was rags dessert consisted of wizened grapes the one thing fit to eat was the cheese as i meditated on the sum i had squandered i could have cried with mortification and to make matters more pathetic still i was as hungry as ever i sat seeking some caustic epigram to wither the dame de comptoir and presently the door opened and another victim entered her face was pale and interesting i saw by her hesitation that the place was strange to her an accomplice of the chief brigand pounced on her immediately and bore her to a table opposite the misguided girl was about to waste one franc fifty i felt that i owed a duty to her in this crisis the moment called for instant action before she could decide between slush and hors d'oeuvres i pulled an envelope from my pocket scribbled a warning and expressed it to her by the robber who had brought my bill i had written the dejeuner is dreadful escape it reached her in the nick of time she read the wrong side of the envelope first and was evidently puzzled then she turned it over a look of surprise a look of thankfulness rendered her still more fascinating i perceived that she was inventing an excuse that she pretended to have forgotten something she rose hastily and went out my barsac was finished shocking bad tipple it was for the money and now i too got up and left when i issued into the street i found her waiting for me i think you are the knight to whom my gratitude is due monsieur she murmured graciously mademoiselle you magnify the importance of my service said i it was a gallant deed she insisted you have saved me from a great misfortune perhaps greater than you understand my finances are at their lowest ebb and to have beggared myself for an impossible meal would have been no joke thanks to you i may still breakfast satisfactorily somewhere else is it treating you like baedeker's guide to the continent if i ask you to recommend a restaurant upon my word i doubt if you can do better than the bel avenir i said a moment ago i was lacerated with regret that i had not gone there but there is a silver lining to every hash house and my choice of the eclatant has procured me the glory of your greeting she averted her gaze with a faint smile she had certainly charm admiration and hunger prompted me to further recklessness i said this five course swindle has left me ravenous and i am bound for the avenir myself may i beg for the rapture of your company there monsieur you overwhelm me with chivalries she replied i shall be enchanted and five minutes later the incognita and i were polishing off smoked herring and potato salad like people who had no time to lose do you generally come here she asked when we had leisure infrequently no oftener than i have a franc in my pocket but details of my fasts would form a poor recital and i make a capital listener you also make a capital luncheon she remarked do not prevaricate i said severely i am consumed with impatience to hear the history of your life be merciful and communicative well i am young fair accomplished and of an amiable disposition she began leaning her elbows on the table these things are obvious come to confidences what is your profession by profession i am a clairvoyante and palmist she announced i gave her my hand at once and i was in two minds about giving her my heart proceed i told her reveal my destiny her air was profoundly mystical in the days of your youth she proclaimed your line of authorship is crossed by many rejections oh i am an author hein that's a fine thing in guesses it is written she affirmed still scrutinising my palm your dramatic lines are er countless some of them are good i see danger you should beware of i cannot distinguish she clasped her brow and shivered ah i have it you should beware of hackneyed situations so the drama is 'written' too is it it is written and i discern that it is already accepted she said for at the juncture where the eclatant is eclipsed by the cafe du bel avenir there is a distinct manifestation of cash marvellous i exclaimed and will the sybil explain why she surmised that i was a dramatic author even so she boasted you wrote your message to me on an envelope from the dramatic authors' society what do you think of my palmistry i cannot say that i think it is your career you are more likely an author yourself or an actress or a journalist perhaps you are mademoiselle girard mon dieu what a piece of luck for me if i found mademoiselle girard and what a piece of luck for her why for her well she cannot be having a rollicking time it would not break her heart to be found one may be certain in that case i said she has only to give some one the tip oh that would be dishonourable she has a duty to fulfil to la voix she must wait till she is identified and remember there must be no half measures the young man must have the intuition to say firmly 'pardon you are mademoiselle girard' her earnest gaze met mine for an instant as a matter of fact i said i do not see how anyone can be expected to identify her in the street the portrait shows her without a hat and a hat makes a tremendous difference she sighed what is your trouble i asked man man tell me his address that i may slay him the whole sex its impenetrable stupidity if mademoiselle girard is ever recognised it will be by a woman man has no instinct may one inquire the cause of these flattering reflections her laughter pealed let us talk of something else she commanded when does your play come out monsieur thibaud hippolyte duboc you see i learnt your name too you have all the advantages i complained will you take a second cup of coffee mademoiselle er no thank you monsieur she said well will you take a liqueur mademoiselle er mademoiselle er will not take a liqueur either she pouted well will you take a walk in the end we took an omnibus and then we proceeded to the buttes chaumont and very agreeable i found it there we chose a seat in the shade and i began to feel that i had known her all my life more precisely perhaps i began to feel that i wished to know her all my life a little breeze was whispering through the boughs and she lifted her face to it gratefully how delicious she said i should like to take off my hat do then shall i why not she pulled the pins out slowly and laid the hat aside and raised her eyes to me smiling well she murmured you are beautiful is that all what more would you have me say the glare of sunshine mellowed while we talked clocks struck unheeded by me it amazed me at last to discover how long she had held me captive still i knew nothing of her affairs excepting that she was hard up that by comparison i was temporarily prosperous i did not even know where she meant to go when we moved nor did it appear necessary to inquire yet for the sentiment in her tones assured me that she would dismiss me with no heartless haste two men came strolling past the bench and one of them stared at her so impudently that i burned with indignation after looking duels at him i turned to her to deprecate his rudeness judge of my dismay when i perceived that she was shuddering with emotion jealousy blackened the gardens to me who is that man i exclaimed i don't know she faltered you don't know but you are trembling am i i ask you who he is how he dared to look at you like that am i responsible for the way a loafer looks you are responsible for your agitation i ask you to explain it and by what right after all by what right wretched false hearted girl has our communion for hours given me no rights am i a frenchman or a flounder answer you are condemning me to tortures why did you tremble under that man's eyes i was afraid she stammered afraid afraid that he had recognised me mon dieu of what are you guilty i am not guilty of what are you accused i can tell you nothing she gasped you shall tell me all i swore in the name of my love i demand it of you speak why did you fear his recognition her head drooped pitifully because i wanted you to recognise me first for a tense moment i gazed at her bewildered in the next i cursed myself for a fool i blushed for my suspicions my obtuseness i sought dizzily the words the prescribed words that i must speak pardon i shouted you are mademoiselle girard she sobbed what have i done you have done a great and generous thing i am humbled before you i bless you i don't know how i could have been such a dolt as not to guess oh how i wish you had guessed you have been so kind to me i longed for you to guess and now i have betrayed a trust i have been a bad journalist you have been a good friend courage no one will ever hear what has happened and anyhow it is all the same to the paper whether the prize is paid to me or to somebody else yes she admitted that is true oh when that man turned round and looked at me i thought your chance had gone i made sure it was all over well she forced a smile it is no use my being sorry is it mademoiselle girard is 'found' but you must not be sorry i said come a disagreeable job is finished and you have the additional satisfaction of knowing the money goes to a fellow you don't altogether dislike what do i have to do about it hein you must telegraph to la voix at once that you have identified me then in the morning you should go to the office i can depend upon you can't i you will never give me away to a living soul word of honour i vowed what do you take me for do tell me you don't regret there's a dear tell me you don't regret she threw back her head dauntlessly no she said i don't regret only in justice to me remember that i was treacherous in order to do a turn to you not to escape my own discomforts to be candid i believe that i wish we had met in two or three weeks' time instead of to day why that in two or three weeks' time the prize was to be raised to five thousand francs to keep up the excitement ciel i cried five thousand francs do you know that positively oh yes she nodded it is arranged five thousand francs would have been a fortune to me neither of us spoke for some seconds then continuing my thoughts aloud i said after all why should i telegraph at once what is to prevent my waiting the two or three weeks oh to allow you to do that would be scandalous of me she demurred i should be actually swindling la voix la voix will obtain a magnificent advertisement for its outlay which is all that it desires i argued the boom will be worth five thousand francs to la voix there is no question of swindling five thousand francs is a sum with which one might it can't be done she persisted to a man in my position i said five thousand francs it is impossible for another reason as i told you i am at the end of my resources i rose this morning praying that i should be identified my landlady has turned me out and i have no more than the price of one meal to go on with you goose i laughed and if i were going to net five thousand francs by your tip three weeks hence don't you suppose it would be good enough for me to pay your expenses in the meanwhile she was silent again i understood that her conscience was a more formidable drawback than her penury monsieur i said that you had asked me for a humiliating story that i had poignant memories connected with la voix here is one of them i set myself to override her scruples to render this girl false to her employers many men might have done so without remorse but not a man like me i am naturally high minded of the most sensitive honour even when i conquered at last i could not triumph far from it i blamed the force of circumstances furiously for compelling me to sacrifice my principles to my purse i am no adventurer hein enfin the problem now was where was i to hide her her portmanteau she had deposited at a railway station should we have it removed to another bedroom or to a pension de famille both plans were open to objections a bedroom would necessitate her still challenging discovery in restaurants and at a pension de famille she would run risks on the premises a pretty kettle of fish if someone spotted her while i was holding for the rise we debated the point exhaustively and having yielded she displayed keen intelligence in arranging for the best finally she declared of the two things a pension de famille is to be preferred install me there as your sister remember that people picture me a wanderer and alone therefore a lady who is introduced by her brother is in small danger of being recognized as mademoiselle girard she was right i perceived it we found an excellent house where i was unknown i presented her as mademoiselle henriette delafosse my sister and to be on the safe side i engaged a private sitting room for her explaining that she was somewhat neurasthenic good i waited breathless now for every edition of la voix thinking that her price might advance even sooner but she closed at three thousand francs daily girard stood firm but there was no upward tendency every afternoon i called on her she talked about that conscience of hers again sometimes and it did not prove quite so delightful as i had expected when i paid a visit especially when i paid a bill as well monsieur my disposition is most liberal but when i had been mulcted in the second bill i confess that i became a trifle downcast i had prepared myself to nourish the girl wholesomely as befitted the circumstances but i had said nothing of vin superieur and i noted that she had been asking for it as if it were cider in normandy the list of extras in those bills gave me the jumps and the charges made for scented soap were nothing short of an outrage well there was but one more week to bear now and during the week i allowed her to revel this though i was approaching embarrassments re the rent of my own attic how strange is life who shall foretell the future i had wrestled with my self respect i had nursed an investment which promised stupendous profits were i capable of carrying my scheme to a callous conclusion but could i do it did i claim the prize which had already cost me so much monsieur you are a man of the world a judge of character i ask you did i claim the prize or did i not he threw himself back in the chair and toyed significantly with his empty glass i regarded him his irresolute mouth his receding chin his unquenchable thirst for absinthe i regarded him and i paid him no compliments i said you claimed the prize you have made a bloomer he answered i did not claim it the prize was claimed by the wife of a piano tuner who had discovered mademoiselle girard employed in the artificial flower department of the printemps i read the bloodcurdling news at nine o'clock on a friday evening and at when i hurled myself panic stricken into the pension de famille the impostor who had tricked me out of three weeks' board and lodging had already done a bolt i have never had the joy of meeting her since how tricotkin saw london one day tricotrin had eighty francs and he said to pitou who was no less prosperous good bye to follies for we have arrived at an epoch in our careers do not let us waste our substance on trivial pleasures or paying the landlord let us make it a provision for our future i rejoice to hear you speak for once like a business man returned pitou do you recommend gilt edged securities or an investment in land i would suggest rather that we apply our riches to some educational purpose such as travel explained the poet producing a railway company's handbill by this means we shall enlarge our minds and somebody has pretended that 'knowledge is power' it must have been the principal of a school it is not for nothing that we have l'entente cordiale you may now spend a sunday in london at about the cost of one of madeleine's hats these london sunday baits may be a plot of the english government to exterminate us i have read that none but english people can survive a sunday in london no it is not that for we are offered the choice of a town called 'eastbourne' listen they tell me that in london the price of cigarettes is so much lower than with us that to a bold smuggler the trip is a veritable economy matches too matches are so cheap in england that the practice of stealing them from cafe tables has not been introduced well your synopsis will be considered and reported on in due course announced the composer after a pause but at the moment of going to press we would rather buy a hat for madeleine and as madeleine also thought that this would be better for him it was decided that tricotrin should set forth alone his departure for a foreign country was a solemn event a small party of the montmartrois had marched with him to the station and more than once in view of their anxious faces the young man acknowledged mentally that he was committed to a harebrained scheme heaven protect thee my comrade faltered pitou is thy vocabulary safely in thy pocket remember that 'un bock' is 'glass of beer' here is a small packet of chocolate murmured lajeunie embracing him in england nothing to eat can be obtained on sunday and chocolate is very sustaining and listen shouted sanquereau on no account take off thy hat to strangers nor laugh in the streets the first is 'mad' over there and the second is 'immoral' may le bon dieu have thee in his keeping we count the hours till thy return then the train sped out into the night and the poet realised that home and friends were left behind he would have been less than a poet if in the first few minutes the pathos of the situation had not gripped him by the throat vague elusive fancies stirred his brain he remembered the franc that he owed at the cafe du bel avenir and wondered if madame would speak gently of him were he lost at sea tender memories of past loves dimmed his eyes and he reflected how poignant it would be to perish before the papers would give him any obituary notices regarding his fellow passengers he lamented that none of them was a beautiful girl for it was an occasion on which woman's sympathy would have been sweet indeed he proceeded to invent some of the things that they might have said to each other inwardly he was still resenting the faces of his travelling companions when the train reached dieppe it is material for my biography he soliloquised as he crept down the gangway few who saw the young man step firmly on to the good ship's deck conjectured the emotions that tore his heart few recognised him to be tricotrin whose work was at that date practically unknown' but as a matter of fact he did arouse conjectures of a kind for when the boat moved from the quay he could not resist the opportunity to murmur my france farewell with an appropriate gesture his repose during the night was fitful and when victoria was reached at last he was conscious of some bodily fatigue however his mind was never slow to receive impressions and at the sight of the scaffolding he whipped out his note book on the platform he wrote the english are extraordinarily prompt of action one day it was discerned that la gare victoria was capable of improvement no sooner was the fact detected than an army of contractors was feverishly enlarging it pleased that his journey was already yielding such good results the poet lit a caporal and sauntered through the yard though the sky promised a fine sunday his view of london at this early hour was not inspiriting he loitered blankly debating which way to wander presently the outlook brightened he observed a very dainty pair of shoes and ankles coming through the station doors fearing that the face might be unworthy of them he did not venture to raise his gaze until the girl had nearly reached the gate but when he took the risk he was rewarded by the discovery that her features were as piquant as her feet she came towards him slowly and now he remarked that she had a grudge against fate her pretty lips were compressed her beautiful eyes gloomy with grievance the fairness of her brow was darkened by a frown well mused tricotrin though the object of my visit is educational the exigencies of my situation clearly compel me to ask this young lady to direct me somewhere can i summon up enough english before she has passed it was a trying moment for already she was nearly abreast of him forgetful of sanquereau's instructions as well as of most of the phrases that had been committed to memory the poet swept off his hat and stammered mees i beg your pardon she turned the aggrieved eyes to him inquiringly although she had paused she made no answer was his accent so atrocious as all that for a second they regarded each other dumbly while a blush of embarrassment mantled the young man's cheeks then with a little gesture of apology the girl said in french i do not speak english monsieur oh le bon dieu be praised cried tricotrin for all the world as if he had been back on the boulevard rochechouart i was dazed with travel or i should have recognized you were a frenchwoman did you too leave paris last night mademoiselle ah no said the girl pensively i have been in london for months i hoped to meet a friend who wrote that she would arrive this morning but she sighed she has not come she will arrive to night instead no doubt i should have no anxiety you may be certain she will arrive to night and this contretemps will be forgotten she pouted i was looking forward so much to seeing her to a stranger who cannot speak the language london is as triste as a tomb today i was to have had a companion and now indeed i sympathise with you replied tricotrin but is it really so london is what you say you alarm me i am here absolutely alone where then shall i go this morning there are churches she said after some reflection and besides w e ll there are other churches of course such things can be seen in paris also demurred tricotrin it is not essential to go abroad to say one's prayers if i may take the liberty of applying to you in which direction would you recommend me to turn my steps for example where is soho is it too far for a walk no monsieur it is not very far it is the quarter in which i lodge and do you return there now he asked eagerly what else is there for me to do my friend has not come and mademoiselle exclaimed the poet i entreat you to have mercy on a compatriot permit me at least to seek soho in your company do not i implore you leave me homeless and helpless in a strange land i notice an eccentric vehicle which instinct whispers is an english 'hansom' for years i have aspired to drive in an english hansom once it is in your power to fulfil my dream with effulgence will you consent to instruct the acrobat who is performing with a whip and to take a seat in the english hansom beside me monsieur responded the pretty girl graciously i shall be charmed and romantic as the incident appears the next minute they were driving along victoria street together the good kind fairies have certainly taken me under their wings declared tricotrin as he admired his companion's profile it was worth enduring the pangs of exile to meet with such kindness as you have shown me i am afraid you will speedily pronounce the fairies fickle said she for our drive will soon be over and you will find soho no fairyland how comes it that your place of residence is so unsuitable to you mademoiselle i lodge in the neighbourhood of the coiffeur's where i am employed monsieur where i handle the tails and transformations our specialty is artificial eyelashes the attachment is quite invisible and the result absolutely ravishing no she added hurriedly i am not wearing a pair myself these are quite natural word of honour but we undertake to impart to any eyes the gaze soulful or the twinkle coquettish as the customer desires as an artist i assure you that these expressions are due less to the eyes themselves than to the shade and especially the curve of the lashes many a woman has entered our saloon entirely insignificant and turned the heads of all the men in the street when she left you interest me profoundly said tricotrin at the same time i shall never know in future whether i am inspired by a woman's eyes or the skill of her coiffeur i say 'in future' i entertain no doubt as to the source of my sensations now she rewarded him for this by a glance that dizzied him and soon afterwards the hansom came to a standstill amid an overpowering odour of cheese we have arrived she proclaimed so it is now that we part monsieur for me there is the little lodging for you the enormous london it is soho wander where you will there are restaurants hereabouts where one may find coffee and rolls at a modest price accept my thanks for your escort and let us say bonjour are the restaurants so unsavoury that you decline to honour them he questioned comment will you not bear me company or better still will you not let me command a coffee pot for two to be sent to your apartment and invite me to rest after my voyage she hesitated my apartment is very humble she said and well i have never done a thing like that it would not be correct what would you think of me if i consented i will think all that you would have me think vowed tricotrin come take pity on me ask me in and afterwards we will admire the sights of london together where can the coffee pot be ordered as for that she said there is no necessity i have a little breakfast for two already prepared enfin it is understood we are to be good comrades and nothing more will you give yourself the trouble of entering monsieur the bedroom to which they mounted was shabby but far from unattractive the mantelshelf was brightened with flowers a piano was squeezed into a corner and tricotrin had scarcely put aside his hat when he was greeted by the odour of coffee as excellent as was ever served in the cafe de la regence if this is london he cried i have no fault to find with it i own it is abominably selfish of me but i cannot bring myself to regret that your friend failed to arrive this morning indeed i shudder to think what would have become of me if we had not met will you mention the name that is to figure in my benisons my name is rosalie durand monsieur and mine is gustave tricotrin mademoiselle always your slave i do not doubt that in paris at this moment there are men who picture me tramping the pavement desolate not one of them but would envy me from his heart if he could see my situation it might have fallen out worse i admit said the girl my own day was at the point of being dull to tears and here i am chattering as if i hadn't a grief in the world let me persuade you to take another croissant fervently i wish that appearances were not deceptive said tricotrin who required little persuasion is it indiscreet to inquire to what griefs you allude upon my word your position appears a very pretty one where do those dainty shoes pinch you they are not easy on foreign soil monsieur when i reflect that you go back to night that to morrow you will be again in paris i could gnash my teeth with jealousy but ma foi returned tricotrin to a girl of brains like yourself paris is always open are there no customers for eyelashes in france why condemn yourself to gnash with jealousy when there is a living to be earned at home there are several reasons she said for one thing i am an extravagant little hussy and haven't saved enough for a ticket i have heard no reason yet at the moment my pocket is nicely lined you might return with me this evening are you mad by any chance she laughed it seems to me the natural course well i should not be free to go like that even if i took your money i am a business woman you see who does not sacrifice her interests to her sentiment what is your own career monsieur tricotrin i am a poet and when i am back in paris i shall write verse about you it shall be an impression of london the great city as it reveals itself to a stranger whose eyes are dazzled by the girl he loves forbidden ground she cried admonishing him with a finger no dazzle i apologise said tricotrin you shall find me a poet of my word why i declare he exclaimed glancing from the window it has begun to rain well fortunately we have plenty of time there is all day for our excursion and we can wait for the weather to improve if you do not object to smoking while i sing monsieur i propose a little music to go on with and it turned out that this singular assistant of a hairdresser had a very sympathetic voice and no contemptible repertoire although the sky had now broken its promise shamefully and the downpour continued tricotrin found nothing to complain of by midday one would have said that they had been comrades for years by luncheon both had ceased even to regard the rain and before evening approached they had confided to each other their histories from the day of their birth ascertaining that the basement boasted a smudgy servant girl who was to be dispatched for entrees and sauterne tricotrin drew up the menu of a magnificent dinner as the climax it was conceded that at this repast he should be the host and having placed him on oath behind a screen rosalie proceeded to make an elaborate toilette in honour of his entertainment determined as he had said to prove himself a poet of his word the young man remained behind the screen as motionless as a waxwork but the temptation to peep was tremendous and at the whispering of a silk petticoat he was unable to repress a groan what ails you she demanded the whispering suspended i merely expire with impatience to meet you again monsieur i am hastening to the trysting place and my costume will be suitable to the occasion believe me in that case if you are not quick you will have to wear crape however proceed i can suffer with the best of them are you certain that i can be of no assistance i feel selfish idling here like this besides since i am able to see see she screamed see no reason why you should refuse my aid my plight is worse still what are you doing now my hair she announced surely it would not be improper for me to view a head of hair perhaps not monsieur but my head is on my shoulders which makes a difference mademoiselle sighed tricotrin never have i known a young lady whose head was on her shoulders more tightly may i crave one indulgence my imprisonment would be less painful for a cigarette and i cannot reach the matches will you consent to pass them round the screen it is against the rules but i will consent to throw them over the top catch why don't you say 'thank you' because your unjust suspicion killed me i now need nothing but immortelles and at dinner i will compose my epitaph if i am not mistaken i already smell the soup on the stairs and the soup had scarcely entered when his guest presented herself paquin and the fairy godmother would have approved her gown as to her coiffure if her employer could have seen it he would have wanted to put her in his window tricotrin gave her his arm with stupefaction upon my word he faltered you awe me i am now overwhelmed with embarrassment that i had the temerity to tease you while you dressed and what shall i say of the host who is churl enough to welcome you in such a shabby coat the cork went pop their tongues went nineteen to the dozen and the time went so rapidly that a little clock on the chest of drawers became a positive killjoy by all the laws of dramatic effect remarked the poet as they trifled with the almonds and raisins you will now divulge that the fashionable lady before me is no 'rosalie durand' of a hairdresser's shop but madame la comtesse de thrilling mystery every novel reader would be aware that at this stage you will demand some dangerous service of me and that i shall forthwith risk my life and win your love bien sur that is how it ought to be she agreed is it impossible that i can be a countess well we will waive the 'countess' and for that matter i will not insist on risking my life but what about the love without the rest she demurred the situation would be too commonplace when i can tell you that i am a countess i will say also that i love you to night i am rosalie durand a friend by the way now i come to think of it i shall be all that you have seen in london why i declare so you will exclaimed tricotrin really this is a nice thing i come to england for the benefit of my education and when it is almost time for me to return i find that i have spent the whole of the day in a room but you have at least had a unique experience in it she queried with a whimsical smile well yes my journey has certainly yielded an adventure that none of my acquaintances would credit do you laugh at me far from it by and by i may even spare a tear for you if you do not spoil the day by being clumsy at the end ah rosalie cried the susceptible poet how can i bear the parting what is france without you i am no longer a frenchman my true home is now england my heart will hunger for it my thoughts will stretch themselves to it across the sea banished to montmartre i shall mourn daily for the white cliffs of albion for soho and for you i too shall remember she murmured but perhaps one of these days you will come to england again if the fare could be paid with devotion i would come every sunday but how can i hope to amass enough money such things do not happen twice no i will not deceive myself this is our farewell see he rose and turned the little clock with its face to the wall when that clock strikes i must go to catch my train in the meantime we will ignore the march of time farewells tears regrets let us forget that they exist let us drink the last glass together gaily mignonne they pledged each other with brave smiles hand in hand and now their chatter became fast and furious to drown the clock's impatient tick the clockwork wheezed and whirred 'tis going to part us shouted tricotrin laugh laugh beloved so that we may not hear kiss me she cried while the hour sounds you shall hold me in your arms heaven gasped the young man as the too brief embrace concluded how i wish it had been striking midnight the next moment came the separation he descended the stairs at the window she waved her hand to him and in the darkness of an english hansom the poet covered his face and wept from our hearts we rejoice to have thee safely back they chorused in montmartre and what didst thou see in london oh mon dieu what noble sights exclaimed tricotrin the lor' maire blazes with jewels like the shah of persia and compared with peeccadeelly the champs elysees are no wider than a hatband vive l'entente positively my brain whirls with all the splendours of london i have seen the infidelity of monsieur noulens whenever they talk of him whom i will call noulens of his novels his method the eccentricities of his talent someone is sure to say but what comrades he and his wife you are certain to hear it and as often as i hear it myself i think of what he told me that evening i remember the shock i had at the beginning i had expected little when i went in his wife said i fear he will be poor company he has to write a short story for la voix and cannot find a theme he has been beating his brains all day so far from anticipating emotions i had proposed dining there another night instead but she would not allow me to leave something you say may suggest a theme to him she declared and he can write or dictate the story in an hour when you have gone so i stayed and after dinner he lay on the sofa bewailing the fate that had made him an author the salon communicated with his study and through the open door he had the invitation of his writing table the little sheaf of paper that she had put in readiness for him the lighted lamp the pile of cigarettes i knew that she hoped the view would stimulate him but it was soon apparent that he had ceased to think of a story altogether he spoke of one of the latest murders in paris one sensational enough for the paris press to report a murder prominently of a conference at the universite des annales of the artistry of esther lekain of everything except his work then in the hall the telephone bell rang and madame noulens rose to receive the message allo allo she did not come back there was a pause and presently he murmured i wonder if a stranger has been moved to telephone a plot to me what i said it sounds mad hein but it once happened on just such a night as this when my mind was just as blank really out of the silence a woman told me a beautiful story of course i never used it nor do i know if she made use of it herself but i have never forgotten for years i could not hear a telephone bell without trembling even now when i am working late i find myself hoping for her voice the story was so wonderful as that he threw a glance into the study as if to assure himself that his wife had not entered it from the hall can you believe that a man may learn to love tenderly and truly love a woman he has never met he asked me i don't think i understand you there has been only one woman in my life who was all in all to me he said and i never saw her how was i to answer i looked at him after all what is there incredible in it he demanded do we give our love to a face or to a temperament i swear to you that i could not have known that woman's temperament more intimately if we had made our confidences in each other's arms i knew everything of her except the trifles which a stranger learns in the moment of being presented her height her complexion her name whether she was married or single no those things i never knew but her tastes her sympathies her soul these the secret truths of the woman were as familiar to me as to herself he hesitated i am in a difficulty if i seem to disparage my wife i shall be a cad if i let you think we have been as happy together as people imagine you will not understand the importance of what i am going to tell you i will say this before our honeymoon was over i bored her fearfully while we were engaged i had talked to her of my illusions about herself when we were married i talked to her of my convictions about my art the change appalled her she was chilled crushed dumfounded i looked to her to share my interests for response she yawned and wept oh her tears her hourly tears the tears that drowned my love the philosopher is made not born in the first few years i rebelled furiously i wanted a companion a confidant and i had never felt so desperately alone we had a flat in the rue de sontay then and the telephone was in my workroom one night late as i sat brooding there the bell startled me and a voice a woman's voice said 'i am so lonely i want to talk to you before i sleep' i cannot describe the strangeness of that appeal reaching me so suddenly out of the distance i knew that it was a mistake of course but it was as if away in the city some nameless soul had echoed the cry in my own heart i obeyed an impulse i said 'i too am very lonely i believe i have been waiting for you' there was a pause and then she asked dismayed 'who are you' 'not the man you thought' i told her 'but a very wistful one' i heard soft laughter 'how absurd' she murmured 'be merciful' i went on 'we are both sad and fate clearly intends us to console each other it cannot compromise you for i do not even know who you are stay and talk to me for five minutes' 'what do you ask me to talk about' 'oh the subject to interest us both yourself' after a moment she answered 'i am shaking my head' 'it is very unfeeling of you' i said 'and i have not even the compensation of seeing you do it' imagine another pause and then her voice in my ear again 'i will tell you what i can do for you i can tell you a story' 'the truth would please me more' i owned 'still if my choice must be made between your story and your silence i certainly choose the story' 'i applaud your taste' she said 'are you comfortable are you sitting down' i sat down smiling 'madame ' she did not reply then 'mademoiselle ' again no answer 'well say at least if i have your permission to smoke while i listen to you' she laughed 'you carry courtesy far' 'how far' i asked quickly but she would not even hint from what neighbourhood she was speaking to me 'attend' she commanded and began 'it is a story of two lovers' she said 'paul and rosamonde they were to have married but rosamonde died too soon when she was dying she gave him a curl of the beautiful brown hair that he used to kiss au revoir dear love she whispered it will be very stupid in heaven until you come remember that i am waiting for you and be faithful if your love for me fades you will see that curl of mine fade too 'every day through the winter paul strewed flowers on her tomb and sobbed and in the spring he strewed flowers and sighed and in the summer he paid that flowers might be strewn there for him sometimes when he looked at the dead girl's hair he thought that it was paler than it had been but as he looked at it seldom now he could easily persuade himself that he was mistaken 'then he met a woman who made him happy again and the wind chased the withered flowers from rosamonde's grave and left it bare one day paul's wife found a little packet that lay forgotten in his desk she opened it jealously before he could prevent her paul feared that the sight would give her pain and watched her with anxious eyes but in a moment she was laughing what an idiot i am she exclaimed i was afraid that it was the hair of some girl you had loved the curl was snow white' her fantastic tale continued noulens which was told with an earnestness that i cannot reproduce impressed me very much i did not offer any criticism i did not pay her any compliment i said simply 'who are you' 'that' she warned me 'is a question that you must not ask well are you still bored' 'no' 'interested a little' 'very much so' 'i too am feeling happier than i did and now bonsoir' 'wait' i begged 'tell me when i shall speak to you again' she hesitated and i assure you that i had never waited for a woman's answer with more suspense while i held her hand than i waited for the answer of this woman whom i could not see 'to morrow' i urged 'in the morning' 'in the morning it would be difficult' 'the afternoon' 'in the afternoon it would be impossible' 'then the evening at the same hour' 'perhaps' she faltered 'if i am free' 'my number' i told her 'is five four two one nine can you write it now' 'i have written it' 'please repeat so that there may be no mistake' 'five four two one nine correct' 'correct i am grateful' 'good night' 'good night sleep well' you may suppose that on the morrow i remembered the incident with a smile that i ridiculed the emotion it had roused in me you would be wrong i recalled it more and more curiously i found myself looking forward to the appointment with an eagerness that was astonishing we had talked for about twenty minutes hidden from each other half paris perhaps dividing us i had nothing more tangible to expect this evening yet i experienced all the sensations of a man who waits for an interview for an embrace what did it mean i was bewildered the possibility of love at first sight i understood but might the spirit also recognise an affinity by telephone there is a phrase in feuilletons that had always irritated me 'to his impatience it seemed that the clock had stopped' it had always struck me as absurd since that evening i have never condemned the phrase for honestly i thought more than once that the clock had stopped by and by to increase the tension my wife who seldom entered my workroom opened the door she found me idle and was moved to converse with me mon dieu now that the hour approached at last my wife was present with the air of having settled herself for the night the hands of the clock moved on and always faster now if she remained till the bell rang what was i to do to answer that i had 'someone with me' would be intelligible to the lady but it would sound suspicious to my wife to answer that i was 'busy' would sound innocent to my wife but it would be insulting to the lady to disregard the bell altogether would be to let my wife go to the telephone herself i tell you i perspired under providence our cook rescued me there came a timid knock and then the figure of the cook her eyes inflamed her head swathed in some extraordinary garment she had a raging toothache would madame have the kindness to give her a little cognac the ailments of the cook always arouse in human nature more solicitude than the ailments of any other servant my wife's sympathy was active i was saved the door had scarcely closed when tr rr r ng the signal came 'good evening' from the voice 'so you are here to meet me' 'good evening' i said 'i would willingly go further to meet you' 'be thankful that the rendez vous was your flat listen to the rain come own that you congratulated yourself when it began luckily i can be gallant without getting wet you thought really i am most considerate you keep a dry skin you waste no time in reaching me and you need not even trouble to change your coat' 'it sounds very cosy' i admitted 'but there is one drawback to it all i do not see you' 'that may be more considerate of me still i may be reluctant to banish your illusions isn't it probable that i am elderly or at least plain i may even be a lady novelist with ink on her fingers by the bye monsieur i have been rereading one of your books since last night' 'oh you know my name now i am gratified to have become more than a telephonic address to you may i ask if we have ever met' 'we never spoke till last night but i have seen you often' 'you at any rate can have no illusions to be banished what a relief i have endeavoured to talk as if i had a romantic bearing now that you know how i look i can be myself' 'i await your next words with terror' she said 'what shock is in store for me speak gently' 'well speaking gently i am very glad that you were put on to the wrong number last night at the same time i feel a constraint a difficulty i cannot talk to you frankly cannot be serious it is as if i showed my face while you were masked' 'yes it is true i understand' she said 'and even if i were to swear that i was not unworthy of your frankness you would still be doubtful of me i suppose' 'madame ' 'oh it is natural i know very well how i must appear to you' she exclaimed 'a coquette with a new pastime a vulgar coquette besides who tries to pique your interest by an air of mystery believe me monsieur i am forbidden to unmask think lightly of me if you must i have no right to complain but believe as much as that i do not give you my name simply because i may not' 'madame' i replied 'so far from wishing to force your confidences i assure you that i will never inquire who you are never try to find out' 'and you will talk frankly unconstrainedly all the same' 'ah you are too illogical to be elderly and plain' i demurred 'you resolve to remain a stranger to me and i bow to your decision but on the other hand a man makes confidences only to his friends' there was a long pause and when i heard the voice again it trembled 'adieu monsieur' 'adieu madame' i said no sooner had she gone than i would have given almost anything to bring her back for a long while i sat praying that she would ring again i watched the telephone as if it had been her window the door of her home something that could yield her to my view during the next few days i grudged every minute that i was absent from the room i took my meals in it never had i had the air of working so indefatigably and in truth i did not write a line 'i suppose you have begun a new romance' said my wife in my soul i feared that i had finished it noulens sighed he clasped his hands on his head the dark hair the thin restless fingers were all that i could see of him where i sat some seconds passed i wondered whether there would be time for me to hear the rest before his wife returned in my soul i feared that i had finished it he repeated extraordinary as it appears i was in love with a woman i had never seen each time that bell sounded my heart seemed to try to choke me it had been my grievance since we had the telephone installed that we heard nothing of it excepting that we had to make another payment for its use but now by a maddening coincidence everybody that i had ever met took to ringing me up about trifles and agitating me twenty times a day at last one night when expectation was almost dead she called to me again oh but her voice was humble my friend it is piteous when we love a woman to hear her humbled i longed to take her hands to fold my arms about her i abased myself that she might regain her pride she heard how i had missed and sorrowed for her i owned that she was dear to me and then began a companionship strange as you may find the word which was the sweetest my life has held we talked together daily this woman whose whereabouts whose face whose name were all unknown to me became the confidant of my disappointments and my hopes if i worked well my thoughts would be 'tonight i shall have good news to give her' if i worked ill 'never mind by and by she will encourage me' there was not a page in my next novel that i did not read to her never a doubt beset me in which i did not turn for her sympathy and advice 'well how have you got on' 'oh i am so troubled this evening dear' 'poor fellow tell me all about it i tried to come to you sooner but i couldn't get away' like that we talked as if she were really with me my life was no longer desolate the indifference in my home no longer grieved me all the interest the love the inspiration i had hungered for was given to me now by a woman who remained invisible noulens paused again in the pause i got up to light a cigarette and i shall never forget it i saw the bowed figure of his wife beyond the study door it was only a glimpse i had but the glimpse was enough to make my heart stand still she leant over the table her face hidden by her hand i tried to warn to signal to him he did not see me i felt that i could do nothing nothing at all without doubling her humiliation by the knowledge that i had witnessed it if he would only look at me listen he went on rapidly i was happy i was young again and there was a night when she said to me 'it is for the last time' six words but for a moment i had no breath no life to answer them 'speak' she cried out 'you are frightening me' 'what has happened' i stammered 'trust me i implore you' i heard her sobbing and minutes seemed to pass it was horrible i thought my heart would burst while i shuddered at her sobs the sobbing of a woman i could not reach 'i can tell you nothing' she said when she was calmer 'only that we are speaking together for the last time' 'but why why is it that you are leaving france' 'i cannot tell you' she repeated 'i have had to swear that to myself' oh i raved to her i was desperate i tried to wring her name from her then i besought her to confess where she was hidden the space between us frenzied me it was frightful it was like a nightmare that struggle to tear the truth from a woman whom i could not clasp or see 'my dear' she said 'there are some things that are beyond human power they are not merely difficult or unwise or mad they are impossible you have begged the impossible of me you will never hear me again it is far from likely we shall ever meet and if one day we do you will not even know that it is i but i love you i should like to think that you believe it for i love you very dearly now say good bye to me my arms are round your neck dear heart i kiss you on the lips' it was the end she was lost a moment before i had felt her presence in my senses now i stood in an empty room mocked by a futile apparatus my friend if you have ever yearned to see a woman whose whereabouts you did not know ever exhausted yourself tramping some district in the hope of finding her you may realise what i feel for remember that by comparison your task was easy i am even ignorant of this woman's arrondissement and appearance she left me helpless the telephone had given her the telephone had taken her away all that remained to me was the mechanism on a table noulens turned on the couch at last and turning he could not fail to see his wife i was spellbound 'mechanism on a table' he repeated with a prodigious yawn of relief 'that is all my own' good said madame noulens cheerily she bustled in fluttering pages of shorthand but old angel the tale of paul and rosamonde is thrown away it is an extravagance telling two stories for the price of one my treasure thou knowest i invented it months ago and couldn't make it long enough for it to be of any use true well we will be liberal then we will include it she noticed my amazement what ails our friend noulens gave a guffaw i fear our friend did not recognize that i was dictating to you by the bye it was fortunate someone rang us up just now that started my plot for me who was it it was la voix she laughed inquiring if the story would be done in time yes indeed they are comrades you are certain to hear it and as often as i hear it myself i think of what he told me that evening i remember how he took me in
