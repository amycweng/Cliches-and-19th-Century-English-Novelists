one man's view by leonard merrick with an introduction by granville barker hodder stoughton london new york toronto introduction this story can be said to date though quite in the sense that a story legitimately may it is historic though that is not to say old fashioned if one searches by internal evidence for the time of its writing might be a safe guess it was about then that many londoners besides the american girls in the story were given their first glimpse of niagara at the panorama near victoria street the building is a motor garage now it lies beneath the cliffs of queen anne's mansions aeroplanes may discover its queer round roof and it was in an ageing past too for architectural ages veritably flash by in new york that broadway could be said to spread into the brightness of union square to day there is but a chaos of dingy decay owning to that name soon it will be smart skyscrapers no doubt when the tide of business has covered it as now the tide of fashion leaves it derelict duluth too with its storekeepers spitting on wooden sidewalks duluth foresees a lake front that will rival chicago but in such honest dating and in the inferences we may draw from it lie perhaps some of the peculiar merits of mr merrick's method his straight telling of a tale and digging to the heart of the book the one man's view of his faithless wife more importantly too the wife's view of herself is in a sense an historic view not of course in its human essentials those must be true or false of this man and this woman whenever however they lived and suffered such sufferings are dateless and whether they are truly or falsely told let the reader judge no preface writer need pre judge for him for in such things the teller of the tale from the heart of his subject speaks straight to the heart and conscience of his audience and will succeed or fail by no measurable virtue of style or wit but by the truth that is in him by how much of it they are open to receive look besides with ever so slightly an historical eye at the circumstances in which the lives of these two were set to grow and to flourish or perish as it was easier or harder to tend them see the girl with her simple passion for the theatre so apt a channel for her happy ambition as it appears and that baulked her very life baulked to day this war day and most surely for the immediate enfranchised to morrow breaking so close the same girl will turn her back light heartedly on the glamour of that little tinselled world to many another prospect of self fulfilment and the lawyer lost in his law if a solicitor generalship is his aim he will be worldly wise enough one hopes to come home not too tired to make at least a passably attractive figure at his wife's well chosen dinner parties or is that phase of english government now also to pass no for probably a country will always be governed from its dinner tables while its well being is finally determined by their quality mamie to day though would be doing more than give dinners it is a question if the mamie of to morrow will have time to and the literary flaneur the half hearted seducer of passionless ladies is he out of date mr merrick implies the quite wholesome truth that he always was through books and bookish dreams beautiful wise dreams lies the passage to life of many boys and girls but the healthiest instincts in them are seeking still a real world in which it will be both sane and fine to live their dreams are mostly a hard test of it when it is found and oh the pity if the finding it quite breaks their dream in sum then it was mamie's tragedy to seek her realities during a phase of art and letters which in their utter unreality seemed to deny the very existence of any real world at all neither true art nor true letters then they were so turning from reality with fear are they still denying it to day if so this story does not date at all and mamie's tragedy is a tragedy of our time for tragedy it is even though in one man's view she finds at last reposeful salvation of a sort but our hope is better and half our pleasure in the story and in its historical truth is the thought that true author as he is were he writing it to day and of to day mr merrick would have written it just so much differently granville barker chapter i the idea was so foreign to his temperament that heriot was reluctant to believe that he had entertained it even during a few seconds he continued his way past the big pink house and the girl on the balcony surprised at the interest roused in him by this chance discovery of her address of what consequence was it where she was staying he had noticed her on the terrace by the band stand one morning and admired her in other words he had unconsciously attributed to the possessor of a delicious complexion and a pair of grey eyes darkly fringed vague characteristics to which she was probably a stranger he had seen her the next day also and the next even hoped to see her speculated quite idly what her social position might be and how she came beside the impossible woman who accompanied her all that was nothing his purpose in coming to eastbourne was to be trivial but why the sense of gratification with which he had learnt where she lived as to the idea which had crossed his brain that was preposterous of course since the pink house was a boarding establishment he might if he would make her acquaintance by the simple expedient of removing there but he did not know how he could have meditated such a step it was the sort of semi disreputable folly that a man a decade or so younger might commit and describe as a lark no doubt many men a decade or so younger would commit it he could conceive that a freshly painted balcony displaying a pretty girl for an hour or two every afternoon might serve to extend the clientele of a boarding house enormously and wondered that more attention had not been paid to such a form of advertisement for himself however his hair was already thinning at the temples solicitors were deferential to him and his clerk was taking a villa in brixton for himself it would not do eastbourne was depressing he reflected as he strolled towards the dumpy wish tower he was almost sorry that he hadn't gone to sandhills and quartered himself on his brother for a week or two instead francis was always pleased to meet him of recent years and no longer remarked early in the conversation that he was overdrawn at cox's on the whole francis was not a bad fellow and sandhills and pheasants would have been livelier he stifled a yawn and observed with relief that it was near the dinner hour in the evening he turned over the papers in the smoking room he perceived as he often did perceive in the vacations that he was lonely vacations were a mistake early in one's career one could not afford them and by the time one was able to afford them the taste for holidays was gone this hotel was dreary too the visitors were dull and the cooking was indifferent what could be more tedious than the meal from which he had just risen the feeble soup the flaccid fish the uninterrupted view of the stout lady with the aquiline nose and a red shawl across her shoulders now he was lolling on a morocco couch fingering the the field two or three other men lay about napping or looking at the the graphic there was a great deal of tobacco smoke and a little whisky he might as well have stopped in town and gone to the club he wondered what they did in belle vue mansion after dinner perhaps there was music and the girl sang he could fancy that she sang well or they might have impromptu dances personally he did not care for dancing but even to see others enjoying themselves would be comparatively gay after all why should he not remove to belle vue mansion if he wished he had attached a significance to the step that it did not possess making it appear absurd by the very absurdity of the consideration that he accorded it he remembered the time when he would not have hesitated those were the days when francis was always overdrawn at cox's well he had worked hard since then and anything that francis might have lent him had been repaid and he had gradually acquired soberer views of life perhaps he might be said to have gone to an extreme indeed and taken the pledge he sometimes felt old and he was still in the thirties francis was the younger of the two of late although he had a boy in the brigade but elder sons often kept young very long it was easy for them like the way of righteousness to a bishop a waiter cast an inquiring glance round the room and crossing to the sofa handed him a card heriot read the name with astonishment he had not seen the man for sixteen years and even their irregular correspondence had died a natural death my dear fellow he exclaimed in the hall come inside in the past of which he had just been thinking he and dick cheriton had been staunch friends none the less staunch because cheriton was some years his senior dick had a studio in howland street then and was going to set the academy on fire in the meanwhile he wore a yellow necktie and married madly and smoked a clay pipe he could not guarantee that he would be an ra but at least he was resolved that he would be a bohemian he had some of the qualifications for artistic success but little talent when he discovered the fact beyond the possibility of mistake he accepted a relative's offer of a commercial berth in the united states and had his hair cut the valedictory supper in the studio at which he had renounced ambition and solemnly burned all his canvases that the dealers would not buy had been a very affecting spectacle my dear fellow cried heriot come inside this is a tremendous pleasure when did you arrive came over in the germanic ten days ago it is you then i saw 'george heriot' in the visitors' list and strolled round on the chance i scarcely hoped how are you old man i'm mighty glad to see you fact you've been here ten days not here no i've only been in eastbourne a few hours you should have looked me up in town i tried your chambers were shut the hall porter at the club what club you forget what an exile i am have a drink well upon my word this is very jolly sit down try one of these would you have recognised me asked cheriton stretching his legs and lighting the cigar you've changed admitted heriot it's a long time i've changed too they regarded each other with a gaze of friendly criticism heriot noted with some surprise that the other's appearance savoured little of the american man of business or of the man of business outside america his hair though less disordered than it had been in the howland street period was still rather longer than is customary in the city it was now grey and became him admirably he wore a black velvet jacket and showed a glimpse of a deep crimson tie he no longer looked a bohemian but he had acquired the air of a celebrity have you come home for good cheriton cheriton shook his head i guess america has got me for life he answered i'm only making a trip and you you're still at the bar eh oh yes said heriot drily i'm still at the bar it is not agreeable when you have succeeded in a profession to be asked if you are in it still i've travelled along the lines on which you left me it doesn't make an exciting narrative chambers court and bed a laundress or two has died in the interval the thing pays better than it used to do naturally that's all you're doing well i should have called it 'doing well' once but we are all olivers in our hearts to day mistake said the elder man you wanted the bar you've got the bar you ought to be satisfied now i yes said heriot as he paused how's the world used you cheriton by the way you never answered my last letter i think it was you who didn't answer me i fancy not you were going to chicago and i wrote i wrote after i arrived in chicago well it must be five years ago we won't argue what did you do in chicago cheriton no good sir i went there with a patent horse collar capital invention not my own i never invented anything but it didn't catch on they seemed to take no interest in horse collars no money in it not a cent after the horse collar i started in the dry goods trade but i was burned out from chicago i went to duluth i've an hotel there to day an hotel that's so it isn't a distinguished career running a little hotel but it's fairly easy compared with hustling with horse collars it's luxurious duluth is not ideal but what would you have i make my way and that's all i ask now if i had my life over again he sighed if we could have our lives over again eh heriot humph said heriot doubtfully he was wondering if he could make any better use of his own if he would be any livelier the next time he was eight and thirty i suppose we all blunder of course you are a young man yet it's different for you and you're in the profession of your choice it's entirely different we don't look at the thing from the same standpoint heriot you don't mean that you regret giving up art sir said cheriton mournfully it was the error i shall always regret i wouldn't say as much to anybody else i keep it here he tapped his velvet jacket but i had a gift and i neglected it i had power and and i run an hotel when i reflect man there are hours well it's no use crying over spilt milk but to think of the position i should have made and to contrast it with what i am is bitter he swept back his wavy hair impatiently and in the momentary pose looked more like a celebrity still heriot could see that the cherished delusion gave him a melancholy pleasure and was at a loss how to reply it was uphill work he said at last who can tell luck i was a lad an impetuous lad and i was handicapped i married the man with a failure to explain is always grateful to have married but i had the stuff in me i had the temperament 'had' it i have it now i may keep an hotel but i shall never be an hotel keeper god gave me my soul sir circumstances gave me an hotel i mayn't paint any more but an artist by nature i shall always be i don't say it in any bragging spirit heriot i should be happier if i didn't feel it the commonplace man may be contented in the commonplace calling he fills the role he was meant for it's the poor devil like myself who knows what he might have been who suffers heriot didn't pursue the subject he puffed his cigar meditatively after the effervescence subsides such meetings must always have a little sadness he looked at the wrinkles that had gathered on his friend's face and realised the crow's feet on his own you lost your wife you wrote me he remarked breaking a rather lengthy silence in new york yes pneumonia you never married eh no do you stay over here long a month or two i can't manage more but i shall leave my girl in london i've brought her with me and she'll remain of course said heriot you have a child of course you have i remember a little thing tumbling about in howland street she must be a woman cheriton mamie is twenty one i want to see if i can do anything for her before i go back she loathes duluth and she has talent she'll live with my sister i don't think you ever saw my sister did you she's a widow and stagnates in wandsworth mamie will be company for her your daughter paints no not paints she wants to be an actress i wasn't very keen on it but she's got the material in her and i concluded i'd no right to say 'no' still she's not very strong takes after her mother i'm afraid a little i'd rather she'd had a gift for something else was it necessary for her to have a gift at all asked heriot a shade sarcastically couldn't she stop at home well said cheriton she tried it but it's a hard thing for a girl like mamie to content herself with the life in duluth there isn't much art in that heriot there isn't much anything there's the lake and superior street and the storekeepers lounging in the doorways and spitting on the wooden sidewalks and there's a theatre of a sort which made her worse for a girl panting to be famous duluth is a hell she's been breaking her heart in it ever since she was sixteen and after all it's in the blood it would have been odd if my daughter hadn't had the artistic temperament i suppose i suppose it would said heriot well why doesn't she go on the stage in america i shouldn't think she'd find it easy here she wouldn't find it easy there there's no stock company in duluth only the travelling companies come sometimes for a few nights there's no bigger opportunity for her on the other side than on this besides she wants the english stage i wonder if you know anybody who could give her any introductions i not a soul i'm sorry to hear you say that said cheriton blankly i was counting on you some heriot looked at him you counted on me for heaven's sake why well i don't know many people over here to day you see the fellows i used to knock against have died gone to the colonies fizzled out you were solid and you were a swell with connections and all that i understand the stage has become very fashionable in london i thought you might meet actor managers at dinners and things that was the idea i daresay it was very stupid but i had it i mentioned your name to mamie as soon as it was settled we should come however we'll fix the matter somehow i'm sorry to prove a disappointment said heriot tell your daughter so for me i'd do what you want with pleasure if i were able you know that i'm sure oh i know that said cheriton it can't be helped yes i'll tell her she will be disappointed of course she understands how difficult the thing is without influence and i've talked about you a lot do you think you were wise to to oh it was a mistake as it turns out i don't mean that only i mean do you think you were wise to encourage her hopes in such a direction at all frankly if i had a daughter forgive me for speaking plainly my dear fellow your daughter and mine their paths would be as wide apart as the poles and you don't know mamie at all events i know that the stage is more overcrowded every year most girls are stage struck at some time or other and there are hundreds of actresses who can't earn bread and cheese a man i know has his type writing done by a woman who used to be on the stage she played the best parts in the country i believe and i daresay nursed the expectation of becoming a bernhardt she gets a pound a week in his office he tells me and was thankful to obtain the post mamie is bound to come to the front she's got it she's an artist born i tell you i should be brutal to stand in the way of her career the girl is pining really pining for distinction when you've talked to her you'll change your views perhaps said heriot as the shortest way of ending the discussion very likely i'm wrong the budding genius bored him mind you explain to the young lady that my inability and not my will refuses at any rate that's all right declared cheriton getting up i told her i was coming round to see if it was you he laughed i bet she's picturing me coming back with a bushel of letters of introduction from you by now well i must be going it's getting late you brought her down to eastbourne to day oh i've been dangling about town a little by myself mamie and my sister have been here a week good night old chap shall i see you to morrow you might give us a look in if you will say in the afternoon belle vue mansion don't forget where exclaimed heriot startled into interest belle vue mansion repeated cheriton gripping his hand you can't miss it a big pink house on the esplanade chapter ii heriot betook himself there on the following day with a curious eagerness if the girl he had noticed should prove to be cheriton's daughter how odd it would be he at once hoped for the coincidence and found the possibility a shade pathetic it emphasised his years to think that the ill kept child of the dirty studio might have become the girl he had admired his progress during the interval appeared momentarily insignificant to him he felt that while a brat became a woman he ought to have done much more he was discouraged to reflect that he had not taken silk for he had always intended to take silk and had small misgivings that he would have cause to repent it his practice had indicated for some time that he would not suffer by the step and yet he had delayed his application his motto had been slow and sure but it seemed to him suddenly that he had been too slow his income as a junior should not have contented him so long he pulled the bell and was preceded up the stairs by a maid servant who opened a door and announced him to the one occupant of the room heriot saw that she was the girl of the balcony and the terrace and that she moved towards him smiling i am mamie cheriton she said my father is expecting you her intonation was faintly american but her voice was full and sweet he took her hand with pleasure and a touch of excitement that did not concord with his countenance which was formal and impassive i am glad to make your acquaintance miss cheriton won't you sit down she said he will be here in a minute heriot took a seat and decided that her eyes were even lovelier than he had known when i saw you last you were a child he remarked inaccurately yes it must have astonished you meeting my father again after so many years it was funny your being here wasn't it but perhaps you often come to eastbourne no said heriot no i don't often come how does it strike you miss cheriton i suppose you can hardly remember england can you well i shan't be sorry to be settled in london it was london i was anxious to go to not the sea shore do you say 'sea shore' in europe or is it wrong when i said 'sea shore' this morning i noticed that a woman stared at me one generally says 'seaside' over here i don't know that it's important well the 'seaside' then the seaside was my aunt's wish well well i'm saying 'well' too often i guess that's american too i've got to be quite english that's my first step but at least i don't talk like americans in your comic papers do i you talk very delightfully i think he said taken aback i hope you mean it my voice is most important you know it would be very cruel if i were handicapped by having anything the matter with my voice i shall have difficulties enough without i'm afraid he said that i'm unfortunate i wish i could have done something to further the ambitions your father mentioned she smiled again rather wistfully this time they seem very absurd to you i daresay he murmured deprecation why the stage struck girl is always absurd recognising his own phrase he perceived that he had been too faithfully reported and was embarrassed i spoke hastily in the abstract the stage struck girl may be absurd but so is a premature opinion thank you she said but why 'stage struck' anyhow it's a term i hate i suppose you wanted to be a barrister mr heriot i did he confessed certainly there are a great many but i thought there was room for one more but you weren't described as 'bar struck' i don't think i ever heard the expression it would be a very foolish one it would sound so to me why 'stage struck' then is it any more ridiculous to aspire to one profession than another you don't say a person is 'paint struck' or 'ink struck' or anything else ' struck' why the sneer when one is drawn towards the theatre but perhaps no form of art appears to you necessary i think i should prefer to call it 'desirable' since you ask the question he said and 'art' is a word used to weight a great many trivialities too everybody who writes a novel is an artist in his own estimation and personally i find existence quite possible without novels did you ever read mademoiselle de maupin asked miss cheriton have you he said quickly oh yes books are very cheap in america 'i would rather grow roses than potatoes' is one of the lines in the preface you would rather grow potatoes than roses eh you are an enthusiast said heriot i see he pitied her for being dick cheriton's daughter she was inevitable the pseudo artist's discontent with realities the inherited tendencies fanned by thinly veiled approval he understood cheriton came in after a few minutes followed by the aunt to whom heriot was presented he found her primitive and far less educated than her brother she was very happy to see dear dick again and she was sorry that she must lose him again so soon dear mamie though would be a consolation a third rate suburban villa was stamped upon her he could imagine her making hideous antimacassars for forbidding armchairs and that a visit to an eastbourne boarding house was the event of her life she wore jet earrings and stirred her tea with vast energy with the circulation of the tea strangers drifted into the room and the conversation was continued in undertones have you been talking to mamie about her intentions cheriton inquired we've been chatting yes what steps do you mean to take miss cheriton what shall you do i propose to go to the dramatic agents she said and ask them to hear me recite dramatic agents must be kept fairly busy i should say what if they don't consent i shall recite to them you are firm he laughed i am eager mr heriot i have longed till i am sick with longing london has been my aim since i was a little girl i have dreamt of it i've gone to sleep hoping that i might i couldn't recall one of its streets but in dreams i've reached it over and over again the way was generally across lincoln park in chicago and all of a sudden i was among theatres and lights and it was london and you were an actress and the audience showered bouquets i always woke up before i was an actress but now i'm here really i mean to try to wake london up i hope you will he said her faith in herself was a little infectious since she was beautiful if she had been plain he would have considered her conceited have i gushed she said colouring he was not sure but what she had she's like her father said cheriton gaily get her on the subject of art and her tongue runs away with her we're all children we artists up in the skies or down in the dumps no medium with us she must recite to you one of these days heriot i want you to hear her will you miss cheriton if you like she said dear mamie must recite to me murmured mrs baines i'm quite looking forward to it what sort of pieces do you say dear nice pieces she knows the parts of juliet and rosalind and pauline by heart said cheriton ignoring his sister i think you'll say her balcony scene is almost as fine a rendering as you've ever heard there's a delicacy a spiritual has she been trained asked heriot i understood she was quite a novice i've coached her myself replied cheriton complacently i don't pretend to be an elocutionist of course but i've been able to give her some hints all the arts are related you know my boy it's only a difference in the form of expression they're playing romeo and juliet at the theatre here to night and we're going she never loses an opportunity for study it's been said that you can learn as much by watching bad acting as good will you come with us he added lowering his voice you'll see how she warms up at the sight of the footlights i don't mind said heriot if i shan't be in the way suppose we all dine together at the hotel and go on from there what do you say he turned to the ladies and the widow faltered lor i'm sure it's very kind of you to invite me mr heriot that would be gay wouldn't it she smoothed her flat hair tremulously and left the decision to her brother and her niece heriot took his leave with the understanding that he was to expect them and sauntered along the parade more cheerfully than was his wont the girl had not failed to impress him though he disapproved of her tendencies nor did these appear quite so preposterous to him now albeit he thought them regrettable he did not know whether he believed in her or not yet but he was conscious that he wished to do so his paramount reflection was that she would have been a wholly charming girl if she had had ordinary advantages a finishing governess and a london season and a touch of conventionality he disliked to use the word conventionality for it sounded priggish but conventionality was what he meant at dinner however and more especially after it he forgot his objections in the theatre he watched miss cheriton more attentively than the stage she herself sat with her eyes riveted on it and he could see that she was the prey to strong excitement he wondered whether this was created by the performance which seemed to him indifferent or by the thoughts that it awoke and he resolved to ask her when the curtain fell and they went out he wasn't sorry that cheriton derided his suggestion of a cab and declared that the walk back would be agreeable he kept by the girl's side and the others followed she did not speak and after a minute he said will it jar upon you if i say 'let us talk' she turned to him with a slight start of course not how can you think me so ridiculous yet it did said heriot i could see i know exactly how i appear she said constrainedly i look an affected idiot if you knew how i hate to appear affected i give you my word i don't put it on i can't help it the theatre gives me hot and cold shivers and turns me inside out that isn't prettily expressed but it describes what i mean as nearly as possible am i 'enthusing' again i never said you 'enthused' before you're not my idea of of 'the gushing girl' at all i'm glad to hear it i was very ashamed when you had gone this afternoon she hesitated painfully i wish i could explain myself but i can't without a pen i can write what i feel much better than i can say it i began to write a play once and the girl said just what i felt it was a bad play but a big relief i've sometimes thought that if i walked about with a pen in my hand i should be a good conversationalist try to tell me what you feel without one said heriot you encourage me to bore you mr heriot i yearn i crave to do something clever it isn't only vanity half the craving is born of the desire to live among clever people ever since i can remember i've ached to know artists and actors and people who write and do things i've been cooped among storekeepers without an idea in their heads i've never seen a man or woman of talent in my life excepting my father i've never heard anybody speak who knew what art or ambition meant you may laugh but if i had it i would give five hundred dollars to go home with some of those actresses to night and sit mum in a corner and listen to them don't you think it very likely you might be disappointed he asked i don't i don't expect they would talk blank verse at supper but they would talk of their work of their hopes an artist must be an artist always on the stage or off it in his studio or in his club my father is an instance he could not be a philistine if he tried he once said something i've always remembered he said 'god gave me my soul child circumstances gave me an hotel' i thought it happily put heriot perceived that cheriton had thought so too as the impromptu had been repeated what a different world we should have lived in by now if he had kept in his profession she exclaimed i quiver when i realise what i've missed people that i only know through their books or the newspapers would have been familiar friends i should have seen swinburne smoking cigars in our parlour and sarah bernhardt would have dropped in to tea and chatted about the rehearsal she had just left and showed me the patterns of the new costumes she was ordering isn't it wonderful in sympathy for her he said it's possible your father might have remained in england without becoming intimate with celebrities she looked doubtful even if he hadn't and one likes to believe in one's own father the atmosphere would have been right they mightn't have been swinburnes and bernhardts that were at home in our place they might have been people the world hasn't heard of yet but they would have talked of the time when the world was going to hear of them one can respect an obscure genius as much as a famous one they had reached the door of belle vue mansion and when he was begged to go in for half an hour heriot did not demur they had the drawing room to themselves now and cheriton descanted with relish on the qualifications for a successful actress he had no knowledge of the subject but possessed great fluency and he spoke of broad effects and communicable emotion and what he might call a matter of perspective with an authority which came near to disguising the fact that there was little or no meaning in what he said the girl sat pale and attentive and mrs baines listened vaguely as she might have done to a discourse in chinese relatives who came back from america and invited her to stay with them in a house where she cost two guineas a week must be treated with deference but the stage and the circus were of equal significance to her mind and she would have simpered just as placidly if her niece had been anxious to jump through a hoop her chief emotion was pride at being in a room with a barrister who she had learnt was the brother of a baronet and she watched him furtively with the anticipation of describing the event in lavender street wandsworth where the magnate was a gentleman who travelled in a brougham and haberdashery would it be inconsiderate to ask you to recite to night miss cheriton inquired heriot don't if you are too tired she rose at once as if compelling herself to subdue reluctance and moved towards the bay of the window slowly for a second or two after she stood there she did not speak only her lips trembled then she began portia's speech on mercy in recitation her voice had the slight tremolo that is natural to many beginners who feel deeply but its quality was delicious and her obvious earnestness was not without effect conscious that her gestures were stiff she had chosen a speech that demanded little action and it was not until she came to therefore jew though justice be thy plea that her hands which she had clasped lightly in front of her fell apart with the change of position she seemed to acquire a dignity and confidence that made the climax triumphant and though heriot could see that she had much to learn his compliments were sincere when he bade her good night she looked at him appealingly tell me the truth she said under her breath i've only had my father's opinion tell me the truth i honestly believe you're clever he answered i'm sure of it he felt his words to be very cold compared with the sympathy that was stirring in him the proprietress who had entered hovered about with an eye on the gas and he repeated his adieux hurriedly the interest that he already took in the question of miss cheriton's success surprised him the day had had a charm that was new and he found that he was eagerly anticipating the morrow chapter iii on the pavements of the strand the snow had turned to slush and from the river a fog was blowing up which got into the girl's throat and made her cough she mounted a flight of gloomy stairs and pulled a bell already her bearing had lost something that had distinguished it in the summer something of courage she rang the bell deprecatingly as if ashamed the anteroom into which she passed had become painfully familiar to her like the faces of many of the occupants they all wore the same expression an air of repressed eagerness of diffidence striving to look assured the walls were covered with theatrical photographs and in a corner a pimply youth sat writing at a table what he wrote nobody knew or cared the crowd had but one thought the door that communicated with the agent's private office to which they prayed though they were no longer sanguine that they would gain admission it was four o'clock and at five the office would close there were so many of them that it was impossible for mr passmore to interview everybody which of them would be lucky to day mamie also looked towards the door and from the door back to her companions in distress a little fair woman in a light fawn costume terribly unsuitable to the season but her least shabby met her eyes and spoke have you got an appointment she asked in a low voice no oh then you won't see him said the little woman more cheerfully i thought as you'd come in so late that you had an appointment i've been here since twelve the door opened and mr passmore appeared on the threshold he did not say good afternoon to his clients he cast an indifferent gaze round the room and signed to a cadaverous man who sat sucking the handle of his umbrella here you he said retiring again the cadaverous man rose hurriedly among envious glances and twenty five heads that had been lifted in expectation drooped dejectedly the men whose watches were not pawned looked to see the time what's your line said the little woman addressing mamie once more i beg your pardon oh i'm trying for my first engagement i haven't acted yet at all the other showed surprise and some contempt a novice are you good lord it's no good your coming to the agents my dear they can't find shops for us i paid mr passmore the usual fee said mamie he promised he'd do what he could the little woman smiled and turned her shoulder to her declining further discussion another girl rang the bell but withdrew with a sigh as she perceived the futility of waiting the cadaverous man came out with an engagement writ large upon his features he stowed a type written part into the pocket of his overcoat and nodded good bye to an acquaintance whose cast of countenance proclaimed him a low comedian got anything dear boy inquired the latter in a husky whisper they want me for the white slaves company the father offered four of course i refused point blank 'no' i said 'six' 'oh' he said 'impossible' i wouldn't budge what do you think why i had eight with kavanagh and she's as good as booked me for her next tour 'i don't mind' i said 'i'll go to the harcourts' they've been trying to get me back and he knows it 'don't do that' he said 'say five my boy' 'six' i said 'and i only take it then to fill in' 'well they want you' he said 'you're the only man for the part and i suppose you've got to have your own terms but they wouldn't pay it to anybody else' his salary was to be three pounds ten and he could have shed tears of relief to get it damn fine old chap said the low comedian who didn't believe him is the comedy part open do you know i might don't think so fancy they're complete his manner was already condescending olive oil now i can't see you people to day exclaimed mr passmore putting up his hands impatiently no good miss forbes as a girl made a dart towards him with a nervous smile that was meant to be ingratiating got nothing for you it's no use what do you want my dear another lady who found it embarrassing to explain her anxiety in public faltered that she had just looked in to hear if mr passmore could kindly nothing doing perhaps later on i'll let you know you will bear me in mind won't you mr passmore she pleaded what he said oh yes yes i'll drop you a postcard i won't forget you good day he did not even recollect her name can i speak to you mr passmore said mamie rising you he said questioningly oh i can't do anything for you yet everything's made up things are very quiet just now here miss beaumont i want a word with you give me a minute persisted mamie i want an engagement i don't care how small the part is i'll be a servant i'll be anything i want a beginning i recited to you if you remember and did you he said oh yes yes i remember very nice you wanted to play juliet he laughed i'll be anything she said again i'll give you double the commission if have you got enough voice for chorus he asked testily how are your limbs i want to be an actress she said flushing i mean to work come on miss beaumont he cried and miss beaumont swept past her into the sanctum the girl who six months ago had looked forward to playing juliet made her way down the dingy staircase drearily this was but one of many dramatic agents with whom she had gone through the form of registering her name mr passmore's booking fee had been five shillings the booking fee of most of the others had been five shillings one had charged a guinea all had been affable when she paid her first visit and forgotten who she was when she paid her second all had been reminded who she was and failed to recognise her when she called again she called on one or another of them every day and contrived to gain such an interview as she had just had about once a week she had taken in the theatrical papers and replied to shoals of advertisements but as she had to state that she was a novice nobody ever took any notice of her applications she had haunted the stage doors when she read that a new piece was to be produced begging in vain to be allowed to see the manager she had in fine done everything that was possible and she was as far from securing an engagement as on the day that she arrived in england and she had talent and she was beautiful and was prepared to begin upon the lowest rung of the ladder the stage is generally supposed to be the easiest of all callings to enter the girl who is unhappy at home the boy who has been plucked for the army the woman whose husband has failed on the stock exchange all speak of going on the stage as calmly as if it were only necessary to take a stroll to get there as a matter of fact unless an extraordinary piece of luck befalls her it is almost as difficult for a girl without influence or a good deal of money to become an actress as it is for her to marry a duke she may be in earnest but there are thousands who are in earnest she may be pretty but there are hundreds of pretty actresses struggling and unrecognised she may be a genius but she has no opportunity to display her gift until the engagement is obtained and this is the tremendous obstacle she can prove nothing she can only say i feel i should succeed if she is allowed to recite and it is very rarely that she is a recital is little or no test of her qualifications for the stage she may recite cleverly and as an actress be very indifferent she has to beg to be taken on trust while a myriad women eager for the vacant part can cry i can refer you to so and so i have experience though other artistic professions may be as hard to rise in there is probably none other in which it is quite so difficult to make the first steps if a girl is able to write she can sit alone in her bedroom and demonstrate her capability if she can paint her canvases speak for her if she pants to be a prima donna she can open her mouth and people hear her sing the would be actress alone among artists can do nothing to show her fitness for the desired vocation until her self estimate has been blindly accepted and she may easily fail to do herself justice then cast as she will be for minor parts entirely foreign to her bent to succeed on the stage requires indomitable energy callousness to rebuffs tact luck talent and facilities for living six or nine months out of the year without earning a shilling to get on to the stage requires valuable introductions or considerable means if a woman has neither the chances are in favour of her seeking an opening vainly all her life and as to a young man so situated who seeks it he is endeavouring to pass through a brick wall mamie descended the dingy staircase and at the foot she saw the girl who had been addressed as miss forbes she was standing on the doorstep gathering up her skirts it had begun to snow again and she contemplated the dark damp street shrinkingly an impulse seized mamie to speak as she passed from such trifles great things sometimes followed she remembered she was at the age when the possibility of the happy accident recurs to the mind constantly a will o' the wisp that lightens the gloom the reflection takes marvellous forms and at twenty one the famous actor of the aspirant's imagination who goes about the world crying a genius you must come to me may be met in any omnibus the famous actor of the aspirant's imagination is like the editor as conceived by the general public he spends his life in quest of obscure ability if we're going the same way i can offer you a share of my umbrella she said oh thanks said the girl in a slightly surprised voice i'm going to charing cross and i'm going to victoria so our road is the same said mamie a feeling of passionate pleasure suffused her as she moved away by the girl's side through the yellow fog the roar of the strand had momentarily the music of her dreams while she yearned in duluth the greatness of the city the london of theatres art and books throbbed in her veins she was walking with an actress isn't it beastly said the girl i suppose you've got to train it yes i'm living at wandsworth have you far to go notting hill i take the bus passmore hadn't got anything for you had he mamie shook her head we were both unlucky but perhaps it doesn't matter so much to you doesn't it have you been on his books long miss miss cheriton mamie cheriton that's a good name it sounds like a character in a play as if she'd have a love scene under the apple blossom where were you last at mr faulkner's but he didn't know of any vacancy either i don't mean that said miss forbes i mean how long have you been out oh answered mamie i left home at one o'clock that's the worst of living such a long way off the other stared don't you understand she exclaimed i mean what company were you in last and when did it finish oh i see stammered mamie i'm sorry to say i've everything in front of me i've never had a part yet at all i'm that awful thing a novice crumbs said miss forbes i guess you actresses look down on novices rather well the profession is full enough already goodness knows still i suppose we've all got a right to begin i don't mind a novice who goes to the agents in the snow it shows she means business anyhow it's the amateurs who go to the managers in hansoms that i hate but it's an awful struggle my dear take my word for it you'd better stop at home if you can afford to and passmore will never be any use to you look at me i've been going to him for four months and i played prince arthur on tour with sullivan when i was nine i am looking at you said mamie smiling and envying you till i'm ill you say passmore is no use let me into a secret what can i do to get an engagement blest if i know if you haven't got any friends to pull the strings i'd like to know the secret myself well she broke off perhaps we shall meet again i must say 'good evening' here there's my bus don't go yet begged mamie won't you come and have some tea first miss forbes hesitated eloquently i shall get tea when i reach home she murmured and i'm rather late oh let me invite an actress to tea do please it will be the next best thing to getting a part you're very kind i don't mind i'm sure there's a place close by where they give you a pot for two for fourpence you're american aren't you i've lived in america i'm english really they were soon seated at a table mamie ordered a pot of tea and muffins it's nice and warm in here she said isn't it i noticed you in the office my name is mabel forbes but i daresay you heard passmore speak to me yes he didn't speak very nicely did he they never do they're all alike they know we can't do without them and they treat us like dirt i tell you it's awful you don't know what you're letting yourself in for my dear to succeed i'd bear anything all the snubs and drudgery imaginable i do know i know it's not to be avoided i've read the biographies of so many great actresses i should think of the future the reward i'd set my teeth and live for that time and i'd work for it morning noon and night it would do me good to live with you if we were on tour together said miss forbes cheerfully you'd keep my pecker up i think i loathe sharing diggings with another girl as a rule one always quarrels with her and with the same bedroom one has nowhere to go and cry after they've been in the profession a few years they don't talk like you not that there's really much in it she added with a sigh to set your teeth and work morning noon and night sounds very fine but what does it amount to it means you'd get two ten a week and study leading business on the quiet till you thought you were as good as ellen terry but if nobody made you an offer what then you mean it's possible to be really clever and yet not to come to the front asked mamie earnestly how can you come to the front if no one gives you the opportunity you may be liked where you are in what you're doing but you can't play lead in london unless a london manager offers you an engagement to play lead can you you can't make him do you suppose the only clever actresses alive are those who're known besides if leading business is what you are thinking of i don't believe you've the physique for it you don't look strong enough i should have thought light comedy was more your line it isn't if i'm meant for anything it's for drama and and tragedy but i'd begin in the smallest way and be grateful the ideas i had when i came to london have been knocked out of me and they were moderate enough too i'd begin by saying that the 'dinner was ready' surely it can't be so difficult to get an opening like that if one knows how to set about it well look here my dear i played prince arthur with sullivan when i was nine as i tell you and i've been in the profession ever since but i've been out of an engagement for four months now all i could save out of my last screw has gone in bus fares and stamps and my people haven't got any more money than they know how to spend if an engagement to announce the dinner had been offered me to day i'd have taken it and i'd be going back to notting hill happy i'm awfully sorry said mamie sympathetically shall we have another muffin no i don't want any more thanks but you've no idea what a business it is i've got talent and experience and i'm not bad looking and yet you see how i've got to struggle one is always too late everywhere i was at the queen's this morning there are always any number of small parts in the queen's things you know and i thought there might be a chance for the pride of the troop they'd got everybody except the extra ladies by the way you might try to get on at the queen's as an extra if you like with your appearance you'd have a very good chance i should say mamie felt her heart stirring feverishly do you mean it she asked what are 'extras' you don't mean 'supers' oh they're better than supers different class you know of course they've nothing to say except in chorus they come on in the race course scene and the ball room and look nice they wear swagger frocks the management finds their dresses and are supposed to murmur and laugh and act in dumb show in the background you know they're frightful fools a girl who could act a bit would stand out among extra ladies like a bernhardt at the ladbroke hall if they'd take me said mamie clasping her hands if they'd only take me do you really think they will it couldn't hurt to try ask for mr casey and tell him you want to 'walk on' there i've given you a hint after all she exclaimed as she got up one can't think of everything right off it might prove a start for you who knows if casey sees you're intelligent he may give you a line or two to speak you go up to one of the principals and say 'lord tomnoddy where's that bracelet you promised to send me when i saw you at kempton park' then the low comedy merchant it's generally the low comedy merchant you speak to says something that gets a laugh and bustles up the stage and you run after him angrily but don't be sanguine even of getting on as an extra there's always a crowd of women besieging the queen's at every production you won't be the only pretty one well i must be going my dear i wish you luck and luck to you said mamie squeezing her hand gratefully and many many thanks i look forward to telling you the result i suppose we're sure to see each other at mr passmore's oh we're bound to run against each other somewhere before long returned miss forbes cordially yes i shall be curious to hear what you do i've enjoyed our chat very much take care of yourself she hurried towards her bus waving au revoir and mamie crossed the road london widened between the girls and their paths in it never met again chapter iv as she reached the opposite pavement heriot exclaimed miss cheriton are you going to cut me you she cried with surprise it was it was the fog's fault i didn't see what a stranger you are it's a fortnight since you came out to us a 'fortnight' you observe i'm 'quite english you know' now you're in good spirits he said what have you been doing i've been rising in my career she answered gaily i have had tea in a cakeshop with an actress i have just shaken hands with her she has just given me a piece of advice i am in imagination already a personage who is she asked heriot where does she come from let me see you to victoria i suppose that's where you are going he stopped a hansom and scrutinised her sadly as they took their seats have you been out in this weather long he said you poor child how wet you must be well you know an actress aren't you going to tell me all about it she was as voluble as he wished he had become in the last few months her confidant and consoler lavender street wandsworth or those residents who commanded a view of no had learnt to know his figure well awhile ago he had marvelled at the role he was filling latterly he had ceased to marvel he realised the explanation and as he listened to her tale her words smote him it hurt him to think of the girl beside him cringing to a theatrical agent forming a chance acquaintance in the streets and contemplating so ignoble a position as the one of which she spoke he looked at her yearningly you are not pleased she said is there a great deal to be pleased at is this sort of thing worthy of you it is the first step oh be nice about it do if you understood can i be juliet at once if i'm to succeed i have sympathised with you he said i've entered into your feelings i do understand but you don't know what you're meditating admitting it's inevitable admitting if you're to be an actress that you must begin since you've no influence where you're content to begin can you bear it these women you'll be thrown amongst some at least she said will be like myself surely i am not the only girl who has to begin and whatever they are it can't be helped remember i'm in earnest i talked at first wildly i see how childish i was what should i be if i faltered because the path isn't strewn with roses an actress must be satisfied to work it isn't decreed that you need be an actress answered heriot after all there is no necessity to fight for your bread and butter if you were compelled there are more compelling forces than poverty can't you recognise ambition haven't i he said have i been wood ah she smiled forgive me i didn't mean that but be nice still am i to reject a career because i'm not starving i'm starving with my soul i'm like a poor mute battling for voice i want i want to give expression to what i feel within me she beat her hands in her lap i'm willing to struggle eager to you've always known it why do you disappoint me now i have to begin even lower than i understood that's all and what is it i shall be surrounded by artists then by degrees i shall rise 'you are in the right way but remember what i say study study study study well and god bless you' do you know who said that mrs siddons to macready it was at newcastle and it was about her performance the same night that he wrote 'the violence of her emotion seemed beyond her power longer to endure and the words faintly articulated was he alive sent an electric thrill through the audience' think what that means three words i can't do it i've tried oh how i've tried for months after i read that book i used to say them dozens of times every day with every intonation i could think of but there was no effect no thrill even to myself 'study study study keep your mind on your art do not remit your study and you are certain to succeed' i will keep my mind on it i'll obey her advice i will succeed heaven couldn't be so cruel as to let me fail after putting such longings into me heriot sighed the impulse to tell her that he loved her to keep her to himself was mastering him never before had her hold on him been displayed so vividly nor had the temptation to throw prudence to the winds been quite so strong if you had a happier home he said there would be other influences don't think me impertinent but it can't be very lively for you in that house it isn't a whirl of gaiety and aunt lydia is not ideal but but i was just the same in duluth duluth he echoed it was dreary in duluth too at all events i had my father there what does he write asked heriot have you had a letter since i saw you he gives no news the news is to come from me i think there's a little he said i can tell it by your tone it's cheerful to be with some one who can tell things by one's tone well he thinks if i can't make a beginning that i may as well go back i see he said i won't ask you if you mean to she laughed a shade defiantly duluth has many charms i've been remembering them since his letter there is my father and there's strawberry shortcake my father will be disappointed in me if i have to go the strawberry shortcake well there's a tiny shop there where they sell it hot i've never seen it hot anywhere else and they turn on the cream with a tap out of a thing that looks like a miniature cistern you're not going back he said you're going on the stage as a supernumerary instead in the flare of the station lamps her eyes flashed at him he could see the passionate trembling of her mouth the cab stopped and they got out and threaded their way among the crowd to the barriers there was a train in ten minutes heriot learnt shall we go to the waiting room no said miss cheriton forgive me what i said just now i am sorry what does it matter it was brutal rather perhaps it was unexpected you have failed me when i wanted you most he took two first class tickets he wished to be alone with her and he knew that she travelled second i'm coming with you he said but you can't have dined our suppers are not extensive let us get in he answered they had the compartment to themselves when the door banged and he regarded her silently with nerves that had escaped control i have warned you she said it will be something out of a tin for certain with vinegar over it mamie there was rebuke in her expression mamie he repeated i love you why i dislike your going on the stage is because i want you myself i was 'brutal' because i'm fond of you will you marry me she lay back against the darkness of the cushions pale and startled are you serious she said you want to marry me do you mean it i mean it i don't seem able to tell you how much i mean it can you like me well enough to be my wife i do like you she stammered but i hadn't an idea i never thought you thought oh i'm sorry why why can't you say 'yes' to marry you i'll be very gentle to you he said shakily i for god's sake don't judge my love for you by the way i put it i haven't had much practice in love making it's a pity perhaps there's a word that says it all i 'worship' you my darling what have you to look forward to you've seen you've tried you know what an uphill life it will be it's not as if i begged you to waive your hopes while you had encouragement to hope you've made the attempt and you know the difficulties now come to me instead you shall live where you like you can choose your own quarter you can have everything you care for books pictures theatres too oh my sweet come to me and i'll fulfil every wish will you mamie i can't she said tremulously it wouldn't be fair her eyes shone at him and she leant forward with parted lips i like you i like you very much but i don't i'm not i've never been in love with anyone i'll be grateful for small mercies said heriot with an unhappy laugh and i could not do what you ask if i fail i fail but i must persevere i can't accept failure voluntarily i can't stretch out my arms to it i should despise myself if i gave in to day even you you know better than that he said well yes she owned perhaps i'm wrong there to you it would seem a sensible step but i believe in myself all my life i've had the thought and i should be miserable i should hate myself i should be like my father i should be always thinking of the 'might have been' you'd be good to me but you'd know you had been a fool i'm not a bit the sort of woman you should marry and you'd repent it heriot took her hand and held it tightly i love you he said consider your own happiness only i love you i am quite selfish i know it wouldn't content me i'm not pretending to any nobility but i'm sorry i may say that i didn't dream you liked me in this way i'm not hard i'm not a horror and i can see i can see that i'm a lot to you i'm glad of that he said simply yes you're 'a lot to me' mamie if you know it and you can't care for me enough there's no more for me to say don't worry yourself it's not unusual for a man to be fond of a woman who doesn't want to marry him chapter v she betook herself to the queen's next morning less buoyantly than she had anticipated her meeting with heriot had depressed her she retained much of the nature of a child and laughed or cried very easily she had met heriot laughing and he had been serious and sad with some petulance she felt that it was very unfortunate for her that he had fallen in love with her and chosen that particular day to tell her so she entered the stage door with no presentiment of conquest and inquired of the man in the little recess if mr casey was in the theatre stage door keepers are probably the surliest class in existence they have much to try them and they spend their official lives in a violent draught but if there is a stage door keeper sweet and sunny in his home he provides an interesting study for the dramatic authors the man took her measure in an instant saving in one particular she was prepared to give him a shilling and he did not guess it mr casey's on the stage he said he won't be disturbed now if i waited do you think i might see him i couldn't tell you i'm sure he resumed his perusal of a newspaper and mamie looked at him through the aperture helplessly there was the usual knot of loafers about the step a scene hand or two in their shirt sleeves a girl in her pathetic best dress also hoping for miracles a member of the company who had slipped out from rehearsal to smoke a cigarette cerberus was shown where his estimate had been at fault he said miss now if you write your business on one of these forms miss i'll send it in to mr casey he gave her a stump of pencil and a printed slip specially designed to scare intruders she wrote her name and mr casey's name and could find no scope for euphemisms regarding the nature of the interview she sought she added to obtain engagement as extra lady and returned the paper with embarrassment she was sufficiently unsophisticated in such matters to assume that her object had not been divined 'ere bill one of the scene hands turned take it in to mr casey for this lady the man addressed as bill departed through a second door with a grunt and a bang and she waited expectantly the girl in her best frock sneered she could not afford to dispense shillings herself and already her feet ached the door swung back constantly at intervals of a few seconds a stream of nondescripts issued from the unknown interior and mamie stood watching for the features of her messenger it was nearly a quarter of an hour before he reappeared mr casey can't see you he announced the stage door keeper heard the intelligence with absolute indifference but the girl on the step looked gratified what shall i do asked mamie i can't do no more than send in for you miss it ain't much good your waiting the call won't be over till three o'clock could i see him then he'll come out if you like to take your chance i'll come back at three o'clock she said it was then eleven she turned into the strand the strand that has broken more hearts than fleet street here a young actor passed her who was also pacing the inhospitable pavements until the hour in which he hoped to see patience and importunity bear fruit he wore a fashionable overcoat and swung his cane with a gloved hand presently he would seek a public house and lunch on a scone and a glass of mild and bitter if he had bitter he would be a halfpenny short in his homeward fare to bow there a musical comedy actress went by who had married a swell his family had been deeply wounded and showed their mortification by allowing her to support him she had had three children and when he was drunk which was frequently he said god forbid that they should ever become damned mummers like their mother a manager had just told her that she had lost her figure and wouldn't look the part and she was walking back to islington where the brokers were in the house a popular comedian who had been compelled to listen to three separate tales of distress between charing cross and bedford street and had already lent unfortunate acquaintances thirty shillings paused and hailed a hansom from motives of economy it was the typical crowd of the strand a crowd of the footlights the men whose positions had been won were little noticeable but the gait and costume of the majority affected youth and disheartened age indicated their profession to the least experienced eyes because she grew very tired and not that she had any expectation of hearing good news mamie went into mr passmore's office and sat down and she did not hear any after an hour she went away and rested next in the anteroom of another of the agents who repeated that things were very quiet and that he wouldn't forget her seven or eight other girls were waiting their turn to be told the same thing at a quarter to three she went back to the queen's is he coming out now she said am i too soon eh said the stage door keeper you told me he'd be out about three i was asking for mr casey this morning oh were you he said there's been a good many asking for him since then he gradually recalled her mr casey's gone he added they finished early he won't be here till to night there was a week in which she went to the stage door of the queen's theatre every day at all hours and at last she learnt casually that as many extra ladies as were required for the production had been engaged there were months during which she persisted in her applications at other stage doors and hope flickered within her still but when september came and a year had passed since her arrival the expiring spark had faded into lassitude she tried no longer only sometimes out of the sickness of her soul the impulse to write was born and she picked up a pen then it was definitely decided that she should return to america it was characteristic of her that she had no sooner dried her eyes after the decision than she was restless to return at once duluth was no drearier than wandsworth externally it was even picturesque with the blue water and the sunshine and the streets of white houses rising in tiers like a theatre in duluth the residents looked down on one another literally the life was appalling but when all was said was it more limited than aunt lydia and if in lieu of acting she dared aspire to dramatic authorship the thought stirred her occasionally she could work as well in minnesota as in middlesex cheriton had remitted the amount of her passage and suggested that she should sail in a week or two she had not received the draft two hours when she went up to town and booked a berth in the next steamer when it was done she posted a note to heriot acquainting him with her intention his visits had not been discontinued but he came at much longer intervals latterly and she could not go without bidding him good bye she sat in the lavender street parlour the next evening wondering if he would come almost she hoped that he would not she had written and therefore done her duty to see him would in the circumstances humiliate her cruelly she felt she remembered how she had talked to him twelve months before recalled her confidence her pictures of a future that she was never to know and her eyes smarted afresh she had even failed to obtain a hearing what a fool what an idiot i look she thought passionately tea was over but the maid of all work had not removed the things and when heriot entered the large loaf and the numerous knives which are held indispensable to afternoon tea in lavender street were still on the big round table the aspect of the room did not strike him any more he was familiar with it like the view of the kitchen when the front door had been opened and the glimpse of clothes line in the yard beyond may i come in he said did you expect me lor it's mr heriot said mrs baines fancy she told the servant to take away the teapot and to bring in another knife he wondered vaguely what he was supposed to do with it i thought it likely you'd be here said mamie won't you sit down i only had your letter this morning so you are going away i am going away i bow more or less gracefully to the inevitable to bow gracefully to the inevitable is strong evidence of the histrionic gift he said i came i saw i was conquered please don't talk about it it was only settled yesterday i sail on saturday you know yes you wrote me murmured heriot it's very sudden i'm crazy to do something if only to confess myself beaten may i offer you a cup o' tea mr heriot asked mrs baines she always offered cups of tea and was indebted to neighbours for their hospitality he thanked her you will miss your niece he said declining a place at the table to which she had moved a chair yes i'm sure she answered i say now it's a pity she didn't go with her father last october going in a vessel by herself oh dear i say i wouldn't have got accustomed to having her with me if she'd gone with her father though that's neither here nor there yes i think you may believe you'll be missed miss cheriton he said i say it's very odd she couldn't be an actress as she wanted continued mrs baines seems so unfortunate with all the trouble that she took but lor my dear we can't see what lies ahead of us and perhaps it's all for the best i say perhaps it's all for the best mr heriot eh dear mamie may be meant to do something different writing or such like it's not for us to say have you been writing again asked heriot turning to the girl a little she said bitterly my vanity dies hard and aunt lydia has encouraged me heriot looked a reproach her tone hurt him though he understood of what it was the outcome i should be glad if you had encouragement he replied i think you need it now but it hurt him also to discuss her pain in the presence of the intolerable third he knew that if he remained to supper there would be a preparatory quarter of an hour in which he was alone with her and it was for this quarter of an hour that he hungered conscious that during the opening of the lobster tin two destinies would be determined that's right mr heriot said mrs baines placidly i'm glad to hear you say so that's what i've been telling her i say she mustn't be disheartened why it's surprising i'm sure how much seems to be thought of people who write stories and things nowadays they seem to make quite a fuss of them don't they and i'm certain dear mamie could write if she put her mind to it i was reading in the paper tit bits only last week that there was a book called robert ellis or some such name that made the author quite talked about now i read the piece out to you dear didn't i a book about religion it was by a lady and i'm sure dear mamie knows as much about religion as anyone my aunt means robert elsmere said mamie in a laboured voice you may have heard it mentioned you mustn't expect mr heriot to know much about it said mrs baines mr heriot is so busy a gentleman that very likely he doesn't hear of these things but i assure you mr heriot the story seems to have been read a great deal and what i say is if dear mamie can't be an actress why shouldn't she write books if she wants to do something of the sort i wonder my brother didn't teach her to paint with her notions and that but not having learnt i say she ought to write books that's the thing for her a nice pen and ink and her own home i agree with you mrs baines if she wants to write she can do that in her own home not to compare it with such a profession as yours mr heriot she said which of course is sensible and grave but girls can't be barristers and will you open the window for me exclaimed mamie it's frightfully warm don't you think so she stood there with her head thrown back and closed eyes her foot tapping the floor restlessly are you wishing you hadn't come she asked under her breath why one must suffer to be polite here aren't you a little unjust said heriot deprecatingly you have it for an hour she muttered i have had it for twelve months have you ever wanted to shriek i wanted to shriek just now violently i know you did he said well it's nearly over are you glad yes and no i can't say if won't you go on if i dared hope to do anything else but i'm not going to talk like that any more i'm ridiculous enough already to whom are you ridiculous to my own perception you not to me he said 'pathetic' yes to you i'm 'pathetic' you pity me as you might pity a lunatic who imagined she was the queen of england i think you know said heriot diffidently that neither the queen nor a lunatic inspires in me quite the feeling that i have for you she changed her position and spoke at random this street is awfully stupid isn't it she said look at that man going up the steps yes he is very stupid i daresay what of it he is a clerk she said and wheels his babies out on sunday mamie come and talk to aunt lydia again how rude we are i want to talk to you he demurred aren't you going to ask me to stay to supper the suggestion came from the widow almost at the same moment i think we had better have the lamp she went on the days are drawing in fast mr heriot aren't they we shall soon have winter again do you like the long evenings or the long afternoons best just about now i always say that i can't bear to think of having to begin lighting up at five or six o'clock it seems so unnatural and then next summer somehow i feel quite lost not being able to let down the blinds and light the lamp for tea mamie dear shut the window and let down the blinds before i light the lamp somebody might see in she suggested the danger in the same tone in which she might have apprehended a burglary under a glass shade a laggard clock ticked drearily towards the crisis and heriot provoked its history by the eagerness with which he looked to see the time it had been a wedding present from poor dear edward's brother and only one clockmaker had really understood it the man had died and since then he listened praying for the kitchen to engulf her when she withdrew at last with an apology for leaving him he rose and went to the girl's side do you know why i came this afternoon he said she did know had known it in the moment that he opened the window for her to say 'good bye' she murmured i came to beg you not to go dearest what do you relinquish by marrying me now not the stage your hope of the stage is over not your ambition in itself you can be ambitious as my wife you lose nothing and you give a heaven mamie won't you stay she leant on the mantelpiece without speaking in the pause mrs baines' voice reached them distinctly as she said put the brawn on a smaller dish you are forgetting there was a reason besides the stage it is you who've forgotten i told you i would be content it wouldn't be repugnant to you to refuse while i thought i had a future and to say 'yes' now that how can you ask me it would be an insult to your love i do ask you he urged i implore you implore me to be contemptible you would have a disappointed woman for your wife you deserve something better than that oh my god said heriot in a low voice if i could only tell you how i ache to take you in my arms as softly as if you were a child if i could tell you what it is to me to know that you are passing out of my life and that in two days' time i shall never see you again mamie the heavy shuffle of the servant was heard in the passage mamie he repeated desperately it will be worse over there her eyes were big with perplexity and doubt mamie are you sure you sure i love you i want you only trust me mamie if you're quite sure you wish it she faltered yes chapter vi when heriot informed his brother of his approaching marriage sir francis said i never offer advice to a man on matters of this sort and proceeded to advise he considered the union undesirable and used the word heriot replied on the contrary i desire it extremely you're of course the best judge of your own affairs i'll only say that it is hardly the attachment i should have expected you to form it appears to me if i may employ the term romantic i should say said heriot in his most impassive manner that that is what it might be called admitting the element of romance what of it we are not boys george said sir francis he added and the lady is twenty two the father is an hotel keeper in the united states you tell me and the aunt lives in wandsworth socially wandsworth is farther than the united states but geographically it is close this mrs payne or baynes is not a connection you will be proud of i take it i shall be very proud of my wife said heriot with some stiffness there are more pedigrees than happy marriages the baronet looked at his watch as i have said it's not a matter that i would venture to advise you upon of course i congratulate you we shall see miss cheriton at sandhills i hope and er catherine will be delighted to make her acquaintance i have to meet phil at the club he's got some absurd idea of exchanging wants to go out to india and see active service and i got him into the guards boys are damned ungrateful when do you marry very shortly during the vacation there'll be no fuss sir francis told his wife that it was very lamentable and lady heriot preferred to describe it as disgusting but in spite of adjectives the ceremony took place the honeymoon was brief and when the bride and bridegroom came back to town they stayed in an hotel in victoria street while they sought a flat ultimately they decided upon one in south kensington and it was the man's delight to render this as exquisite as taste and money made possible the furniture for his study had simply to be transferred from his bachelor quarters but the other rooms gave scope for a hundred consultations and caprices and like a lad he enjoyed the moments in which he and mamie bent their heads together over patterns and designs she would have been more than human and less than lovable if in those early weeks her disappointment had not been lost sight of more than a girl if the atmosphere of devotion in which she moved had not persuaded her primarily that she was content only after the instatement was effected and the long days while her husband was away were no longer occupied by upholsterers' plans did the earliest returning stir of recollection come only as she wandered from the drawing room to the dining room and could find no further touches to make did she first sigh a gift of heriot's he had chosen it without her knowledge and it had been delivered as a surprise was a writing table a writing table that was not meant merely to be a costly ornament and one morning she sat down to it and began another attempt at a play the occupation served to interest her and now the days were not so empty in the evening as often as he was able heriot took her out to a theatre or a concert or to houses from which invitations came the evenings were enchantingly new to her less so perhaps when they dined at the solemn houses than when a hansom deposited them at the doors of a restaurant and her husband's pocket contained the tickets for a couple of stalls she was conscious that she owed him more than she could ever repay and though she had casually informed him that she had begun a drama she did not discuss the subject with him at any length to dwell upon those eternal ambitions of hers was to remind him that she had said she would be dissatisfied and he deserved something different from that he deserved to forget it to be told that she had not an ungratified wish she felt ungrateful to realise that such a statement would be an exaggeration in the november following the wedding it was seen that her majesty had been pleased on the recommendation of the lord chancellor to approve the name of george langdale heriot to the rank of queen's counsel and heriot soon found reason to congratulate himself on his step a man may earn a large income as a junior and find himself in receipt of a very poor one as a leader there is an instance cited in the inns of court of a stuff gownsman making eight thousand a year whose income fell when he took silk to three hundred but heriot's practice did not decline few men at the bar could handle a jury better or showed greater address in their dealings with the bench he knew instinctively the moment when that small concession was advisable when the attitude of uncompromising rigour would be fatal to his case he had his tricks in court the least affected of men out of it in court he had his tricks counsel acquire them inevitably and one of heriot's had been a favourite device of ballantyne's in cross examination he looked at the witness scarcely at all but kept his face turned to the jury box why this should be persuasive is a mystery that no barrister can explain but its effectiveness is undeniable nevertheless he was essentially sound as he had been known as a safe man while a junior so now that he had taken silk he was believed in as a leader the figures on the briefs swelled enormously his services were more and more in demand then by and by there came a criminal case that was discussed day by day throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom in drawing rooms and back parlours in clubs and suburban trains and heriot was for the defence the kensington study had held him until dawn during weeks for he had to break down medical evidence and on the last day he spoke for five hours while the reporters' pens flew and the prisoner swayed in the dock and the verdict returned was not guilty when he unrobed and left the court george heriot walked into the street the man of the hour and he drove home to mamie who kissed him as she might have kissed her father he adored his wife and his wife felt affection for him but the claims of his profession left her to her own resources and she had no child chapter vii when they had been married three years she knew many hours of boredom she could not disguise from herself that she found the life she led more and more unsatisfying that luxury and a devoted husband who was in court during the day and often in his study half the night were not all that she had craved for that her environment was philistine depressing dull and she lectured herself and said the fault was her own and that it was a very much better environment than her abilities entitled her to she recited all the moral precepts that a third person might have uttered and the dissatisfaction remained to write plays ceases to be an attractive occupation when they are never produced she had written several plays by this time and submitted them more or less judiciously to several west end theatres there had even been an instance of a manager returning a manuscript in response to her fourth application for it but she was no nearer to success or to an artistic circle a career at the bar is not all causes celebres and the details of heriot's briefs were rarely enthralling to her mind even when he discussed them with her and when he came into the drawing room he did not want to discuss his briefs he wanted to talk trifles just as he preferred to see a musical comedy or a farce when they went out nor did he press her for particulars of her own pursuits during his absence she never sighed over him and as she appeared to be cheerful he thought she was contented that such allusions to her literary work as she made were careless he took to mean that she had gradually acquired staider views once he perceived that it was perhaps quieter for her than for most women for she had no intimate acquaintances but then she had never been used to any there were her books and her music and her shopping no he did not think she could be bored besides her manner at dinner was always direct evidence to the contrary she was now twenty five years old and the kensington flat and abundant means had lost their novelty she was never moved by a clever novel without detesting her own obscurity never looked at the window of the stereoscopic company without a passion of envy for the successful artists never accompanied heriot to the solemn houses without yearning for a passport to upper bohemia instead she was twenty five years old and marriage without having fulfilled the demands of her temperament had developed her sensibilities it was at this period that she met lucas field if her existence had been a story nothing could have surprised her less than such a meeting it would have been at this juncture precisely that she looked for the arrival of an artist and lucas field would probably have been a brilliant young man who wore his hair long and wrote decadent verse the trite in fiction is often very astonishing in one's own life however and as a matter of fact she found their introduction an event and foresaw nothing at all lucas field was naturally well known to her by reputation so well known that when the hostess brought mr field across to her mamie never dreamed of identifying him with the dramatist she had long since ceased to expect to meet anybody congenial at these parties and the fish had been reached before she discovered who it really was who had taken her down field was finding it a trifle dreary himself he had not been bred in the vicinity of the footlights his father had been a physician and his mother the daughter of a lincolnshire parson but he had drifted into dramatic literature when he came down from oxford and the atmosphere of the artistic world had become essential to him by now portman square though he admitted its desirability and would have been mortified if it had been denied to him invariably oppressed him a shade when he entered it he was at the present time foretasting hell in the fruitless endeavour to devise a scenario for his next play and he had looked at mamie with a little interest as he was conducted across the drawing room a beautiful woman has always an air of suggestion she is a beginning a heroine without a plot regarded from the easel she is all sufficing contemplated from the desk she is illusive after you have admired the tendrils of hair at the nape of her neck you realise with despondence that she takes you no farther than if she had been plain field had realised that she left him in the lurch before his soup plate had been removed presently he inquired if she was fond of the theatre please don't say 'yes' from politeness he added why should i she had gathered the reason in the next moment and her eyes lit with eagerness he had a momentary terror that she was going to be commonplace i couldn't dream that it was you here she said apologetically isn't a poor playwright respectable he asked there was an instant in which she felt that on her answer depended the justification of her soul she said afterwards that she could have fallen round an epigram's neck i should think the poor playwright must be very dull she replied this was adequate however and better than his own response which was of necessity conventional i have seen your new comedy she continued i hope it pleased you i admired it immensely like every one else it is a great success isn't it the theatre is very full every night he said deprecatingly then it is a success does that follow you are not satisfied with it it falls short of what you meant i shouldn't have supposed that it seemed to me entirely clear that i had a theory really perhaps i have not failed so badly as i thought he did not think he had failed at all but this sort of thing was his innocent weakness miss millington is almost perfect as 'daisy' isn't she 'almost' where do you find her weak she blushed she struck me of course i am no authority as not quite fulfilling your idea in the first act when she accepted the captain i thought perhaps she was too responsible there too grown up there isn't a woman in london who could play 'daisy' said field savagely in other words you think she wrecked the piece oh no indeed if 'daisy' isn't a child when she marries the play has no meaning no sense that is why the character was so difficult to cast in the first act she must be a school girl and in the others an emotional woman perhaps i said too much you are a critic mrs heriot oh merely merely merely very interested in the stage to be interested in the stage is very ordinary to be a judge of it is rather rare no you didn't say too much miss millington doesn't fulfil my idea when she accepts 'captain arminger' and to be frank i haven't fulfilled miss millington's idea of a consistent part i can understand said mamie that the great drawback to writing for the stage is that one depends so largely on one's interpreters a novelist succeeds or fails by himself but a dramatist a dramatist is the most miserable of created beings said field if he happens to be an artist i can hardly credit that i can't credit anybody being miserable who is an artist he laughed it was not polite but he couldn't help it though i can understand his having moods of the most frightful depression she added oh you can understand that quite would he be an artist if he didn't have them may i ask if you write yourself n no she murmured does that mean 'yes' it means 'only for my own amusement' the writer who only writes for his own amusement is mythical i'm afraid said field one often hears of him but he doesn't bear investigation you don't write plays no i try to he regarded her a little cynically i thought ladies generally wrote novels i wish to be original you see do you send them anywhere oh yes i send them i suppose i always shall you're really in earnest then you're not discouraged i'm earnest and discouraged too is it impertinent to ask if you had experiences like mine when you were younger i wrote plays for ten years before i ever passed through a stage door one must expect to work for years before one is produced of course one may work all one's life and not be produced then it depends how clever one is or whether one is clever at all it depends on a good many things it depends sometimes on advice if she had been less lovely he would not have said this and he knew it if she had not been mrs heriot he would not have said it either the average woman who wants a literary man's advice is the bane of his existence and field was not only without sympathy for the tyro as a rule he was inclined to disparage the majority of his colleagues he was clever and was aware of it he occupied a prominent position he had arrived at the point when he could dare to be psychological it depends sometimes on advice he said and the wife of george heriot qc murmured unfortunately i have nobody to advise me even as it was he regretted it when he took his leave and the manuscript that he had offered to read lay in his study for three weeks before he opened it he picked it up one night remembering that the writer had been very beautiful the reading inspired him with a desire to see her again that the play was full of faults goes without saying but it was unconventional and there was character in it he recollected that she had interested him while they talked after dinner on a couch by the piano and as her work was promising he wrote volunteering to point out in an interview if she liked those errors in technique which it would take too long to explain by letter it cannot be made too clear that if she had sent him a work of genius and had been plain miss smith in a home made blouse he would have done nothing of the sort he called upon her with no idea that his hints would make a dramatist of her nor did he care in the slightest degree whether they did or did not she was a singularly lovely woman and as her drama had not been stupid stupidity would have repelled him he thought a tete a tete with her would be agreeable to mamie however the afternoon when he sat sipping tea in her drawing room like an ordinary mortal was the day of her life she told him that she had once hoped to be an actress and believed that the avowal would advance her in his esteem he answered that he should not be astonished if she had the histrionic gift and was secretly disenchanted a shade by what he felt to be banal then they discussed his own work and he found her appreciation remarkably intelligent to talk about himself to a woman who listened with exquisite eyes fixed upon his face was very gratifying to him field had rarely spent a pleasanter hour it is not intimated that he was a vain puppy he was not a puppy at all he had half unconsciously felt the want of a sympathetic confidant for a long while though and albeit he did not instantaneously realise that mrs heriot supplied the void he walked back to his chambers with exhilaration he realised it by degrees he had never married he had avoided matrimony till he was thirty because he could not afford it and during the last decade he had escaped it because he had not met a woman whom he desired sufficiently to pay such a price when he had seen mamie several times and in the circumstances it was not difficult to invent reasons for seeing her he wondered whether he would have proposed to her if she had been single heriot was very pleased to have him dine with them and he was not ignorant that during the next few months field often dropped in about five o'clock mamie concealed nothing knowingly and the subject of her writing was revived now she told george that mr field thought she had ability she repeated his criticisms frankly admired his talent confessed that she was proud to have him on her visiting list and fell in love with him without either analysing her feelings or perceiving her risk and while mrs heriot fell in love with him lucas field was not blind he saw a great deal more than she saw herself he saw not only the influence he exercised over her but that she had moped before he appeared he did not misread her he was conscious that she would never take a lover from caprice that she was the last woman in the world to sin lightly or under the rose he saw that if he yielded to the temptation that had begun to assail him he must be prepared to ask her to live with him openly but he asked himself whether it was impossible that he could prevail on her to do that had he the mind to do so whether she was so impregnable as she believed he was by this time fascinated by her his happiest afternoons were spent in south kensington advancing his theories and talking of his latest scenes nor was it a lie when he averred that she assisted him to be an artist it is not necessary to be able to produce and if her own attempts had been infinitely more futile than they were she might still have expressed opinions that were of service to another many of her views were impracticable naturally psychological as his tendencies were he was a dramatist and he could not snap his fingers at the laws imposed by the footlights though he might affect to deride them in his confidences the only dramatist alive was ibsen he said yet he did not model himself on ibsen albeit he was delighted when she exclaimed how ibsenish that is many of her views were impracticable because she was ignorant about the stage but many were intensely stimulating the more he was with her the less he doubted her worthiness of sinning for his sake he was so different from the ordinary dramatic author on the ordinary dramatic author with no ideas beyond curtains and fees she would have been thrown away he did not wish to be associated with a scandal it would certainly be unpleasant but she dominated him there was no disguising the fact and he would be very good to her he would marry her she was adorable his meditations had not progressed so far without the girl's eyes being opened to her weakness and now she hated herself more bitterly than she had hated the tedium of her life she knew that she loved him she was wretched when he was not with her and ashamed when he was there she wandered about the flat in her solitude frightened as she realised what an awful thing had come to her but she was drunk intoxicated by the force of the guilty love and by the thought that such a man as lucas field could be in love with her she revered him for not having told her of the feelings that she inspired her courage was sustained by the belief that he did not divine her own that she would succeed in stamping them out without his dreaming of the danger she had run yet she was drunk and one afternoon the climax was reached he implored her to go away with him chapter viii if a woman sins and the chronicler of her sin desires to excuse the woman her throes and her struggles her pangs and her prayers always occupy at least three chapters if one does not seek to excuse her the fact of her fall may as well be stated in the fewest possible words mamie did struggle she struggled for a long time but in the end she was just as guilty as if she hadn't shed a tear field's pertinacity and passion wore her resistance out at last theirs was to be the ideal union and of course he cited famous cases where the man and woman designed for each other by heaven had met only after one of them had blundered he did not explain why heaven had permitted the blunders after being at the pains to design kindred souls for each other's ecstasy but there are things that even the youngest curate cannot explain he insisted that she would never regret her step he declared that with himself for her husband she would become celebrated art love joy all might be hers at a word and she spoke it when heriot came in one evening mamie was not there and he wondered what had become of her for at this hour she was always at home but he had not a suspicion of evil he was as far from being prepared for the blow that was in store as if field had never crossed their path he had let himself in with his latch key and after a quarter of an hour it occurred to him that she might be already in the dining room when he entered it he noted with surprise that the table was laid only for one where is mrs heriot he said to the servant who appeared in response to his ring mrs heriot has gone out of town sir out of town he exclaimed what do you mean mrs heriot left a note for you sir to explain there it is sir heriot took it from the mantelpiece quickly but still he had no suspicion not an inkling of the truth he tore the envelope open and read while the maid waited respectfully by the door your mistress has been called away he said when he had finished illness she will be gone some time his back was to her he could command his voice but his face was beyond his control he felt that if he moved he would reel perhaps fall he stood motionless with the letter open in his hand shall i serve dinner sir yes serve dinner odell i'm quite ready when the door closed it was his opportunity to gain the chair he walked towards it slowly like a blind man the letter that he held had left but one hope possible the last hope of despair to keep the matter for awhile from the servants' knowledge as yet he was not suffering acutely indeed in these early moments the effect of the shock was more physical than mental there was a trembling through his body and his head felt queerly light empty not his own the maid came back and he forced himself to dine the first spoonfuls of the soup he took were but heat entirely tasteless to his mouth and at the pit of his stomach a sensation of sickness rose and writhed like something living when she retired once more his head fell forward on his arms it was a relief to rest it so he did not know how he could support the long strain of her vigilance by degrees his stupor began to pass as he stared at the vacant place where his wife should have sat the dazed brain rallied to comprehension his wife was not there because she was with her lover oh god with her lover mamie had given herself to another man mamie mamie had gone to another man his face was grey and distorted now and the glass that he was lifting snapped at the stem she had gone she was no longer his wife she was guilty shameless defiled mamie he rose an older a less vigorous figure i shall be busy to night he muttered don't let me be disturbed he went to his study and dropped upon the seat before his desk her photograph confronted him and he took it down and held it shakenly how young she looked was there ever a face more pure and heaven knew that he had loved her as dearly only an hour ago as on the day that they were married not a whim of hers had been refused not a request could he recollect that he had failed to obey yet now she was with a lover she smiled in the likeness the eyes that met his own were clear and tender truth was stamped upon her features he recalled incidents of the past three years incidents that had been rich in the intimacy of their life surely in those hours she had loved him that had not been gratitude a sense of duty merely had she not loved him then he remembered their wedding day how pale she had been how innocent a child yet now she was with a lover a sob convulsed him and he nodded slowly at the likeness through his tears presently he put it back he was angered at his weakness he had deserved something better at her hands pride forbade that he should mourn for her he had married wildly yes he should have listened to advice francis had warned him perhaps while he wept they were laughing at him together she and field how did he know that it was field had she mentioned his name in the letter he knew that it was field instinctively he marvelled that he had not foreseen the danger and averted it how stupid had the petitioners in divorce suits often appeared to him in his time he had wondered that men could be so purblind and he himself had been as dense as any but she would not laugh ah guilty as she was she would not laugh she was not so vile as that the clock in the room struck one he heard it half unconsciously then started and threw out his arms with a hoarse cry he sprang to his feet fired with the tortures of the damned the sweat burst out on him and the veins in his forehead swelled like cords he was a temperate man at once by taste and by necessity but now he walked to where the brandy was kept and drank a wineglassful in gulps mamie he groaned again mamie the brandy did not blot the picture from his brain and he refilled the glass nothing would efface the picture he knew that it was hopeless to attempt to sleep yet he went to the bedroom the ivory brushes were gone from the toilet table she had been able to think of brushes in the wardrobe the frocks were fewer and the linen was less the jewellery that he had given to her had been left behind all was orderly there were no traces of a hurried departure the room had its usual aspect he looked at the pillows against the one that had been hers lay the bag of silk and lace that contained her night dress had she forgotten it or was it that she had been incapable of transferring that he picked it up and dropped it out of sight in one of the drawers he did not go to bed he spent the night in an armchair re reading the letter and thinking when the servant knocked at the door he went to his dressing room and shaved he had a bath and breakfasted and strolled to the station outwardly he had recovered from the blow and his clerk who gave him his list of appointments remarked nothing abnormal about him in court heriot remembered that mamie and he were to have dined in holland park that evening and during the luncheon adjournment he sent a telegram of excuse if any one had known what had happened to him he would have been thought devoid of feeling he had scarcely re entered the flat when mrs baines called his first impulse was to decline to see her but he told the maid to show her in a glance assured him that she was ignorant of what had occurred dear mamie is away the servant tells me she said simpering i hadn't seen her for such a long time that i thought i'd look in to day not that i should have been so late but i missed my train i meant to come in and have a cup of tea with her at five o'clock well i am unfortunate and how have you been keeping mr heriot i'm glad to see you i hope you are well mrs baines where has dear mamie gone she asked pleasuring she is on the continent i believe may i tell them to bring you some tea now on the continent alone exclaimed mrs baines fancy no she is not alone said heriot you must prepare yourself for a shock mrs baines your niece has left me she looked at him puzzled his tone was so composed that it seemed to destroy the significance of his words left you how do you mean she has gone with her lover oh my gawd said mrs baines whatever are you saying mr heriot don't your niece is living with another man she left me yesterday he continued quietly i am sorry to have to tell you such news he was sorrier as he observed the effect of it but he could not soften the shock for her by any outward participation in her grief since he must speak at all he must speak as he did oh to hear of such a thing she gasped oh to think that well oh mr heriot i can't it can't be true isn't it some mistake dear mamie would never be so wicked i'm sure she wouldn't it's some awful mistake you may depend there's no mistake mrs baines my authority is your niece herself she left a letter to tell me she was going and why the widow moaned feebly with another man he bowed oh heaven will punish her mr heriot oh what will her father say how could she do it and you how gentle and kind to her you were i could see i did my best to make her happy he said evidently i didn't succeed is it necessary for us to talk about it much believe me you have my sympathy but talking won't improve matters oh but i can't look at it so so calmly mr heriot the disgrace and so sudden and it isn't for me to have your sympathy i'm sure i say it isn't for you to sympathise with me my heart bleeds for you mr heriot you're very good he answered but i don't know that a faithless wife is much to grieve for after all ah but you don't mean that you were too fond of her to mean it she'll live to repent it you may be certain the lord will bring it home to her oh how could she do it you don't you don't intend to have a divorce naturally i intend it what else do you propose oh i don't know she quavered rocking herself to and fro and smearing the tears down her cheeks with a forefinger in a black silk glove but the disgrace and all lavender street to read about it ah you won't divorce her mr heriot it would be so dreadful don't you want to see the man marry her how 'marry her' she asked vaguely oh i understand yes i suppose he could marry her then couldn't he i'm not a lawyer like you i didn't look so far ahead but i don't want a divorce ah well i want it he said for my own sake then you don't love her any more mr heriot he laughed drearily your niece has ended her life with me of her own accord i've nothing more to do with her those are cruel words said mrs baines those are cruel words about a girl who was your lawful wife the flesh of your bone in the sight of gawd and man you're harder than i thought mr heriot you don't take it quite as i'd have supposed you'd take it so quiet and stern like i think if you'd loved her tenderly you'd have talked more heart broken though it's not for me to judge heriot rose i can't discuss my sentiments with you mrs baines think if you like that i didn't care for her at all at least my duty to her is over and i have a duty to myself to day to cast her off the semi educated classes use the phrases of novelettes habitually whether this is the reason the novelettes trade in the phrases or whether the semi educated acquire the phrases from the novelettes is not clear to he paused he could not trust himself to speak at that moment to cast her off repeated mrs baines oh i don't make excuses for her i don't pity her though she is my brother's child i say she is deserving of whatever befalls her i remember well that when dick married i warned him against it i said 'she isn't the wife for you' it's the mother's blood coming out in her though my brother's child but what was i going to say i'm that upset that oh yes i make no excuses for her but i would have liked to see more sorrow on your part mr heriot i could have pitied you more if you'd have taken it more to heart you may think me too bold but it was ever my way to say what was in my mind i don't think i'll stop any longer the way you may take it is between you and your gawd but she put out her hand i don't think i'll stop good evening he said stonily i'm sorry you can't stay and dine she recollected on the stairs that she had not inquired who the man was but she was too much disgusted by heriot's manner to go back chapter ix when a naturally pure woman who is not sustained by any emancipated views consents to live with a man in defiance of social prejudices she probably obtains as clear an insight as the world affords into the enormous difference that exists between the ideal and the actual matrimony does not illumine the difference so vividly because matrimony with all its disillusions leaves her an unembarrassed conscience with her lover such a woman experiences all the prose of wedlock and a sting to boot a man cannot be at concert pitch all day long with his mistress any more easily than with his wife she has to submit to bills and other practical matters just as much with a smirched reputation as she had with a spotless one the romance does not wear any better because the marriage service is omitted a lover is no less liable to be commonplace than a husband when the laundress knocks the buttons off his shirts yes mamie was infatuated by field she had not sinned with a cool head simply to procure a guide up parnassus but she had hoped to pick a few laurels there all the same she found herself in a little flat in the rue tronchet they had few visitors and those who did come were men who talked a language that she did not understand but who looked things that she understood only too well the remorse and humiliation that she felt was not leavened by any consciousness of advancing in her art field rather pooh poohed her art as the months went by after the decree nisi was pronounced he still discussed his work with her perhaps less as if she had been a sybil but still with interest in her ideas her own work however bored him now he had no intention of being cold but the subject seemed puerile to his mind if she did write a play that was produced one day or if she didn't what earthly consequence was it she would never write a great one and these panting aspirations which begot such mediocre results savoured to him of a storm in a teacup of a furnace lit to boil the kettle he was rather sorry that he had run away with her but he did not regret it particularly of course he would marry her as soon as he could he owed her that and since he was not such a blackguard as to contemplate deserting her by and by he might just as well marry her as not the whole affair had been a folly certainly he was not rich and he was extravagant he would have done better to remain as he was still many men envied him he trusted fervently she would not have children though it didn't seem likely but if she ever did the error would be doubled he did not want a son who had cause to be ashamed of his mother when he grew up it was curious that she did not refer more often to his legalising their union her position pained her he could see and made her very frequently a dull companion that was the worst of these things one paid for the step dearly enough to expect lively society in return and yet if one complained of mournfulness one would be a brute he would write a drama some time or other to show that it was really the man who was deserving of sympathy in such an alliance it would be very original as he would treat it the lover should explain his situation to another woman whom he had learnt to love since and well he didn't see how it should end with the dilemma repeated and it didn't matter after all for nobody would have the courage to produce it he made these reflections in his study in the salon furnished in accordance with the tastes of the lady who had sub let the flat to them for six months mamie stood staring down at the street it was four o'clock and saving for half an hour at luncheon she had not seen him since ten for distraction she could make her choice among some tauchnitz novels her music and a walk excepting that the room was tawdry and ill ventilated and that she had lost her reputation it was not unlike her life in south kensington in her pocket was a letter from her father the most difficult letter that it had ever fallen to dick cheriton's lot to compose theoretically he thought social prejudices absurd as became an artist to whom god had given his soul and he had often insisted on their ineptitude in the case of his own daughter however he would have preferred to see them treated with respect there was a likeness to lucas field here field also dwelt on the hill top but he wanted his son if he ever had one to boast a stainless mother cheriton had not indited curses like the fathers in melodrama and the people who have found religion only parents in melodrama and some christians who go to church twice every sunday are infamous enough to curse their children he had told her that if she found herself forsaken she was to cable for her passage money back to duluth but that he was ashamed and broken by what she had done he had not attempted to conceal and as she stood there gazing down on the rue tronchet mamie was recalling the confession to which this was an answer phrases that she had used came back to her i have done my best but my love was too strong for me wicked as it may be to say it i know that even in my guilt i shall always be happy i met the right man too late but i am so young i could not suffer all my life without him forgive me if you can had she it was a horrible thought had she been mistaken had she blundered more terribly than when she married for unless her prophecies of joy to the brim were fulfilled unless her measure of thanksgiving overflowed the blunder was more terrible infinitely more terrible she was a gambler who had staked her soul in her conviction of success the question was one that she had asked herself many times before without daring to hear the answer but that the answer was in her heart though she shrank from acknowledging it might be seen in her expression in her every pose it might be seen now as she drooped by the window she sighed and sat down and shivered yes she knew it she had thrown away the substance for the shadow she could deceive herself no longer lucas field was not so poetical a personality as she had imagined guilt had no glamour her devotion had been a flash in the pan a madness that had burned itself out she had no right to blame her lover for that only the prospect of marriage with him filled her with no elation it inspired misgiving rather if she had made a blunder would it improve matters to perpetuate it he was considerate to her he spared her all the ignominy that was possible but instinctively she was aware that if they parted he would never miss her as her husband had done in his life she would never make a hole she guessed the depth of heriot's love better now that she had obtained a smaller one as plummet between the manner of the man who was not particularly sorry to have run away with her and his whose pride she had been the difference was tremendous to a woman whose position was calculated to develop her natural sensitiveness to the point of a disease should she marry lucas or not hitherto she had merely avoided the query now she trembled before it expedience said yes something within her said no the decree would be made absolute in two months' time what was to become of her if they separated to duluth she could never go to be pointed at and despised she sighed again bored dear asked field in the doorway i was thinking that was obvious not of your er work no not of my 'er work' he pulled his moustache with some embarrassment i didn't mean anything derogatory to it oh i know she said wearily don't it doesn't matter you can't think much less of it than i am beginning to do myself you can't take much less interest in it you are unjust said field i am moped take me out take me out of myself if you can but take me out of doors at any rate i am yearning to be in a crowd we might go to a theatre to night he said would you like to it doesn't amuse me very much i don't understand what they say still it would be something but i want to go out now for a walk i don't like walking here alone can't you come with me i'm afraid i can't you forget i promised an interview to that paper this afternoon i expect the fellow here any moment you promised it she exclaimed with surprise why i thought you said that the paper was a 'rag' and that you wouldn't dream of consenting after all one must be courteous i changed my mind there's some talk of translating a clever man's son into french an interview just now would be good policy you are going to be adapted a clever man's son translated he said i may adapt i am translated she smiled but perceived almost at the same instant that she had not been intended to do so and that he had said it seriously i make a very good interview he continued lighting a cigarette i daresay you've noticed it i never count an epigram or two wasted though they do go into another chap's copy that's where many men make a mistake or very likely they can't invent the epigrams anyhow they don't the average interview is as dull as the average play people think it's the journalists' fault but it isn't it's the fault of the deadly dull dogs who've got nothing to tell them i ought to have gone a good deal further than i have i've the two essential qualities for success i'm an artist and a showman don't she murmured don't he laughed gaily i'm perfectly frank i admit the necessities of life i've told you so before my mind never works so rapidly as it does in prospect of a good advertisement there the fellow is i expect he added as the bell rang the study is quite in disorder for him and there are a bunch of parma violets and a flask of maraschino on the desk i'm going to remark that maraschino and the scent of violets are indispensable to me when i work he won't believe it unless he is very young but he'll be immeasurably obliged that sort of thing looks well in an interview violets and maraschino are a graceful combination i think she did not reply she sat pale and chagrined he was renowned enough and more than talented enough to dispense with these stage tricks in the library she knew it and he knew it but he could not help them awhile ago they had caused her the cruellest pain now she was more contemptuous than anything else although she was still galled that he should display his foibles so candidly i am quite frank he had said she found such frankness a milestone on the road that she had travelled my dear child said field among the illusions of a man's youth is the belief that if he goes through life doing his humble best in an unobtrusive way the press will say what a jolly fine fellow he is and hold him up as a pattern to all the braggarts and poseurs who are blowing their own trumpets and scraping on their own fiddles among the things he learns as he grows older is the fact that if he does his best in an unobtrusive way the press will say nothing about him at all the fiddle and the trumpet are essential but it is possible to play them with a certain amount of refinement it is even possible though a clever man cannot dispense with the fiddle and the trumpet for the fiddle and the trumpet to be played so dexterously that he may dispense with cleverness i do not go to such lengths myself you have no need to do so she said coldly i have no need to do so thank you but i can quite conceive that say violets and maraschino worked for all they were worth might alone make a man famous a mouse liberated a lion and things smaller than a mouse have created one before now the violet in the hedgerow 'bloomed unseen' or 'died unknown' was it it did something modest and unsuccessful i know the violet assiduously paragraphed and paraded might lead to fortune i would rather be obscure and do honest conscientious work answered mamie than write rubbish and finesse myself into popularity it is much easier he said tranquilly to be obscure is the one thing that is easy still you don't mind my saying that i hate the adjectives you used though do you the words 'honest' and 'conscientious' applied to literature dearest make me shudder i am always afraid that 'wholesome' is coming in the next sentence are you going to say so to your interviewer the remark isn't brilliant it was sincere and to be sincere and brilliant at the same time is a little difficult i've been both though in the scene i've just done you must read it or rather i'll read it to you you'll be pleased with it as soon as the piece is finished i must write to erskine it will suit the pall mall down to the ground and i should like it done there only only what field hesitated i meant it for erskine from the start he saw the scenario and the part fits him like a glove but what were you going to say well i fancy he has some idea that a piece of mine just now you understand with the case so fresh in people's minds erskine's a fool what on earth does the public care of course he'll do it when he reads the part he's got only i know he's doubting whether my name'd be a judicious card to play yet awhile there was a pause in which her heart contracted painfully i see she rejoined in a low voice he fidgeted before the mirror and glanced at his watch that fellow must be getting impatient you had better go in to him she said well we'll go to the vaudeville or somewhere to night mamie that's arranged yes to the vaudeville or somewhere she assented with another sigh she went back to the window and stared at the rue tronchet with wet eyes chapter x some weeks afterwards field went to england he did not take mamie with him for he intended to remain only a few days nor had she been at all desirous of accompanying him she had begun indeed to see that she did not know what she did desire her life in paris oppressed her the notion of duluth was horrible and the thought of living with lucas in london where she might meet an acquaintance of heriot's at any turn was repugnant in an almost equal degree field was unexpectedly detained in london the business that had been responsible for his journey constantly evaded completion and after he had been gone about a month a letter came in which he mentioned incidentally that he had a touch of influenza after this letter a fortnight went by without her hearing from him and rendered anxious at last she wrote to inquire if his silence was attributable to his indisposition if the latter was of a serious nature her mind did not instantaneously grasp the significance of the telegram that she tore open a few hours later it ran my nephew dangerously ill if you desire to see him better come porteous she stood gazing at it who had telegraphed who then she understood that it was lucas who was meant lucas was dangerously ill she must go to him she must go at once she was so staggered by the suddenness of the intelligence that she was momentarily incapable of recollecting when the trains left or how she should act in order to ascertain all she realised was that this was paris and lucas lay dangerously ill in london and that she had to reach him her head swam and the little french that she knew seemed to desert her the undertaking looked enormous beset with difficulties that were almost insuperable the stupidity of the bonne for whom she pealed the bell served to sharpen her faculties a trifle but she made her preparations as in a dream when she found herself in the train it appeared to her unreal that she could be there the interval had left no salient impressions on her brain nothing but a confused sense of delay it was only now that she felt able to reflect the telegram was crumpled in her pocket and she took it out and re read it agitatedly how did this relative come to be at the hotel lucas had scarcely spoken of his relations if you desire to see him the import of those words was frightful he could not be expected to recover her stupefaction rolled away and was succeeded by a fever of suspense the restriction of the compartment was maddening and she looked at her watch a dozen times only to find that not ten minutes had passed since she consulted it last it seemed to her that she had been travelling for at least two days when she stood outside a bedroom in a little hotel off bond street and tapped at the door with her heart in her throat the door was opened by a woman whose dress proclaimed her to be an institution nurse field slept and mamie sank into a chair and waited for his wakening how is he she asked in a low tone the nurse shook her head he's not doing as well as we could wish ma'am is mr porteous here mrs porteous she'll be coming presently she lives close by so it was a woman who had telegraphed somehow she had assumed unquestioningly that it was a man if you desire to see him ah yes she might have known it an aunt who would be frigid and contemptuous of course well she deserved that she would have no right to complain nor was it to be expected that lucas's family should show her much consideration though she could not perceive that she had done them any injury two hours passed before she had an interview with the lady mamie was in the room that she had engaged in the meanwhile she had bathed her face and was making ready to return to the sick room when she was told that mrs porteous was inquiring for her won't you come in she asked our voices won't disturb him here mrs porteous entered gingerly she was a massive woman of middle age fashionably dressed her expression suggested no grief only a vague fear of contamination she had telegraphed to paris because she felt that it was her duty to do so but she had not telegraphed until it was almost certain that the patient would not rally sufficiently to make a will you are er mrs heriot she said regarding her curiously the doctor thought that mr field's condition ought to be made known to you so i wired thank you it was very kind the doctor advised it said mrs porteous again significantly is he is there no hope we fear not my nephew is sinking fast it's as well you should understand it if you think it necessary to remain i see you have taken a room as as 'mrs field' i presume i should have been 'mrs field' if lucas his aunt shivered there are things we need not discuss of course i'm aware that you are living under my nephew's name i was about to say that if you think it necessary to remain till the end i have no opposition to offer but the end is very near now my telegram must have prepared you i should not have wired unless i understood answered mamie yes i am glad that your nephew had a relative near him though your name was quite strange to me he never mentioned it really lucas called to see us at once our house is in the neighbourhood he wrote me said mamie that he had a touch of influenza it seems extraordinary that influenza should prove so serious he was strong he was in good health the other's air implied that she did not find it necessary to discuss this either people die of influenza or the results of it every year she said the doctor will give you any information you may desire no doubt you must excuse me i may be wanted while field lingered she never left his side after mamie's arrival men committed preposterous actions on their death beds and though he was not expected to recover consciousness there was the possibility that he might do so if an opportunity occurred his mistress would doubtless produce a solicitor and a provision for herself with the rapidity of a conjuring trick as it was mrs porteous had small misgivings but what he would die intestate there might not be much but at any rate what he had should not swell the coffers of guilty wives events proved that her summons had not been precipitate however field spoke at the last a few coherent words and took mamie's hand but that was all then he never spoke any more even as she stood gazing at the unfamiliar face on the pillow the swiftness of the catastrophe made it difficult for the girl to realise that all was over the calamity had fallen on her like a thunderbolt it seemed strange inexplicable untrue the last time but one that he had talked to her he had been full of vigour packing a portmanteau humming a tune alluding to fees some details of the theatre the prospect of a smooth crossing and now he was dead there had been little or no transition he was well he was dead the curtain had tumbled in the middle of the play and it would never go up any more it was not till after the funeral that she was capable of meditating on the change that lucas field's death had wrought in her life she did not ask herself whether he had left her anything or not the idea that he might have done so never occurred to her nor would she have felt that she could accept his bequest if he had made one she perceived that she had nobody to turn to but her father and to him she cabled cheriton replied by two questions what was field's will and would she like to return to duluth to the second she made a definite answer impossible pray don't ask me and then there was an interval of correspondence while mrs porteous rejoiced to find that her confidence was justified and that her nephew had died intestate mamie was contemplating the choice of swallowing her repugnance to going back to america or of living with mrs baines cheriton had written to them both and that one course or the other should be adopted he was insistent mamie need not live in lavender street mrs baines might make her home in another neighbourhood where they would be strangers but that the girl should remain alone in england was out of the question which line of conduct did she prefer she could not decide immediately both proposals distressed her on the whole perhaps the lesser evil was to resign herself to her aunt lydia if as her father declared her aunt was willing to receive her mrs baines at any rate was but one while in duluth half the population would be acquainted with her story but was her aunt lydia willing was she expected to write to her and inquire she was not entitled to possess dignity of course but it was not easy to eat dust because the right to self respect was forfeited she had removed to a lodging in bernard street bloomsbury and in the fusty sitting room she sat all day lonely and miserable reviewing the blunder of her life she neither wrote nor read her writing was an idea she hated now she merely thought wishing she could recall the past wondering how she could bear the future one afternoon when she sat there pale and heavy eyed the maid of all work announced a visitor and mrs baines came in mamie rose nervously and the other advanced she had rehearsed an interview which should be a compromise between the instructions that had been given her by her brother and the attitude of righteous rebuke that she felt to be a permissible luxury but the forlornness of the figure before her drove her opening sentence from her head all she could utter was the girl's name and then there was a pause in which they looked at each other it is kind of you to come mamie murmured i hope you're well said mrs baines not very i won't you sit down i never thought i should see you like this mamie said the widow half involuntarily shaking her head the girl made no answer in words she caught her breath and stood passive if the lash fell she would suffer silently we always see sin punished though she believed we always did she retained such startling optimism it's not for me to reproach you thank you i'm not too happy aunt lydia i daresay my dear i haven't come to make it worse for you she scrutinised her again she would have been horrified to hear the suggestion but her niece's presence was not without a guilty fascination a pleasurable excitement to her as she remembered that here was one who had broken the seventh commandment she was sitting opposite a girl who had lived in paris with a lover and she was sitting opposite her in circumstances which redounded to her own credit i have heard from your father she went on i suppose you know yes said mamie he has written me and do you wish to make your home with me again i'm quite ready to take you if you like i could never live in lavender street any more aunt lydia you must understand that that it would be awful to me your father hinted at my moving it will be a great trouble but i shan't shirk my duty dear mamie if it will make your burden any easier to bear we will live together somewhere else i say if i can make your burden any easier for you i will live somewhere else i am not ungrateful i yes if you will have me i should like to come to you mrs baines sighed and smoothed her skirt tremulously to balham she inquired you are moving to balham i was thinking about it i was over there the other day to get some stuff for a bodice it's nice and healthy and the shopping is cheap it's all the same to me where we go said mamie so long as the people don't know me i hear you were living with with him in paris operas and drives and all manner of things to soothe your conscience he gave you no doubt said mrs baines in an awestruck invitation to communicativeness after that terrible life in paris balham will seem quiet to you i daresay but perhaps you won't mind that' no place can be too quiet for me the quieter it is the better i shall like it that's as it should be though i suppose with him you were out among gaieties every night she waited for a few particulars again as none were forthcoming then i'll try to let the house and we'll go over together and look at some in balham as soon as you like my dear she continued your father will see that i'm not put to any expense in the meantime you'll stay where you are eh you know you know i saw mr heriot after you'd gone don't you no stammered the girl lifting eager eyes you went to him the very next day my dear so it seemed i thought i'd drop in and have a cup of tea with you not having seen you for so long and through missing a train and having such a time to wait at the station i was an hour and more late when i got to kensington he was at home of course i had no idea there was anything wrong i shall never forget it never you might have knocked me down with a feather when i heard you'd gone what muttered mamie what did he say it was like this i said to him 'dear mamie's away the servant tells me' for naturally i thought you were visiting friends 'as likely as not she's with his family' i thought to myself 'oh yes' he said 'you must prepare yourself for a shock mrs baines my wife has left me' 'left you' i said 'yes' said he so cool that it turned me a mask of blood to hear him 'she's gone away with a lover' 'mr heriot' i exclaimed 'mister heriot' 'she left a note' he said 'so it's quite true do you think we need talk about it much i don't know that a worthless woman is any loss' he said he said that those were his very words my dear and that cool i stared at him i'd no mind to make excuses for you gawd knows but for all that one's own flesh and blood wasn't going to be talked about like niggers in my hearing when i got my wits together i said 'it seems to me i'd be sorrier for you mr heriot if you took it different' 'oh' said he in his superior way 'would you we needn't discuss my feelings madam perhaps you'll stay and dine' i was so angry that i couldn't be civil to him 'i thank you' i said 'i will not stay and dine and i take the opportunity mr heriot of telling you you're a brute' with that i came away but there was much more in between that i've forgotten about the divorce it was he said he had 'a duty to himself' and that the man could marry you when you were divorced which i suppose he would have done if he had lived though whether your sin would have been any less my dear if an archbishop had performed the ceremony is a question that i couldn't undertake to decide you must begin your life afresh now that it's all 'absolute' which i learn is the proper term and you'll never be in a newspaper any more pray to heaven for aid and take heart of grace and if it will relieve you to speak sometimes of those sinful months with with the other one in paris why you shall talk about them to me my dear and i won't reproach you mamie was no longer listening an emotion that she did not seek to define was roused in her as she wondered if heriot could indeed have taken the blow so stoically as her aunt declared she scarcely knew whether she wished to put faith in his demeanour or not but the subject was one that filled her thoughts long after mrs baines's departure it was one to which she constantly recurred with less delay than might have been anticipated the widow found a house in balham to fulfil her requirements and the removal was effected several months before no lavender street was sub let the houses of this class differ from one another but slightly excepting that the one in balham was numbered and that the street was called rosalie road mamie could have found it easy to believe that she was re installed in wandsworth it seemed to her sometimes as if the van that had removed the furniture had also brought the ground floor parlour with the miniature bay window overlooking the shrubs and the plot of mould the back yard with the clothes prop and the neighbours' yards with the continuous clatter they too might have been transferred from lavender street and so abiding was the clatter that even if she felt sleepy at nine o'clock it was useless to go to bed before eleven in view of this unintermittent necessity for back yards she wondered how the inmates of more expensive houses for which back yards were not provided managed to support the deficiency the women that she viewed from the bedroom among the clothes lines or across the plot of mould as they went forth with string bags might have been the lavender street tenants and were they not the lavender street children these who on week days swung unkempt on the little creaking gates along the road and on sundays walked abroad in colours so grotesquely unsuited to them such houses are for the most part happily the crown of lives too limited to realise their limitations too unsuccessful to be aware that they have failed to rosalie road balham with her aunt lydia for companion the divorced woman at the age of twenty six retired to remember that she had once hoped to be an artist and had had the opportunity of being happy to day she hoped for nothing there was no scope for hope if she could have awakened to find herself famous her existence would have been coloured a little though she knew that fame could not satisfy her now as it would once have done but the ability to labour for distinction was gone she was apathetic she had no interest in anything when six months had passed she regarded death as the only event to which she could still look forward when she had been here a year a glimmer of relief entered into her depression the doctor who had attended her and sounded her lungs told her that she must take care of herself sometimes a neighbour looked in and spoke of dilapidations and the indifference of the landlord of the reductions at a high road linendraper's and the whooping cough sometimes a curate called to sell tickets for a concert more elementary than his sermons in the afternoon she walked to tooting bec and stared at the bushes in the evening she betook herself to the circulating library where lady audley's secret and the wide wide world were displayed and the proprietor said he hadn't heard of meredith perhaps she had made a mistake in the name god help her she was guilty and she had left a husband desolate but the music that she had dreamed of was the opera on wagner nights the books that she had expected were copies containing signatures that were the envy of the autograph collector the circle that had been her aim was the world of literature and art she lived at balham she saw the curate and she heard about the dilapidations in the neighbour's roof one year merged into another and if she lived for forty more the neighbour and the curate would be her all chapter xi when five years had passed after the divorce the liberal party came into power again and george heriot qc mp was appointed solicitor general his work and ambitions had not sufficed to mend the gap in his life but it had been in work and ambition that he endeavoured to find assuagement of the wound perhaps eagerness had never been so keen in him after his wife went as while he was contesting the borough that he represented now perhaps he had never realised the inadequacy of success so fully as he did to day when one of the richest prizes of his profession was obtained conscious that the anticipated flavour was lacking the steps to which he might look forward still lost much of their allurement were he promoted to the post of attorney general and raised to the bench he foresaw that it would elate him no more than it elated him now as sir george heriot and a very wealthy man to recall the period when as a struggling junior he had sat up half the night to earn a guinea the five years had left their mark upon him the hours of misery which no one suspected had left their mark upon him the lines about his eyes and mouth had deepened his hair was greyer his figure less erect men who in their turn sat up half the night to earn a guinea envied him cited his career as an example of brilliant luck the success of others is always luck and though they assumed that a fellow was generally cut up a bit when his wife went wrong found it difficult to conceive that sir george had permitted domestic trouble to alloy his triumphs to any great extent nobody imagined that there were still nights when he suffered scarcely less acutely than on the one when he returned to discover that mamie had gone nobody guessed that there were evenings when his loneliness was almost unbearable to the dry self contained man that moments came when he took from a drawer the likeness that had once stood on his desk and yearned over it in despair that was his secret pride forbade that he should share it with another he contemned himself that he did suffer still a worthless woman should not be mourned out of his life should be out of his memory such weakness shamed him in august a week or so after the vacation began he went to stay at sandhills his object in going to sandhills was not wholly to see his brother and still less was it to see his sister in law he was solitary he was wretched and he was only forty seven years of age he had been questioning for some time whether the wisest thing he could do would not be to marry again he sought no resumption of rapture but he wanted a home an estimable wife perhaps a son would supply new interests and the vague question that had entered his mind had latterly been emphasised by his introduction to miss pierways who he was aware was now the guest of lady heriot miss pierways was the daughter of a lady who had been the hon mrs pierways and whose straitened circumstances had debarred her from the suite in hampton court that she might otherwise have had at the period of her husband's death the widow and the girl had retired to obscure lodgings the only break in the monotony of the latter's existence being an occasional visit to some connections or friends at whose places it was hoped she might form a desirable alliance the most stringent economies had to be practised in order to procure passable frocks for these visits but the opportunities had led to no result though she had beauty and then an extraordinary event occurred when the girl was twenty eight the widow who for once had reluctantly accepted an invitation to accompany her received an offer of marriage herself and became the wife of an american who was known to be several times over a millionaire for one door that had been ajar to the daughter of the hon mrs pierways with nothing but her birth and her appearance to recommend her a hundred doors flew open to the step daughter of henry van buren and it was shortly after the startling metamorphosis in the fortunes of the pair that heriot had first met them the dowry that agnes pierways might bring to her husband weighed with him very little for he was in a position to disregard such considerations but miss pierways' personality appeared to him suggestive of all the qualifications that he sought in the lady whom he should marry without her manner being impulsive or girlish she was sufficiently young to be attractive she was handsome and in a slightly statuesque fashion that bore promise of the serenity which he told himself was now his aim certainly if he did re marry and he was contemplating the step very seriously it would be difficult to secure a partner to fulfil his requirements more admirably than miss pierways whether he fulfilled hers he could ascertain when he had fully made up his mind it was with the intention of making up his mind in proximity to the lady that he had gone to sandhills and one evening when he was alone in the smoking room with his brother the latter blundered curiously enough on to the bull's eye of his meditations i wonder said sir francis that you've never thought of re marrying george my experience of matrimony was not fortunate answered heriot smoking slowly but with inward perturbation your experience of matrimony was a colossal folly all things considered the consequences might easily have been a good deal worse i don't follow you between ourselves the end never seemed to me so regrettable as you think it my wife left me and you divorced her and you have no children if i had had children said heriot musingly it is a fact that the consequences would have been worse but in any case said the baronet it was a huge mistake really one may be frank in the circumstances you married madly the probability is that if your wife had been if you were living together still you would be a miserable man to day it was a very lamentable affair of course when it happened but regarding it coolly in looking back on it don't you fancy that perhaps things are just as well as they are i was very fond of my wife replied heriot engrossed by his cigar to an extent said sir francis indulgently no doubt you had an affection for her but my dear fellow what companionship had you was she a companion i don't know was she interested in your career could she understand your ways of thought was she used to your world one doesn't ask a great deal of women but had you any single thing in common i don't know said heriot again sir francis shrugged his shoulders take my word for it that with such a girl as you married your divorce wasn't an unmixed evil it wasn't the release one would have chosen but at least it was better for you than being tied to her for life damn it george what's the use of blinking the matter now she was absolutely unsuited to you in every way you must admit it i suppose she was at the same time i was happy with her how long would the infatuation have lasted it lasted more than three years would it have lasted another five speaking honestly i believe it would though you had nothing in common i don't explain said heriot i tell you i was happy with her that's all viewing it dispassionately i suppose she was unsuited to me i don't know that we did have anything in common i don't see any justification for the fool's paradise i lived in but for all that if i married again i should never care for the woman as as i cared for her in fact i should merely marry to he was about to say to try to forget her to make a home for myself he said instead have you considered such a step asked sir francis sometimes yes the best thing you could do a very proper thing for you to do anybody in particular it's rather premature you're not in chambers old fellow what do you think of miss pierways inquired heriot after a scarcely perceptible pause a very excellent choice i should congratulate you heartily we had not noticed the and catherine is very acute in these matters there has been nothing to notice probably she would refuse me point blank but in the event of my determining to marry again i've wondered whether miss pierways wouldn't be the lady i proposed to i don't think you could do better really you don't think i'm too old for her on my honour 'too old for her' not a bit a very sensible marriage i'm not surprised that you should be attracted by her 'attracted by her' said heriot suggests rather more than the actual facts i appreciate her qualities but i can't say i'm sensible of any attachment i'm sorry that i'm not i appreciate her so fully that i am anxious to be drawn towards her a little more i'm somewhat past the age for ardent devotion but i couldn't take a wife as i might buy a horse of course i've not been very much in her society er down here i daresay when i come to know her better have you met van buren in town before he sailed he is in new york you know i like them all we were very pleased to have the mother and the girl come to us well make your hay while the sun shines it isn't shining said heriot i'm just looking east waiting for it to rise but i'm glad to have talked to you as soon as the first ray comes i think i'll take your advice i ought to marry francis i know you're right chapter xii the more he reflected the more he was convinced of it in marriage lay his chance of contentment and during the ensuing fortnight his approval of miss pierways deepened the house would not fill until the following month and the smallness of the party there at present was favourable to the development of acquaintance excepting that she was a trifle cold there was really no scope for adverse criticism upon miss pierways she was unusually well read took an intelligent interest in matters on which women of her age were rarely informed and was accomplished to the extent that she played the piano after dinner with brilliant execution and admirable hands and wrists her coldness theoretically was no drawback to him and heriot was a little puzzled by his own attitude her air was neither so formal as to intimate that his advances would be unwelcome nor so self conscious as to repel him by the warmth of its encouragement yet in spite of his admiration the idea of proposing to her dismayed him when he forced himself to approach the brink his vacillation was especially irritating since he had learned that the ladies were at the point of joining van buren in new york the opportunity of which he was failing to take advantage would speedily be past and he dreaded that if he suffered it to escape him he would recall the matter with regret he perceived as well however that if he were precipitate he might regret that too and he was sorry that they were not remaining in europe longer one evening when their departure was being discussed the mother expressed surprise that he had never visited america though she had had no curiosity about it herself until she married an american and in answer heriot declared that he had frequently thought of running across during the long vacation if you ever do she said i hope you will choose a year when we are there to tell you the truth i was thinking of it this year we may see you in new york sir george said miss pierways really how strange that will seem i've been eager to go to new york all my life but now that i'm going i'm rather afraid the idea of a great city where i haven't any friends but you will have many friends agnes by and by answered miss pierways yes i suppose so but it's very fatiguing making friends don't you think so and i tremble at the voyage how delightful it would be remarked mrs van buren if we were going by the same steamer sir george heriot laughed it would be very delightful to me to make the voyage in your company but i might bore you frightfully a week at sea must be a severe test i should be afraid of being found out we are promised other passengers observed miss pierways looking down with a faint smile her archness was a shade stiff but her neck was one of her chief attractions why don't you go george said lady heriot cheerfully you'd much better go by mrs van buren's boat than any other and you've been talking of making a trip to america 'next year' ever since i've known you this amiable fiction was succeeded by fresh protestations from mrs van buren that no arrangement could be more charming and heriot half against his will half with pleasure found himself agreeing to telegraph in the morning to inquire if he could obtain a berth he hardly knew whether he was sorry or glad when he had done so that the step would result in an engagement might be predicted with a tolerable degree of certainty and he would have preferred to arrive at an understanding with himself under conditions which savoured less of coercion since a state room proved to be vacant however he could do no less now than engage it and everybody appeared so much pleased and miss pierways was so very gracious that the misgivings that disturbed him looked momentarily more unreasonable than ever the night before he sailed in their customary chat over whisky and cigars sir francis said to him 'ask and it shall be given unto you' i'm inclined to think you're right said his brother i suppose it will end in it she's a trifle like a well bred machine doesn't it strike you so warranted never to get out of order the other's look was significant and heriot added very desirable in a wife of course only somehow 'only somehow' you're eccentric george you always were it's not my reputation said heriot drily i believe that i'm considered particularly practical reputations retorted the baronet attempting an epigram as he sometimes did in the course of his second whisky and potash and failing signally in the endeavour are like tombstones generally false he realised the reality of tombstones and became controversial i've known you from a boy and i say you were always eccentric it was nothing but your eccentricity that you had to thank before here's a nice girl a girl who will certainly have a good settlement a girl who's undeniably handsome ready to say 'yes' at the asking and you grumble i'm hanged if you don't grumble because you see she is to be depended on what the devil do you want i want to be fond of her answered heriot i admit all you've said of her i want to like her more so you ought to but what does it matter if you don't all women are alike to the men who've married them after a year or two she'll make an admirable mother and that's the main thing i suppose was it heriot recalled the criticism during his first day on board neither of the ladies was visible until queenstown was reached and he paced the deck pursuing his reflections by the aid of tobacco she would make an admirable mother and that was the main thing of the second half of the opinion he was not so sure to marry a woman simply because one believed she would shine in a maternal capacity was somewhat too altruistic he thought however he was fully aware that miss pierways had other recommendations she appeared with her mother at the head of the companion way while he was wishing that he hadn't come and he found their chairs for them and arranged their rugs and subsequently gave their letters to the steward to be posted after leaving queenstown mrs van buren's sufferings increased and the girl who saving for a brief interval was well and cheerful was practically in his charge it was heriot who accompanied her from the saloon after breakfast and strolled up and down with her till she was tired when the chair and the rug the salient features of a voyage are the woman the chair and the rug were satisfactorily arranged it was he who sat beside her talking flying visits she made below while her mother kept her cabin but for the most part she was on deck or in the saloon or in the reading room and for the most part heriot was the person to whom she looked for conversation if he had been a decade or two younger he would probably have proposed to her long before they sighted sandy hook and it surprised him that he did not succumb to the situation as it was a woman is nowhere so dangerous and nowhere is a man so susceptible as at sea the interminable days demand flirtation if one is not to perish of boredom moonlight and water are notoriously potent even when viewed for only half an hour and at sea the man and the girl look at the moonlight on the water together regularly every evening and it is very becoming to the girl miss pierways' face was always a disappointment to heriot at breakfast the remembrance of its factitious softness the previous night made its hardness in the sunshine look harder he wondered if it was the remembrance of its hardness at breakfast that kept him from proposing to her when they loitered in the moonlight he was certainly doing his best to fall in love with her and everything conspired to assist him but the days went on and the momentous question remained unuttered we shall soon be there she said one evening as they strolled about the deck after dinner i'm beginning to be keen have you noticed how everybody is saying 'new york' now at first no one alluded to it we mightn't have been due for a year and since yesterday nobody's talking of anything else nearly everyone i've spoken to seems to have made the trip half a dozen times said heriot i feel dreadfully untravelled in the smoking room when are you going to niagara niagara is one of the things i'm determined not to miss i was talking to some girls who have lived in new york all their lives when they weren't in europe and they haven't been there yet they told me they had been to the panorama in westminster i have met a londoner who had never been to the temple no how perfectly appalling she exclaimed none the less fervently because she hadn't been to it herself oh yes i know i shall adore niagara i want to see a great deal of america while i'm there i wish i had time to see more i should like to go to california i wouldn't see california for any consideration upon earth she declared california to me is bret harte i should be so afraid of being disillusioned when we went to ireland once do you know sir george it was a most painful shock to me my ideas of ireland were founded on dion boucicault's plays i expected to see all the peasants in fascinating costumes with their hair down their backs just as one sees them on the stage the reality was terrible i shudder when i recall the disappointment i sympathise of course you're laughing at me i shall have my revenge if you don't like new york but i don't know i may feel guilty you mustn't blame us if you don't like new york sir george fortunately you won't have time to be very bored though will you 'fortunately' fortunately if it doesn't amuse you i mean when does the how do you say it when does your holiday end i must be back in london on the twenty fourth of next month i'm almost american myself i shall have such a fleeting glimpse of the country that i must really think of writing a book about it you have something better to do than write vapid books to me your profession seems the most fascinating one there is if i were a man i'd rather be called to the bar than anything you'd be astonished if you knew how many biographies of eminent lawyers i've read they enthralled me as a child i don't know any career that suggests such power to me as the bar don't smile sometimes when we're talking and i remember the tremendous influence you wield i tremble she lifted her eyes to him deprecating her enthusiasm which was too palpably a pose and again heriot was conscious that the opportunity was with him if he could but grasp it they had paused by the taffrail and he stood looking at her trying to speak the words that would translate their relations to a definite footing he no longer had any doubt as to her answer he could foresee her reply at least the manner of her reply with disturbing clearness he knew that she would hesitate an instant and droop her head and ultimately murmur correct phrases that would exhilarate him not at all in imagination he already heard her tones as she promised to be his wife he supposed as they were screened from observation that he might take her hand how passionless how mechanical and flat it would all be he replied with a commonplace and after a few moments they continued their stroll when he turned in however he reproached himself more forcibly than he had done yet and his vacillation was by no means at an end he was at war not with his judgment but with his instinct and it was the perception of this fact that always increased his perturbation they landed the following day and after being introduced to mr van buren in the custom house heriot drove to an hotel the hotel he found excellent new york he found wonderful but a city different from what he had expected he had vaguely pictured new york as a paris where everybody talked english this was before the introduction of the automobile had changed the face of paris and the face of the parisian before it incidentally reduced the number of half fed horses barbarously used in that city which is the negro's paradise and the horse's hell and the boulevard was even more unlike broadway then than now broadway broad in name only till it spread into the brightness of union square suggested london more than paris london in an unprecedented burst of energy the tireless vigour of the throng the ubiquitous rush of the elevated railway confused him though he paid homage to the cuisine of america which proved as much as much superior to that of england as the worst transatlantic train was to our best of that period he told himself that he was disappointed the truth was that not wishing to take the van burens' invitations too literally and having no other acquaintances here he was dull american hospitality however is the most charming in the world and he spent several very agreeable hours inside the big brownstone house nothing could have exceeded the geniality of van buren's manner nor was this due solely to the position of his visitor and a hope of their becoming connected the average american business man will show more kindness to a stranger who intrudes into his office than most englishmen display to one who comes to them with a letter of introduction from a friend and van buren's welcome was as sincere as it was attractive heriot stayed in new york a week and then fulfilled his desire to visit niagara on his return he called in fifth avenue again he was already beginning to refer to his homeward voyage and he was still undetermined whether he would propose to miss pierways or not the days slipped by without his arriving at a conclusion and then one morning he told himself he had gone too far to retreat now that the step which was doubtless the most judicious he could take should be made without delay he called at the house the same afternoon for on the next day but one the etruria sailed and he found the ladies at home he sat down wondering if he would be left alone with miss pierways and take his departure engaged to her but for half an hour there seemed no likelihood of a tete a tete presently there were more callers and they were shown into another room mrs van buren begged him to excuse her he rose to leave but was pressed to remain i want to talk to you when they've gone she said i haven't half exhausted my list of messages to london heriot resumed his seat and miss pierways smiled poor mamma wishes she were going herself if she told the truth now that we're here it is i who like new york not she we're creatures of custom he said your mother has lived in london too long to accustom herself to america very easily of course you'll be over next season oh yes shall you ever come to america again sir george i i hardly know he answered i certainly hope to oh then you will you're your own master is anybody his own master to the extent of travelling to america many people i should think he remembered with sudden gratification that he had never said a word to her that might not have been spoken before a crowd of listeners what was there to prevent him withholding the proposal if he liked i've no doubt i shall come he said abstractedly she looked slightly downcast it was not the reply that she had hoped to hear i shall always owe a debt of gratitude to you and to mr and mrs van buren for making my visit so pleasant to me he found himself saying next my trip has been a delightful experience she murmured a conventional response but chagrin began to creep about her heart heriot diverged into allusions which advanced the position not at all they spoke of new york of england of the voyage she perfunctorily and he with ever increasing relief and now he felt that he had been on the verge of the precipice for the last time he had escaped and by the intensity of his gratitude he realised how ill judged had been his action in playing around it when mrs van buren reappeared followed by her husband her daughter's face told her that the climax had not been reached and bold in thanksgiving heriot excused himself when he was asked to dine with them that evening had he been offered the alternative of the next evening he could not without rudeness have found a pretext for refusing but on the morrow as luck would have it the van burens were dining out the footman opened the big door and heriot descended the steps with a sensation that was foreign to him and not wholly agreeable he knew that he did not want to marry miss pierways and that he had behaved like a fool in trying to acquire the desire but he was a little ashamed of himself his conduct had not been irreproachable and he was conscious that when the steamer sailed and the chapter was closed for good and all he would be glad to have done with it he had blundered badly nevertheless he would have blundered worse and been a still greater fool if the affair had terminated in an engagement of course his brother would say distasteful things when they met and lady heriot would convey her extreme disapproval of him without saying anything that he must put up with of two evils he had at any rate chosen the lesser he repeated the assurance with still more conviction on saturday morning during the quarter of an hour in which the cab rattled him to the boat the experience had been a lesson to him and he was resolved that henceforward he would dismiss the idea of marriage from his mind he saw his portmanteau deposited in his cabin and he returned to the deck as the steamer began to move the decks were in the confusion that obtains at first passengers still hung at the taffrail taking a farewell gaze at friends on the landing stage the chairs were huddled in a heap and stewards bustled among stacks of luggage importuned at every second step with instructions and inquiries the deep pulsations sounded more regular the long line of sheds receded and the figures of the friends were as little dark toys waving specks of white even the most constant among the departing began to turn away now the hastening stewards were importuned more frequently than before everybody was in a hurry and all the women in the crowd that flocked below seemed to be uttering the words baggage and state room at the same time a few men were temporarily in possession of the deck striding to and fro behind pipes or cigars the regulation as to no smoking abaft this was not in force yet or was at least disobeyed at present heriot sauntered along the length of deck until it began to fill again the pile of chairs received attention they were set out in a row under the awning the deck took a dryness and a whiteness and a few passengers sat down and questioned inwardly if they would find one another companionable he bent his steps to the smoking room but it was empty and uninviting thus early and he forsook it after a few minutes as the door slammed behind him he came face to face with the woman who had been his wife chapter xiii she approached their gaze met he had bowed and passed her perhaps it had lasted a second the mental convulsion in which he looked in her eyes he did not know he found a seat and sank into it staring at the sky and sea acutely conscious of nothing but her nearness he could not tell whether it was despair or rejoicing that beat in him he knew nothing but that the world had swayed that life was in an instant palpitating and vivid that he had seen her then he knew that in the intensity of emotion that shook him body and brain there was a thrill of joy inexplicable but insistent but when he rose at last he dreaded that he might see her again he did not see her till the evening when he drew back at the door of the saloon as she came out his features were imperturbable now and betrayed nothing though her own before her head drooped were piteous in appeal he noted that she looked pale and ill and that she wore a black dress with crape on it he wondered whether she had lost her father or her aunt next morning he understood that it was her father for he saw her sitting beside mrs baines so dick cheriton was dead he had once been fond of dick cheriton the stranger in the black frock had once slept in his arms and borne his name the sadness of a lifetime weighed on his soul he perceived that she shunned him by every means in her power but they were bound to meet and then across her face would flash the same look that he had seen at the foot of the companion way its supplication and abasement wrung him horrible as the continual meetings grew in the reading room on deck or below their lines crossed a dozen times between breakfast and eleven o'clock at night it became as torturous to heriot as to her he felt as if he had struck her as he saw her whiten and shrink as he passed her by soon he hated himself for being here to cause her this intolerable pain it was on the evening of the third day that her endurance broke down and she made her petition with a pang he recognised the voice of her messenger before he turned mrs baines you're surprised i should address you mr heriot she said i shouldn't have but she wants me to beg you to speak to her if it's only for five minutes she implores you humbly to let her speak to you she made me ask you i couldn't say 'no' his pulses throbbed madly and momentarily he couldn't reply what purpose would it serve he said in tones he struggled to make firm she can't bear it mr heriot sir heriot i should say i was forgetting i'm sure i beg your pardon she 'implores you humbly to let her speak to you' i was to use those words won't you consent she is ill she's dying dying whispered heriot by a physical effort she nodded slowly the doctor has told her she won't be here long poor girl but whether she's to be pitied for it or not it's hard to say i don't think she'll be sorry to go my brother is gone sir heriot his answer was inarticulate we got there just at the end if we had been too late she she has been ailing a long while but we didn't know it was so serious when she saw you it was awful for her i oh what am i to tell her she's waiting now where said heriot hoarsely will you come with me show me he said show me where she is he still heard the knell of it dying he heard it as the lonely figure in the darkness rose thank you i am grateful the familiar voice knocked at his heart mrs baines has told me you are ill i am grieved to learn how ill you are it doesn't matter it was good of you to come i thought you would i i have prayed to speak to you again it wasn't much to ask he said i am human he could see that she trembled painfully he indicated the chair that she had left and drew one closer for himself then for a minute there was silence do you hate me she said he shook his head should i have come to tell you so but you can never forgive me why distress yourself if for a moment i hesitated to come it was because i knew it would be distressing for you perhaps a refusal would have been kinder after all no no i was sure you wouldn't refuse she doubted but i was sure i said you'd come when you heard about me is it so serious what is it tell me i know nothing it's my lungs they were never very strong you remember the doctor told me in duluth 'perhaps a year' if i am 'very careful' i'm not very careful it'll soon be all over don't look like that why should you care i don't care i don't want to live a bit only do you think if if there's anything afterwards that a woman who's gone wrong like me will be punished for god's sake he said don't talk so but do you it makes one think of these things when one knows one has only a very little time to live you can't forgive me you said so i do he said i forgive you freely if i could undo your wretchedness by giving my life for you i'd give it you don't know how i loved you what it meant to me to find you gone ah mamie how could you do it the tears stood in her eyes as she lifted her white face to him i'm ashamed she moaned what can i say why said heriot at the end of a tense pause why did you care for him so much if he had lived and married you would you be happy happy she echoed with something between a laugh and a sob tell me i hoped you'd be happy that's true i never wanted you to suffer for what you'd done i suffered enough for both i don't think i should have married him i don't know i don't think so i knew i'd made a mistake before oh in the first month if you haven't hated me i have hated myself and since you've been with her ever since my poor father wanted me to go home i wish i had you know i've lost him she told you that he wanted me to go home but i couldn't where everybody knew you understand and then she moved to balham and we never left it till two months ago when the cable came we were in time to see him die my poor father he touched her hand and her fingers closed on it you oughtn't to be up here at night he said huskily looking at her with blinded eyes didn't the man tell you that the night air was bad and that flimsy wrap it's no use so draw it across your mouth what's the difference there then shall you will you speak to me again after this evening or is this the last talk we shall have i had so much to say to you but i don't seem able to find it now you're here if you believe that i ask your pardon on my knees i suppose after all that that's everything if ever a man deserved a good wife it was you i realise it more clearly than i did while we were together though i think i knew it then you never married again no he answered no i haven't married but you will perhaps why haven't you i'm too old and i cared too much for you the tears were running down her face now she loosed his hand to wipe them away don't say i've ruined your life she pleaded don't say that my own yes my own it served me right but i've tried so hard to believe that you had got over it when i read of your election and then that you were made solicitor general i was glad ever so glad i thought 'he's successful he has his career' i've always wanted to believe that your work was enough that you had forgotten it wasn't so no it wasn't so i did my best to forget you but i couldn't aunt lydia said you weren't cut up at all when she saw you you deceived her very well 'a worthless woman' you called me i 'wasn't any loss' it was quite true but i knew you couldn't feel like that not so soon 'worthless' i've heard it every day since she told me i meant to do my duty when i married you george if i could have foreseen she broke off coughing if i could have foreseen what the end would be i'd have killed myself rather than become your wife i was always grateful to you you were always good to me and i only brought you shame not 'only' he said you gave me happiness first mamie the greatest happiness i've known i loved you and you came to me you never understood how much i did love you i think that was the trouble 'there's a word that says it all i worship you' do you remember saying that you said it in the train when you first proposed to me i refused you then why did i ever give way how different everything would be now you 'worshipped' me and i her voice trailed off and once more only the pounding of the engine broke the stillness on the deck the ocean swelled darkly under a starless sky and he sat beside her staring into space in the steerage someone played robin adair on a fiddle a drizzle began to fall to blow in upon them heriot became conscious of it with a start you must go below he said it's raining she rose obediently shivering a little and drawing the white scarf more closely about her neck good night she said standing there with wide eyes he put out his hand and her clasp ran through his blood again good night he repeated gently sleep well was it real was he awake he looked after her as she turned away looked long after she had disappeared the fiddle in the steerage was still scraping robin adair the black stretch of deck was desolate a violent impulse seized him to overtake her to snatch her back to hold her in his arms for once with words and caresses of consolation dying he wondered if davos algiers the cape anything and everything procurable by money could prolong her life then he remembered that she did not wish to live but that was horrible she should consult a specialist in town and follow his advice he would make her promise it with the gradual defervescence of his mood he wondered if she was properly provided for and he resolved to question mrs baines on the point he would elicit the information the following day and something could be arranged if necessary if not with mamie's knowledge then without it the morning was bright and mamie was in her chair when he came up from the saloon after breakfast as he approached she watched him expectantly and it was impossible to pass without a greeting it was impossible when the greeting had been exchanged not to remain with her for a few minutes how are you feeling he asked any better i never feel very bad i'm just the same to day as yesterday thank you the thank you was something more than a formula and he felt it it hurt him to hear the gratitude in her tone natural as it might be i want you to go to a good physician when you arrive he said say to drummond and to do just as he tells you you must do that it is a duty you owe to yourself she shrugged her shoulders what for that i may last two years perhaps instead of one it is kind of you to care but i'm quite satisfied as things are don't bother about me you will have to go he insisted before we land i shall speak to your aunt about it he had paused by her seat with the intention of resuming his saunter as soon as civility permitted but her presence was subversive of the intention he sat down beside her as he had done the previous evening but now it was inevitable that they should speak of other subjects than infidelity and death the sky was blue and the white deck glistened in the sunshine the sea before them tumbled cheerfully and to right and left were groups of passengers laughing flirting doing fancy work or reading novels you haven't told me how it was you came to the states she said presently were you in new york all the time heriot did not answer and she waited with surprise i'll tell you if you wish he said hastily i came out half meaning to marry oh she said as if he had struck her i thought i might be happier married the lady and her mother were going to new york and i travelled with them i i was mistaken in myself they were not looking at each other any longer and her voice trembled a little as she replied you weren't fond enough of her no he said i shall never marry again i told you so last night after a long pause she said was she pretty prettier than i used to be she was handsome i think not like you at all why talk about it i'm glad i came though or i shouldn't have seen you i shall always be glad to have seen you again remember that after we part for me at least it will never be so bitter since we've met and i've heard you say you're sorry god bless you she murmured almost inaudibly he left her after half an hour but drifted towards her again in the afternoon insensibly they lost by degrees much of their constraint in talking together she told him of her father's illness of her own life in balham heriot gave her some details of his appointment explaining that it was the duty of an attorney general and solicitor general to reply to questions of law in the house to advise the government and conduct its cases and the rest of it by wednesday night it was difficult to him to realise that their first interview had occurred only forty eight hours ago it had become his habit on deck to turn his steps towards her to sip tea by her side in the saloon to saunter with her after dinner in the starlight even at last he felt no embarrassment as he moved towards her even at last she came to smile up at him as he drew near moments there could not fail to be when such a state of things seemed marvellous and unnatural when conversation ceased and they paused oppressed and tongue tied by a consciousness of the anomaly of their relations nevertheless such moments were but hitches in an intercourse which grew daily more indispensable to them both how indispensable it had become to herself the woman perceived as the end of the voyage approached and now she would have asked no better than for them to sail on until she died when she undressed at night she sighed another day over when she woke in the morning eagerness quickened her pulses on saturday they would arrive and when friday dawned the reunion held less of strangeness than the reflection that she and heriot would separate again directly to think that as a matter of course they would say good bye to each other and resume their opposite sides of an impassable gulf looked more unnatural to her than the renewed familiarity their pauses were longer than usual on friday evening both were remembering that it was the last heriot had ascertained that cheriton had been able to leave her but little and the notion of providing her with the means to winter in some favourable climate was hot in his mind it is understood he said abruptly that you go to drummond and do exactly as he orders you'll not be so mad as to refuse at the last moment all right she answered apathetically i'll go shall i will you care to hear what he says your aunt has promised to write to me by the way there's something i want to say to night if what he advises is expensive you must let me make it possible for you i claim that as my right i intended arranging it with mrs baines but she tells me you you'd be bound to know where the money came from he'll probably tell you to live abroad thank you she said after a slight start i could not take your money it is very good of you but i would rather you didn't speak of it if you talked forever i wouldn't consent mamie the very offer turns me cold please don't you're cruel he said you're refusing to let me prolong your life have i deserved that from you oh she cried in a tortured voice for god's sake don't press me leave me something i won't say 'self respect' but a vestige a grain of proper pride think what my feelings would be living on money from you it wouldn't prolong my life george it would kill me sooner you've been generous and merciful to me be merciful to me still and talk of something else you are asking me to stand by and see you die i have feelings too mamie i can't do it i'm dying she said if it happens a little sooner or a little later does it matter very much if you want to be very kind to me to to brighten the time that remains as much as you can tell me that if i send to you when when it's a question of days you'll come to the place and see me again i'd bless you for that i've been afraid to ask you till now but it would mean more to me than anything else you could do would you if i sent why said heriot labouredly after another pause why would it mean so much they were leaning over the taffrail and suddenly her head was bent and she broke into convulsive sobs that tore his breast mamie he exclaimed mamie tell me he glanced round and laid a trembling touch on her hands tell me dear he repeated hoarsely do you love me then her figure was shaken by the shuddering sobs his touch tightened to a clasp he drew the hands down from the distorted face drew the shaken figure closer till his own met it till her bosom was heaving against his heart do you love me mamie yes she gasped and then for an instant only their eyes spoke and in the intensity of their eyes each gave to the other body and soul yes i love you she panted it's my punishment i suppose to love you too late i shall never see you after to morrow till i am dying if then but i love you remember it it's no good to you you won't care but remember it because it's my punishment you can say 'when it was too late she knew she died detesting herself shrinking at her own body her own loathsome body that she gave to another man' oh she beat her hands hysterically against his chest i hate him i hate him god forgive me he's in his grave but i hate him when i think what's been and it wasn't his fault it was mine mine my own degraded beastly self curse me throw me from you i'm not fit to be standing here i'm lower than the lowest woman in the streets the violence of her emotion maddened him he knew that he loved her the truth was stripped of the disguise in which he had sought for years to wrap it he knew that he had never ceased to love her and a temptation to make her his wife again to cherish and possess her so long as life should linger in her veins flooded his reason their gaze grew wider deeper still he could feel her quivering from head to foot another moment and he would have offered his honour to her keeping afresh some men left the smoking room there was the sharp interruption of laughter the slam of the door they both regained some semblance of self possession as they moved apart i must go down she said and he did not beg her to remain it was their real farewell for on the morrow they could merely exchange a few words amid the bustle of arrival liverpool was reached early in the morning and when he saw her she wore a hat and veil and was already prepared to go ashore in the glare of the sunshine the veil could not conceal that her eyes were red with weeping however and he divined that she had passed a sleepless night to mrs baines he privately repeated his injunctions with regard to the physician for he was determined to have his way and the widow assured him that she would write to morson drummond for an appointment without loss of time the delays and shouts came to an end while he was speaking to her and the gangway was lowered and mamie moved forward to her side he saw them again in the custom house but for a minute only and from a distance evidently they got through without trouble for when he looked across again they had gone as he saw that they had gone a sensation of blankness fell upon heriot's mood where he stood waiting among the scattered luggage his life felt newly empty and the day all at once seemed cold and dark chapter xiv the truth was stripped of the disguise in which he had sought to wrap it he knew that he had never ceased to love her as he had known it while she sobbed beside him on the boat so he knew it when the bar claimed him again and he wrestled with temptation amid his work he might re marry her he could not drive this irruptive idea from his mind it lurked there impelled attention dozed woke and throbbed in his consciousness persistently were he but weak enough to make the choice the woman that he loved might belong to him once more were he but weak enough there were minutes in which he was very near to it minutes in which the dishonour if dishonour it were looked as nothing to him compared with the joy of having her for his wife again yet were he but weak enough would it indeed be weakness would it not rather be strength the courage of his convictions the longing illumined his vision and he asked himself on what his doubt and hesitation was based she had sinned but he had pardoned her sin not merely in words but in his heart and she was very dear to him and she had repented then why should it be impossible what after all had they done to her what change in the beloved identity had they wrought those months that were past he was aware that it was the physical side that repelled him there had been another man yet if she had been a widow when he met her first there would have been another man and it would have mattered nothing did this especial sin make of a woman somebody else did it give her another face another form another brain did unfaithfulness transform her personality the only difference was the knowledge of what had happened the woman herself was the same but he would not vindicate his right to love her he loved her that was enough in its simplicity the question was whether he would do better to condone her guilt and know happiness or to preserve his dignity and suffer he could not blink the question it confronted him nakedly when a week had worn by without her he was lonely and wretched with her while she lived he was confident that his joy would be supreme the step that he considered was if any one pleased revolting but if it led to his contentment perhaps to be revolting might be the height of wisdom he must sacrifice his pride or his peace and at last quite deliberately without misgiving or a backward glance heriot determined to gain peace a few days after the arrival mrs baines had written to inform him that the physician was out of town but now a line came to say that an appointment had been made for monday and that she would communicate dr drummond's pronouncement immediately they reached home after the interview it was on monday morning that heriot received the note and he resolved to go to mamie the same evening the thought of the amazement that his appearance would cause her excited him wildly as he drove to victoria he could foresee the wonder in her eyes as he entered the incredulity on her features as she heard what he was there to say and the profoundest satisfaction pervaded him that he had resolved to say it the comments that his world would make had no longer any place in his meditations a fico for the world that would debar him from delight and censure what it could not understand he had suffered long enough his only regret was for the years which had been lost before he grasped the vivid truth that innocent or guilty the woman who conferred happiness was the woman to be desired a criticism of his brother's recurred to him you hadn't a single taste in common he had not disputed it at the time he was not certain that he could deny it now but there was no need to consider whether their views were kindred or opposed whether she was defiled or stainless when she was the woman whose magic could transfigure his existence he was conscious that this marriage to be approved by his judgment and condemned by society would be a sweeter and holier union than their first to which she had brought purity and indifference as the cab sped down victoria street his excitement increased and in imagination he already clasped her and felt the warmth of her cheek against his face the hansom slackened jerked to a standstill and he leapt out and hurried to the booking office a train was at the point of starting the sentiment of the bygone was quick in him as he found that he must pass through a yellow barrier on to the same platform to which he used to hasten when he went to see her in lavender street wandsworth he had never trodden it since a thousand associations sad but delicious were revived as he took his seat and the guard whose countenance seemed familiar sauntered with a green flag and a lantern past the window victoria slipped back it had been in one of these compartments perhaps in this one that he had first asked her to be his wife how wet her cape had been when he touched it a porter sang out grosvenor road and at the sound of it heriot marvelled at having forgotten that they were about to stop there yes grosvenor road and then what next he could not remember but memory knocked with a louder pang as each of the places on the line was reached when wandsworth common was cried he glanced at the dimly lighted station while in fancy he threaded his way to the shabby villa that had been her home he thought that he could find it blindfold after this the line was quite strange to him and now the impatience of his mood had no admixture and he trembled with eagerness to gain his destination balham was bawled two minutes later and among a stream of clerks and nondescripts he descended a flight of steps and emerged into a narrow street no cab was visible and having obtained directions he set forth for rosalie road afoot a glimpse he had of cheap commerce of the flare of gas jets on oranges and eggs and fifth rate millinery and then the shops and the masses were left behind and he was in obscurity the sound of footsteps occurred but seldom here and he wandered in a maze of little houses for nearly half an hour before a welcome postman earned a shilling rosalie road began in darkness and ended in a brickfield he identified number by the aid of a vesta and pulled the bell impatience was mastering him when he discerned through the panes a figure advancing along the passage his voice was strange in his ears as he inquired if mamie was in yessir she's in the drorin' room 'oo shall i say sir george heriot is mrs baines at home his title rendered the little maid incapable of an immediate response missis is out of a herrand sir she stammered she won't be long when she comes in tell her that i'm talking privately to her niece 'privately' don't forget she turned the handle and heriot followed her into the room vaguely he heard her announce him he saw the room as in a mist momentarily all that was clear was mamie's face white and wondering in the lamplight she stood where she had been standing at his entrance looking at him he had the impression of many seconds passing while she only looked many seconds seemed to go by before her colour fluttered back and she said you yes it's i won't you say you're glad to see me aunt lydia has written to you she said still gazing at him as if she doubted his reality her letter has gone i've come to hear what dr drummond says she motioned him to a chair and drooped weakly on to the shiny couch i am not going to die she muttered your sympathy has been thrown away i'm a fraud in the breathless pause he felt deafened by the thudding of his heart he has given you hope he said 'bosh' i told him what the doctor told me in duluth he said 'bosh' one lung isn't quite sound that's all i may live to be eighty o dear god said heriot slowly i thank you she gave a short laugh harsh and bitter i always posed my last pose was as a dying woman mamie he said firmly he went across to her and sat down by her side mamie i love you i want you to come back to me my darling my life's no good without you and i want you for my wife again will you come he heard her catch her breath she could not speak he took her hands and drew her to him their lips clung together and presently he felt tears on his cheek then she released herself with a gesture of negation you are mad she said and i should be madder to accept the sacrifice for this he was prepared i am very sane he answered dearest when you understand you will see that it is the only reparation you can make me listen
