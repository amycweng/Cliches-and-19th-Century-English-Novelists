jeunes filles and her father had been professeur de violon at the little conservatoire music was her destiny as a holloweyed stunted child who should have been romping in the unfrequented park she had been doomed to hours of piano practice in the stuffy salon where during eight months of the year a window was never opened for longer than it took to shake out the rug her name was marie lamande she had accepted her fate passively if it had not been scales and exercises that made a prisoner of her she recognised that it would have been fractions or zoology in france schools actually educate but few children have a childhood on the first day of a term when the wan girls reassemble they sometimes ask one anothercurious to hear what novelty the holidays may have yielded amid the home workdid you have a little promenade during the vacances because its lycee was widely known english and american families came to stay in chauvillethe english pupils discovering what it was to be taught with enthusiasmand marie knew french girls who had been initiated into the pleasures of teaparties openmouthed she heard that the extravagant anglaise or americaine must have spent at least five or six francs on the cakes but all the foreigners successively grew tired of inviting french children whose astonished mothers sent them trooping as often as they were asked and in no case gave an invitation in return and marie herself never had the good luck to be asked like her parents she had been intended for the groove of tuition and in due course tuition became her lot but she was a gifted pianist and ambitious she dreamed of glory some years after she had been left alone when her age was twentyseven she dared to escape from the melancholy town that she had grown to execrate a slight little woman without influence or knowledge of life she aspired to conquer paris she attacked it with a sum sufficient to keep her for twelve months her arrival at once frightened and enraptured her in chauville at eight oclock in the evening a few of the shopkeepers had sat before their doorways in the dark a while at nine their crude streets were as vacant as the boulevards of the professional and independent classes whose covert homes signified even in the daytime visitors will be prosecuted behind the shutters of long avenues were over sixty thousand personsmost of them heroically hardworkingof a race that the pleasureseeking english called frivolous content with no semblance of entertainment but the illpatronised performances provided by a gloomy theatre which was unbarred on only two days in the week paris spirited and sparkling in the tourist regions took her breath away music called to her imperiously she sat squeezed among crowds at the recitals of celebrities and came out prayerful to wonder will crowds ever applaud me but after the first few days she reduced her expenses and her allowance for concertgoing was strict she found a lodging now in the rue honorechevalier and sought engagements for soirees dart and matinees artistiques writing to many people who made no reply and crossing the bridge to appeal in person to many others who were inaccessible or rude among the few letters of introduction that she had brought from chauville one served its purpose madame herbelin the directrice of the lycee always kindly disposed towards her had recommended her to an acquaintance as a teacher thanks to this she earned five francs each thursday by a lesson when nine alarming weeks had slipped away she gained an interview with a fat man who had much knowledge and who was interested in hearing himself talk he said to her mademoiselle it is a question of finances to rise in the musical world you must give concerts and to give concerts you must have money also you must have the goodwill of pupils in a position to collect an audience for you otherwise your concerts will be a heavier loss still further you must have the usual paragraphs and critiques triumph triumph what genius is possessed by this divine artist whose enchanting gifts revolutionise paris mademoiselle lamande is without question the virtuosa the most spirituelle the most troublante of our epoch these things do not cost a great deal in the paris newspapers but naturally they have to be paid for she told him i am a poor woman and the only pupil that i have here is a child in montparnasse the fat man groaning comically volunteered to see what he could do he forgot her after five minutes practising in the feeble lamplight of the attic she used to wait through the long evenings for the postman and news that never came for me she would call over the banisters nothing mademoiselle then back to the hired pleyel that barely left space for her to wash inexorable technique cascades of brilliance while her heart was breaking after she shut the piano the dim light looked dimmer the narrow street was silent only in the distance sometimes was the jogtrot of a cabhorse and the minor jangle of its bell her siege of paris made no progress companionship came to her when ten months had gone a young widow drifted to the house and now and then on the stairs they met one day they found themselves seated at the same table in a little cremerie close by and over their oeufssurleplat they talked as they walked home together the widow said i always leave my door open to hear you play the answer was wont you come into my room instead madame branthonne was a gentlewoman employed in the bernstein school of languages she was so freehanded with her sous so generous in the matter of brioche and chocolate that marie thought she must be comparatively rich but madame branthonne was not rich and when marie knew her well it transpired that she remitted every month out of her slender salary for the maintenance of a baby son in amiens how you must miss him how old is he only eleven weeks miss him mon dieu but i had to leave him or we should both have starved if i had brought him with me who would have looked after him all day while i was out besides in this work there is no telling how long one may remain in any cityi might be packed off to some other branch of the concern tomorrow really oh yes one never knows last week one of oar professors was sent at a days notice to russia what a life of course one need not consent to go but it is never prudent to refuse you used to make me cry in there for my baby when you played the piano the poor little soul is called paul after his father he is with a person who used to be my servant she is married now and has a little business a dairy i know she is good to him but imagine how i sufferin less than a year i have lost my husband and my child alors vrai what an egotist i am how go your own affairs still no luck in the garden of the luxembourg on sundays the two lonely women sauntered under the chestnuttrees and talked of their sorrows and their hopes the hopes of the widow were centred upon the lotteries de bienfaisance which had lured a louis from her time and again she was emerging from a period of enforced discretion and she asked what do you say to our buying a ticket between us the present lottery had neared its end only one drawing remained and the price of tickets was accordingly much reduced the friends bought their microscopic chance for five francs each the prizes that were dangled varied between a mite and a fortune and now in the murky lamplight of the garret the pianist saw visions rebuffed intimidated she had suddenly a prospect chimerical as the prospect was she might gain the means to buy a hearing for her art for the woman seeking recognition opportunity for the woman divided from her child a home every night they spoke of it often while the lamp burnt low and a horsebell jangled sadly they laughed together in a castleintheair but those brats from the assistance publique who blindly dispensed destinies at the drawing dipped their red hands upon the wrong numbers as usual i am sorry i proposed it to you it is an imbecility to waste ones earnings in such a fashionone might as well toss money in the seine well i have had enough i have finished i am determined never to gamble any more cried madame branthonne who had made the same resolve a dozen times marie said less but her disappointment was black it was only now that she knew how vivid had been her hope and in the meanwhile her little hoard had dwindled terribly and she was seeking other pupils what if you get themyou will be no nearer to renown in chauville you have a living waiting for youwhy wear out shoeleather to find bread in paris poverty in paris is no sweeter than poverty elsewhere if i go back to chauville it means the end she answered i shall never have anything to look forward to therenever to the day of my death year after year i shall sit teaching exercises and little pieces to schoolgirls who will never play the girls will escape and marry but i shall sit teaching the same exercises and little pieces to their children here if i can hold out if only i can hold out long enough i may batter my way up i want to get onive a right to get on you dont suppose that no one has ever made a career who couldnt pay for it no sighed her confidante i dont suppose its so bad as thatmen do help one sometimes but in her heart she felt you arent the kind of woman that men do things for and to a stranger even pupils at five francs an hour proved hard to find a pianist of talentand she couldnt earn a living in paris even by elementary lessons it was one of those cases which the uninitiated call improbable and which are happening all the time yet it fell to madame branthonne to quit paris first when marie lamande could no longer sleep at night or slept only to see the desolation of chauville in her dreams the teacher of french was required to go to one of the london branches of the school it occurred abruptly the news and the goodbye were almost simultaneous a new proclamation of millions to be won aggrandised par arrete ministeriel was blazoned across the pages of the newspapers and on impulse the woman who was determined never to gamble any more left a louis with the other to buy a ticket for her you know you cant spare it urged marie i wouldnt if i were you momentarily the widow hesitated and then she gave a shrug oh of course im an idiot she exclaimed but what else have i got to hope for yes get it and send it to me early in the journey she vacillated again but her instructions were not revoked because soon afterwards no more than a third of the train remained on the rails and madame branthonne was among the victims killed her aghast friend heard of the catastrophe twelve hours later than multitudes for whom it had no personal interest dazed she wondered whether the exservant in amiens would see the name of branthonne in the list of the dead and what would become of the baby now she had a confused notion that she ought to communicate with the woman but she was ignorant of the address she went hysterically to the head office of the school where the manager undertook to make inquiries at the amiens branch when the sickness of horror passed her thoughts reverted to the ticket that she had been enjoined to buy and on the way to fulfil the duty it was as if the dead woman as she had seen her last with her hat and coat on were close to her again what name inquired the clerk in the big bank lamande she answeredand asked herself afterwards if it would have been more businesslike to say branthonne but it didnt seem to matter the point that perplexed her was in whose charge ought the ticket to be it belonged to the baby now and its possibilities extended through the year serie no billet no ought she to post it confidingly to the dairykeeper when she learnt where she lived the question persisted as she tramped the streets despondentlyas daily she drew nearer to defeat she had discontinued to hire a piano everywhere she was humbled with the same reply banished with the same gestures maddened by the same callous unconcern paris was brutal she dropped in her purse the last louis that protracted hope when this was gone there would be left nothing but the price of her journey to chauville and despair in the first drawing of the lottery a few days later the ticket won a prize of twelve thousand francs in a crumpled copy of le petit journal in the cremerie she read of the drawing by chancenot having remembered for what date it was announced and she took a copy of the paper home with herhaving forgotten the number of the ticket that she had bought and when the revelation came to her there was blent with her thanksgiving for the childs sake the human bitter consciousness that had she rashly suggested it half the chance might have been hers she might have stood here tonight on the threshold of success so simple it would have been the knowledge was a taunt she felt that fate had robbed and derided her she felt poor as she had never felt poor before the thought floated across her mind impersonally it brought no shock because it did not present itself as a temptation even the faintest it was just as if she had been recognising what somebody in a tale might do without purpose without questioning why the thought fascinated her she sat seeing how easily she could steal the money the ticket was on the table there was nothing to show that she hadnt any right to itshe had merely to claim the prize there would be a fortnights delay at least before she got it well she could eke out the sum that was put by for her fare she imagined her sensations on the morning that she walked from the bank with notes for twelve thousand francs in her pocket if her pocket were picked yielding even more intently to the thought she perceived that the proper course would be to open an account before she left it wouldnt be twelve thousand francsa substantial sum would be deducted for les droits des pauvres but it would be enoughthe price of power the thought leapt further she saw herself gorgeously gowned on a platformheard the very piece that she was playing the plaudits that came thundering she trembled in the emotion of a visionary fame recalling her there sounded in the dark emptiness again the minor jangle of a cabhorse bell then she understood it had been no idle supposition the thought that mastered her o divine vierge marie she wailed on her knees and knew that she wanted to be a thief through the night through the morrow through every waking moment a voice was saying to her you wont be robbing a child you can do for it all that she didevery month just the same thing long before the child is old enough to need so large a sum you will be in a position to give it to him what will he have lost nothing you are terrified by the semblance of a sin it is not a sin really dare it dare it be bold nothing could quell the voice it was whispering while she prayed and the crashing of orchestras could not drown it when she fled to music for relief she learnt that the woman in amiens was called gaillard and had a shop in the rue puteaux but now she shrank from writing to hershe didnt know how she meant to act once in desperation she did begin a letter an avowal of the prize that had been drawn but she hesitated again there was an evening when with steps that wavered like a woman enfeebled by illness she packed her things to return to chauville she sat wideeyed staring at the trunk when she had dragged the things frantically out she wrote to amiens making herself responsible for the monthly payments all that his mother did i will do she wrote feeling less criminal for the phrase and then one morning tortured she caught the express to the town to see that all was well the place was small and poor and though the baby looked well cared for and the young woman and her husband seemed kind the visit was horrible to her next day she spent some of the stolen money on a babys bonnet and pelisse and as the quality of the gift suggested means she received before the date for her second remittance a scrawl declaring that the cost of provisions had risen dreadfully and asking for twenty francs a month more recital donne par mademoiselle marie lamande a blueandwhite poster with her name staring paris in the face the time came when she saw one on a wall and stopped thrilling at it in the rain a week afterwards she saw one on a wall again and passed it with a sigh remembering the halfempty salle and the cheques that she had drawn patience mademoiselle patience an artist does not arrive in a day one must persevere there were plenty of persons to give her encouragement now that it might be advantageous to them but the expense of her debut was a warning and she proceeded slowly though they made her feel very shy and cowardly she did not succumb to the arguments of vehement people who offered opportunities the most exceptional at a big price and whose attitudes of amazement implied that she must be brainless to decline she did not waste money in bettering her abode she did not when she had given a recital again continue to imagine that the prize had provided a sum abundant for her purpose the knowledge obsessed her that she owed this money that one day she was to repay it for a year she told herself the road is harder than i thought but i shall reach the end of it in time during the second year she struggled in a panic while the money was melting melting without result to adventure a concert meant such wearisome such overwhelming preparation and within a week it was as if it had never beenshe was again forgotten but she saw a little chorusgirl who had done something more than ordinarily immodest launch herself into celebrity in a night at last when she realised that she had wrecked her peace of mind for nothing when to cross the bridge was to eye the river longingly she knew that she wasnt free to find oblivion like that restitution to the child would be impossible but it was her destiny to support him she wrote to madame herbelin in chauville appealing for influence to regain the footing that she had kicked away her bent face was wet and ugly as she detailed the story of her failure she foresaw the greetings tactful but galling of acquaintances the halfveiled satisfaction of other musicmistresses in the town the reply that reached her made it evident that to recover the position would be a slow process and her means to wait were limited hitherto the acknowledgments from amiens had varied but slightly the remittance had come the baby was well or the baby had had some infantile ailment and was better now a partially illegible letter informed her suddenly that the little business was to be given up circumstances compelled the woman to take a situation again and she could not keep the orphan in her care it was explained that mademoiselle should arrange to remove him in a months time already stricken she was stupefied by this news it seemed to her the last blow that could be dealt what was to be done she marvelled that she had not contemplated the contingency she had not contemplated itat most she had given it a passing glance she had questioned agonised whether she could manage to maintain the payments regularly she had asked herself what lay before her when the child was older and his needs increased she had wondered conscienceracked how she was to bear her life but for this new responsibility hurled on her when she was broken she had been unprepared remove him to what she wasnt remaining in paris was she blindly to answer some advertisement before she left and leave a baby behind her here helpless in hands that might misuse him she shuddered no now that he would be at the mercy of a stranger the place must be near enough for her to visit itoften and unexpectedly she must find a place near chauville but could she do it however secretly she arranged wasnt it sure to be known what was she to say it was a misfortune that she had written to madame herbelin too fully to be able to assert now that she had married what was she to say and who would credit what she said hourly the craven in her faltered that there were hundreds of honest homes in paris where he would be gently treated where he would be as safe as he had been in amiens and always her better self cried out but youd desert him without knowing that the home you had found was one of them for three weeks she cowered at the crossways she did not love the little child that she had wronged as she bore him back with her to chauville the journey was long and he clung to her whimpering and she caressed him whitefaced and abject but there was no love for him in her heart the dusk when they arrived was welcome she led him down the station steps her head sunk low in the street he cried to be carried and she picked him upsubmissive to her burden she had had to sacrifice her reputation or the childand mademoiselle lamande returned to her native town with a baby in her arms she had booked to the gare du marche the station in the poorest quarter a porter followed trundling the luggage over the cobbles in a narrow bed under a skylight the child and anxiety allowed her little sleep before she could begin her search for work it was imperative that she should find someone to shelter him if only during the day and in the morning she questioned a servant who was sweeping the stairs the girl looked as if she had been picked from a dustbin and clothed from a ragbag but compared with english girls of her class she had brilliant intelligence she thought it probable that the woman at the epicerie across the road might be accommodating the woman at the epicerie was unable to arrange but she suggested a concierge of her acquaintance la bas la bas proved to be remote chauville had not changed as of old the door of the eglise ste clothilde was lost in its vast frame of funeral black as of old the insistent bell was dinning for the dead the population was still concealed except where a cortege of priests and acolytes and mourners wound their slow way with another coffin to the cemetery chauvilles most animated spot as a makeshift the concierge sufficed to gain an interview with madame herbelin strained patience but after the applicant had sat for a long while with her feet on the sawdust of the salle dattente where an officer and a marquise drooped resignedly madame la directrice told her it is a sad pity that you left the town marie could not remember that the busy woman said anything more valuable there was however another occasion this time the lady said mademoiselle i knew you when you were a little girl and i knew your parents and i have regretted more than you may suppose that it was not in my power to offer you an appointment at the lycee in your emergency but i have recently heard something about you that is very gravesomething that i trust is not true madame said marie trembling i can guess what you have heard and it is not true only this is truei have placed a child with a concierge in the rue lecomte and go to see it there it is the orphan of a woman who was my friend in paris a widowwe lived together madame herbelin did not speak madame branthonne was killed in a railway accident going to england marie went on she was a teacher in the bernstein school her baby had been left in amiens with a woman called gaillard a few weeks ago the woman wrote to me that she was going away and was unable to keep the child any longer i couldnt abandon it to the assistance publique where is she now this madame gaillard inquired the directrice coldly i do not know said marie and then recognising the lameness of the reply she burst forth into a torrent of details to corroborate the story her voice more than the details carried conviction to the listener after a long pause she said mademoiselle i believe you have done a generous thing the thief winced but it was an imprudent thing a thing that you could not afford to do i do not speak of your intention to maintain the childmay le bon dieu aid you in the endeavour but you did wrong to bring it to chauville you should not expose yourself to calumny i counsel you most earnestly to place the child somewhere else without delay madame it is my duty to have him under my own eyes she urged apart from me he might be starved beaten corruptedmy friends boy might be reared as an apache how could i know i should risk it all it would be inhuman of me i think you overestimate the dangers sighed madame herbelin in fine if you put the boy away from you it is possible he may suffer but if you keep him near you it is certain you will suffer i cannot say more i must suffer answered marie a permanent home for him not far from the rue lecomte was found at a bonneterie whose humble little window contained communion caps and the announcement piqures a la machine to have had him in her lodging would have cost her less but this child that dishonoured her must be covert from the jeunes filles that she hoped would come there and if she had to give lessons out she could not leave him there alone she did have to give lessons out it was a descent for her here to go to the pupils houses but she was compelled to do it and something bitterershe was compelled to accept a lowered fee and affect to be unconscious why a reduction was proposed to obtain the services of a belle musicienne for a trifle there were a few mothers who engaged her and replied to questioning relatives that she was a slandered woman but to her they did not say that she was slandered and their hard eyes were an insult she gave a lesson twice a week for twenty francs a month now mademoiselle marie lamande who had advertised recitals in paris and she went short of food to meet the charges at the bonneterie the boy seemed to be amply nourished and the remembrance sustained her on the days when she was dinnerless god for a chance to get away to be free of this place where it was an ordeal to tread the streets when she could afford to buy a postage stamp she applied for salaried work in some distant school once it looked as if the child were not to live and as she sat obeying orders through one endless night she knew before she fainted from exhaustion that if he died her own escape from chauville would be made by the same road but he recoveredthanks partially to herand her duty still had to be done he recovered and as time passed began to talk like other children on the doorsteps she recalled the refinement of his mother and the little child in a black blouse shrilling kitchen french avenged himself unknowingly as often as we ever meet when the boy i robbed is a poor big common man she thought every note of his voice will be a chastisement before she accomplished her release she bore in chauvillelevieux a threeyears martyrdom madame herbelin had consented to testify to her abilities and she went far away to a school at ivrysthilaire she had pleaded that in the letter of recommendation she might be referred to as madame lamande but this entreaty the directrice would not grant mademoiselle she said i cannot do it for you and if you are wise there is no need remember what i told you when you returned and be guided by me this time do not repeat there the blunder that you made here leave the child where he is you have tested the person and you know she is honest occasionally once a year you can afford to come and see him if you take him with you you will not gain much by your removal of course at ivrysthilaire your parentage is unknown and there is nothing to hinder you from inventing a relationship but it isnt worth the troublebelieve me you would be suspected just the same make the most of this opportunity go unencumbereddo not live your whole life in shadow for the sake of an ideal but her conscience would not allow her to see him only once a year nor to leave him to play on the doorstep and attend the ecole communale in view of a constant salary she already foresaw herself alleviating his plight she was resigned to live her life in shadow that she might yield a little sunshine to him so when she had sacrificed herself again madame la directrice thought she is strangely devoted to the child i wonder if i was wrong to befriend herperhaps she is a bad woman after all she did not venture to take the boy with her however she was more than three months at ivry before her furtive arrangements for him were concluded then she placed him with priests twenty miles distant from her in the etablissement des freres eudoxie at maisonverte small as the annual charges were they were vast in relation to her salary till she succeeded by slow degrees in obtaining a few private pupils her selfdenial was severe but the little chap was in better hands now and the woman had procured a respite from disdain a tinge of colour crept back into her cheeks and she faced the world less fearfully by and by when she could afford the fare she went to the institution sometimes on a sunday and walked with him in the cour and noted that gradually his speech improved as she could afford the fare but seldom the intervals were long paul looked forward to her rare visits some of the boys had visitors more frequently than he pale women who came to walk beside them in the cour and the boastful shout of ma mere was often humiliating to paul he had been taught to call her mademoiselle but one sunday the child in a triumphant cry found his own name for her mademoiselle ma mere est venue after that he called her always mademoiselle ma mere and divining something of the little wistful heart mademoiselle did not reprove him at ivrysthilaire a thing strange and bewildering happened for the first time in her life a man sought her society for the first time in her life she was happier for talking to a man two moments were prodigious to hera moment after she had heard herself laughing merrily a moment when she realised why she had just plucked out a grey hair when they were alone together one day the man said to her now that i have made a practice in the town at last i am rooted hereand ivry isnt amusing if a woman were to marry me she would have to live here always i tell you this because i love you it was as if god had wrought another miracle i cant understand it she whispered truly then the man laughed and took her in his arms and it seemed to her that she had never known what it was to be tired when he let her go and she came back to the world her sin was staring at her and now the voice that decoyed her before was clamouring if you degrade yourself in his sight youll lose him her lover appeared to her no less a hero because under his imposing presence he was a cur and the thing that she feared would revolt him was her dishonesty not on that day nor on the next but after many resolutions to do right had melted into terrors she forced him to listen and it seemed to her that she was dying while she spoke i stole she moaned her face covered pauvrette he exclaimed tenderly when she dared to look he was smiling the relief and gratitude in her soul were so infinite that she wanted to kneel at his feet but when she sobbed out the story of her later struggles and told him how she was devoting her life to the child his brow grew dark that of course would have to be changed he said changed she stammered obviously best beloved one must consider public opinion these journeys to maisonverte are mad they must cease you have not been fair to yourself and now more than ever you need to reflect that but she broke in frightened you dont understand it is not a mere question of my going to maisonverte he will not be there alwayshe will grow up and his future will be my care my responsibility goes on oh i knowyou need not tell methat you have thoroughly the right to refuse butbut i have no right to alter since i have seen that i could never hope to give back what i took i have seen that he was my charge for life mon dieu he said you exaggerate quixotically to give back what you took remember what you have already done counted in francs she pleaded i have done very little it has been difficult to do thats all presently when he perceived that on this one point the little weak woman was inflexible the man made a beautiful speech declaring that she was worth more than the opinion of ivrysthilaire and of all france he said that nothing mattered to him but their divine love he looked more heroic still and his eyes were moist with the nobility of the sentiments that he was delivering but as he sat in the principal cafe of the town by and by among the stacks of swords in the corners and the elite of the military and civil circles clearing their throats vociferously on to the floor he knew that a few days hence he meant to deliver a second lie about the supplications of his family and his duty as a son had her debt been paid he would have held her absolved from yielding so much as another thought to the boy and he could have afforded to pay the debt but it did not even enter his mind to commit such a madness yet in his fashion he loved her the chivalry of offering marriage to a woman without a dot had proved it it would have been kinder to her not to leave her in a fools paradise she was to suffer more intensely because of that some of the facts sufficient to explain the position i have confided to my mother he told her she is very old and the honour of the family is very dear to her i entreat you in her name the boy shall remain in this institution or be placed in some other they will teach him a trade when the time comes for him to earn his living he will be no worse off than the other gosses there be guided by me i assure you you are morbidly sensitive there is no reason why you should ever meet him again my adored one our happiness is in your hands give the child up i cannot she repeated hopelessly and then all of a sudden the imposing presence vanished and she saw the puny manmore clearly than he had ever seen himself it begins to be plain why you cannot he hissed zut tell your yarn about your theft to somebody greener for me its too thin but why should we part ducky the matter could be arranged when he had demonstrated his intelligence in this way without advantage the man went down the garden path out of her lifeand for an hour she sat sightless and ageing years the birds in the garden were making a cruel noise she felt that she had grown too old during the afternoon to bear the shrillness of the birds when was it that she had had the arrogance to pull out a grey hair her lovestory was over but the drear routine continuedthe thrift the drudgery the clandestine journeys to the boy if when she saw him next he felt that she was colder to him she did not mean to be so never had she striven quite so wearily to be tender it was insensibly that she ceased to recall him as a burden had times touches been more swift she would have marvelled at the mystery of the thing but the weight of life was lifted very slowly and the burden bid fair to be consoling before she realised that the load was less as the months wore by and term succeeded term the boy evoked an interest in the loneliness duty no longer took her to himit was affection to amuse him now was not a tasktheir playtime had become her single pleasure from this child the woman who had had no childhood captured gleams of youththe virgin who was for ever celibate caught glimpses of maternity in the vacances paul ill come and stay at maisonverte she used to say and well have picnics in the park when the trimestre was over and she studied his report her smile was proud once when she went he rushed to meet her with a prize mademoiselle ma mere look look he halloed and the virgins arms were flung about him and she hugged him like a mother as a mother she marked his progress year by year as a mother mourning his barren prospects and craving to advance them she beat her breast that she had made him penniless it was as a mother that by parsimonies protracted and implacable she garnered the means at last to better his condition by this time her hair was all grey and the schoolboys voice was breaking on the day that she was strong enough she meant to confess to him and see his love turn to contempt but the day when she was strong enough wouldnt come when he was sixteen she had said i shall tell him in a year from now when he was seventeen she had wept god couldnt mind his loving me for a year more mademoiselle he would sayfor he was a young man and had dropped the other namei dont know why you have been so good to me and she would answer your mother and i were friends dearest only that you work too hard he would declare ever so much too hard youre always tired you know you werent ambitious enoughthat was your great mistake you shouldnt have gone in for teaching you ought to have played at concertsyou might have been no end of a swell play something to me now will you what used my mother to say about your playing she said once that it made her cry for her baby paul what do you think of when i play but he was shy of admitting what he thought of because he thought of noble deeds and his ideal woman and of the ecstasy it would be to see his name on the cover of a bookand he was doomed to be a clerk yet when the clerk chafed in his bonds and the conceit of authorship was too mighty to be bridled it was to her that he first revealed a manuscript it was she trembling who was his first critic your good women are all perfect she told him and your bad women have never a good impulse we arent like that but she was never too weary to talk about the tales and when they began to wander among august journals that refused them she used to pray before the crucifix in her bedroom that the hearts of editors might be moved now she meant to confess to him before he entered on his military service the parting was so bitter that she failed at the last moment he went far from her the years of his service were a much greater hardship to her than to him during the first week she stinted her own diet to send a bon de poste to ameliorate his food but he wouldnt keep the money in the avenues of ivry never did she see the pitifully garbed conscripts being drilled without picturing the conscript who was dear to her garbed like thatand closing her eyes with the pain and when he was free to return the meeting was so sweet that she was a coward once more he was a clerk for a long time but his dissatisfaction would have been longer still without her she it was who took to the echo divrysthilaire the article that paved his way to journalism there was a day of sovereignty when he was offered an illpaid post on that undistinguished paper how victoriously he twirled his moustache how proudly through her spectacles she watched him do it oh of course he wouldnt be content to stick for ever on the ivry echo not he he was going to write great novels just the same incipiently the women of his stories lived now but he was still very young she said to him at this stage you put your girls in a drawingroom but they come from a tavern and abashed and wondering he saw that poor mademoiselle knew more of girlhood than a literary man had learnt he was an artist or he would not have seen because he was an artist he probed his questions deep because she loved him she did not flinch to him she voiced truths that she had shrunk from owning to herself thoughts that had frightened her and thoughts that she had deemed too sacred to be uttered she brought forth for his guidance her innocence and her knowledge she yielded to him her vanities and her regrets she bared the holiest secrets of her sterile life and stripped her soul that he might make his books of it but always there remained the one secret that she could not tell after he had begun to get onwhen he was a journalist in parisshe had a terrible grief she had travelled to paris to see him and he declined to admit her he declined to admit her because he knew what she had come to say and under heaven there was nothing to him so precious as an idol that he had made out of a spiritual profile and some vices the ivry editor had told her it was rumoured that the woman talked of marrying paul and mademoiselle had written imploring letters to him without avail he must be the best judge of his own mind he had answered and of the true nature of the woman he loved then distraught she had made the journey and been turned from the door with a servants transparent he the tumult of the modern traffic confused herthe failing little figure was jostled by the crowd she went deafened through remembered gates to a bench and sat there feeling stunned the bench was in the garden of the luxembourg where it seemed to her that in another life she had walked beside his mother she had to save him when her mind cleared she thought only of that since it was impossible to plead to paul she must plead to the woman she would find out where she lived she would say in imagining herself in the presence of such a woman she was as timorous as a child she would saywhat the wildness of the notion overwhelmed her suddenly she felt that she could say nothing that she would be tonguetied a sight for ridicule but she must save paul she was two days in paris before she obtained the address and she was no less amazing to the wanton than was the wanton to the spinster from different worlds they marvelled at each other across a hearthrug she said he is not my son but he is as dear to me as if he were indeed the sons of many women are far less to them i think than he to me i worked for him when he was a baby since he has been a man he has meant the only interest in my life it has been a wretched failure of a lifethe one hope left in it is to see him succeed madame his career is in your hands i entreat you to be mercifuli beg it of you on my knees i dont pretend to judge your feelings for him but if you care for him really and deeply do what you know is right for the man you lovemake a memory for yourself that youll be proud of youre beautiful now and young and you dont take some things very earnestly but one day when youre older and memories are all youve got a noble remembrance will be sweet youll say to yourself i saved a man from ruining his future i saved a woman from breaking her heart after her curiosity in the alien was exhausted the beauty rang the bell and said what kind of a fool are you to have imagined i should give up a man i liked because a stranger asked me to its about the silliest idea i ever heard of and then she herself did something sillier she told paul what had happened mimicking the suppliants sorrow and jeering at her prayer the man read into the scene the pathos that the jeerer missed and he saw that the woman he had idealised lacked the grace of pity later when success came to him there was no domestic tragedy darkening the home behind it and he had owed to mademoiselle a timely rent in the veil of his illusion she was teaching at ivry still when his success came for weeks she had known by his letters and the papers that his new book had made a reputation for him but one morning she heard that it was making him rich the hard times were over for them both he wrote there was to be no more labour for her no more loneliness they were to live together in a little appartement in passy she was to rest with flowers in the window and her hands in her laphe was coming to carry her away the letter quivered as she read it and she put it down in fright the secret that had smouldered while she toiled for him while she worked to keep herself flared menace now that he proposed to keep her she dared not accept her comfort of his ignorance she saw herself as a cheat who had hidden her sin a hypocrite who had taken gratitude to which she had no claim now he must be told the confession that had terrorised her all her life could be escaped no longer the day of her calvary was here at every step in the street she shuddered though it was not till evening that he was due she clasped him crying with pride and fear when he strode in he rattled gaily of things triumphant things too difficult today for her to understand she thanked god that it was twilight and he couldnt clearly see her face she crept away from him and bowed her head the young man looked forward the old woman looked back in the twilight her confession came at lastin the twilight his reverent knowledge of his boundless debt but i have loved you she sobbed at the beginning you were my punishment but then i loved you you have borne want for me and contempt i have taken your youth from you and your happiness and your strength he went to her and knelt and kissed the trembling hands how i love you he cried mademoiselle ma mere ii aribauds two wives in the bois one day i met madame aribaud by madame aribaud i mean the wife of a very popular dramatist and i call them aribaud because it wouldnt do to mention their real name i like meeting madame aribaud when i am in paris it refreshes me not only because she isnt preceded by a gust of scent and doesnt daub her mouth clown red like so many parisiennes but because she is so cheerful she diffuses cheerfulness she sat beaming at her little son while he scattered crumbs for the birds and she informed meit was in that he was in the latest fashion having a nurse from england to give him the real english pronunciation though as yet he was hardly a linguist and the nurse said i tell madam we must be pietient with im we cant expect im to talk like i do hall at once also the lady informed me that they had finished arranging their new house and that on the morrow i must go there to dejeuner very readily i went and they showed me the english nursery and an american contrivance that she had presented to her husband for his dressingroomcomme ils sont pratiques les americainsand an antique or two that she had picked up for his study and not least she showed us both some croquettes de pommes that looked ethereal andi have never tasted croquettes de pommes like madame aribauds i always say she is the most domesticated of pretty women and her husband the most pampered of good fellows playgoers who know him merely by his comedies in which married people get on together so badly up to the fourth act might be surprised to see inside his villa only when he and i were lounging in the study afterwardsmy hostess was in the little garden pretending to be a horsei said to him as the boys shouts came up to us through the open window doesnt the child disturb you out there when youre busy my friend nodded sometimes he acknowledged he disturbs me what would you have he must play and the garden is too diminutive for him to go far away in it it makes me think of what dumas pere said when he paid a visit to his sons chalet in the suburbsopen your diningroom window and give your garden some air once or twice i have wondered whether i should work in a front room instead but to tell you the truth i always come to the conclusion that i like the noise believe me a dramatist may suffer from worse drawbacks than a childs laughter he blew smoke thoughtfully and added i had a wife who was childless now though i knew maurice aribaud very well indeed i had never heard that this was his second marriage and i suppose i stared yes he said again i had a wife who was childless and then with many pauses he told me a lot that i had not suspected about his life and though i cant pretend to remember his precise words or the exact order in which details were forthcoming i am going to quote him as well as i can i had not two louis to knock together when i met herand i wasnt so very young i had been writing for the theatre for years and had begun to despair of ever seeing anything produced to complete my misery i had no companionship if one excepts booksno friend who wrote or aspired to write no acquaintance who did not draw his screw from a billet as humdrum as my own i was a clerk in the magasins du louvre and though of course the other men in the office talked about playsin france everybody is interested in plays in england i hear you are interested only in the playersnone of them was so congenial that i was tempted to announce my ambitions to him i used to think how exciting it must be to know authors and artists even though they were obscure and outatelbows every night as i walked home and passed the windows of a bohemian cafe i used to look at it wistfully i envied the fiercest disappointments of the habitues inside for they were at least professionals of sorts they moved on a different planet from myself once in a blue moon i found the resolution to enter pushing the door open timidly like a provincial venturing into paillards i suppose i had a vague hope that something might happen something that would yield confidences perhaps a comrade for life but i sat in the place embarrassed with the air of an intruder and came out feeling even lonelier than when i went in one windy wet day i was at the montdepiete to redeem my watch i had pawned it two or three weeks before because i had seen a secondhand copy of a book that i wanted very much and couldnt afford at the moment i will not inquire whether you have ever pawned anything in paris yourself but if you havent you may not know the formalities of the degagement ah you have pawned things only in london well after you have paid the principal and the interest you are given a numbered ticket and then you go into a large room and take your choice among uncomfortable benches and wait your turn it is something like cashing a cheque at the head office of the credit lyonnais only at the montdepiete the people on the benches sit waiting for the most disparate articles on one side of you there may be a fashionably dressed woman who rises to receive a jewelcaseand on the other some piteous creature who clutches at a bundle the goods and chattels descend in consignments and when one consignment has been distributed the interval before the next comes down threatens to be endless the officials behind the counter converse in undertones and you meanwhile have nothing livelier to do than listen to the rain and wonder how hardup your neighbour may be that day however i did not chafe at the delay there was a young girl there whose face caught and held my attention almost immediately not only was her prettiness remarkableher expression was astonishing she looked happy yes in the gaunt room among the damp dismal crowd relieving the tedium by a heavy sigh or an occasional shuffling of their shoes this fairhaired neat innocent little girl looked happy smiles hovered about her lips and her eyes sparkled with contentment i tried to conjecture the reason for her delight what treasured possession she was about to regain a trinket no something indefinable in her bearing forbade me to think it was a trinket my imagination ranged over a dozen possible pledges without finding one to harmonise with her ridiculous as it sounds i could picture nothing so appropriate for her to recover as a canary which should fly singing to her finger every time a number was called curiosity made me hope that her turn had come the latest load that had been delivered was almost exhausted only three packages remained another call and she got up at last the package was a bulky one i craned my neck it was a typewriter quite five minutes more lagged by before i got my watch and when i crossed the courtyard i had no expectation of seeing her again but no sooner had i passed through the gate than i discovered her in trouble she had been trying to carry the typewriter and an open umbrella and now the umbrella had blown inside out and she had put the typewriter on the pavement in such a situation it was not difficult for me to speak i picked the thing up for her she thanked me and made another ineffectual attempt to depart i offered my help she demurred i insisted we made for her tram togetherand tram after tram was full it had been raining for several hours and paris was a lake of mud in the end i trudged beside her through the swimming streets carrying her typewriter all the way to the step of her lodging so began my courtship she was as solitary as i her fathers death had left her quite alone he had been old and very poor blind too but his work had been done up to the last my little sweetheart guiding him to the houseshe had earned a living as a pianotuner in sevres she had an aunt his sisterinlaw but though the woman boasted a respectable business and was fairly welltodo she had come foward with nothing more substantial than advice and the orphan had had only her typewriter to keep the wolf from the door her struggles in paris with a typewriter she had been forced to pawn it every time she lost a situation but every time she saved enough to recapture it she felt prosperous again her own machine meant luxuries with her own machine she could afford a plant to put in her attic window and a rosebud for her breast she loved flowers and she often wore them tucked in her bodice after the magasins du louvre closedthe lonely clerk used to hurry to meet the little typist on her way home yet she told me once that her love for them had come very late for years the sight of all flowers had saddened her she had been born on that melancholy boulevard that leads to the cemetery of pere la chaise that quarter of it where one sees exposed for sale nothing but floral tokens for the mournersnothing to right and left but mountains of artificial wreaths and drear chrysanthemums in stiff white paper cones as a child she had thought that flowers were grown only for graves i recall the courtship in all seasons and always in the streetswhen the trees were brown and the light faded while we walked and when the trees had whitened and the lamps were gleaming and when the trees grew green and we walked in sunshine it was in the streets that we fell in lovein the streets that i asked her if she would marry me we were on the quai des orfevres one sunday afternoon in summer i had meant to wait till we were in the garden of the tuileries but we had stopped to look at the river and i can see it all now the barge folks washing hanging out to bleach and a woman knitting among the geraniums on a deck there was a little fishingtackle shop i remember called au bon pecheur and a poodle and a persian cat were basking together on the doorstep our hands just touched because of the people passing and then we went on to the tuileries and talked and before we seemed to have talked much it was moonlight a concert had begun and away in the distance a violinist was playing la precieuse why i exclaimed ive given you no dinner she laughed she hadnt been hungry either no millionaires have ever dined at armenonville more merrily than we for a hundred sous at a little table on a sidewalk she said when i am your wife i shall typewrite all your plays for you mauriceperhaps that will bring you luck and by and by when we came to the magasins du louvre she pointed to the comediefrancaise you havent far to travel to reach it dearest she smiledwell cross the road together how sweet she looked in the wedding frock that she had stitched how proud i was of her our menage was two rooms on the left bank and in the evening in our tiny salon on the sixth floor her devoted hands clattered away on her machine transcribing my manuscript till i kissed and held them prisoners didnt she work hard enough all day for strangers poor childmy salary was too small to liberate her you are jealous she would say gaily because i write your dialogue so much faster than you and often i wished that i could create a scene as rapidly as she typewrote it but we had our unpractical evenings also when we built castlesintheair and chose the furniture for them i had brought home from the magasins one of the diaries that they issue annually it contained plans of the theatresit always doesand perched on my knee she pictured a play of mine at each of them in turn and the house rocking with applause and then we pencilled the private box wed have and drove in fancy and our automobile to sit there grandly on the threehundredth night we spent many hours in selecting presents that i would have made to her if i could one of the things she wanted was of course a theatre bag the prettiest that you can pretend and i pretended a beauty for her in rose brocadeand inside i put the daintiest enamelled operaglasses that the rue de la paix could show and a fan of brussels point and a brusselspoint handkerchief and a quaint gold bonbonniere with sugared violets in it i remember she threw her arms round my neck as ecstatically as if the things were really there we were at the time supping on stale bread with a stick of chocolate apiece the dramatist sat silent his eyes grown wide i think that for a moment he had forgotten his new desirable home and the antiques on the mantelpiecethat he was back in a girls arms in a room on a sixth floor under the window his wife had ceased to play at horses and was swinging their son instead the childs delight was boisterous she called up to us now are we a nuisance messieurs shall we go to the nursery no no cried aribaud starting not at all we are doing nothing continue mon ange continue what a heaven opened he went on turning to me when i had a piece taken at last as long as i live i shall think of the morning that letter came of our reading it together half dressed and crying with joy she was making the coffee for breakfast and yet even when the contract was signed it sometimes seemed incredible i used to dream that it had happened and dream that i was dreamingthat i was to wake and find it wasnt true and the eternity of delay the postponements one after another and then when we felt worn out with waiting the night that we jolted to the show in an omnibus and sat breathless in the fauteuils de balcon i remember the first laugh of approval that the audience gave her clutching my hand and how she clung to me sobbing and comforting when we got home and knew that the piece had failed i had a short run the next autumn with successeur de son pere but my first hit of course was les huit jours de leonie when that was produced the fees came tumbling in werent we dazed at the beginning and how important we felt to be taking a flat and going to a bureau de placement to engage a servant we were like children playing with a dollshouse the change was marvellous and when i received an invitation from somebody or other who had been unapproachable only a year beforeher exultance to see me go the invitations to the author you understand did not always include his wife and unfortunately those that ignored her were often those that it would have been unwise for me to decline i found that rather pathetic we had hoped together for so long and now that success had come she wasnt getting her fair half of the fun an elaborate evening gown that we had hurried expectantly to order for her was not needed after allit was out of fashion before she wore it still as i say she exulted to see me goat first and later well when i insisted on a refusal because she had not been asked it grieved her that i neglected opportunities for her sake and when i consented to go without her she was not unnaturally dull it was not very lively for her in the daytime either when my duties as a clerk had taken me from her she too had had employment but now of course her berth had been resigned and while i wrote all day upstairs she was alone she was not used to leisureall her life she had worked we had no child to claim her time to occupy her thoughts and yield the interests of maternity though she endeavoured to create distractions for herself the flat that we had been so proud of was rather dreary for her after its novelty faded she sighed in it oftener than she laughed the very few women that she met were actresses who talked of nothing but their careerstheir genius their wrongs and their press notices what companion could she find among them even had i wished her to seek their companionship and the men who came to us also talked shop continuously and directed themselves chiefly to me no doubt they would have had enough and too much to say to her had i been absent but as it was they often appeared to forget that she was there as time went on too the theatre made more and more demands upon mea comedy in rehearsal while another was being written the telephone bell always ringing to call me away just when i had arranged to take a halfholiday with her and when i left the theatre i could not dismiss the anxieties of a production from my mind as i had dismissed the affairs of the magasins when i left my office stoolthey were mine and i brought them home with me she grew bored restless she was nervy with solitude and chagrined at feeling herself insignificant she told me one day that she wanted me to put her on the stage mon dieu to begin with she had no gift for the stageand if she had been ever so clever did i want to see her there i was aghast but mignonne i said what makes you think all of a sudden you could act leaving everything else aside what reason is there to suppose you would succeed you have had no experience you have never even shown the slightest tendency towards it i want something to do she said but i said that isnt enough and besides you would not like it at allyou would find it odious you sit in a box and you see a celebrated woman bringing the house down and to be an actress looks to you very fine but she has been half a lifetime arriving at celebritythere is nothing fine about the journey to it you would feel that you had given up a good deal i assure youa dramatists wife in the box is a much more dignified figure than a dramatists wife rehearsing a trivial part and being corrected by the stagemanager i did not mean trivial parts she said disconsolatelyand i realised for the first time that she had been dreaming of a debut in the principal role but she let the discussion drop and i half thought i had convinced her i was very much mistaken a few weeks later she referred to it again and more urgently she seemed to imagine that her project was a perfectly simple matter for me to arrange that the only obstacle in the way was my personal objection to it what you say about trivial parts is quite true she acknowledged with an air of being extremely reasonable but in one of your own pieces you could easily get me lead everybody wants plays from you now you would only have to say that you wished me to be engaged of course i should study i should go to a professor of diction and take lessons well i tried to explain the commercial aspect of the case to her i told her that for one thing the managers would see my plays in jericho before they agreed to entrust the leading part to a novice and i told her that supposing for an instant i did find a manager reckless enough to consent i should be ruining my own property ah she said you make up your mind in advance that i have no dramatic instinct i said it is not even a question whether you have any dramatic instinct it is enough that you havent any renown you have heard too much of the business by this time not to know that everybody tries to secure the most popular artists that he can for me to put up a play with an absolutely unknown name instead of a stars would be asking for a failure if i were billed as madame aribaud the name would not be unknown she argued whether you were billed as madame aribaud or as anybody else i said the point would be how good you were in the part the public would not pay to see an indifferent performance because you were madame aribaud ah then you admit itthat is it after all she cried you declare beforehand that i have no ability why should you say such a thing it isnt right of you i said i declare beforehand that you have had no training i declare beforehand that you could not master in a few weeks or months a technique that other women acquire only after years and on top of all that i declare that i dont want to see you in the profession why do you become dissatisfied after we have got on why cant you be as content as you used to be when we had nothing the days are longer than they used to be i want something to do she insisted oh i understood but i need hardly tell you that this fever of hers didnt make for bliss the theatre became a bone of contention between usthe position that i had dreamed of and yearned for was dividing me from my wife it got worse every year i no longer dared to mention business in my home we were on affectionate terms only in the hours when the theatre was forgotten one day i would hold her in my arms and on the next some chance allusion would estrange us if i happened to come across a little actress who was suitable to a more conspicuous part than those that she had had hitherto my casting her for it was a domestic tragedyi made opportunities for every woman but one i have been told that strangers who pestered me for theatrical engagements complained that i was unsympatheticthey little guessed how i was pestered for engagements on my own hearth the aunt at sevres also had something to say she had managed to get on a semifriendly footing with us when les huit jours was running and now she had the effrontery to take the tone of a motherinlaw with me she knew i was devoted to her niece but i was not being fair to heri ought to realise that she had a right to a career too what audacitya woman who had given nothing but phrases when her niece was penniless i did not wrap up my answer in silver paperand i fancy the aunts influence was responsible for a good deal i think she revenged herself by offering all the encouragement possible behind my back anyhow my wife announced to me at last that she had determined to go her own road without my help it was as if she had struck me she meant to seek an opening in some minor company in the provincesin the obscurest of the theatres ambulants if she could do no better it sounded so mad that at first i could hardly believe she was in earnest the doggedness of her air soon convinced me i would have welcomed the wildest hysteria in preference since i refused to further her ambition she must resign herself to beginning in the humblest way she told me quietly she regretted to defy my wishes but she was a woman and i had been wrong to expect from her the blind obedience of a childshe could not consent to remain a nonentity any longer she dumfounded me it meant actual separation it meant the end of our life togetherand she was telling me this composedly coolly as if our life together were the merest trifle compared with the fascination of the footlights i cursed the footlights and the day i first wrote for them i swear i wished myself back in the magasins du louvre my excitement was so violent that i could not articulate i stuttered and stood mute i went from her overwhelmed asking myself what i was to do there is one course that never fails to remedy marital unhappiness and bring husband and wife together againon the stage it is when he leads her to an ottoman and standing a pace or two behind her proceeds with tender gravity to recite a catalogue of her defects he contrasts them pathetically with the virtues that endeared her to him in the springtime of their unionand the wife moved to tears becomes immediately and for ever afterwards the girl that she used to be the situation is pretty it is popular and it is quite untrue for in real life one cannot recreate a character by making a speech however i was a dramatist and more credulous than i am now and i tried for days i pondered what i should say arguments were plentiful but the problem was how to present them forcefully enough to show her the wildness of her plan and yet gently enough to avoid incensing her our future hung upon the scene and i prayed to heaven that not a tactless word should escape me i knew that we had reached the crisis that a mistaken adjective even an impatient gesture might be fatal i considered and reconsidered that appeal with more tireless fervour than any lines that i have ever put into the mouth of a leading man i thought about it so much that sometimes i was enraged to find the things i meant to say falling mentally into sentences too rhythmic and rounded as if i had indeed been writing for the stage and i damned my metier anew you are an author yourself my friendyou should understand i longed to open my heart to her with all simplicitynever had any one sought to pour his heart out more earnestly more freely more unaffectedly than iand it seemed to me in these moments that the artifices of the theatre were fighting against me to the very end it was as if its influence were unconquerableit had surmounted her love for me and now it threatened even to mock my plea enfin the opportunity came she sat down on the couchthe ottoman of the stage situationand i began to speak with all the tenderness and gravity of the stage husband struggle as i would to banish the thought i could not help being conscious of our resemblance to the hero and heroine of a thousand comedies in the last act i say that i began to speak and that i felt constrained by a shoal of theatrical reminiscences but our likeness to the hero and heroine was brief she interrupted me she defied the dramatic convention in lieu of being moved to tears she replied with a world of dignity that the faults were mine she advised me for my own sake to try to attain a more unselfish view with a flow of impromptu eloquence that i envied she warned me that though i was not intentionally unjust i was allowing prejudice and egotism to warp my better nature before i knew what had happened i stood listening to a homily the situation that meant my last hope had come out upside down aribaud paused again on the little lawn the child had left the swing the most devoted of wives and mothers was playing chat perche with him now they made a pretty picture but my thoughts were with her predecessor i was mourning the lovestory that had begun like an idyll and that seemed to have had so bad an end the mans voice brought me back yes the infallible situation had failed he repeated what do you suppose was the sequel i suppose i sighed she had her way no said aribaud she had her baby he waved a triumphant hand towards the garden and from the first promise of that godsent gift the glamour of the theatre faded from her mind and me talked only of her home from that day to this we have been as happy together as you see us now my exclamation was cut short by the hostess whose history i had been hearing messieurs are you really sure we arent laughing too much for you she pealed up to us again sure sure it is wellit is as it should bewe come to join you shouted aribaud laugh loud my lovelaugh on iii that villain her father henri vauquelin was a widower with one daughter to whom he had denied nothing from the time she used to whimper for his watch and drop it on the floor so after she left the convent where she had been educated and told him how much she was missing her friend georgette he said gaily mais ma petite invite mademoisellewhatever her name may be to come to paris and stay with us for a month his gaiety was a trifle forced however though he was happy to give his daughter a companion he was pained to learn that his own companionship hadnt been enough for i have done all i could he mused the fact is that though i feel fairly young i am elderly thats the trouble to a girl of twentyone a father of fortyfive is an ancient for the chimney corner i must see about finding her a husbandi shall have to talk to madame daudenarde about her son the first time i am in the neighbourhood and after blanche had flung her arms round his neck and darted forth to send the invitation to her friend he surveyed his reflection in a glass pensively and noted that his moustache was much greyer than he had thought when the indispensable georgette arrived in a costume that became her admirably and sat at dinner in a dress that became her more admirably still replying to him with composure and point he was surprised at the girls attraction for each otherand his surprise did not diminish as the days passed though not actually more than two or three years older than blanche mademoiselle paumelle was in tone much older blanche was an ingenue georgette was a woman excepting in moments when she romped like a schoolgirl all spontaneity and high spirits she is a queer compound your chum he remarked when she had been with them for a fortnight alternately thirty and thirteen you dont like her papa oh yes she is well enough and not badlooking i am relieved she did not turn out to be uglythat would have depressed me but it is a trifle confusing to be uncertain whether i am about to be addressed by a woman of the world or a madcap from a nursery she used always to be a madcap till she lost her motheryou see there are only her stepfather and his two sisters now it is that that has changed her so dreadfully i find nothing dreadful about her said vauquelin a shade sharply on the contrary iti suppose some people might find it rather fascinating i merely observe that she is different from any other girl that i have met whats the matter with her stepfather she tells me he never stops talking his topics must be pretty catholic this jeune fille from the country appears to know more of politics finance society and sport than i who have lived in paris fortyfive years how you do exaggerate papa rippled blanche reprovingly at any rate i do not exaggerate the years sighed vauquelin well if she is not happy at home why not ask her to stay with us for two months she is not in my way you know but mademoiselle paumelle declared that it would be impossible for her to prolong her visit blanche reported this to him with wistful lips and he said ill see if i can persuade heri will speak to her about it in the morning when you go to take your musiclesson on the morrow blanche tells me that she is greatly disappointed he began she will miss you terribly when you leave us mademoiselle i wish you would think over your objection it is infinitely kind of you monsieur vauquelin i fear that a month is the very most i can manage even to do us a service ah a service she smiled you will find plenty of people ready to do you such services not plenty of mesdemoiselles paumelle i am in earnest it is dull here for blanche alone with me i have done my best for her i am not consciously selfishi have sat at home when i wanted to go out and gone out when i wanted to stop at home i have taken her to the francais and pretended to enjoy myself though i could have yawned my head off and the question of her clothes has absorbed me more than the affairs of france but i am old all my tenderness for her cannot alter that you do not seem to me old said mademoiselle paumelle dont i said vauquelin regarding her gratefully look how grey my moustache is getting and yet do you know when were all laughing together i feel as young as ever i was your manner is young the face alters ever so long before the manner i am fortyferover forty and blanche is twentyone what will you i must get her married soon it is my paramount desire i rather fancy that daudenarde and she may not dislike each otherthe gentleman you saw the other evening she was doing her hair from seven oclock till eight and he sighed when he handed her the lemonade your observation is invaluable i must have a chat with his mother soon it would be an excellent match in the meantime she stands in need of the companionship and counsel of a young lady like you she needs it most urgently if your stepfather can spare you ah my stepfather could spare me for ever she put in there are others to listen to him and if you are not bored here bored i am having the time of my life eh bien remain for two months i beg be merciful to us i need your advice myself there is a matter that is harassing me i cannot determine whether her new jumper should be beaded silkbroidered or fringed if it is telling on your health her eyes laughed into his you yield i weakly wobble there is further the consuming question of a simple evening dresswhat it should be made of i succumb tulle would be all right or georgette it shall be georgettewe shall not lose you so utterly when you go oh you arepriceless she pealed vauquelin reflected she has three sterling qualities this girlshe is pretty she is nice and she looks at me as if i were a young man during the next six weeks vauquelin developed a zest for the francais that was astonishing and not for the francais only or for the opera comique and concerts and kinemas blanche had never applauded her papa so ardently he would be seized with captivating whims for expeditions and picnics and moonlight runs in the car his frolicsomeness passed belief not till the six weeks were over and mademoiselle paumelle had departed bearing blanche with her did his spirits fall and then there would have been no buyers the middleaged gentleman was plunged into melancholy the worse to bear from the fact that he was conscious of being comic trying to throw dust in his own eyes it is frightful how i miss blanche he would soliloquise at the elegiac dinnertable but the eyes were fixed sentimentally on the place that had been georgettes and as the date approached for blanche to return and his heart sank before the necessity for resuming his capers it is clear he told himself that the affection i entertained for that georgette paumelle was almost parental the fatherliness of his feelings for her however did not avert increased regrets at the greying moustache and he abandoned his shaving mirror because it magnified the lines about his nose and mouth blanche on his knee again had plenty to tell she described the stepfather as a trial and his maiden sisters as cats she had enjoyed herself because georgette and she had been together all day but it must be hideous there for georgette alone she isnt going to stick it much longer she is miserable with them how distressing that is said vauquelin to whom does she go well she has money of her own you knowshe can live where she likes maiscomment donc she cannot live by herselfune jeune fille bien elevee what an idea her people would never sanction it i think they would be rather glad to get rid of her said blanche choosing a chocolate with deliberation butbut it is monstrous to live like a bohemian she it is unheard of terrible is she out of her mind listen ma cherie if her plight upsets you so violently she can make her home with us ah papa cried blanche in ecstasy it is the very thing i thought of but i was afraid it was too much to ask you now when did i ever refuse you anything but such an enormous favour not at all not at all i shall adapt myself to the arrangement well enough but papa it might get on your nerves in time not at all not at all there is my study for me to retire toi shall not see more of her than i want to you promise that i can swear it oh it will be adorable i only wonder if i am being selfish to let you do it i insist said vauquelin with a noble gesture say we entreat her to agree that we shall be wounded if she declines say our flat is her home for as long as she will honour usthe longer the better i will write a few lines to her too be tranquil my sweet childi do not sacrifice myself is it not my highest joy to indulge you after many letters had been indited to her mademoiselle paumelle was prevailed upon to come and after many remonstrances had been made to her she ceased to speak of going but for the fact that her gifts to the girl were expensive it was as if she were a member of the family blanche was relieved to note that her papa was not driven to the seclusion of his study often and never did he withdraw to it when blanche was absent to take her musiclesson as he had predicted vauquelin adapted himself to the arrangement plastically he approved it so much especially the teteatete during the musiclessons that when six months had flashed by he resented an incident which reminded him that it couldnt be permanent a monsieur brigard an old comrade arrived to advocate nothing less than that blanche should espouse brigards boy my friend i have other views for my daughter replied vauquelin firmly but the arrival dejected him in the knowledge that when blanche should marry georgette would have to go and in their next hour alone together georgette asked him what his worry was nothing i am a littlewe must all think of the future our childrens future a father has responsibilities a propos dewhat am i inquisitive do i not confide everything to you some pest has made matrimonial overtures about his son preposterous the young mans position is not good enough ah his position is first rate i say nothing against his position it is his character that displeases you no as for that he is steady and not unamiable but what do you complain of vauquelin waved his hand vaguely the proposal does not accord with my ideas i have different intentions for her ah yes that monsieur daudenarde i thought perhaps that affair had faded out by no means affirmed vauquelin clutching at the excuse precisely i wish her to marry monsieur daudenarde and that is a sound and laudable reason why i should resent being badgered by brigard i find such intrusions on my routine very offensive daudenardes mother and i are going to have a little talk together some time or other but what you decided to have a little talk with her nine or ten months ago i must avoid precipitance in such matters a father cannot act with too much caution blanche is a darling but there are other girls in paris if you desire the match be careful you dont let him slip have no misgiving said vauquelin irritably i am quite content madame daudenarde will receive a visit from mewhen blanche is older and we shall see what we shall see the captivating georgette looked thoughtful the more so after a chat with blanche had drawn forth the nervous confession that she thought monsieur daudenarde very nice and then when the volatile father had banished the menace of the future from his mind and was again basking in the sunshine of the present what should happen but that madame daudenarde inconsiderately broached the matter to him instead of waiting for him to approach her dear lady my daughter is too young replied vauquelin promptly how too young demurred madame daudenarde she is oneandtwenty i was but nineteen when i married yes said vauquelin but my sainted mother did not marry till she was thirtytwo and she always impressed upon me that it was the best age thirtytwo cried madame daudenarde shrilly do you ask me to adjourn our conference for eleven years my honoured friend i do not make it a hardandfast condition stammered the unhappy man struggling for coherence it is possible there may be something to be said against it but your gratifying proposal is so suddeni had not contemplated the alliancei need time to balance my parental duties against my reverence for my mothers views now georgette who could put two and two together as accurately as the minister of finance had not failed to remark that the interview took place privately in the study and noted that her host was evasive when blanche inquired why madame daudenarde had called at such a funny time feelers during the next musiclesson found him evasive also in the days that followed when blanche developed a tendency to sigh plaintively and turned against chocolates it grew clear to georgette that this father must be shown the error of his ways may i say that i hope that conversation with madame daudenarde contented you she ventured hein said vauquelin starting that the engagement will soon be announced mon dieu is it not extraordinary how people seek to rob me of my child he moaned does that mean that nothing is arranged yet why not leave well alone are we not all comfortable as we are i have made no definite reply to madame daudenardei cannot be bustled have you ever thought that when i part from blanche i shall be left here by myself yes it has even occurred to me that you have thought of it too naturally it is not strange that i should tremble at such a prospect to be solitary is a sad thing it is for your own sake then not hers that you delay for the first time i find you lacking he broke out you do not seem to comprehend the workings of a fathers heart i have never had one dont split straws when i lose her i shall be alone you do not require to be a father to know that you could always go to see her flute and your grandchildren respectful grandchildren that clustered at your knee i will not anticipate grandchildreni am not a hundred exclaimed vauquelin angrily i repeat that the present conditions are entirely to my taste and i desire to prolong them it is also possible you might remarry at my age who would have me some ripe and ruddled widow girls quite young marry men much older than you but not for love tell me what would you put me down at without flattery i should call you in the prime of life the friendly phrase for senile depend upon it people said that to methuselah supposinga man is never too old to make a fool of himself you knowsupposing for the sake of argument i felt a tenderness a devotion for a girl scarcely older than blanche a devotion which i strove to think platonic even while i sighed under her window and which revived in me unsought the emotionsall the sentiment the throes the absurditiesof the youth that had gone from me before i knew how divine it was would itcould itis it imaginable that she might not laugh she would not laugh if she were worth it all to marry me for lovea girl to see me romantic without thinking me ridiculousto melt to my tears not shrink from the crowsfeet round my eyes i wonder if you choose wisely you will not wonder in love who chooses fate decides what would you call wisely she should behow old old enough to know her mind young enough to attract you for the rest she should have means that you might never fear it had been yours that won her she should have affection for your child that she might know no jealousy of yours she should take interest in your childs future that if you were wilful she might guide you to revert to madame daudenarde i counsel you to write today that you consent vauquelin stood gazing at her incredulously georgette georgette he panted do you know you have given me your own portrait with my love she told him smiling iv the statue in the square diena which teems with little parisians in charge of english nurses vera simpson wheeled the babycarriage to a bench on fine mornings and exchanged patriotic sentiments with her compeers when disparagement of france flagged vera simpson occasionally observed so as she always entered the square at the same end and nearly always chose the same bench she observed the eccentric proceedings of a young man who took to coming every morning to stare at the statue on the opposite grass plot after standing before it as if he were glued there the young man would reverse one of the chairs that faced the path in an orderly line and then sit mooning at the statue with his back to everybody for nearly an hour it was miss simpson surmised a statue to a departed frenchy she had never approached it to ascertain what name it bore and could see nothing about the thing to account for the fellows taking such stock of it some time before he had appeared for nine days in succession she and her circle had nicknamed him the rum un on the tenth day instead of the young man a woman went to the statue and stood before it just as stupidly and as long as the man had done the most comical bit was that when she turned away at last it was seen that the statue had been making the woman cry after that neither of the funny pair came back to the square diena but as vera simpson chooses the same bench still she sometimes recalls their queerness and before her mind wanders tries again to guess their game this was the game that vera simpson tries to guess gaby dupuy was wishing that the summer were over she was a model not one of the wretched models that wait at the corner of the boulevards raspail and montparnasse on mondays to crave the vote of students in academies she went by appointment to the ateliers of the successful but now the painters and the sculptors were all at the seaside and her appointment book had shown no sitting for ever so long gabys qualities had never placed her among the stars of her profession nobody had ever said of her as a great man said of one of the most celebrated of models that he had only to reproduce her faithfully still less could it be asserted that she had the genius to penetrate an artists purport and present the pose that was eluding him but if she had neither the beauty of a sarah brown nor the intuition of a dubosc her face possessed a certain attractiveness and she could achieve the expression demanded of her when it was laboriously explained once upon a time her face had been more attractive still gaby wasnt so young as she used to be while the woman was regretting that her scanty provision for the dreaded summer would not allow her a more adequate menu she received a letter a stranger who signed himself jacques launay earnestly desired an interview he wrote that being unfamiliar with paris he had had great difficulty in ascertaining her address and added that as his stay in the capital was drawing to a close he would deeply appreciate the favour of an early reply her eyebrows climbed as she saw that in lieu of requiring her to betake herself to his studio he begged for the privilege of calling upon her at any hour that she might find convenient probably though as a provincial he hadnt got a studio here still what deference he had written to her as if she were of the ancienne noblesse but if he hadnt a studio where did he expect her to pose did he want her to go to him in the country yes that must be it flute gaby didnt think it would be good enoughthe end of the dead season was in sight at last and in paris she would often be booked for two studios a day nevertheless she was eager to hear what he had to say for himself she answered that he could see her at seven oclock the following evening at the paradis des artistes round the corner to meet him at a restaurant she reflected would at least ensure his asking her to have something to drink and as the tables would be laid by seven oclock he might even spring to a meal the paradis des artistes was a small establishment where for three francs one found a homely dinner inclusive of wine and a cripple who wore a red jacket to look like a tzigane and chanted to a mandoline the artistes were chiefly models and the lesser lights of a cafeconcert as most of the company knew one another and the proprietress called many of the ladies by their christian names and played piquet with them between midnight and am the tone of the restaurant was as informal as a family party when gaby arrived the only person present whom she had never seen there before was a young man who sat at a table near the door solitary and seemingly expectant their gaze met but although he looked undecided he did not salute her then as she was greeted by acquaintances somebody cried gaby comment va and the young mans head was turned again if he was her correspondent it was rather odd that he didnt know her when he saw her but she gave him another opportunity he approached with marked hesitation mademoiselle gabrielle dupuy mais oui monsieur she said smiling graciously it is monsieur launay oh mademoiselle it is most kind of you faltered the stranger his confusion was extraordinary considering his age for he could not have been less than eight or nineandtwenty they stood mute for some seconds as he remained too much embarrassed to suggest her taking a seat at his table i hope i have not kept you waiting she asked carelessly moving towards it they sat down now and the waitress whose tone was informal too whisked over with and for mademoiselle dupuy give me a glass of madere louise she said still the young man seemed unable to find his tongue and she went on i am afraid this place was rather out of the way for you but i have got into the habit of dropping in here about this time and it is cosy and one can talk yes he assented he stole a timid glance at her and looked quickly away oh yes who was it who gave you my address at last monsieur i do not know he said awkwardly it was a man who heard me inquiring i had immense trouble to find it out it is not a dead secret however i suppose notnobut i have no friends in paris i have never been in paris before and at the start i did not even know who you were you did not know who i was oh you had seen something i had posed for yes it was like that i was anxious to find you but i did not know your name and i had no one to help me he stammered it was enormously difficult you are a painter monsieur launay no mademoiselle ah a sculptor that interests me still more i am not a sculptor either mademoiselle he admitted i am a composer a composer she echoed butbut a composer does not employ models no mademoiselle but i beg you not to think my motive impudent exclaimed the young man with the first touch of spontaneity that he had shown yet mysterious merely she smiled her expression offered him encouragement to elucidate the mystery but nervousness seemed to overcome him again he was boring her she exchanged remarks across the room with a lady who wore one of the figured veils then in vogue under which the victim of fashion appeared to have lost portions of her face going to feed gaby yes my dear in a minute she answered she saw her correspondent regard the announcement diner fr his invitation was constrained and her acceptance listless it no doubt surprised the young man to discover that the veiled lady was his guest as well he must have wondered how it had happened also it may have startled him when he made to fill gabys glass from one of the little decanters that stood before them to learn that she did not take it and to see a bottle labelled pouilly fuisse display itself before he could say why for he had not heard it ordered he heard no order given for the second bottle that he beheld nor for the tarte aux cerises that graced their repasta delicacy that was not a feature of the other peoples but though these incidents may have caused him disquietude since he was far from having an air of wealth he manifested no objection to them gaby allowed that that was gentil a singularly taciturn host but an amenable one and briefly as he spoke he yielded continuous attention to her prattle to the lady with the veil it was queer that the more she prattled the more despondent he grew she found him piquing her curiosity when a bill for twentynine francs fifty was presented to him after the cafe filtre and egyptian cigarettes gaby put out her hand for it and knocked off four francs without discussion i dont let them make their little mistakes with friends of mine she told him languidly rising i am going home to get my coatyou can come with me he accepted her invitation with as scant enthusiasm as she had shown for his own and by way of a hint forgetful of her earlier statement she added this place is rottenits so noisy and one cant talk but he proved no more talkative in the street one might almost have imagined that the task of explaining his petition for the interview was a duty that he sought to escape her lodging was so close that the doorway took him aback he followed her up the stairs submissively she was not impatient for the coat after lighting the lamp she lit another of the cigarettes and sat the young man stood staring from the window well chatterbox she said he swung round with unexpected vehemence i know i look a hopeless idiot he cried but what an idea her gesture was all surprised denial i prayed to see youi said nothing all the evening i stand like a dummy here i must tell you why i wrote butbut it is not so easy as i thought it would be you make me curious listen he exclaimed i had had two passions in my lifemusic and the poetry of richardiere no other poet has meant halfa titheso much to me as he his work inspired me when i was a boy if i had had the means i would have taken the journey to paris just to wait on the pavement and see his face when he went out when he diedof course all france mourned his loss but none but his dearest friends i think could have felt as i did well since i have been a man i have made an opera of his arizath and i came to paris last week because there was a prospect of its being produced five minutes after i had found a room at an hotel i was asking my way to the square diena to see the statue to him i knew nothing about it excepting that it had been erected thereand as i approached it my heart sank i had always pictured a statue of the man and i saw merely a bust of himthe statue was of a woman recalling a verse she nodded i know beauvais kept me posing for three hours and a half without budging and i had a chilblain that itched like mad on the finger inside the book the disappointment was keen i almost wished i had not come for it had been a long walk and i was very tired and then after i had stood looking at the bust noting how handsome he had been and thinking of his genius i looked down at the statue of the woman and i felt that it would have been worth coming simply to see that it was so wonderful so real the naturalness of the attitude the perfection of the toilettei had never realised that the sculptors art could do such things i think i looked for minutes at the slippers i admired the sleeves the sweep of the gown that seemed as if it must be soft to touch i was amazed by a thousand trifles before my glance lingered on the face and after my glance lingered on the face i saw nothing else i could not even move to look at it in profileit held me fixed it is beauvais masterpiece said gaby they all say it is the finest thing he has done it is a masterpiece yes but i was not thinking of the sculptor and his art any morei was thinking of the face without remembering how it had come about it was as if a beautiful mind were really pondering behind that brow the character of the mouth and chin impressed me as if the marble had been flesh and blood the abstracted eyes couldnt have stirred me to more reverence if they had had sight and while i looked at them they seemed by an optical illusion to meet my own not with interest with an unconsciousness that mortified methey seemed to gaze through my insignificance into the greatness of richardiere i blinked i suppose for the next instant they had been averted i wanted them to come back to realise my presence i concentrated all my will upon the effort to trick myself once moreand i could have sworn they turned now too they seemed to notice me there was a smile in them an ironical smilethey smiled at the presumption of my linking an immortal poets work with mine insane but i felt it i shrank from the derision again i raised my head to richardiere and for the first time i remarked that his expression was a poor acknowledgment of the figures homage it was consequential and impertinent a tinge of cruelty in it even he had an air of sensualism of one who held women very light i could imagine his having said horrible things to women he was not worthy of the look in the statues eyes i went there the next day after vowing that i would not go the eyes discerned me sooner this time and i contrived to fancy that their gaze was gentler i was happy in the fancy that their gaze was gentler when the eyes wandered from me i was humbled and when they looked in mine i held my breath i persuaded myselfno i did not persuade myself the thought was bornthat there was comprehension in the gaze that my worship though undesired was understood in the afternoon i had a business appointment that i had been thinking about for weeks but instead of being excited by its nearness i regretted that it obliged me to leave the square diena when i kept the appointment the bad news that there had been a delay in the arrangements hardly troubled mei was impatient only to be outside originally my plan had been to see the louvre as soon as the business was overnow my one desire was to return to the statue it was a delight to hasten to it people must have thought me bound for a rendezvous as i strode smiling through the streets not once did i regard the arrogance of richardiere on the pedestal but it was only in moments that the musing figure ceased to remind me that her god was there though i never looked at it an intense repugnance to the face of richardiere was in my blooda jealousy if you will it possessed me while i was awaywhile i was reiterating that i had made my last visit to the square knowing nevertheless that on the morrow i should yield again the jealousy persisted when i turned the pages of my opera now and the magic of the masters poetry was gone i could not forget his domination of the figurei wanted to think of the beautiful statue freed aloof from him he had left the window and was moving restlessly about the room intent her face propped by her hands the model for the statue sat and watched him the cigarette between her lips was out the fact that there must have been a model for it was borne upon me quite suddenly it had the thrill of a revelation and nearly dazed me this woman lived somewhere in the world she was walking speaking it was as if a miracle had happened as if the statue had come to life i repeated breathlessly that it was true but it appeared fabulous i had attributed emotions to the marble figure with easeto grasp the simple truth of the womans existence was inconceivably difficult i trembled with the marvel of it pygmalion was not more stupefied than i when my heart left off pounding so hard i began to question how long it would take me to discover who she was i did not even know the way to set about it but i knew that if she was in france i meant to find her i need not talk about the rest after a silence gaby stirred and spoke it was a triumph to pose for the statueyour story makes me very proud i could not avoid telling it to you answered the young man drearily but how you say itas if you had done wrong shall i tell you what would have been wrong not to let me know that would have been pathetic mon dieu it would be atrocious for a woman to have done all that and never to hear and to think that at the beginning i fancied you wereyou were so quiet while we dined i was listening to you he sighed thats true you were entitled to it by thenyou had done much to get the chance yes i had done much to get the chance it was beautiful of you i mean it because you have spoken earnestly from your heart and i could seei could see very well that what you were saying was true that you were not exaggerating to please me oh i am moved believe me i am really moved she put out her hand to him impulsively and he took it as in duty bound but he did not raise it to his lips her body stiffened a little as the hand drooped slowly to her lap a shade of apprehension aged her face again there was silence well she murmured well enfin when you sought the chance when you wrote to me at last you foresawwhat infinitely less than you have granted mademoiselle he returned with an obvious effort a briefer meeting a more formal one i thank you most gratefully for your patience your kindness the honour you have done me she gave a harsh laugh and now you regret that you must say good night it is a fact that i have to see my man again this evening he acknowledged hurriedly glancing at his watch i had forgotten the time yes said the woman you had forgotten the timeyou had forgotten that the statue was modelled eleven years ago so you did not find her after all you began your search too late it is not that he cried distressed ah she had sprung to her feet and stood panting why lie to me i am sorry for you in a wayyou havent been a brute consciously a brute what do you imagine you have been a fool you think to yourself i have changed and you should have known i must have changed it would have spared you the bother of seeking me the disillusion when we metthere are no wrinkles creeping on the statue oh it has been a fraud for you i realise the sell but you are not the only sufferer by your folly a man cant talk to a woman as you have talked to me and leave her cold he cant say i felt all this for you before i saw younow goodbye and leave her proud he cant adore her in the marble and disdain her in the flesh without her being ashamed you have degraded me jeered at meyou have taunted me with every blemish on my skin it isnt that he cried again i was a fool i own ita brute if you choose to call me onebut it isnt that what then is it my frock that alters me i am poor i cant afford such gowns as beauvais put on me for the statue is it the way my hair is dressed i can dress it like the statue again the brow you liked the brow well look time hasnt been so rough on me therethe brow is young and you need not be jealous of my thoughts of richardiere for i have never read a single word he wrote what is there lacking in me tell me what you miss i cant tell you he groaned but he had started you have told me she said shrinking i know now my face is ignorantthe statue has more mind than i he no longer said it isnt that he drooped before her dumb contrite after a long pause she quavered dabbing at her eyes well im not an idioti should improve is it an imbecile like me who could teach you i should be content never in a single hour i fell in love with an ideal and went to look for itfailure was ordained it is i who lack sense not you a ghost of a smile twitched her lips it was all the fault of that beauvais he stuck an expression on me with the clothes i did look like that in his studio though the chilblain was itching but even if i made myself look like it now it wouldnt take you in would it dont look so frightened of me i shant go on at you again poor boy you have had a deuce of an evening well i suppose you are right failure was ordainedand it is wise to cut ones failures short you may go and dont flatter yourself that you have hurt me so much as i saidmy vanity was stung for a minute thats all tomorrow i shall have forgotten all about you you can find your way downstairs he hesitatedand took an irresolute step towards her with halfopened arms good night she said not moving goodbye on the tenth day instead of the young man a woman went to the statue and stood before it just as stupidly and as long as he had done the most comical bit was that when she turned away at last it was seen that the statue had been making the woman cry after that neither of the funny pair came back to the square diena but as vera simpson chooses the same bench still she sometimes recalls their queerness and before her mind wanders tries again to guess their game this was the game that an english nursemaid tries to guess v the celebrity at home before boardinghouses in london were all called hotels and while snobbery had advanced no further than to call them establishments there was one in a london square where two of the visitorswhich is boardinghouse english for boarderswere a girl and a young man irene barton was a humble journalist who wrote stories when she would have been wiser to go to bed and yearned to be an admired author jack humphreys was an athletic clerk who was renouncing clerkships for canada and foresaw himself prospering in a world of wheat the young man and the girl used to confide their plans to each otherwhen they werent saying how detestable all the other boarders wereand before the time came for him to sail they had complicated matters by falling in love when he had begged her to wait for him and she had explained that matrimony did not enter into her scheme of things miss barton was miserable but she did not let him guess that she was miserable and she didnt change her mind she had dreamed of being a celebrated novelist from the days when she wrote stories in penny exercise books at the nursery table and his appeal amounted to asking her to sacrifice her aspirations and remain a nobody she had scoffed too often at women who ruined their careers for sickly sentiment to be guilty of the same blunder still she had had no suspicion that sentiment could lure so hard and she viewed the women more leniently now she reflected that the experience of sickly sentiment at first hand should be of benefit to her fiction but the thought failed to encourage her so much as she would have expected of it they learn in suffering what they teach in song she reminded herselfand an oldfashioned instinct which she rebuked whispered but isnt it better to be happy than to teach because jack humphreys persisted they discussed the subject more than once sauntering round the garden of the square in the twilight she expounded her philosophy to him i am not she insisted the least bit the kind of girl you ought to care for itll be five years at the very least before you can marry and in five years time i shall have written books andwell i hope i shall have done something worth while do you suppose i could be satisfied to give it all up i know myself i couldnt do it or if i did do it i should be wretchedand make you wretched too but why should you give it all up he said miserably dont you think i should be interested in it havent i been interested herehave you found me so wooden i dont know much about it but oh my dear im so fond of you whatever interested you would be bound to interest me you could write novels as my wifeid never put any difficulties in your way heaven knows i wouldnt she shook her head you think all that now but youd know better then you wont want a wife to write novelsyoull want one to bake the bread and feed the chickens and make herself useful youll want the domesticated articleand im an artist i should be an encumbrance not a wife besides i should hate it all oh i know im hurting you but its true i should bore myself to death to write i need to live among men and women to live in london paris among other writers i want to see pictures and hear musicreal music not verdi and that kind of treacleand be in the movement perhaps by the time you wanted me to come to you i should be in the movementfive years is a long while and im going to work hard and you fancy i could turn my back on it all oh mr humphreys dont let us talk about it any more trying to steady his voice the young man asked may i write to you sometimes as a friend i think you had better not she said though her heart had jumped at the suggestion i havent any people whod care much about hearing from me he pleaded i shall be pretty humped over there at the start id promise faithfully not toerid write to you just as i might write to any other chum if i had one very well she assented write to me like that and ill answer he did not write quite like that but he suppressed twothirds of what he wanted to say and signed himself yours sincerely nobody could have found any definite endearment to object to in the pages though she checked the impulse to reply by the next mail she replied at considerable length she told him the latest details of the boardinghousethat mrs usher was looking seriously ill because she couldnt find out why mrs dunphy received so many telegrams and that because mrs kenyons husband wasnt able to come to england yet mrs wykes was suggesting that she hadnt a husband at all she told him that she had had enough of these awful people and that he was to direct his next letter elsewhere and always his next letter was awaited more eagerly than was consistent of a young woman who was quite sure that she preferred celebrity to love so although they did not write to each other more than twice or thrice a year they were still corresponding after both had made some progress the homestead was the mans own property at last and the woman had had a novel published she sent a copy of it to him with two or three of the best reviews it had been reviewed very highly and if the exclerk had sometimes questioned whether she mightnt be exaggerating her prospects his doubt was banished when he read the compliments that the critics paid her he grinned a little wryly in the solitude of the homestead yes it would have been a queer kind of life here for a woman of her talent i should bore myself to death like a knife through him when she said it of course he had not grasped then what the life would be if he had thoroughly divinedlooking back he wondered whether he would have found the pluck to tackle it himself that first awful year when he had ploughed a bit of wilderness craving in every hour for the sight of a girl in england well time worked wonders and his labours interested him now he pulled and viewed proudly a few heads of the wheat he had sown with his own hands jolly colour they were better than a clerkship no more london for him irene barton was finding it a tom tiddlers ground he supposed good luck to her oh of course she had done the sensible thing in refusing himand heaven be praised he wasnt broken up about it any longer one could get over any blow by way of thanks for the book he scribbled a friendly letter in which there was no endearment definite or indefinite to object to it implied that her choice had been a wise one and he congratulated her very cordially the letter was sincere he felt that it would give her pleasure and when it reached her and she read between the lines the womans heart sank and tears crept down her face he wondered mildly why he didnt hear from her any more the novel that the papers praised so warmly had enriched her by the sum of ten pounds and when she was five years older than she had been on the day she said goodbye to him she was writing in a boardinghouse much like the one where he had met her she remembered wistfully that within five years she had foreseen herself rejoicing in upper bohemia she wrote well she did not think as well as she wrote of courseher horizon was clouded by myths like those that have it that scots are all skinflints and jews are all roguesbut her work had beauty and critics saw it and she made a reputation but the general public did not see it or seeing the beauty were a channels width from perceiving that it was beautiful so she did not make money and without money she found a literary reputation was less ecstatic than she had presumed it did not mean congenial society because she could not afford to join the clubs where congenial society might be supposed to exist it did not mean concerts or picturegalleries or less physical discomfort or a breath of sea air when she was sick for it it did not mean a single amelioration of her lifes asperities because press notices were not to be tendered in lieu of cash even those who lauded her fiction remained strangers to her only for a few weeks after each book was issued she read in her boardinghouse attic that she was a distinguished novelist and then she was again ignored and meanwhile her youth was fading and her eyes were dimming and she looked in the glass and mourned in the emptiness of her distinction she longed for laughter and a home desperate at last she did join a club of professional women but nominal as the fees were considering the splendour of the place it was an annual effort for her to pay the subscription and she did not go there often enough to make any intimate friends because she was generally too tired and every year she grew more tired still when she had been growing tired for sixteen years she was in a dreary lodging in a dingy street toiling at a novel between the fashion articles by which she earned her daily bread mr humphreys in easy circumstances by this time was in london too though when memories awoke in her she pictured him in manitoba he was indulging in a trip and had been in england three weeks one afternoon in the hall of the new and expensive hotel he picked up a book and came upon her name among the publishers advertisements it was an advertisement of one of her shattered hopes but mr humphreys didnt know thathe merely saw her referred to as a distinguished novelist she was at the moment trudging from a modistes to a milliners to gather something to say in her inevitable article it was raining and she had a headache and she would have to hammer out a sprightly column about paris models before she could lie down his holiday was proving rather dull and he wondered idly whether it would be a foolish impulse to recall himself to such a prominent woman his formal note redirected by the publishers clerk and redirected again reached her some days later if you have not quite forgotten our old friendship i should be glad of an opportunity to call and congratulate you on your triumphs she read that line many times her face was white and her eyes were wide she looked again at the name of the expensive hotel and stared at the sordid parlour in which she satthe pitiable parlour with its atrocious oleographs on drab walls and two mottled vases from the teagrocers on the dirty mantelpiece he would be glad to congratulate her she remembered the unaffected cheeriness of the previous congratulations the letter that had shown her his love was dead she had fancied that nothing could hurt more deeply than that letter but she had been wrongto expose her mistake to him would be bitterer still the humiliation of it the punishment all the arrogance of her rejection all the boasts of her girlhood thronged back upon her tauntingly god if she could have seen aheadif only she could have her life again she debated her reply to say that she was leaving town would sound ungracious the alternative was to receive him at the club almost for the first time she was devoutly thankful to be a memberthe club would spare her the ignominy of revealing her parlour the stationery would avert the need for betraying her address on the imposing stationery she wrote that she would be pleased to see him here on either wednesday or thursday next her clothes she supposed wouldnt give her away as he was a man was he married there was no hint of a wife in his letter how much changed would she find him would the change in herself shock him greatly there were women as old as she who were still spoken of as young but their lives had run on smoother lines than hersand when he saw her last she had been twentytwo and sanguine it seemed to her that he would meet a stranger she trembled in the club on wednesday afternoon and began to hope that his choice would fall on thursday she was told that he had come she rose with an effort a big man with greying hair approached her uncertainly she smiled with stiff lips mr humphreys she faltered and a voice that she didnt remember a new deep voice that wasnt like jacks at all was saying why miss barton this is very kind of you how dye do so glad to see you again she murmured letlet us go and sit down her heart was thumping and she felt a little deaf soer well how does london look to you after such a long time are you home for good no about a couple of months my home is on the other side now well this is a real pleasure i never expectedi was rather nervous about writing but it would have been too bad if you hadnt she said well i thought id take my chance eryes london looks rather different i managed to get lost in it the other day i had to find a taxi to take me back no taxis when i was here before you take tea the alcove was very comfortable and the long room was exquisite in all its tones the beauty of the carpet she felt more than repaid her for that annual effort and how deferential was the service a fine place said mr humphreys admiringly yes its rather decent she drawled they do one very well here a club is one of the necessaries of life i suppose so he was remembering the way her tea had been served in the boardinghouse wealth buys more in the old country than over thereyou get more for your money than i do do you have to rough it very badly her tone was gentler are you still in the same place well i havent known i was roughing it of recent years but i dont see luxury like this in manitoba not bad and ive got a gramophone pretty rotten records im afraid verdi is about the most classical of them isnt it lovely how verdi reminds one she said if i hear verdi im about ten years old again andits funnyim always in the same bow window and its always a summers afternoon though i suppose the organs used to come in the winter too just as if i hear that hymn with pilgrims of the night in it its always the nursery and the gas over the mantelpiece is lighted verdi gives me my childhood back i hope to hear verdi in heaven youve nothing very dreadful to complain of then you arent sorry you went well noim glad i went it has panned out all right it has been a funny thing to walk down the strand again and remember that the last time i was in it i was short of sixpences the other day i looked in at the office where i used to clerk two of the boys i had known were there stillgrown roundshouldered and pigeonchested i suppose theyve had a rise of about fifty pounds a year in the meantime they came round to dinner at the hotel last night and it made me melancholy to hear them talk i used to want them to chuck the office and go out to canada with metheyd got the stamina oncebut they hadnt got the grit now its too late you know its capital to see you flourishing like this youre about the only survivor of the old days that it hasnt given me the hump to meet you always were sure youd get on werent you i was she said yes i used to say so do you remember the people in that house and how we used to groan about the extras in the bills it was a bad time for us both she stammered but its good to look back on now its over helps one to appreciate when youre feeling dull now you can drive round here and have a chat with a friend and say well it used to be much worsei used to be poor isnt that so she nodded helplessly her mind was strained to find another subject i wish youd come round to dinner with me one evening if youve nothing better to do im not going out very much just now she demurred i itd be a charity im all alone andby the way i dont know if miss barton is just your literary name now if there is a lucky man i hope he will give me the pleasure too no im not married she said like me youve been too busy you know i really think our victories should be feted itd be friendly of you to come you can find one evening free before i go back i suppose she said trying to laugh im not so full of engagements that i cant do that and though neither of them had foreseen the invitation she was pledged to dine with him heavily she reflected that when the dinner finished she would be obliged to ask him to send for a taxi and that it would probably cost her a halfcrown she went by train that her solitary evening gown was wrong having been bought three years since did not worry her though as lady veronica in her the autocrat at the toilettable column she wrote of things being hopelessly last seasons when their vogue had been declining for a week but she was embarrassed by her lack of evening shoes at the table she bore herself bravely supported by the knowledge that the epoch of her sleeves was unsuspected by him but when she rose she found it difficult to conceal her feet yet if it had not been that the shame of failure poisoned each mouthful that she took the evening would have had its fascination when she led him to speak of his early blunders on the homestead while he told her how he had shrunk dismayed from the first bleak sight of that patch of prairie she forgot she was pretending and forgot to feel abased in moments she even forgot to feel old the story of his struggles bore her back as she heard these things the greying man became to her again the boy that had loved herand as the woman leant listening the man caught glimpses of the girl that she had been his trip was proving queerly unlike his forecast of it on the farm when he packed his bags he had had no idea of seeing her but he had looked for emotions that he hadnt obtained the strangeness of sauntering on the london pavements as a prosperous man had been less exhilarating than his anticipation of it to drive to a fashionable tailors and order clothes had failed to induce a burst of high spirits though on the way he had laudably reminded himself that once it would have been the day of his life he was in fact feeling solitary and to loll in stalls at the theatres instead of being jammed in the pit would have seemed livelier to him if he had had a companion in the circumstances it was not astonishing that he proposed to take irene barton to the theatre a night or two laterand as he insisted a good deal she compromised with a matinee somehow or other he was having tea with her at the club again the day afterwards and on the day after that there was something else they had always found much to say to each other in the old daysthey found much to say now when the constraint wore off the man told himself that he felt a calm friendship for the woman whom he had once wanted for his wife and the woman told herself that since he would soon be gone shed snatch happy hours with the man she loved while he was here her philosophy had changed since she expounded it in the garden of the square and thenthe claims of the autocrat at the toilettable had compelled her to break an appointmentit manifested itself to mr humphreys that his feelings were not so calm as he had thought irritable in the hotel hall he perceived that this friendship threatened his holiday with a disastrous end he wanted no second experience of fevering in canada for a face in england grimly he decided that the acquaintance must be dropped if it came to that why remain in england any longer it was time for him to go on the morrow in another charming corner of the familiar club he told her his intention and she tried to disguise how much it startled her when she had hoped that he hadnt received bad news and he had said briefly that he hadnt there was a pause in his endeavour to be casual he had been curt and both were conscious of it he wondered if he had hurt her perhaps he should have offered an excuse for his sudden leavetaking he began to invent oneand she politely dismissed it he was certain now that he had hurt her after all why not be candid he leant forward and spoke in a lowered tone do you know why im going im going because if i stopped i should make a fool of myself again the cup in her hand jerked she felt suffocating voiceless not a word came from her im remembering that discretion is the better part of valour miss barton how do you mean she faltered im running away in time you see ii made a mistake i reckoned you wouldnt be dangerous to me any more and i was wrong so you wont think me ungrateful for going will you youve given me some very happy hours i dont want you to think i didnt appreciate them but i appreciate too the fact that youre a successful woman and that ive even less to hope for now than i had before i went through hell about you once deari couldnt stick it twice her hand was passed across her eyes and she trailed it on her skirt are you running away fromfrom my success if i cared for you do you think my success would matter do you care for me his voice shook like hers he hated the chattering groups about them as he bent conventionally over the teatable do you mean you could give your position up to be my wife she rose her lips twitched before her answer came it came in a whisper youve never seen my rooms will you drive me there and on the way she was very quiet the taxi stopped in a dingy street she took a latchkey from her pocket and opened a door from which a milkcan hung perplexed he followed she led him to a parloura pitiable parlour with atrocious oleographs on drab walls and two mottled vases on a dirty mantelpiece this she said dryly is where i live you see the celebrity at home he tried to take her to him and she drew swiftly back i have failed she cried no one has read my books im as poor as when you knew me first ive spent years in holes like this ive shammed to you because i was ashamed my talk of people i know of places i go to has been liesi know no one i go nowhere i refused to marry you when i was a girl because i didnt think it good enough for me before you stoop to ask me again go away and think whether its good enough for you ive lost my hopes my youth my looksyoud be giving me everything and i should bring you nothing in return his arms were quick now and they held her fast nothing he demanded his eyes challenged her nothing irene oh my dearest she wept smiling if my loves enough vi picq plays the hero when he had made his choice of a career when in spite of remonstrances he had become an actor his father had felt disgraced his father was the hatter in the rue de la paroisse the shop was not prosperousin villenogent people made their hats last a long whilebut it was at least a shop and the old man wished his son to be respectable this you see was france the little french hatter had not heard that across the channel the scions of noble houses turned actors and he would not have believed it if he had been told once the son of a little french tradesman humiliated his father by going on the stage and became the admiration of the world but this tradesmans son did not distinguish himself like that indeed he did not distinguish himself at all many years later the hatter patted the artists hand and said feebly after i am gone take a hat my poor olivier heaven knows thou needest one a hat and his blessing were wellnigh all he had to give by this time in his youthful dreamsdaydreams behind the counterolivier picq had seen himself a leading man in paris making impassioned love in the limelight to famous actresses his engagements had proved so different from his dreams that not once had he attained to the heros part even in the least significant of provincial holes no manager could be induced to regard him as a hero by slow degrees he had ceased to expect it by still slower degrees he ceased to expect even parts of prominence he was the fatuous valet who came on with the laughing chambermaid to explain what the characters that mattered had been doing between the acts he was the gaby that made inane remarks in order that the low comedian might reply with something funny he was the moody defaulter that committed suicide early in the pieceand he changed his wig alas not his voice to become the uninteresting figure that broke the tragic tidings to the widow ah says the reader he wasnt clever thats why he didnt get on well it is not pretended that picq had genius for such parts as fell to him he had not even marked ability but the truth is that in the role of romantic hero which he had not had a chance to play he would have been good the laughing chambermaid used to say he would have been splendid often they grieved over the bad luck that had attended him as they reviewed the years of struggle hand in hand he had married the chambermaid oh i can guess the end of this story already says the reader he became a leading man in paris after all so he did madam but not quite so felicitously as you may think picq dizzied by the sudden transformation was promoted to be the heroa gallant dashing boyin a revival on a paris stage one winter when he was subject to lumbago and fiftyeight years old you see most of the actors of military age that still lived were either in the line or the hospitals while many of the popular actresses were nursing a manager who had the temerity to cast a play now was in no position to be fastidious and playgoers were indulgent they accepted the elderly man as the gallant boy he was applauded and while he declaimed bombast across the footlightsthose turgid love appeals to which he had aspired behind the counter forty years agoit was with a heart torn with anxiety for his own boy who was in the trenches when jean had slept as a baby the utility actor and the chambermaid had sat by the cradle and talked in low tones of the fine things he was to do when he grew up not on the stageboth had outlived its glamour he was to be an advocate it is so refined dearest said the chambermaid and there is money in it my love agreed the father and for half a lifetime unflinchingly they had scraped and hoarded to realise that ambition for him their salaries were not vast and there were numerous vacations in which there was no salary at all often the sum that they had garnered during one tour would melt before the next but every hundred francs that they could stick to looked a milestone on the journey only one annual extravagance did they allow themselves on jeans birthday it was picqs custom to take home a bottle of cheap champagne the dinner might be meagre the vacation might be long but on jeans birthday they must be joyous and in a shabby lodginghouse bedrooma parlour was beyond the means of poor players who pinched to make their son an advocatethe pair would festively clink glasses to his future we have not been unhappy together all these years nanette my little wife though you did throw yourself away in marrying me hein picq would say tenderly embracing her and nanette who still looked almost as young sometimes as she had looked at the wedding breakfastat any rate picq thought sowould answer with a catch in her voice sweetheart i have thanked the good god on my knees every night for that throwing myself away all the same it is possible that without me you would have got on far bettereven have made a name silly it is more likely i who have held you back perhaps alone you would have gone to the top ah no i cannot bear to think it i cannot bear to think i have been a hindrance to you then picq denying it vigorously would cry but a fig for the stage ma foi have we not each other and our jean it is wealth enough i tell you he is going to be a famous man one day our jeanhe has the brow by rare good fortune when he was old enough to have ideas of his own on the subject of a career jean had not opposed their plan he did not as night easily have been the case inherit a craving to be the hero he had long been a student in paris and they were playing in a rural district remote from him on the day of the mobilisation never while life lasted would they forget that daythat beating on a tocsin and the glare of a blue sky that turned suddenly black to them the deathly silence that spread and then the shrill voice of a child the first to speakcest la guerre the shaking of their limbs held the father and mother apart only their gaze rushed to each other jean she had moaned and jean fought for france still and already it seemed to them that the war was eternal twiceon two anniversaries since that terrible saturdaythey had raised trembling glasses to a photograph on the wall and pretended to be gay and a third anniversary was approaching be confident be brave he wrote to them we are going to win but the thoughts that crowded on his little mother in the dark after she went to bed kept her awake for hours and marking the change that the war had wrought in her picqs misgivings for his wife were sometimes hardly less acute than his anxieties for his boy the laughing chambermaid who had retained girlishness of disposition for two decades after girlhood was past seemed to him all at once middleaged ever the first formerly to propose trudging a long distance to save a tram fare she was now fatigued after an hours stroll by the time they came to paris too she was subject to spells of some internal trouble which the doctor had failed to banish permanently there could be no question of her seeking an engagement it is a shame when the double salary would have been so nice she repined one evening the trouble had recurred and a new doctor had been no more definite than his predecessor we might have lived on my money and put the whole of yours aside every week it is a shame that you should have an invalid for a wife an invalid laughed picq affecting great amusement now is not that absurd to hear you talk one would imagine it was some terrible malady instead of a little derangement of the system that will pass and be forgotten very likely you will be in a show again before jeans birthday and it shall be a good part also parbleu there are not so many stars available today that they can afford to put on an artist like you to flick the furniture with a featherbrush listen nanette my best beloved if it were anything serious that you had the matter with you it would not right itself as it does from time to timeit would be always the same the fact that you are sometimes as well as ever shows that it is nothing organic have not both doctors said so did not the other man tell us so again and again she nodded forcing a smile her smile was girlish still and somehow it looked to him strangely poignant on her altered face his gaze was blurred as he muffled himself in his shabby cloak and set forth through the sleet to be the dashing hero a child came towards him calling papers and he thought if only the news were that germany sued for peace that would be the best medicine for her and on the morning before the birthday she was not in a show again she was feeling so much worse that she clung to picq alarmed picq was alarmed too though he tried to hide it look here i tell you what he exclaimed in the most confident tone that he could summon we are going to call in a big man and get you cured without any more delay thats what were going to do this chap is too slow for me i dare say his medicines might do the trick eventually but it does not suit me to wait so long no it does not suit me i am not going to see you worried like this while he potters about as if time were no object we shall call in a big man and put an end to the nuisance at once i wish to heaven i had done it before i am going now i am going to the chaps house to tell him plainly i am not content mais non mais non demurred nanette piteously it would cost such a lot cheriwhat are you thinking about i shall get all right without that you mustnt take any notice of me i am a cowardi have never been used to feeling ill you seebut i shall get all right without that i care nothing what it costs that is my intention declared picq and it will not cost such a great sum either anyhow whether it is forty francs or five hundred my mind is made up i am going to him this moment to tell him i want the highest authority in paris now be tranquil mignonne try to sleep we have chosen the shortest course at lastwe were bien betes not to take it at the startand in a week at the outside you will be yourself again never in her life had nanette contemplated spending forty francs all at once on a physician she knew she would be unable to sleep for the awfulness of such expense but if his prescription cured her promptly and she could earn a salary again soon what a weight i have become to thee my little husband she faltered stroking his hand hush thou wilt sleep while i am away pauvrette asked picq tenderly she closed her eyes smilingto lie and grieve over the weight she had become to him when he had gone and picq went apace to the doctors when the motive for the inopportune call was explained the doctor evidently resented the suggestion that his own treatment of the patient could be bettered another opinion monsieur parfaitementif you desire it his shrug was eloquent but your wife has only to continue with the medicine i have prescribed she has continued stammered picq she has continued there it isshe has continued for a long time i grow anxious no doubt it is unreasonable of me but truth to tell the veteran of the boards who faced a crowded auditorium without a tremor found himself nervous in the room of the dignified practitioner one must not expect miracles i am not a magician in such cases mais enfin another opinion would ease my mind if you would do me the great kindness to indicate a specialist monsieurthe best such a one as you would recommend if it werei do not know what it could be i but such a one as you would recommend if you feared something grave i should be thankful i know nothing of these things if you would be so very kind as to communicate with someone for me he withdrew after five minutes clumsily relieved to be able to tell nanette that with luck they might receive a visit from a specialist on the morrow and his chargehow much panted nanette who feared that such celerity might cost more still when the specialist had been on the morrowwhen picq had closed the street door after him and stumbled up the stairs in his hurry to rejoin nanette and sat down on the bed with his cheek resting against hersthey did not speak for some seconds well well he brought forth at last after all it is not so bad what it is a shock of coursei own it is a shock but really when one comes to think it over she moaneda child afraid dontdont an operation yes yes it is a shock we were hoping for an easy cure but when all is said we have learnt there is a cure if he had told us there was nothing to be done there is a cure and you will feel nothing mignonneyou will feel no pain at all and afterwards when you lie there at peaceso comfortable in the knowledge that all the misery is overi shall come every day and bring you flowers and every day i shall find you brighter and stronger upon my word i would not mind making a bet that in looking back at it you remember it as a happy time big tears were on her frightened face and it is jeans birthday she wailed yes it is unfortunate it cannot be helped well we shall have our fete when you come home instead andlisten listen we will drink his health at a restaurantwe will make up for the delay to the devil with the cost when you come home cured we will have a swagger supper out to celebrate the double event nanetteit is useless to expostulatei register a vow that this time we will squander a couple of louis on a supper on the boulevard and you shall put on your pink silk dress petit bonhomme wilt thou do me a favour she whimpered now thou art going to say something foolish no we will have that supper on the boulevard after the awful expense i shall have been two louis more or lessbut let us fete jean the same as usual tonight we must weve never missed doing it once since he was a baby i couldnt bear to let the day go by without our doing that think of the danger he is in get champagne as you always do if it would be bad for me i wont take any but get it my illness mustnt spoil the birthday altogether get it and well forget about me for an hour cheri i shall go into the hospital braver in the morning for having had our fete agreed agreed said picq chokingly but it will be a poor treat to me if i am to drink it alone i shall ask if you may take a sip he rang up the specialist to inquire on the way to the theatre in the evening it is our boys birthday monsieur he pleadedour boy who is in the war you see it is his birthday one glass of champagne yes it will do no harm said the authoritative voice but no excitement you understand and no solid food tomorrow and the next day they will see to her dietand the day after that we shall operate that word operate booming from the receiver struck horror to picq afresh he marvelled that anyone could be capable of uttering it so cheerfully as he went out into the streets again a child came towards him calling papers and he sighed if they but announced that germany sued for peace she would not be thinking so much about the operation then during the performance the bottle of paltry wine stood among the articles of makeup on the table of his dressingroom and in his wait in the last act he sat staring at it and thinking of the days when his boy in the ieme regiment territorial had been a tiny child and the wife who was so ill had been all sunshine and laughter it had not been withheld from him on the doorstep in the morning that the operation would be a serious one and he felt sick in contemplating the next three days suspense how would nanette contrive to bear it he wondered away from him among strangers in a hospital when the fearful moment came for her to be carried from the ward to the operating table cold sweat burst out on him as he sat huddled there in the garish dressingroom picq prayed to heaven to give her courage his chin was sunk on his chest he rocked to and fro there was a sudden rap at the door entrez said picq and somebody brought him a telegram he read i have the pain of informing you of the death on the field of honour of your son jean picq it was from the war office better hurry up picqyou havent too long called a colleague carelessly looking in good god and he sprang towards him picq staggered from his colleagues arms up the crazy staircase to the wingsand straightened his back to be dashing he entered upon the scene in time and he delivered his lines and struck his attitudes and paused by force of habit when a round of applause was due at the climax of a tirade when he took a step back and mechanically raised his gaze to the first circle nobody would have supposed that with his minds eye he looked through the tier of faces on the mangled body of his son the curtain fell again the play was over and he tottered back to the room the bottle of champagne on the dressingtable among the litter of makeup was the first thing he noticed my wife gasped picq and broke down he was shaken by sobs some of the players had followed sympathy surrounded him i see her face when i tell heri see her face how to keep it from her tonight she mustnt knowit would kill her but to keep it from her for weeks till she has recoveredis it possible poor chap be brave time they mumbled useless words to have to pretend to her every time i go for weeks perhaps months and then when she is so happy at being well again to have to strike her down with the blow ah i know i am not the only father to lose his sonshe is not the only mother but you dont think it might be best to break it to her now someone suggested he shook his head impatiently the throbbing head from which the jeune premiers curls were not removed yet it would be murder i am warned she is to avoid excitement and this evening when she tries to be bright to go in and say he is killed i mustnt tell her till she is wellquite quite well i must keep her cheerful i must be in good spirits buti havent the courage to go home it was the truth he had not the courage to go home she is waiting for mei must make haste to change he faltered more than once but even when he had changed at last his soul cowered before the thought of the ordeal and he lingered nerveless in the chair she is waiting for mei must go he kept repeating while the lights in the theatre went out i must go he said again and rose they had called a cab for him and his legs felt so unreliable that he offered no protest though a cab seemed a terrible extravagance yes he would take one it was certain he could not walk fast enough to make up for the delay and nanette mustnt be allowed to grow anxious he lay back in the cab dizzily a hand round the neck of the bottle on his knees in good spiritsin good spirits he cautioned himself but her instinct is so strong if she suspects on the rattling course imagination wrung him with the moment of her suspicionthe horror in her dilating eyes the impuissance of his agony dead he perceived with a shock that he had not understood that jean was deadthat he still did not understand dead jean who seemed so vividly alive was only a memory his eagerness his laughter his allusions all the intimate realities that represented jean had been blown out it was inconceivable his mind would not grasp it where then did comprehension he that he was stricken the cab startled him by stopping as he had said she was trying to be bright she had not cast her fears aside but she meant to hide them she welcomed him with a smile champagne and a cab what next yes what do you think of it i was in a hurry to get back how has it been with you cheriehas the evening seemed very long well there is good newsyou may have a glass he was sure he said yes at once oh i wouldnt have tried to persuade himthat would have been folly i told him the reason but i did not try to persuade him how tired you look how did it go it was a good audiencewhat there was of it three calls after the third act what an appetite ive gotand what a thirst i cant wait to take my boots off the spread attracts me what i declare i see my favourite sausage i couldnt go out for any flowers this year and i forgot to remind you she said but youll find enough to eat and youwhat is there for you let me put the pillow behind you mignonne and now to open the bottle i am not an expert at the game butah it is coming prepare yourself for the bang tiens it is of a gentle disposition but no doubt it will taste just as good sapristi how it sparkles he bore a glassful to her side and their gaze turned together to the likeness on the wall well little wife the usual toast to our boy our darling jean may god bless him may god bless him breathed the mother they looked at the photograph silently for a moment i wonder if he is thinking of us she murmured perhaps he is fancying us like this i venture to say so replied picq he knows we should never forget his birthday he knows that ifhe is alive she said in a whisper ah why should we doubt it his arm encouraged her how often we have alarmed ourselves and always he was alive take another sip mignonne it is a sound wine hein i should not be surprised if on the boulevard they charge fifteen francs for such a wine you must go and sit down now and have your supper not for a minute or two the bouquet is so excellent i cant take my nose out of the glass and i think i am more thirsty than hungry after all petit bonhomme petit bonhomme she faltered pitifully and why petit bonhomme like thatwhat are you making so much of me about do you think i am blind do you suppose you can hide it from me your hands tremble and your eyes are red as soon as you came in i saw you have been tormenting yourself about the operation all the evening mais non mais non if i worry it is not about the operation because it is a simple thing though it sounds so big to us they tell me it is an everyday affair like having out a tooth that was his very expression monsieur it is no more dangerous than having out a tooth i worry if i worry at all in thinking that you are frightened if i could only make you believe that there is nothing to be frightened of i know i am a coward i told you so it is from you that he gets his courage what an illusion a fine fireeater i am old stickinthemud ah yes im ashamed when i think of what he is going throughhow splendidly he bears it and here am i afraid of everything he has no heroine for a mother i forbid thee to say it he knows it is not true he loves me just the same dont you jeanyou dont love your little mother any less the photograph hung too high for her take it down she pleaded if i could change places with thee my son i would find the courage for that though i died of terror in the first hour ah my little baby my little baby and i was so glad he was a boy you are not to upset yourself quavered picq i cannot stand it will you be sorry he was a boy when he gets the croix de guerre i make you a bet they give him

son we drink to your future a bumper to our next merry meeting that toast reverberated to picq when she lay sleeping and picq was sleepless but at any rate she had no suspicion so far she remained without suspicion when he visited her at the hospital during the following week but always she remained a prey to fear not for herself nowthey said the operation had been successful it was the thought of jeans peril that haunted her as she was wakened in the early morning the burden of dread rolled upon her through the long monotonous day her mind was in the bloodsoaked line more often than in the ward they hinted to picq that her anxiety was detrimental and he tried to reason with her once but it seemed to do more harm than good for she burst out if he should be killed and wrung her hands on the quilt he has everything before him hes so fond of life if he should be killed he will not be killed is not my love for him as great as yours and you see i am confident i swear to you i am confident i implore you dont dwell on these thoughts make haste and get well and again he asked himself how am i to break it to her when she is well then there was a morning when they sent him away for a while stupefied by the announcement that never would she be well the conditions had changed he must be prepared for the worst she too had been prepared before he was admitted he had foreseen her speechless with fright but strange to say the coward who had been so timorous of an operation had spoken of her approaching death quite calmly her terror for jean it was increasingly her terror for jean that tortured her last hours petit bonhomme it is like being on the rack she had gasped if only i were sure he would be spared god of heaven it is like being on the rack for her shuddered picq sobbing in the street it is for her like being on the rack and there is nothing i can do and a child came towards him calling papers it was with the connivance of the nurses that he brought joy and thanksgiving to her heart during the hours that remained to her he pretended to her that germany sued for peace if he was condemned to affect the tones of hysterical rejoicing he had no need to counterfeit the tears tears were rolling down his cheeks as he feigned to fight for mastery of a whirlwind of exultance and panted to her that the war was won i return with good newsthe greatest but i implore thee keep stillthey forbid thee to sit up nanette my loved one our boy is safe the danger is all overhe will soon be home the boches are beaten i rush back to tell thee they cave in paris has

breathed smiling she seemed to grow younger during the afternoon before she died and though she knows now it was a he said picq when they had crossed her hands on her breast it is no disappointment to her since she has him with her now vii a flat to spare at the corner of the rue baba stands the maison severin with its board announcing furnished flats to let one december evening a journalist went to call upon a colleague there as he climbed the last flight of stairs a door was opened violently and a gesticulating female appeared she shrieked defiance over her shoulder pulled down her sleeves and descended with such precipitance that she nearly butted jobic over the banisters dodging her by a miracle jobic entered unannounced your domestic seems to be perturbed my dear pariset he remarked tiens you said the young widower panting yes she has returned her apron she has resigned the situation that devila situation that offered unsurpassed opportunities for pillage i am left with the dinner unprepared and the twins to put to bedand i ought to be at batignolles by eight oclock you should marry again said jobic i cannot do it in the time mon dieu just because i mentioned that it was unintelligent of her always to keep the empty wine bottles among the full ones it took me a quarter of an hour to get hold of anything to drink you may tell a bonne that she is an inveterate liar without disturbing her in the least you may say that she is an habitual thief and she will accept the truism placidly but insinuate that she is a fool and her vanity is in arms at once what has brought you here i come to borrow a louis visionary spendthrift what do you do with your salary then the fact is your rent is an extravagance and you spend far too much in dressing up your babies for some time i have had the intention of remonstrating with you on the subject if you exercised reasonable economy you would be in a position to lend me a louis on your head i am but the monotonous fatigues me to attain the charm of variety i propose to lend you nothing at all i tell you what howeveri can provide you with a job for putting twins to bed my lowest figure is five francs i will cook the dinner for forty sous and an invitation to share it the tenders are declined listen you may go to batignolles and write a column around a communist meeting for me the kiddies are too young for me to leave them by themselves and i have been counting on this affair to supply material for my causerie in tomorrows echo communist meeting exclaimed jobic with distaste i do not believe i could borrow any more money under communism than i can now are we discussing your beliefs has your welfare the remotest interest for me all i ask of you is to fill a column bring the stuff for me to sign before you sleep and i will pay you your own price for it cash cash its a deal said jobic some sprightly copy is as good as on your desk your editor will not fail to note a vast improvement in your literary style it was in these circumstances that lecho du quartier contained a column over parisets pen name of valentin vance that drove the prettiest communist in paris to tears of fury for not only did the writer burlesque her impassioned speech not only did he poke fun at her theories and deride her elocutionhe actually made unflattering comments upon her personal appearance not since she embraced the cause six months ago had suzanne duvivier read anything to compare with it if i were a married woman she raged my husband should call the monster out for such insults and then since she was an accomplished pupil at one of the bestknown salles for instructing the fair parisienne to fence it occurred to her that the lack of a husband was no drawback though there were pressing domestic matters to claim her this morning she betook herself to kindred spirits and burst in upon them to demand their services mais ma chere gasped mademoiselle tisserand and mademoiselle lagarde we have never acted as seconds in a duel never we implore you to dismiss the notion we counsel you to treat the abuse with the silent scorn that it deserves the man might run you through your valiant heart do we shirk danger we communists cried suzanne dear comrade the cause cannot spare you moreover every novel with a duel in it that we have ever read makes it clear that it is the privilege of the party challenged to choose the weapons this monsieur vance might choose pistols the novels again indicate that it devolves upon the seconds to load the pistols and we have never done such a thing in our lives it may also be that you have never handled one yourself for a moment suzanne duvivier quailedshe was only twentyfive and normally no swashbuckler if monsieur vance did choose pistols she knew very well she would have to shut her eyes as she fired then the obloquy of the column overwhelmed her anew and she flung timidity to the winds we must hope for the best girls she said resolutely if you are my pals you will not desert me in this hour i fight for the cause far more than for myself i do not know precisely what phrases you should employconsult the novelsbut the first thing to be done is for you to present yourselves to the man and desire him to name the day you had better not say name the day because that has another association but he must fix the date if you can contrive to suggest that i hanker after pistols perhaps he will say swords au revoir my friends bear yourselves firmlylook as if you were used to it wear serious hats she departed to put in half an hours practice at the fencing school and mademoiselle lagarde moaned to mademoiselle tisserand it is terrible is it not however we need not make frumps of ourselves i suppose i wonder if my toque would be inappropriate not the least in the world said mademoiselle tisserand what do you think of my hat with the bird of paradise she is right as regards our demeanour thoughwe must be deadly calm let us remember that the dignity of communism is at stake the brute must not be allowed to guess that we are afraid a couple of hours later pariset after struggling with a fire that refused to be lit and breakfasting without any coffee and dressing his twins with some of their underlinen back in front gave the concierge a tip to let him leave them in her loge and went forth to the echo building anathematising his exdomestic with continuous fervour on the way arrived there he found two young women strenuously inquiring for the address of monsieur valentin vance you behold him mesdemoiselles said pariset what can i have the honour of doing for you the young women looked embarrassed it is you who are the author of this article monsieurthis infamous calumny queried the plumper of the two oh exclaimed pariset taken aback oh i am speaking to mademoiselle suzanne duvivier no monsieur i am not mademoiselle duvivier neither of us is mademoiselle duvivier but we inquire if you are the monsieur vance who is the author of this article welleryes certainly i am the author of it the pair conferred a moment in undertones the one in the toque gave the one with the bird of paradise a slight push then monsieur i have the honour to inform you that we are the bearers of a challenge from the lady you have slandered a challenge stammered pariset what do you say is this a joke you will find it very far from a joke put in mademoiselle lagarde strategically our principal is a crack shot in that case you may be sure i shall not choose pistols said pariset with a smile ah breathed the girl dissembling her elation you choose swords no matter no demurred pariset i do not choose swords either butnot swords either what then i choose roses i am a champion with roses and i have the right to avail myself of my skill monsieur cried her companion peremptorily we shall not be patient with pleasantries nor i with hysteria mademoiselle comment do you figure yourself i am going to fight a woman you must be demented you refuse to meet her pointblank on the pretext of convention on the score of manhood your manhood did not restrain you from attacking her was it so bad the attack faltered pariset who had not done much more than glance at jobics masterpiece pshaw sneered both the girls as nearly as their ejaculation can be spelt shame how perfectly disgusting you insult a lady and then refuse her satisfaction it is the act of a coward ah oh listen volleyed pariset i will not meet her if you go on saying ah and oh till you are black in the face but to cut it short she shall have her satisfaction i will cross swords with any man that she appoints as her deputy all is said i await the gentlemans representatives mesdemoiselles bonjour and now i have got a duel on my hands as well as two babies in my arms he reflected jobic is an imbecile why did i trust him that sacree bonne her desertion is giving me a fine time i should like to wring her neck he spent a feverish afternoon at registry offices suzanne was exasperated too the news of the demand for a deputy was a heavy blow for she couldnt think of anybody likely to oblige her vainly she reviewed the list of her male acquaintances none seemed to possess all the necessary qualities ineligible herself and unable to find a substitutewhat a dilemma the more provoking because scattered throughout france must breathe several heroic spirits who would have been willing to fight for a nice girl and the guerdon of her gratitude but she was reluctant to advertise duellist wanted with a portrait of her attractions she was removing on the morrow to a furnished flat and it had been her intention to supervise the removal of some of its dust this morning late in the afternoon she ran round to see how matters had progressed without her a damsel from a registry office in the quarter had undertaken to commence the work punctually at am the flat was in the maison severin all unconscious that she was to dwell beneath the same roof as the villain she had challenged suzanne ascended sanguine of seeing the clean curtains up the damsel hadnt put in an appearance either she had received an offer more to her taste or she had decided to prolong her vacation there had been no message to explain her caprice suzanne sped to the registry office tumultuously the bureau de placement des deux sexes was presided over by a very large woman at a very small table three of the four employers present were excited ladies complaining of bonnes who had arranged to take service with them but who had neither arrived nor written the fourth was a personable gentleman awaiting his turn in an attitude of the deepest despondence suzanne sat on the bench by the gentlemans side while the fat woman strove to appease the three ladies next please she said eventually monsieur desires suzanne heard that monsieur desired a capable bonne a tout faire at once and that by at once he did not mean a fortnight hence or even the following dayhe meant now the proprietress said mechanically that she would see what could be done and asked for five francs dont you believe it said the gentleman am a widower and know the ropesi might part with five francs and remain servantless for a month produce a servant trot one of your treasures out let me get a grip of it and take it away with me and i will pay you tenfifteen francs but it happens that there is no servant on the premises this afternoon monsieur is not reasonable he should comprehend that i cannot show him what i have not got it is equally comprehensible madame that i cannot pay for what i do not see next please said the fat woman shrugging her shoulders madame began suzanne vehemently i must ask you to find another femmedemenage for me immediately if you pleaseyour angelique that i settled with here has never turned up there you are cried pariset everybody says the same thing mais monsieur snorted the proprietress your affair is finishedthe business of mademoiselle does not concern you pardon madame my affair is not finished on the contrary my need is dire i have offspring who clamour for female ministrations voyons mademoiselle will accept my apologies they are superfluous monsieur said suzanne acknowledging his bow but madame my case is urgent i go into my new appartement in the morning and there is nobody there yet to shake a mat or light a fire and what a job it is to light a fire put in pariset with fellow feeling the life they lead us these bonnes responded suzanne above all mademoiselle when one has two little children and is without experience figure yourself my confusion dreadful monsieur i can imagine it what do you expect me to say to you you two shouted the fat woman banging the table i tell you that there is no bonne waiting just now am i le bon dieu to create model domestics out of the dust on the office floor and at this instant the door opened and there entered briskly a comely wench wearing an apron and no hat ah gasped pariset and suzanne together ah exclaimed the fat woman jubilant everything arranges itself now i know this one i recommend her you can take a place today marceline good it is forty francs a month as usual and you sleep in hein fifty and i sleep outwith my aunt said marceline promptly seizing the circumstances i agree announced the eager clients in a duet mais monsieur remonstrated suzanne dismayed mais mademoiselle expostulated pariset enfin take her i yield her to you my children pine for her care but we will suffer i am averse from appearing selfish monsieur ah chivalry forbids that i wrench this unique boon from your arms mademoiselle no she is for monsieur said suzanne in a burst of magnanimity the proprietress picked up her pen monsieur resides no matter i renounce my claim in favour of mademoiselle the proprietress dipped the pen in the inkpot mademoiselle goes to the maison severin nest ce pas what cried pariset the maison severin it is at the maison severin you have taken a flat mademoiselle why that is my address too what storey are you on the fourth and i listen an idea a compromise if you would be so generous might you not lend her to me now and then but everything arranges itself repeated the fat woman joyously mademoiselle and monsieur can share her to perfection marceline you would render service in two little appartements on the same floor that is worth more money said marceline and proceeded to estimate the suggestion at a monstrous figure however her views were modified at last the fat woman made entries in a tattered book suzanne heard the gentleman give his name as monsieur henri pariset pariset did not hear the lady give her name because the proprietress of course knew it already far from suspecting each others identity the challenger and the challenged exchanged cheerful smiles then marceline was prevailed upon to fetch her box forthwith and the elated journalist and the charming girl who thirsted for his blood bore their domestic gaily to the rue baba together how things happen said pariset as they went along nest ce pas said she all the same my flat cannot be got ready by the morning now i dont see why not my own share of her this evening will be slight let her put my babies to bed at once and then you can have all you want of her as to my dinner i will eat at a restaurant ah mais non if it is not your custom said suzanne she can manage your dinner all rightshe will have no cooking to do for me i am at a pension de famille till tomorrow and as they reached the house the concierge remarked by way of welcome it is not unfortunate that you have returned monsieur your twins have been disturbing the whole district but they are adorable your twins exclaimed suzanne with genuine admiration for now they were tranquil and beamed i cannot pretend to know whether they are big or small for four years old but they are darlings not bad said pariset who thought the world of them himself well then when marceline has tucked them up she shall come to you straightway and it is agreed that you are to monopolise her as long as you like half an hour passed monsieur cried marceline reappearing eh bienyou cannot find the childrens nightgowns si si the little ones sleep but the compliments of mademoiselle and would monsieur be so amiable as to lend her the featherbrush from his broomcupboard take all she wants how goes it opposite there is enough for two persons to do i dont doubt it said pariset inquire of mademoiselle whether i can be of any assistance but on second thoughts he was prompted to put the question himself in a long blue apron with her sleeves rolled up she told him that he couldnt and he took off his coat and got to work what a sweeping and a polishing there was nine oclock had struck when he began to hang the curtains and the dinner at the pension de famille was a thing of the past evidently mademoiselle he said from the top of a stepladder you also will have to dine out this evening what do you say to leaving marceline to put the finishing touches now and taking nourishment in my company monsieur returned suzanne you dizzy me with your neighbourly kindness if you can turn round without risking your neck however you will note that marceline is absent she is engaged in improvising a meal for us and i beg you to accept my invitation enchanted only as you are still somewhat at sixes and sevens here may i propose that you invite me to my own flat instead of yours so it befell that the bouillon brought hot in a can from the little greengrocers across the road was served at parisets table and marcelines omelette created while the cutlets were frizzling on the grille proved to be delicious our bonne remarked the widower complacently might be worse hein i was thinking the same thing assented suzanne it seems to me that we have done very well for ourselves you smoke a cigarette it is one of my consolations i hope that i may be privileged to see you console yourself here often and if you ever have leisure to call upon me cor le feeve oclock monsieur i shall be charmed you can hardly excuse yourself on the plea that my address is too remote believe me said pariset i warmly felicitate myself on the address if i may say so i am daring to foresee a friendship and it would be very welcome for i lead a lonely life i too she sighed i am a painter i am a communist but all the same i am alone ah you are a painter and communist hein we shall have subjects to talk about you are surprised i am above all surprised to hear that you are alone it is difficult to realise how that can be it is true i assure you only today i had the strongest need of a mans arm to render me a service and i could think of no one to ask there are a couple of arms here announced pariset displaying them in an heroic gesture and doughty deeds they have just accomplished for me she laughed no but seriously he urged oh seriously the service that i speak of is far too big for even the best of new friends you are wrong without having heard it i venture to pronounce it just the right size how sincere you are and how i appreciate your earnestness she exclaimed but it is out of the question i have not yet proved myself worthy of your confidence he regretted sentimentally i understand if you imagine it is thatdeep reproach was in her gazei must explain have you heard of a journalist called valentin vance yes well i sent him a challenge today and he answered that i must find a deputy pariset sat dumfounded twice he essayed to articulate without producing so much as a monosyllable at last he stuttered you are mademoiselle suzanne duvivier i had no idea how stupid of me you have read his article welleri have still not had time to read it very attentively but i have heard a good deal about it ah then you do not wonder at my resentment she cried and though the twins forbade her to jeopardise his life she hoped to hear him gallantly offer to fight monsieur vance this was just what pariset could not do after his boasted avidity to execute the service he must wear an air of funking it his embarrassment was intense constraint fell upon them both disillusion clouded her eyes she had begun to like him so much it grieved her to see him turn tail after some very painful seconds he faltered you are disappointed in me disappointed oh yes i seem to you a braggart who has backed out of his boast yet i assure you i am not to blame you seek the one service in the world that i am utterly unable to perform monsieur replied the girl coldly your parental duties are so obviously paramount that it is unnecessary to remind me of them oh as to that one does not expect more than a scratch in a duel so it is not from parental reasons that i say it cant be done the reasons are physical i cannot meet monsieur vance because i shall sink lower in your esteem with every word i cannot meet him because enfin valentin vance is i you she had started to her feet my pen name the silence was awful she leant on the back of the chair for support then with a dignity that he felt to be superb she said monsieur as a tenant i thank you for your cooperation as a communist i ask permission to retire ah i implore you to listen raved pariset it is strange she added more spontaneously that since you found me so hideous on the lecture platform you put yourself out to be so agreeable to me at the registry office i i find you hideous vociferated pariset it was not i who wrote it not a single word was mine believe me my bonne flounced off last night and the twins kept me at home i entrusted the job to a dunderheaded confrere ah mon dieu since i found you hideous the spirituality of your face is an inspiration i admire you with all my heart yes i shall confess it with all my heart i love you do not condemn me for a column that i did not perpetratebe merciful be tender i will write others that you shall approve you shall instruct mei will gather wisdom from your lips yes at your feet on our hearth i will learn from you i will become a disciple of communismthe mouthpiece of your cause i will consecrate my pen to your service my pen shall annihilate your opponents though my sword could not chasten monsieur vance his arms entreated her suzanne the appartement of mademoiselle is completely ready proclaimed marceline she rushed in and out again triumphant it appears to me i shall not need it long smiled suzanne surrendering to his embrace viii a portrait of a coward every sunday mrs findon went with her two stepdaughters to the cemetery and put flowers on the grave every sunday since her husbands death she had done soevery sunday for four years excepting during the month of august which was passed in the unattractive village where his widowed sister lived when the melancholy walk was over and they had returned to the house the misses findon used to sit on either side of the fireplace moisteyed and slightly pink about the noses speaking at long intervals in subdued tones and their young stepmother would gaze from the window wondering whether the pretence of mourning a husband she had not loved was to be her lot for life when she was twenty her father had said to her belle mr findon wants to marry you dont look like that he is much older than you are of course and it isnt the ideal but what have you got to look forward to im a pauper and we both know i cant last much longer and when ive gone youll be all alone how are you to live youll be left with about fifty pounds and waste some of that on crape its a ghastly thing for me to lie here and know youll soon be destitute hes decent enough in a dull way and if you were to marry him i should feel i had a right to die so she had married him and mr findon had endeavoured to mould her disposition to his requirements he moulded so much that it seemed to her he must lament that she wasnt an entirely different person and she wondered why he had asked her to be his wife the provincial town to which he took her was depressing and the furniture and ornaments of his house made her want to shriek and the people who paid her visits never mentioned any subject that had any interest for her more dejecting than the visitors were her stepchildren to the two colourless schoolgirlsamy fourteen years of age mildred nearly sixteenshe had turned eagerly turned achingly because no child of her own came to lighten the gloom and for long she had striven to believe that the slowness of their minds was due to their environment they need waking up she would think and exhausted herself in efforts to make them fluent but she found that nothing that was done could make them fluent and as they grew older she found that nothing that was said could make them laugh they laughed only when the wind blew somebodys hat off they were sandy undemonstrative girls and they had manifested no great affection for their father till he died suddenly five years after the marriage then however the words dear father were for ever on their lips and a strain of unsuspected sentiment in their nature had opposed itself morbidly to the slightest departure from any domestic arrangement that he had desired she still remembered amys pained stare and mildreds startled i dont think dear father would have liked that when she had diffidently proposed to transfer a huge photograph of his mother from the drawingroom wall to the spare bedroom she still reproached herself for her compliant oh i wont then of course it was among the first of the concessions that had made the house seem to her a sepulchre by her stepdaughters wish nothing had been altered in his studynot the position of an armchair or of the footstool even to the pipes on the table and a gumbottle on the mantelpiece the room which was never used now remained as he had left it last and every morning for four years she had accompanied mildred and amy solemnly to the threshold and regarded the armchair and the pipes with an air of reverence and afterwards sat down to breakfast thinking that the girls looked as if they had been to the funeral over again at the beginning if she had not shrunk from wounding them she might have hinted that that piece of hypocrisy was horrible to her now she could do so no more than she could hint that she did not want to feign bereavement in the cemetery every sunday or to take an annual change that was made doleful by the triteness of aunt harriet and the presence of her invalid son at the age of fiveandtwenty the gentleness and weakness of the woman had committed her to act a lie at the age of twentynine the woman reflected miserably that unless her stepdaughters married she would have to act the lie for life the oppressive thought was no new oneand she had asked stupid people to dinner and accepted invitations to wearisome households she had urged mildred and amy to join the golf and tennis clubs though they were apathetic about golf and tennis and she usually took them to london to buy their frocks instead of to the local high street but girls less becomingly dressed had got married and no young man had paid any attentions to mildred or amy though mildred was but twentyfive and amy only twentythree both had already the air of girls destined for spinsterhood sometimes as she regarded their premature primness she found it impossible to suppose that proposals would ever come to them impossible to picture either of the staid angular figures in a mans arms timidly once when her dread of a lifetime spent in beckenhampton had grown unbearable she had nerved herself to suggesting a removal dont you think we should find it brighter to live somewhere else she had pleaded in london we should have concerts and pictures and things london amy had faltered with dismay oh no i shouldnt like that at all well it neednt be london then but there are nicer towns than this what do you think mildred im sure we could none of us be as happy as we are at home said mildred in a shocked voice it would seem dreadful to leave the home where dear father used to be with us and the little stepmother her hope extinguished had found herself murmuring yes of course there is that i know the terms of their fathers will had made the house more theirs than hers it seemed to her that she lacked the right to persist even if she could have felt sanguine of persistence prevailing but what she lacked most of all of course was courage she was goodnatured she was charming she had some beautiful qualities but she was without the force of mind to oppose anybody she was a tender lovable and exasperating coward that is to say she would have been exasperating if there had been anyone to regret her cowardice anyone to care much whether she was miserable or not and then one summer after mildred had influenza the doctor recommended harrogate instead of the dismal villageand the possibility of harrogate yielding husbands to the girls quickened the womans heart in the season there among so many menmightnt there be two to find mildred and amy congenial it was she not they who pondered so carefully and paid so much for the morning afternoon and evening dresses in which they lagged about a fashionable hydro a fortnight later it was she not they who knew a throb of hope when either of them danced twice monosyllabically with the same partner and who welcomed their opportunity to play in an amateur performance with its attraction of daily rehearsals i dont think we care much for acting amy demurred i think we would rather look on like you dr roberts said that mildred needed to be taken out of herself if you dont go in for it she wont oh i should say yes it is sure to be a lot of fun you know i dont think that mildred and i care much for fun demurred amy however the misses findon attended the rehearsalswith the dramatic instinct possessed by pasteboard figures on a toy stage and blankly their stepmother noted that though young men were ambitious of polishing their scenes in alcoves at various hours with other girls no young mans histrionic fervour urged him to any spontaneous polishing with mildred or amy the thing that did happen at harrogate was unlookedfor a man displayed considerable interest in mrs findon herself they had spoken first in the hall where he was sitting when she came out of the breakfastroom with the girls one morning and on subsequent mornings they had all loitered for ten minutes in the hall and then when the rehearsals prevented mildred and amy from loitering she had paused awhile without them one day when the rehearsal took place after luncheon she was surprised to find that she had sat talking to him the whole afternoon but though their tone had long since grown informal and they talked spontaneously though he had told her he was in the last fortnight of his leave from india and spoken of his prospects of a judgeship there she did not realise how far their acquaintance had progressed until he said to her you dont look like a happy woman and yet it doesnt sound to me as if your husband had been all the world to you if it isnt the loss of your husband thats weighing on you whats the matter she gazed at him startled and still stranger to her than the boldness of his question was the intimacy of her reply after she had made it mr murray im not a happy woman from that moment they were not acquaintancesthey were friends piecemeal he learnt her story and perceived the weakness of her character and their confidences were more frequent and prolonged after a hurried letter from aunt harriet saying that her dear boy had passed away and that it would help her to bear her cross if dear mildred and amy would go to her for two or three days a week slid by and they were with her still and meanwhile mr murray and mrs findon fell in love with each other it was her first breath of romance a fathers ailments encompassing her girlhood had excluded sentimental episodes to marriage she had been moved by nothing but docility she would soon be thirtyand for the first time she found a strange pulsating promise in the birds twittering when she woke lingered at a lookingglass and turned back to it that a man might approve she eyed intently times touches on her face noting with new sensitiveness that it showed her age she knew for the first time restlessness if one man was absent and if he was present knew impatience of all others who were present too and she sparkled at her own blitheness and but for the recurring thought that it would all be over soon she lived in eden for a week they had been speaking of her stepdaughters and he had said the first time i saw you with them i wondered what the relationship was you cant have much in common with them you must have hoped to see them marry havent you do you think they will she asked oh i dont know it doesnt follow because one finds no charm in a girl oneself that nobody else will find any ive known men crazy about women that i wouldnt have turned my head to look atand men that were by no means fools isnt there anybody in beckenhampton there arent many chances for a girl in beckenhampton besides they dont care for young mens societythats one of the reasons why men dont find much to say to them i think i hoped something might come of their staying here but but a man has wanted to talk to you instead could she control her voice oh thats a different thing why is it a different thing i meant that i hoped it might lead to something for themi wasnt thinking of friendship im not thinking of friendship your friendship wouldnt be much use to me out there i want you to be my wife will you they were in the garden after dinner from the ladies orchestra in the hall came the barcarolle from the tales of hoffmann in sentiment she was in her teens i cant she said in a whisper im so fond of you do you know ive never heard your name she told him her name belle id be so good to you dont you like me she turned to him no one could see them the first kiss of her first lovemoonlight and the barcarolle though she did not recognise it there was a single instant in which she was capable of any weakness but she was not capable of strength i cant she repeated how can i to marry again i couldnt say such a thing to them what would theyi couldnt do it i dont understand you cant marry me because they wouldnt like it you dont mean that or is it because you dont think you ought to leave them both butgood heavens besides theres this aunt theyve gone tothey could live with her you arent telling meyou cant mean you wont marry me because you imagine its your duty to sacrifice our happiness for the sake of two young women you dont care about you know you dont care about them its mad i need you more than

if the young women had returned then they did not however return at all next morning the post brought from them the news that they felt too sad to find harrogate congenial now and that they would rather be at home they were going back to beckenhampton the day after tomorrow it meant that her precious hours here were numbered she showed the letter disconsolately to murray i shall have to go this afternoon she said i dont see what fori dont see why you should be dragged away at a minutes notice youre not a child to be sent for oh i must go she sighed i must get there before them to see to

believe id like itits time you did a little tyrannising i cant kiss you darling because somebodys coming down the stairs but look at me and lets pretend downcast as she felt as the train bore her from him she felt firm she could not view the ordeal before her as lightly as hehe did not understand she told herself it was natural that he shouldntbut she was resolved to meet it without delay and to be bold in the face of the consternation she foresaw how easy it would have been but for the insincerities she had been guilty of the craven insincerities it was her own horrible hypocrisy not her stepdaughters disapproval chat made the task so difficult as she dwelt upon the difficulties as she realised the almost incredible shock she was about to deal the fortitude within her faded and during the latter half of the journey it was with thankfulness she reflected that she would not have to confront the situation that day it should be directly they arrived though she vowed it she had watched tremulously till nearly three oclock when a cab rumbled to the house at last and her heart turned sicker still as she saw that her stepdaughters were accompanied by their aunt we persuaded her to come im afraid i shall be a sad visitor for you my dear they were quite right the change will do you good they explained that they had lunched early and they sat awhile in the drawingroom with their hats and coats onher sisterinlaw oppressive with much crape the young women also wearing black dresses very badly made a glass of wine harriet you must be tired after the journey she rang the bell sipping the port and alternately nibbling a biscuit and flicking crumbs from her lap aunt harriet was taciturn and tearful and she had little to say between tea and dinner excepting when she spoke huskily of her sons last hours but in the evening her thoughts reverted to the happy days she had spent in the house when her dear brother was alive and she discoursed on them remarking how sadly different it seemed now it was a terrible loss for you belle she moaned but the parting is only for this life thats all my dear only for this life youll meet again where there are no partings you must keep thinking of that its only faith that helps us all to bear up and the hypocrite loathing her hypocrisy heard herself answer oh i know oh yes at harrogate the orchestra would be playing now and he was wondering if she had told them yet she gazed before her helplessly she would have to put it off till tomorrow said mildred i daresay aunt would like to go to bed early if youll all excuse me dear i think i should i think were all of us ready arent we murmured mrs findon and as they got up and filed from the room amy said in sacerdotal tones theres one thing we want to do isnt there before we go upstairs tonight and like one who performs a rite she opened the study door and on the threshold they drooped devoutly o god forgive me and help me to be truthful prayed the hypocrite when she was alone the morrow was sunday and in the morning they went to church and after service they walked dismally to the cemetery at dinner she could scarcely swallow she felt faint and her hands trembled when the return to the drawingroom was made it had to be now her sisterinlaw was settling herself for a nap amy turned listlessly the pages of a book mildred her shallow eyes upturned and her head slightly sideways wore an air of pious resignation to some unexpressed calamity turning from the window with a gulp the coward stammered oh after you had gone from harrogate mr murray asked me to marry him the silence seemed to her to last for minutes to do what gasped amy well exclaimed mildred it didnt take long to put him in his place i hope what impudence he had an impudent look said amy some man who was staying at the hydro where you were inquired aunt harriet fancy thats the worst of those large places but i shouldnt let it worry you my dear it isnt worth worrying about very likely he didnt mean any harm by it he didnt understand thats alldidnt know your heart was buried with him whos gone disgusting i call it said mildred but aunts quite rightwe neednt talk about it i thought this morningi dont know if you noticed itthat the saxifrage on the grave had gone rather thin there was a gap here and there i think wed better see the superintendent it isnt what it ought to be by any means she stood struggling to say the restshe struggled with all the puny will that was within her and so unfit was she to struggle that on surrendering her paramount emotion was relief she said yes well see him about it and have some more she had intended to write to murray in time for the evening collection but she could not write that she had kept her word and she shrank from writing that she had paltered with it she lay sleepless crying with mortification once a desperate impulse to be done with her compliance then and there pulled her up and she thrust on her dressinggown but her mind quailed even as she reached the door and she sank on to the edge of the bed procrastinatingand then crept back between the sheets she could not write that she had kept her word on the next day either nor during the two days that followed the just thing to them both would have been to write him exactly what had happened but as she was a woman the thing natural to her when she was to blame was to behave worse still by not writing at all a feeble attempt she made but what was there to say excepting that she had failed in every moment she was conscious of his waiting she realised the glances that he cast at that letterrack over the console table and saw his mouth tighten at every disappointment that it dealt and she was fond of him yet it was beyond her to sustain the effort to confess herself demeaned he telegraphed coming to you by the seven oclock train tomorrow friday morning from her bedroom window before breakfast she saw the boy crossing the road with the message and she darted downstairs and took it from him before the double knock could crash no one was aware when the family group made their matins to the study that in her pocket she had a telegram from a lover no one surmised when she served the eggs and bacon that she was questioning terrified how to keep his coming secret if any of them were in when the maid said that he was asking for her she would be tonguetied and theyhow insulting theyd be to him it would be awful awful unless she were to prepare them unless she were to say now that she had heard from him and that they must receive him properly she knew she wasnt going to say it but she imagined the sensation if she said it mr murrays calling this morning youve made a mistakei accepted him she shivered at the mere notion at fancying how horror would distort their faces just after she had been shamming in that room she would make an excuse to go outshed meet him at the station it was going to be very painfulshe wished he werent coming in love with him though she was she knew that she wished he werent coming and in that moment it was borne upon her that her expectation of marrying him had died days ago she could never go through with it she would have to tell him soand he wouldnt understand wouldnt make allowances for her he had not understood at harrogate hed reproach her tell her she had treated him badly and shed have to sit there in the waitingroom trying not to cry with people looking on if she could have been picked up in his arms and carried off this morning without coming back to the house at all that would be nice the girls and harriet might say what they chose if she hadnt got to listen to it but he wouldnt ask her to go like that she would have to propose it herself how could she besides when she went out to meet him she couldnt even take a suitcase oh what good would it do to meet him pain for nothing he thought he would be able to argue her into it make her promise over again wretched and very likely she would promiseand then what was she going to do she would feel worse then than she felt now it would have been far better for them not to see each other if she told the servantshe couldnt say not at home that would sound dreadful he might be here soon she supposed unless he had to wait long for the change of trains if she did mean to go to the station she ought to go directly she had given orders to the cook walking into misery with her eyes open and walking back with her heart in her shoes it wouldnt be any easier to say it to them later than it was at this minuteand she would know it even while he was wringing the promise from her oh what was he coming for to make things worse still he might have known by her not having written to himshe pushed back her chair with vexation after breakfast when the beds were being made mrs findon said doreen if anybody calls this morninga gentlemansay were away from home for a few days you understand for a few daysall of us oh and doreen if he asks where we are you dont know more than six years have gone by since mrs findon peeped breathless as mr murray got into a cab again and was driven out of her life and now when she reads in her newspaper every day on one page or another how sublimely mankind has progressed by relapsing into barbarism and that the new human nature is purged of frailties that were inherent in men and women until the th august she vaguely wonders how it is that her household and her social circle and beckenhampton at large and she herself have not had their characters regenerated like the rest of the world for each morning she goes with the misses findon to gaze upon the study and each sunday she goes with them to gaze upon the grave and on their return while the misses findon sit by the fireplace speaking at long intervals in subdued tones their stepmother stares from the window knowing that her pretence of mourning a husband she did not love will continue as long as she lives and when she looks back on her romance she marvelsnot at the recreancy of her submission but that once she briefly dared to dream she would rebel ix the boom at this time of day i do not mind publishing the facts it happened a few weeks after those pillars of the statethibaudin and hazarddisappeared from paris with a couple of million francs they were leading the police a pretty dance and people said ah they are probably at the worlds end by this time i used to think to myself how securely a man who had a mind to do so might lie hidden within an hours journey of the grand boulevard it was really the disappearance of thibaudin and hazard that originated my idea i was manager at that period of the theatre supreme where we were very soon to produce beauregards play omphale i descried a way to attract additional attention to our project i went to see beauregard one october morning and gave him a shock he was breakfasting in bed bonjour maitre i said are you too much occupied to talk business panage exclaimed the dramatist if you have come to demand any more mutilations of the manuscript i tell you without parleying that no consideration on earth will induce me to yield there is a limit mon dieu there is a limit rather than cut another line or substitute another syllable i will put the contract in the fire dear friend you have evidently slept ill and are testy this morning i said compose yourself i come to exhilarate you with a great scheme he still eyed me apprehensively and to pacify him i made haste to explain it has nothing to do with any alterations in the play ah he breathed relief and dipped his croissant in his cup it is a scheme for booming it my host was forthwith genial a smile suffused his munching face and he offered me a cigarette i ask your pardon if i was abrupt he said as you surmise i passed a bad night a boom well you know my views on the subject of booming the ordinary puff preliminary is played out one needs something novel panage something scholarly scholarly is the word for omphale a play of prehellenic times one needs the boom scholarly classical and grandiose you voice my own sentiments said i one needs nothing less than a production of unrivalled accuracycostumes copied from designs discovered in crete and dating back to the dim days of the minotaur that would look tasteful in print would it not alors what do you say to our going to crete and discovering them crete stammered beauregard have i mentioned that he was fat and indolent and had never travelled further than trouville what think you of exploring the minotaurs lair i questioned of penetrating to the apartments of phaedra of examining with your own eyes the labyrinth of ariadne i he ejaculated you and i together my old one our adventures would make pretty reading hein would not all paris be chattering about your omphale what a fever of impatience for the first night think of the effect such paragraphs would have on the advance booking the corpulent beauregard lay back on the pillows pale and mute i had spoken too earnestly for him to suspect that i was pulling his leg and i could see that he was very seriously perturbed his mind was torn in halves between his longing for the advertisement and his horror of the exertion and expense after a moment he sat up perspiring and wrung my hand panage he cried you are a man of genius your idea is most brilliant i have never heard its equal with all my heart i congratulate you i alas cannot accompany you on account of my wifes illhealth but you are free go mon ami your inspiration will crowd your theatre his wifes health was offensively robust i shook with laughter so unrestrained that the cigarette fell out of my mouth let me be a trifle more explicit i said it is not essential to my scheme that either you or i should actually go to crete it is only essential that we should be reported to have gone there i propose that we should blazon our departure in all the journalswe might give them interviews in the midst of our packingand that we should then retire for two or three months to some secluded spot near at hand where there will be nobody to recognise us i shall confide only in verdeille my secretary i can rely on him and he will keep the press well supplied with anecdotes of our vicissitudes during our absence mon dieu we will make paris bubble and boil with anticipation he was admiring but timid dont you think it would be very risky he demurred if our imposture were found out it would be ruin for example what spot well i am not prepared with spots at the instant i came to you on the effervescence of the notion but somewhere off the beaten track one can hide very effectually without going fari would not mind wagering that thibaudin and hazard are lying low in some hamlet while the police are watching marseilles and havre or picturing them already in south america they are probably concealed within an easy run of the gare st lazare waiting till the search is relaxed what about one of the little seaside places in normandyhave you ever stumbled on one of them a day after the season finished there is nobody left but the gardechampetre he shivered three months of it he queried piteously our investigations which we undertake to complete the previous labours of the archaeologists ought to be thorough i pointed out is it not worth our while to suffer a little tedium for such an end lift your gaze to the cash that will accrue beauregard dwell upon the boxoffice besieged positively we shall double the value of your play also you can take plenty of exercise and improve your figure i abhor exercise he murmured and you could keep early hours and prolong your life my life is a series of vexationsto prolong it would be fatuous further everybody will say what a conscientious artist you are i dont mind asserting that your passion for accuracy is sweeping me to the minotaurs lair against my will well i will think about it he said heavily he promised to write to me on the morrow there was no difficulty about finding a summer resort forsaken enough in octoberthe difficulty was to find one sufficiently animated to boast an hotel that remained open and at last i authorised verdeille to provide us with a furnished chalet of these he had reported an unlimited choice everywhere the resort finally approved for our purpose contained thirty furnished chalets and they were all to be let with alacrity until the following july we took ours until february i had extracted beauregards consent and a fortnight later i hustled him into a cab he looked as if he were being removed for a killorcure operation and i am sure he had half a mind to break his word even when we were in the train on the journey i perused with pleasure le matin and the current issue of lillustration in which the programme of our imaginary trip was set forth with a wealth of invention that did me credit the deception in fact had been engineered so eloquently that at moments i had almost begun to fancy we were really bound for crete we travelled to dieppe and then a cab crawled into a void with usthe motor service we learnt was discontinued for the next nine months the chalet was a high gaunt house called les myosotis a peasant who represented the agence de location stood at her door to wonder at our arrival a primitive bonne whom verdeille had engaged to attend upon us appeared to entertain doubts of our sanity we entered the scene as messieurs poupard and bachelet it was my precaution to choose names beginning with a p and a b i thought of the initials on our luggage and our washingthe dramatist had overlooked that point well i shall not pretend that i was in for a rollicking time i have a high esteem for beauregard in the theatre but beauregard in a village was unspeakable his lamentations linger with me yet we had nothing to do except to walk in the mud and regard the shutters of the twentynine other chalets at seven oclock in the evening the distant lighthouse and the lamp in our own salon afforded the only lights discoverable for miles round that fat parisians melancholy his reproaches his attitudes of despair defy description even when the weather improved he would perceive no virtue in it i exclaimed once what a beautiful sky tonight he replied it would be beautiful from the place de la concorde he had brought a cartload of novelsand before we had been in the place a week he was complaining that he had nothing to read i shall die if i remain any longer he declared i shall be buried here i foresee it the climate doesnt agree with me honestly i feel very unwell i ought to return to paris it is my dutyi have my wife to consider you were never so well in your life i remonstrated sharply rubbish theres no escape now youve got to see it through foretaste the triumph of omphale and be blithe how much will a triumph be worth to me if i am dead he wailed mon dieu what an existence what demoniac desolation i shudder when i wake in the morning the thought of the terrible day before me weighs me down i have scarcely the energy to put on my socks to wash my neck exhausts me is there nothing nothing to be done for an hours respiteis there no entertainment within reasonable distance my beloved bachelet i said you forget at a place of entertainment we might be recognised besides there isnt any he threw up his arms it is like being in gaol word of honour who directed you to this fatal hole where a postman collects letters only when he pleasesthis desert where mondays matin drifts by tuesday night by what perverse ingenuity did you contrive to find it how long have we endured it now ten days i told him cheerfully why we have only got about eighty more he groaned it seems like centuries my misgiving of course is that it will drive me to intemperance such ordeals as this develop the vice the natives themselves are staggered by our presence they whisper about me as i pass children follow me up the roads marvelling if the population sufficed i should be followed by crowds i tell you we are objects of suspicion we are a local mystery they conclude we must have done something also the laundress here is a violent savageshe is not a laundress at all i had six new collars when we came six collars absolutely new from the boxand this devil has frayed them already i would never have believed it could be accomplished in the time but she has managed it six collars absolutely new from the box dont imagine that he had finished dont suppose that it was merely a bad mood it was the kind of thing i had to bear from him daily hourlyfrom the early coffee to the latest cigarette one afternoon when i had gone for a stroll without him a contretemps occurred i had entered the outfitters and stationers and tobacconists and provision merchantsthe miniature shop was the only one in the place that had not closed until the following summerto obtain a pair of shoelaces that the clodhoppers cackled about our sojourn was a small matter to me and i paid no more heed to the womans curious stare today than usual but i was to meet another stare as i waited for my change a shabby young man came in to ask for a copy of le petit journal and a toy for five sous le petit journal which i had just read contained the latest details of my explorations in crete and instinctively i looked round his eyes widened i did not know him from adam but it was evident that he knew me at least by sight i turned hot and cold with confusion grabbing at my coppers i hurried out wondering what i had better do if he addressed me before i had time to solve the question i heard him striding at my heels with a deprecating bow that told me he had favours to solicit he exclaimed monsieur panage you are mistaken i said promptly oh monsieur i beg you to hear me he cried i entreat you in the theatre you are for ever inaccessiblewill you not spare an instant to me here he was so sure of my identity that i realised it would be indiscreet of me to deny it any longer since i could not deceive my only course was to ingratiate him what do you want i asked fuming monsieur he broke out i am an actor i have been acting in the provinces since i was a boy i have played every kind of part from farce to tragedy i have talent but i have no influence and the stage doors of paris are shut and barred against me no manager will listen to me because i am too obscure to obtain an introduction to him no one will believe that i have ability because i cannot get a chance to prove it oh i know very well what a liberty i have taken in speaking to you but i want to get on i want to get oni implore you to give me a trial he had me in a nice fix apparently he was unaware that i was believed to be in crete but he would soon learn it by the newspaper in his pocket and if i snubbed him he would certainly give me away he could hold me up to ridiculei should be the laughingstock of paris it was a fine situation for me i the director of the theatre supreme was compelled to temporise with this provincial mummer i scrutinised him in encouraging silence as if mentally casting him for a part i saw hope bounding in him ah i said thoughtfully yes what is your favourite line character monsieur he panted and of course i would accept a very small salary a very small salary indeed i did not doubt it i could picture him strutting and ranting on the boards of a booth for a louis a week and holding himself lucky when he earned that walk on a little way with me i said graciously we can talk as we go along i should have to see you do something before i could consider you you know i must be sure that you are capable even the gentleman who plays the servant at the supreme and hasnt a single word to utter is an experienced comedian you are not playing anywhere in the neighbourhood you are not in a travelling theatre about here no monsieur he sighed i am out of an engagement i am here because this is where i live rather remote from the dramatic world i suggested smiling something of a drawback is it not his simplicity in crediting me with the notion of recruiting the supreme from a travelling theatre tickled me nearly to death a grave drawback monsieur he agreed but i am not alonei have a child and she is too delicate to thrive in a city a good many delicate children have thriven in paris i remarked in thriving households monsieurin healthy quarters paris is dear and i am poormy child would be condemned to a slum i should see her lade away better to be a barnstormer all my life than lose my child she is all i have left to love there is your art i said humbugging him my art he gave an hysterical laugh a nervous jumpy fellow without a particle of repose listen monsieur listen i am an actor and if i could demolish the barrier that keeps me out i might be a great one but i confess to you that i would abandon art and cast figures on an office stool or break flints on a road and thank god for the exchange if it would buy my child a home i want money i want to give my child the comforts that other children have thats my ambition i have no loftier pose than fatherhood my prayer is not applause and compliments and notoriety not the petty pleasure of hearing i have equalled one favourite or eclipsed another my prayer isto give things to my child i want to buy her nourishing food and a physicians advice and the education of a gentlewoman i want the money to send her to the south when it snows and to the mountains when its hot i want to see her laughing in a garden like the rich mens children in paris that you spoke of i stand and watch them sometimeswhen i go there to beg at stage doors till an understrapper kicks me out well well the sort of things you desire are not so expensive i said suavely some day your salary may provide them all you think it possible monsieur really his haggard eyes devoured me you have only to make one success after that you will be grossly overpaid like every other star if i could but do it he gasped if i could only convince a paris manager that i have it in me year after year ive hoped and tried and failed to get a hearing you may judge my desperation by my audacity in stopping you in the streets what course is open to mewhat steps can i take even now when i am pouring out my heart to monsieur panage himself how much does it advance me he was not so simple as i had thought enfinby the way what is your name my name is paul manesse monsieur well monsieur you must surely understand that until i have seen you act i cannot be of any service to you i could rehearse on approval he pleaded moreover i added hastily all my arrangements are made for some time to come later on when an opportunity arises we shall see what we shall see i halted write to me during the run of omphale i shall not forget our little chat a propos i am starting tomorrow for crete i see the papers are reporting that i am already there so you need not mention that you have met meit is never policy to contradict the press yes i shall bear your name in mind i assure you he did not look assured however he stood silent and his lips were trembling heaven knows what solid help my amiability had led him to expect but it was plain that honeyed phrases were a meagre substitute you have been most courteous to me he stammered you have done me a great honouras long as i live i shall remember that i have talked with monsieur panage but you are leaving what you found monsieura desperate man bah who knows when an opening may occur i said a shade embarrassed i may see a chance for you sooner than you think when i want you i shall send for you i little dreamt in what strange circumstances i was to send for him beauregard was snoring on the sofa when i burst into the room well you can bestir yourself and pack i volleyed the place is too hot to hold us we have to get out hein there is a pro here who knows me confound him i had to tell him we were leaving for crete in the morninghe mustnt see me here again the playwright shifted his slippered feet to the floor and sat up we go back to paris he inquired beaming how can that be of course not we must discover another retreat fugitives moaned beauregard nomads do you not think panage that i might go back to parisi could remain cautiously in the house the truth is my wife is of a very highminded character and it distresses her to have to address tender letters to a monsieur bachelet she feels that it is not correct i was in no mood to be tolerant of his subterfuges he wept i determined to effect our departure the same evening while he was still intimidatedand if only i had been able to accelerate his movements my change of intentions would have spared us much his dilatoriness exposed us to a thunderbolt we had pealed the bell in his bedroom for the lamp and when the door was opened at last i turned to utter a sharp complaint of the delay to my surprise i saw that a stranger was walking in there was a fraction of a second in which i stared indignantly waiting for an apology for his blunder then it was as if my heart slipped slowly to my stomach and i felt catastrophe in the air even before i heard his rustic official tones he arrested us as thibaudin and hazard behind me i heard beauregards dressingcase drop with a thud our eyes met and we stood petrified realising the impossibility of concealing our names in my terror of the public scandal that was imminent my clothes stuck to my skin curs as well as criminals we looked i rather fancied that our provincial captor was relieved to see what knockkneed miscreants he had to deal with you bungling idiot i gasped i am monsieur panage of the theatre supreme this gentleman is monsieur beauregard of the academie francaise you shall suffer for this outrage he shifted his feet slightly it was the least bit in the world but that motiveless movement betrayed misgiving i deduced from it that in his eagerness to distinguish himself he had taken more responsibility upon his bucolic shoulders than sat quite comfortably on them i flung my card to him look what of it he said surlily what evidence is this i see you were preparing for flight no violencebeauregard had impotently wrung his handsi have men in the passage you will offer your explanations in the proper quarter come he advanced upon me now listen to me i cried backing in a panic put so much as a finger on us and you are ruined not only will i have you discharged from the force i will have you hounded out of any employment that you find to the end of your days it is i who say it you have no excuse we bear no resemblance whatever to thibaudin and hazard if you were of paris you would know as much again he faltered again he saw distinction within his grasp the workings of a dull intelligence a fools passion for promotion supplied a fascinating study even in my fear hollow cheeks small grey moustache slight stoop he recited eyeing me his sheeps gaze travelled to beauregard age forty bald at crown fat is he the only fat man in france fool we can call all paris to prove who we are monsieur will have his opportunity to prove it elsewhere he returned stubbornly but the monsieur hinted that i was impressing him against his will beauregard began to collect his wits if we are compelled to prove it elsewhere it will be the end of you he raged better be convinced in time i warn you hazard is fat yes i am perhaps a little plump what do you show me mumbled the fellow i see the card of monsieur panage that does not demonstrate that monsieur panage is present complacence was in his gesture he seemed vain of the brilliance of his reasoning all is said i have no time for discussions stop i cried inspired what if we produce a resident of this very village to say who i am mon dieu the man you met roared beauregard saved there is no such personwe have made our inquiries there is a gentleman well known who has lived here with his daughter sincei dont know how long give me his name his name i said his name is i could not recall the nameit had had no interest for me i could remember saying hypocritically i shall bear your name in mind but what it was i had no idea i stood dazed his nameit escapes me for the moment enough the pretence is idle morbleu thundered beauregard think panage think i am trying but i paid no heed to it heavens what a revenge for the mummerthe name that had fallen on careless ears was now my only chance of rescue i thrashed my brains for it sweating with funk the nameit evades me because i have met him only once in my life or not so often i am not to be duped let me think dont speak for a minute farceur his nameii nearly had it wait i have waited too long come the pair of you his namehis name i sought it frantically his name ispaul manesse i mopped my neck our persecutor made a note where is he to be found how should i know that it is not difficult for you to ascertain doubtless any villager could direct you to him now mark you i have supplied the name of a resident in a position to correct your monstrous blunder i advise you to bring him to identify me before the matter becomes more serious for you still if you put us to public ignominy apologies will not satisfy me when you discover your mistake here is your last chance to extricate yourself he ruminated enfin i will send one of my men to inquire for him he said grudgingly if it turns out that this monsieur manesse is unknown i warn you that you will suffer for your game the room was about forty feet from the groundi saw him attentively considering whether in his absence we were likely to walk out of the window he marched into the corridor and gave a whistle i heard two voices before he came in again uninvited he sat clasping his knees none of us spoke any more the lamp having still made no appearance i lit the candles i do not forget that long halfhour in les myosotis the yokel himself grew restless at lasthe rose and went into the corridor again hark exclaimed beauregard suddenly the man has come back can you hear manesse listen i cannot distinguish i murmured straining my ears to the door some minutes passed to our dismay our oppressor reentered alone perplexity darkened his brow he hesitated before he broke the suspensive hush monsieur manesse agrees that this afternoon he met monsieur panage he announced buthe raised a forensic forefingerthat does not establish that either of you is monsieur panage monsieur manesse is occupied in telling a fairy tale to his little daughter and cannot spare the time to come here to identify you enfin you will accompany me to the commissaire de police and you will obtain the evidence in due course sacre tonnerre i screamed it was the last straw that strolling player declined to spare the time that mountebank neglected me i saw crimson i paced the room raving what did he say i spluttered what were the ruffians words my man reports that the gentleman replied monsieur panage must have had immense difficulty in recollecting my name he would not stir an inch to save my lifewhy should i take a walk for him i sat down i felt dizzy i feared i was going to be extremely ill the man himself seemed moved by my collapseor increasingly uncertain of his position he said perhaps a note might be effectual alors if monsieur wishes to write i will wait give me your fountainpen beauregard butagain the forefinger was upliftedthere must be no secret instructions i must be satisfied there is no private meaning in the note good heavens what am i permitted to say he pondered to monsieur paul manesse monsieur has monsieur written monsieur yes yes go on i am now convinced that you can act i hereby engage you at the trifling salary of two hundred and fifty francs a week for prominent parts in my next three productions at the theatre supreme the silence was sensational who the devil are you i stuttered when i found my voice paul manesse monsieur he told meyour new comedian if you sign i signed you have heard how we boomed omphale and i found a star that jolly little manesse girl has a rich papa today x pilar naranjo in one of the dullest towns of france i sat with a parisian at a variety show a frenchman with a very grubby shirtfront presented to the audience senorita pilar naranjo the famous dancer of madrid my companion started dramatically and whispered i pray you to pardon mei shall adjourn to the bar till she has done of course i followed him whats the matter do not ask me to watch her why i could not support it she is so bad as all that bad she is entrancing oh did you see her when you were in spain in paris when i had come back have you read my sobs after midnight no buy it it contains perhaps the most poignant poems that i have writtenthey are moans in metres for my loss of pilar naranjo you dont say so she was the passion of my life he struck an attitude return to your seat alone mon ami for company i shall have my bitter thoughts civility forbade me to let him do all the acting himself and i said in solemn tones i shall remain by your side he brooded heavily with one eye on the past and the other on the effect he was making in my nature he informed me there is mysteriously some castilian qualityno sooner had i arrived in spain than i bore myself like a spaniard i spent fascinating months there and when i came home paris appeared to me a foreign city absently i replied to people in spanish my fondest possession was a guitar that i had brought back though i could not play it i derived exquisite pleasure from slinging it over my shoulder when i promenaded in the garden of the luxembourg it may be that instinct warned my compatriots that now they were alien to me for they seemed to avoid me and i was alone i can understand it i said one melancholy evening as i wandered through the barren streets pining for the magic of granada i noticed the name of pilar naranjo on the bills of a minor musique all though it was a name unknown to me its nationality was an appeal i entered the musique all i paid for a fauteuil and received a pink ticket what a crisis even today i cannot behold pink tickets without a shudder to the strains of an exiguous orchestra the provocation of the ladys castanets reached our ears gaily her victim writhed very soon i gathered that she was popular there but on the stage to be a foreigner is to be a favourite and i prepared myself to be disappointed when she appeared sapristi i was spellbound she danced that night the habenera that she is dancing now ah those cajoling arms so irresistible how imperial was her form how southern were her feet and her face the bewildering beauty of her face that haunts me still i got up sit downi could not endure your looking at her without me he gasped when her turn finished i had no thought but her i was scarcely conscious of the monkeys that came next in some fifteen minutes a girl had danced herself into my destinyand i was swept to the stage door like a leaf on the gale of my emotions i could see nobody inside to take a message ten minutesa quarter of an hour passed i waited in the gloomy little culdesac dreading in every second to hear the approaching footstep of a rival with an appointment so tremendous was my agitation that spanish tenses with which i was normally familiar evaded me and my brain buzzed with the effort to compose a preliminary phrase the door opened before her features were visible in the darkness the majesty of her deportment proclaimed that it was she i advanced i bowed with all my grace senorita i said i am a poet and i adore you will you honour me by supping with me it was not the overwhelming eloquence that i should have had in french but i felt that the fervour of my voice should make amends and i prayed that she would not be flippant in return my sentiment demanded sweet grave contralto tones a giggle would have been torture to me once more a crisisa spiritual crisis in which my heart ceased to beat would she respond gravely or would she giggle she did neither one nor the other as if i had not spoken she went by comment done i had referred clearly to supper i was welldressed young handsomeand a dancer at a fifthrate musique all which was not precisely a college for decorum refused to dispense with the ceremony of an introduction it was prodigious and by degrees my anger at the affront subsided so far from dismissing her from my mind i paid homage to her virtue yes my bosom was thrilled by deep esteem on that sad walk home the romantic passion for a danseuse was transmuted into a devout reverence for a noble woman i condemned myself for approaching her so informally there is in my complex nature a vein of humility extremely winning i resolved to write to her confessing my fault before i slept it was a long job because i had to look up so many words in a dictionary but i foresaw that she would be touched by the letter in conclusion i said the impulse that you scorned was born not of disrespect but of an admiration that brooked no curb if your vestal pride is not adamant to my remorse grant me i supplicate an opportunity to express my penitence at the stage door tomorrow wednesday wednesdays sunshine already tinged the street when i dropped the missive in the boiteauxlettres but i was not conscious of fatigue on the contrary i regretted that i must kill eighteen hours in sleep or some other banality before the paradise of her presence was attained how much had happened in a night all that was frivolous in my disposition had passed away and i realised that this girl had inspired in me a devotion profound epochmaking and supreme he paused from the footlights the frenchman of the dirty shirtfront was to be heard in the capacity of interpreter ladies and gentlemen senorita pilar naranjo desires me to translate to you her heartfelt gratitude for the enthusiasm of your applause if you will graciously allow her a few moments for a change of costume senorita naranjo will have the honour of presenting to you her sensational toreador dance the poet groaned when i woke i hoped to find that i had slept well into the afternoon with impatience i saw that it was only midday however in dressing i recognised that i might profitably employ some of the time with the dictionary and i prepared a score of burning declarations for the interview the remaining hours were intolerable no sooner had the musique all opened than i took my seat but the exasperating entertainment appeared to me to endure for aeons before her turn the torments inflicted on my suspense by a pair of crosstalk comedians cannot be surpassed in hell at last i trembled in the culdesac again at last she came with an obeisance that consigned my career to her feet i murmured i am here to learn whether i am pardoned not a syllable as before she passed me by ah mon dieu i cannot tell you how i reached my couch but my zeal survived even this i was stricken but indomitable i said behold a saint worth winning i said brace up and demonstrate that you are worthy of her my friend every day for a month i thumbed that exhausting dictionary and a spanish grammar that i might send to her a sonnet every night for thirty days on end i wrestled with synonyms and inversions in a foreign tongue to create for her a nightly proof of my genius and my love and i waited for an answer vainly long after despair had mastered me i was with a goodfornothing painter of my acquaintance he said i have a new flamedelicious have you heard of the spanish dancer up at the little casino by a superhuman effort i controlled myself your suit prospers it is going strong and only a week since i first dropped in there and saw her you are a man of action but since when have you talked spanish oh that isnt necessary he laughed she is spanish only on the stage between ourselves her name is really marie durandshe has never been out of france in her life she had not understood a single word that i had said or writtenand by the time i discovered it she was anothers he holds her stillyou hear him now the interpreter was speaking again senorita naranjo desires me to translate xi the girl who was tired of love at the opera ball a boy had danced half the night with a partner whose youthful tones were so delicious whose tenderness was so attractive that he implored her a hundred times to unmask if i do youll get up and go away she gasped at last fondling his hand he vowed that it was her temperament that fascinated him and she took the mask offand he saw the sunken face of an old old woman horrified he left her in the same season another man supplicated to a girl for her lovea girl with a face so beautiful that it made him forget the strangeness of her voice which was flat and feeble and the girl who looked no more than nineteen replied with exhaustion i outlived such emotions long ago to tell you the truth the subject sounds to me ridiculous all i want today is peace and quiet wearily she left him these two incidents peculiar as they are were the outcome of an occurrence queerer stillan occurrence at the tragic epoch of a womans life when her glass says stop fooling yourself youve crumpled to that madame de val fleury had begun to combat the advance of age the day after she detected the first shadowy threat of crowsfeet as she turned her perfect neck before the mirror her triumph was a fleeting one and the later conquests were briefer yet scarcely had the enemy been driven from the glorious eyes when it crept about the chiselled nose and mouth no sooner was its attack upon her face withheld than it showed greyly in her hair but she never abandoned the contest she fought with time continuously and although there were moods of depression as measures more and more drastic were required custom and vanity enabled her year by year decade by decade to view her reflection with complacence she beheld it through a haze of illusion in applying the colour to her shrivelled cheeks she did not note that the chestnut transformation that had looked so natural on a counter looked spurious on her head did not see how piteously the perfect neck had sagged but one may morning the mirror said stop tooling yourself youve crumpled to that and madame de val fleury sat and saw her face withered as it wasand madame de val fleury wailed for her lost loveliness as she had never wailed for her dead husband and son a dress that she was to wear for the first time and that had cost five thousand francs lay on the bed she did not glance towards it she leant her elbows on the toilet table and stared at the brutal glass and beyond the glass she viewed the ghost of her empire scenes where famous beauties had turned involuntarily at her entrance it was the womens homage the reluctant admiration of her own sex that she mourned for as she brooded there in her backward gaze she saw why as the years sped she had squandered more and more on her modistessaw bitterly that she had struggled to prolong by her clothes the fastwaning jealousy of her face and at longchamp that day she knew herself to be only an old unattractive woman magnificently attired not more than a month after this madame de val fleury had the annoyance to lose a pendant sapphire that she was wearing a reward not illiberal was offered and when she woke from her nap one afternoon she was relieved to learn that the stone had been picked up by a poor girl who was waiting in the hall to see her if she is clean i will see her here said madame de val fleury the young girl who entered in a threadbare frock had been dowered with beauty so extraordinary that all the ladys pleasure at recovering her jewel was swamped in envy the eyes the complexion the exquisite modelling of the features held her mute for an instant subduing a sigh she said i hear you have found my sapphire yes madame let me look where did you find it it was in the road madame just against the kerb in the rue de berri ah yes i am glad you saw it it was a piece of luck for you too hein she rose and opened her desk yes indeed madame said the girl clasping her hands what are youi mean what do you do for a living i work at madame wilhelmines madame the milliners why dont you go as mannequin somewhereyou areerpretty they tell me my figure is not good enough madame thats true your figure is bad said the lady more amiably well you could sit to artists for the face you could earn more money that way than wilhelmine pays you i should think i know only one honest way to make as much money as i want madame said the girl in a low voice i want a good deal tiens the state lotteries of course no madame a likelier way than that oh and what do you call a good deal madame understands that i am very poor a trifle to madame would be a good deal to me say a hundred thousand francs a hundred thousand francs such a sum is not a trifle to anybody you know a way to make it thanks to this reward i have a chance to make it assented the girl folding the bank notes that had been given to her and not the lotteries no madame a journey for which i lacked the fare but i bore madame no no go on eh bien i am sick of poverty i would far rather part with my face and gain wealth than remain beautiful and a beggar you would far ratherwhat do you say i am going to the face exchange madame said the girl resolutely the old woman looked at her stupefied the what she asked in a whisper madame has not heard of it it is held once a year of course one may fail one may not be able to strike a bargainand even if one does the miracle may not occur but something tells me i shall be fortunate madame de val fleury shrank back on the couch frightenedshe could not doubt that the girl was insane after a moment nerving herself to approach the bell she stammered yes yes i remember now i daresay it is the best thing you can do good afternoon to you i wish you every success and as she sniffed at the smelling salts brought by her maid she murmured trembling mad how terrible quite quite mad the incident did not fade from her mind she thought of it in the night and on the morrow and when she took the sapphire and the snapped chain to her jewellers if the nonsense the poor creature talked had only been true what ecstasy and her tone had been perfectly sane oh of course she was demented stillstill miracles did happen look at lourdes every day madame de val fleury recalled the matter with a curiosity more intense and regretted the alarm that had prevented her obtaining details before a week had gone by the curiosity drove her to make a purchase at the milliners the girl had mentioned you have a young person employed here who found a jewel that i lost she remarked i dont see her in the shop yes madame no madameshe is in the workroom how fortunate that madames sapphire was restored to her ah the workroom have you had her long is she satisfactory ah yes madame about two years i have no fault to find with her i fancied she was a little odd in her manner you have not noticed anything of the kind mais non madame no doubt she was shy in madames presence no she is quick to take a hint that girl she has all her wits about her you might tell her i should like to have a word with her faltered madame de val fleury and when the girl appeared still more beautiful without a hat she said come to my flat again this evening about nine oclock if you can i will make it worth your while i want to talk to you as she passed out she felt breathless and dizzy then if she is not mad panted madame de val fleury then if she is not madmy god can there be something in it she had been going to a neighbours for a game of ecarte after dinner and ecarte was a passion with her but she knew no regrets in cancelling the engagement a book by her favourite novelist just published lay to hand and reading was another of her pet pleasures but she did not open it as she sat waiting for the hour to strike punctually at nine oclock the bell rang the girl was shown in good evening said madame de val fleury sit down no no not so far off come closer tell me i have been wondering what you were speaking about the other afternoon is it really a fact madame means my intention i mean the place itself it actually exists ah certainly it exists madame where is it in brittany madame near pont chouay butit sounds incredible i am sure you are sincere buthow long have you known of it i have known of it ever since the first miracle that happened there madame four years ago i lived in the village then the face of a little girl the millers child was burntah it was frightful to seeand her mother knelt and prayed the whole night through that she herself might bear the scars instead and at dawn it was so and the childs face was as fair as ever it takes ones breath away what is the village called st pierre des champs madame if madame goes there and inquires everyone will confirm what i tell her and such miracles have happened again at dawn on each seventh of september madame i assure madame i speak the truth listen said madame de val fleury i shall go and hear what they say if i am satisfied are you willing toto exchange your face for mine i will not haggle with you i will pay what you want it is a large amount but you shall have ita hundred thousand francs one would have to think over the price madame said the girl hesitatingly what it is the figure you named yesfor an exchange but it is possible i might change with someone of my own years naturally i should prefer that you do not suppose a young girl would pay a hundred thousand francs cried madame de val fleury wincing if she has youth already what for for beauty there are many young girls who would be content to do so there will not be many living in a little village ah madame people who know arrive from all parts besides it might be better for me to take even fifty thousand francs with a young face than a hundred thousand withwith one more mature madame understands that i am humani am not indifferent to the other sex if i sacrifice all my prospects of admiration sweethearts husband it is worth a great sum i shall go and hear what they say repeated madame de val fleury deeply mortified what is your name berthe cheron madame put it down for me and your private address if what i hear convinces me perhaps we may come to terms all night the old woman dreamt she was again of surpassing loveliness the envy of all the women of her world she went to brittany the same week and returned palpitating with the tales that had been told her she agreed with mademoiselle cheron to pay francs if the metamorphosis occurred and it was arranged that when the time came they should travel to st pierre des champs together in the meanwhile her rapturous reflections were not free from anxiety if the dawning of the longedfor date should indeed yield her berthe cherons face she would be no longer recognised as madame de val fleury her social circle would not know her monsieur septfous her bankershe banked at a private bank and monsieur septfous was practically her man of businesswould not know her her servants themselves would not know her when she came back to paris to explain would be to meet with perpetual embarrassments on the whole the best plan would be to change her name as well it would mean relinquishing a few friendships that she valued butagain she foresaw herself dazzlingly fair and caught her breath her loveliness would compensate a millionfold her income was derived chiefly from municipal bonds and metro shares at the bank she had also a substantial sum on deposit she told monsieur septfous that she had decided to spend the rest of her life in the country and she took a draft payable to bearer for the full amount of cash and removed her box of securities she determined to call herself madame de beaulieu late on the evening of the th of september the old woman and the girl arrived at st pierre des champs they had expected to arrive earlier but the train crept into pont chouay at instead of and thence they were dependent on the local fiacres which were hard to find and slow to move madame de val fleury reached the village impatient and fatigued in the little moonlit marketplace with its vacant stalls when they entered it at last many figures circulated scrutinising one anothers features eagerly most of the men and women bore lanterns and one of the stalls had evidently been sublet for the evening under the sign christophe cheese eggs and butter a humpback had electric torches for sale as the pair made their way across the cobbles to the shrine that had been erected beside the watermill no face of much beauty met their view the sellers appeared to be chiefly buxom peasant girls wholesome looking but no more those who had come to buy were of types more various here an old roue fraudulently dyed and painted peered avidly at the features of a youth who raised his lantern and rebuffed him with a jeer there an individual with crafty lips and predatory eyes obviously a sharper was to be seen bargaining for the physiognomy of a simpleton a man with a round humorous face darted each moment from one melancholy countenance to another and a passerby said loud enough to be overheard look at jibily the low comedianhe is crazy to play tragic parts irritating and incessant was the shrill outcry of a female broker hobbling with a file of maidsofallwork at her heels fine faces cheap clamoured the crone fine faces cheap it became very cold beside the watermill as the laggard night wore by madame de val fleury shivered distressfully alternately she prayed and despaired more than once she glanced tense with hope at her companion striving to detect some promise of the soughtfor change but the girls face remained unaltered in the serene radiance of the moon its fairness was exquisite beyond words and the woman wrung her hands with the intensity of her desire slowly slowly the moonlight faded the pallor of dawn streaked the sky and a hundred faces were upturned beseechingly a hundred suppliants trembled wan and white grew the scene a tremor and a rustling stirred the huddled figures suddenly somewhere a woman wailed no use and burst into sobs berthe cheron fearful now the moment had come of beholding herself gauntcheeked and wrinkled bowed her head shuddering in her hands madame de val fleury half dazed with exhaustion and suspense bent to the shining surface of the pool the pool receded it became suddenly unreal next her pounding heart was squeezed with terrorshe didnt know if the reflection she beheld was her own or berthe cherons from behind her she nodded wildly at her reflection she grimaced and gesticulated at it like a madwoman it had happened she thought she gave an earpiercing shriek of joy but she fainted without a sound after the money was paid she neither saw nor heard anything of berthe cheron aided by a lady whose birth gave her the passport to society and whose income made her amenable to a financial offer madame de val fleury or as she now called herself victorine de beaulieu was the sensation of paris that autumn the consummate toilettes permitted by her wealth lent to her face a beauty even more transcendent than berthe cherons had been when she drove people pressed forward on the sidewalks to regard her when she entered her box at the opera everybody in the house to whom the box was visible looked at her as much as at the stage in salons faces the most admired before her advent paled in her presence like candle flames in sunshine she was paramount and she revelled in the knowledge yet the transformation had its lack she missed her game of ecarte with her erstwhile neighbour she missed the garrulity of familiar friends whom she no longer met there were hours when despite the transports afforded by the mirror now she found time hang heavy on her hands and the hands of course had not recovered girlishness and beauty nor her body nor her mind that was the drawback only her face was young physically and mentally she was old her corsetiere could not provide her with a figure to match the face her physician could not give back to her the energies that had gone her mirror itself was impotent to revive the enthusiasm and illusions of her youth men made love to the bewildering young widow after the first thrill of amazed exultance she was bored their fervour kindled no responsive spark her aged heart beat no faster the sentiment the rhapsodies poured into her ear seemed drearily stupid to the old woman as she posed on balconies wishing she were in her bedroom with a cup of tisane and her slippers during the third passionate proposal addressed to her it was with extreme difficulty that she restrained her jaws from yawning why are you so coldwhy wont you hear me men cried to her and she answered dully i am not impressionable it doesnt interest me to be made love to i am tired of all that and she was spoken of in paris as the girl who was tired of love many evenings during the winter there were when the knowledge that she would be wearied by some mans appeal if she went out determined her to remain at home the opportunity to outshine other women failed to lure her from the fireside and she sat in her dressinggown playing ecarte with her new maid it is marvellous what a head for the game madame has seeing she is so young exclaimed the maid awestruck i cannot say as much for you snapped her mistress mourning that quondam neighbour when the summer came and she went to the coast with a score of wonderful dresses she sighed for companionship more drearily yet hitherto at such places she had sat among her compeers amiably chatting now she appeared too young to be congruous to the circle of the oldwas too old to participate in the pastimes of the young scant of breath and stiff in the joints she viewed morosely the laughing women trooping to the tennis courts shrunken beneath her youthful frocks she dared not don a bathing costume and reveal her wasted form among the sirens lolling by the tents queer as the fact seemed her years irked her more this summer than they had done while she looked her age the anniversary of the miracle found her in low spirits and suffering from lumbago there was a lad attractive promising on the threshold of a careersuch a lad as thirtyeight years earlier she had pictured her baby growing up to be she had made his acquaintance at a feeve oclock where being so young he felt shy and where to find himself speaking to this enchantress confused him more still but her tone had promptly relieved him of his dread that he ought to play the courtier when she invited him to call on her she asked him as she might have asked a schoolboy her interest in guy vernes ambitions yielded to her gradually a healthier outlook stranger still as the months passed a real and deep affection stole into the old egoists nature she was less purposeless less futile for it almost as she entered into his boyish forecasts and made fight of his little setbacks it seemed to her as if her son had lived one day the boy flung his arms round her and begged her to be his wife it was horrible she repulsed him shuddering dont guy dont entreaties poured from him if you understood she moaned i shall have gone to my grave while youre a young man he thought she meant that she was very ill ill nurse you back to health victorine i love you with all my soul you dont love me a bit she said there is nothing in me for you to lovei am as utterly different from you as if there were fifty years between us you only imagine you love me because you admire my face good heavens have i ever said a single word to lead you to think i cared for you in such a way an english boy might have suffered as much but would have taken it more quietly this boy was french and he did not hide what he felt he answered vehemently that she had led him to think so every time they talked of his future if you didnt care for me why should it interest you he raved of his broken heart he loaded her with reproaches youve shammed to me mocked me just to amuse yourself no she was crying i am fond of youfonder of you than of anybody in the world but not like that i shall never care like that again for anyone i wish i had never seen you i wish i were dead you mustnt come here any more she found the strength to tell himand not till then had she realised how very dear he had become to her im so sorry guyso dreadfully sorry he fell at her feet imploring her anew he broke down and besought one kiss before he left her her misery was deeper than his as she bent to him but the boy didnt know it my god he sobbed i adore youand you kiss me as if you were my mother the mirror provided no comfort in her loss she stared lonely at the alien face reflectedstared at it by slow degrees with aversion it was not she the unlovely form and jaded mind were shethe spent passion and the infirmities what benefit was the face of youth without youths pulses the mirror mocked her weary thoughts each day upon her grief a woman whitelipped and shaken intruded to upbraid her you have ruined my sons career she said he neglects his work he thinks of nothing but you i hope and pray you may be punished as you deserve at guys age a career is not ruined by a foolish attachment pleaded madame de val fleury piteously and at yours such an answer is abominable cried the other you do not lessen your guilt by cynicism if ever a girl encouraged a young man you encouraged my son foolish as his devotion to you may be he is devoted to you by what right did you tempt him to come here constantly if you had no tenderness for him your treatment of him has been infamous as a mother do you know only one kind of tenderness madame my affection for your son was true and great my interest in his future was no less deep than yours i swear to you that what has happened distresses me so much that i have been able to think of nothing else madame verne advanced upon her with clenched hands your hypocrisy is even more revolting than your cynicism if i know more than one kind of tenderness yes but not in a girl for a young man you swear to me you are distressed i swear to you something else my boy is all i haveand i am frightened for him i do not know what he may do in his despair if i lose him he shall be revenged take care madame de beaulieu if you hear of his death take care the very next day if possible or the next month or the next yearwhenever i can reach youas heaven is my witness i will mark that face of yours with vitriol she rang the bell and wentand the maid that entered found her mistress in a swoon upon the floor for a week her shattered nerves kept madame de val fleury abed and for several weeks terror prevented her from setting foot outside the flat she had a grille constructed in the door and a hundred times she repeated to the servants that it was not to be opened for the merest instant to madame verne or any stranger such precautions could not yield composure however the day was rendered ghastly with false alarms and when she glanced at the mirror dread flared upon her now a face seared and repulsive a mutilated sightless thing of horror the night brought dreams so fearful that she was more than once wakened by a scream that had burst from her thrice the awfulness of the tension impelled her to falter through the telephone sympathetic and ingratiating inquiries to madame verne and when the mother rang off without vouchsafing a reply the poor old creature tottered with panic at last towards the close of february she had the unspeakable relief of learning that madame verne and her son had gone to monaco and once again she was able to step into her car with a sense of safety nevertheless the thought of the unhappiness that she had brought upon the boy was black in her mind she tried to thrust the thought aside by reading but fiction had lost its power to charm her gradually as her health improved she turned for respite from her sad reflections to the theatre when there remained no more fashionable programmes for her to see she would adventure the secondrate one night as she was coming out of a little theatre in the montmartre quarter she started and stopped short trembling in every limb at a sight that met her gaze she could not withdraw her gazeshe was magnetised by the sight it thrilled her as if the dead had risen to her view she was looking at the face that had been hersshe was looking at berthe cheron berthe cheron handsomely dressed had also jerked to a standstill and for a few seconds the two fronted each other dumblythe young girls puckered eyes her furrowed cheeks rancorous with regret it was she who was the first to speak blast you she said what do you meani treated you fairly didnt i stammered madame de val fleury i wishi wish resentment choked her i paid all you wanted paid it wouldnt have been good enough if youd paid a million you knewyou knew who was getting the best of it paid whats the use of the money without any fun do you think fine clothes make up for that i want to be danced with i want to be kissed to hell with your moneyi want love dont talk so loudly dont that mans looking at us hes not looking at me no man ever looks at me paid if we were both as we were you could pay some other foolit wouldnt be me youd get if we were both as we were id pay no one groaned madame de val fleury what its true quite quite true for a moment they were silent again studying each other then madame de val fleury said breathlessly i want to ask you something come home with meget into my car dont abuse me any more dont rail at meim an old woman and i cant bear it as the car bore them away she explained herself weeping i know it seems strange to you my not being satisfiedi know ive got the things you want so much but you retain the capacity to enjoy those things and i dont if i could have had your youth as well it would have been different the old are happiest in their old ways with their old friends we both made an error ifdo you think if we were to go there again berthe cheron turned to her wildly if we were to go there again she gasped if we were to go there againin humbleness of spirit this time in contrition beseeching pardon for our errordo you think it might be undone oh let us try let us try cried the girl seizing her hand and she too wept but i could not refund more than about half the money she faltered dismayed i would not ask you to refund a son of it said madame de val fleury you should keep it as a marriage portion in the flat they talked till late mingling their tears and comforting each other nearly four months had to pass before the coming of the date they craved but on the evening of the th of september the two victims of their own folly reached st pierre des champs once more and in the eerie marketplace the lanterns swayed amid the flitting figures and again they heard the shrill clamour of the crone shuffling among the naked stalls fine faces cheap and the long long night grew cold and the penitents teeth chattered and as the elder knelt and prayed as never had she prayed before the pebbles bit into her knees a few days afterwards monsieur septfous in the private office of the bank saw the door open to admit a caller that surprised him my dear madame de val fleury he exclaimed how delighted i am to greet you dare i hope you have returned to paris for good for good my friendthe country got on my nerves at my time of life not every change is desirable replied the old lady beaming and subsequently one man said to another funny thing at bullier last night i saw a girl just like madame de beaulieu who vanished to new york or somewhereexcepting that she had her arms round a chaps neck and looked so happy lucky chap by jove know him a fellow called guy verne xii in the year of our lord dear nelly i was in the theatre last night just to have a look at you again and i saw you when you came out of the stage door saw the toff and the taxi waiting to take you to supper wonder if you can call my name to mind any more alf alf that was your sweetheart when you were in the fancy department at skinner and mophams loved you true i did remember the early closing days when we used to go to the theatre together nelly remember me taking you to supper at the ham and beef shop four years ago wouldnt set foot in the ham and beef shop now would you no class but ive been fair sick with longing for the sight of it myself since the day i joined up and you cried in the city road with your arms round my neck bright as heaven it looked the gas shining on all the sausages when i was all over lice in the line with my jaws chattering thought of it just as i was going over the top once saw the chap in his white jacket cutting a sandwich and smearing the mustard on saw him plain bit i read in a london paper over there said the prewar time now it had passed away seemed like an evil dream it didnt seem like that to me the bad old days of peace the paper called it said all us boys would find it painful to go back to business after the great romance and glory of war i dont think i know one of them that would have given something to be back calling sign in the bad old days of peace while he was sticking that great romance made me feel funny all over to see london again at last and look at the civilian population that was bearing their trials with such heroic fortitude too good to be true it felt till i got a mouthful of what they call beer in this better world i hear weve made and found the lord duke behind the bar treating me as if i was dirt made me wonder if paying sixpence for half a pint was asking for charity seem to have forgotten how to be civil all the publicans now its the law for them to loaf the best part of the day and make you pay so that they do as well in one week as they used to do in three thats what im told by a chap whose uncle has got a pubthe profit on one weeks loafing is about the same as it was on three weeks work done too well in the shops to be civil too i notice while ive been freezing and bleeding in that there great romance its hope the war lasts for ever isnt it mother couldnt bear to go out because of what the neighbours are saying people with sons of their own too it makes me wonder who ive been doing it for theres motherand there used to be you makes me wonder about lots of things religion and that at church on sunday the collection was for teaching our christianity to the heathen the peaceful heathen that arent busy bombing one another and nobody laughed dont make any mistake im not saying england hadnt got to fight england had got to fight right enough because it aint a civilised world but the parsons and the priests and the rabbis and the papers could have said how horrible it was our not having learnt any way to settle things ever since we took to wearing clothes except new ways of slaughtering one another they hadnt got to pretend war was something fine and splendid and improving they hadnt got to pretend war had changed every woman in england to a holy angel and englishmen were finding their souls by driving bayonets through other mens bellies england couldnt help going to war but england could have helped praising war we were told at the start as how armageddon had been led up to by those german writers that had preached the devilish doctrine that war did good they must have had a rare job if they preached it more than our own newspapers were preaching it before a month was up those of them that i saw anyhow if the war has been such an ennobling influence if it has purified us all half or a quarter as much as they keep on saying the kaiser must be the best benefactor england ever had then why dont they put up a monument to him in trafalgar square and what did they want to put the great war for on the shrines i see i should have thought they might have found a better word for it than great aint great bringing up the kids to hold with the lie that war is an ennobling influence like the savages do if i had my way id put the crudest war or the worst war on all the shrines remember how i used to hate gus hooper for his conscientious objector lay well im not keen on him nowhooper may have been a swinebut ive come to see that if war is ever done away with it will be just because the real conscientious objectors are top dog i expect by then they wont be called conscientious objectors and it will sound strange to read how in our time there werent more than a few men or women that didnt think it a virtue to commit murder if you put on khaki even ladies you cant say too much fori mean real ladies not our disgraceful sort them that have been heroines a lot of them and worked themselves to shadowsive heard more than one of them put in a good word for war with they say war brings out mens best qualities you could hear that under their pity for us they approved of war it did come on me as a shock i used to think we were all so uptodate all the finished article if you know what i mean i dont think anybody will look the same to me again quite no matter how smart they are dressed when you look at people in the streets now you can often fancy them as ancient britons coming along naked theres nothing that looks quite the same not sunshine in the parks you cheer up wonderful for a minute and then you feel as if the sunshine was camouflage too war wont ever be done away with because kaisers and governments leave off wishing they could grab something that somebody else has grabbed firstit isnt in human naturebut only because they cant get men willing to kill and be mangled for it civilised warfare might as well talk about peaceful massacre why if this bloody world of ours was civilised thered have been no need for england to go to war or belgium to go to war or anybody else to go to war no need for fritz to go to war we shouldnt have had the worst war at all bill and his war gang would have been seized by the germans themselves and clapped into gaol or a lunatic asylum according to what the doctors said about them went over to skinner and mophams hoping to find you they havent done so bad neither with their heroic fortitude im told the girls that used to run in for sixthreefarthing quills for their hats have been buying separation allowance coats at thirty guineas as fast as hands could pick them off the hooks still mopham passed the time of day with me quite familiar considering proud thought for a young fellow that hes done his duty to his country he says only wish id been of military age myself he says see our roll of honour in the window framed very stylish i think spared no expense to make it a handsome article what for you miss furs forward it was there that i heard you had gone wrong the women are splendid what price the rest made me feel queer last night being so close to you again nelly though you didnt recognise the bit of my face that the bandages let you see i was the cripple by the door of the taxi when you and the toff got in alf xiii a pot of pansies this afternoon it chanced that three men who used to be firm friends were all sitting in the cafe de la paix at the same time they pretended not to notice one another and tonight my thoughts keep reverting to a pot of pansies the pot of pansies that was so great a power i exaggerate nothing it is i pierre camus pressman who affirm it jacques rouelle still struggled as a writer of short stories and henri dufour was already succeeding as a playwright but they remained as cordial as ever no jealousy on the one side nor pomposity on the other their wives too were on affectionate terms in fact the women were cousins as for me i was the comrade of them all in their modest flata great name for two roomsjacques and blanche rouelle would read to me manuscripts and bewail the terms jacques got for them and in their little villa off the rue pergolese henri and elise dufour would talk to me of some comedy that henri was perpending and even confide to me their discomfiture when he had one declined two devoted couples five ardent friends and then by a stroke of fate jacques discovered the pot of pansies i had gone to see him one day and found that he was out blanche however was at home and elise had just dropped in bringing a toy or something for the child very charming and fashionable she looked though i knew her well enough to be sure she had put on one of her shabbiest costumes for the visit she told us that henri had begun the penultimate act of the play on which he had been at work ever since the spring and that he had talked of it recently to martime who was much attracted by the thesis she was in high feather and her elation was natural martime had produced an earlier piece of henris but that had been no guarantee that he would like this one and i knew that henris heart was set on his playing the leading part mind you dont forget to send jacques and me tickets for the dress rehearsal said blanche blithely as if we were likely to forget you or pierre either said the other smiling to me of course we dont know yet that martime will do the piece but he was so enthusiastic about the theme and his part is so good that were pretty confident i daresay he will want some silly alterations made but i dont think theres much doubt about his taking it when its ready how lovely to be able to write for the theatre blanche exclaimed think all the money jacques has had from editors with his royalties from contes du quartier as well is not anything like as much as henri can make with a single play and as if fearing that her cousin might misconstrue her plaint she added emotionally not that i grudge him his good fortune heaven knows i know it too cherie responded elise squeezing her hand jacques innings will come i am very sure it will come it is atrocious that henri and i should have all the luck in the meantime the vivacity seemed to be taking a solemn turn so i put in and what about me for me both your households are too wealthyi blunder in knowing either of you a pauper should never have rich friends tiens that is a novel philosophy said elise inquiringly it is sound what do they yield him at best an invitation to dinner which does not compensate for the despondence he suffers in contrasting their grandeur with his garret the poor devil of discretion associates with people even worse off than himselfand by comparison feels prosperous you old humbug they laughed at me and addressing blanche again elise dufour said wait till those dividends come rolling in he will gnash his teeth more than ever wont he dividends said i what dividends who dares to mention dividends in front of me ah he hasnt heard cried blanche recovering her buoyancy henri is going to get a hundred shares for jacques in a company that is coming out we should not be able to get them ourselves but the man is a friend of henris what do you think of it our making investments isnt it great it is true said elise nodding it will be a very good thing henri means to apply for quite a lot i could guess what it was though not being a capitalist i paid no heed to the bourse and was absolutely ignorant whether amalgamated pancakes were heavy or funded fireworks had gone up henri had chanced to speak of it to me i had no doubt that jacques might do much worse than hold a hundred shares in that concern what do you think of it repeated blanche we have been working eight years to save three thousand francswont it seem wonderful to have a few francs that we havent worked for at all coming in every year she went on talking about it after elise had gone it will be like something in a fairy tale to have a little money falling regularly to us from the skies as it were what it will mean even henri and elise do not know we shall be in a position to indulge in pleasures that sound fantastic now for instance if jacques is out of sorts i shall be able to pack him off to the country to get well today he would not hear of such a thinghe would not touch our nestegg if he were on his last legs and the little one what joy to buy babys clothes without dipping into that to buy him perhaps a little fur coat out of money that poor jacques has not had to whip his brains for wont he look sweet the pet dressed in dividends i wish that you could take some shares pierre but i know then jacques returned seemingly deep in thought and i said come in and make yourself at home congratulations my financial magnate hein he queried what oh that yes it had slipped my mind for the moment he went over to his wife and kissed her tenderly it appeared that he had been out for two or three hours and he demanded with deep anxiety if the child still thrived mais oui goose he sleeps in there said blanche the shares had slipped thy mind ah but listen thou dwellest overmuch on thy workin the end thou wilt have a breakdown but no but no little woman on the contrary never have i felt more fit i have just seen something that is positively inspiring he announced i have seen a suggestion for a short story that is exquisite so we were all attention quite by accident i had been walking aimlessly wandering without noting where i turned when in the twilight i found myself in a long street of decay that struck a chill to my heart the slatternly forbidding houses had an air of hopelessness of evil that made me shudder i tried to classify the denizens but well as i know paris i was baffled i had the impression of entering a street of mysteries it was as if behind each of those morose darkling windows lowering upon me in their hundreds there lurked gruesome things suddenly on the foul ledge of a groundfloor window dim with dirt behind which some nameless stuff was looped further to hide the secrets of the room i saw bloominga pot of pansies i cannot tell you how infinitely fresh its fairness looked in these surroundings how divinely incongruous i stood gazing at it a full minute lost in conjecture who in that sinister house retained the sensibility to tend a pot of pansies what message did it yield her how did she come to be there mon dieu i said a story a great story i was enraptured when i reached a decent quarter i sat down on a bench and lit a cigarette and prepared to welcome the delicious plot that i foresaw emerging from my reverie tell it to us we begged him the fervour of jacques tones abated they were flat when he replied strange to say it did not emerge he said i have not been able to find it yet it will arrive we cried with conviction there should be an excellent story in that ah certainly it will arrive my only misgiving is that i am not worthy to treat it it should be a gem that story a masterpiece it should be a story that will live all the same it piques me that with such a stimulus to write i should have to wait even for an hour i am athirst to begin you will strike the idea before you go to bed i assured him even i though fiction is not my line can see a story there you can see it he inquired eagerly i do not mean that i see the plot but i see the prospects ah yes that is how it is with me he said the prospects are magnificent arent they what delight i shall take in this i may not be capable of handling it as well as it deserves but you are going to see the best short story i have ever done mon vieux well changes in the staff transferred me abruptly to london soon after that and i had no further conversation on the subject with jacques till nearly five months had passed the interval had threatened to be longer still but one must eat why cant you cut an english cooks throat if you dont know the answer you are unaware that in england they placidly consume anything that is put on their plates because there are no english cooks i should like frequently to sojourn in the beautiful countryside of england if it were not so painful to see vegetables growing there when i looked at those verdant young things so full of flavour and nutriment and thought of the fate before themreflected that they were destined to be drowned in hogsheads of water and served as an unpalatable pulp the sight of them used to wring my heart i overtook jacques in the champs elysees one day as i was on my way to call on henri and elise and we strolled along together i said i rather thought you would send me a copy of that story you were speaking of before i went what paper was it published in to my amazement he replied gloomily it is not written i am seeking the plot for it what i exclaimed not written after five months if you could turn out other stories in the meantime why not that one i have not turned out other stories in the meantime he told me i am concentrating my imagination on the pot of pansies i stopped and stared at him ah ca are you in earnest mon dieu it looked very promising but if you mean to spend the rest of your life trying to write it the promise will cost you dear i know it is unpractical of me he owned distressfully i have eaten up a pretty penny i reproach myself but the fascination is overwhelming i cannot withstand it the thing has become an obsession i have been back a dozen times in all weathers to look at the house again but the course has not advanced me in desperation i even rang the bell and asked to see the occupant of that room but the crone who opened the streetdoor was either so deaf or so artful that it was impossible to make her understand what i said let us talk about it there are only three points to resolve who in a house like that has still the sensibility to tend a pot of pansies what does it say to her by what circumstances is she there i remember i remember i said i am not provided with answers to such conundrums at any moment of the day but i could have answered them in less than five months ill swear i added if you like i will find the plot for you in a quarter of an hour some time when i have nothing else to do i did not mean it very seriously and of course i am a busy man at this juncture we saw henri approachinga deuce of a swell in his frockovercoat and chamois gloves though his figure was more protruberant than it had been in the period when he was among the great unacted he hailed us with you rascals you negligent knaves if you greet me once in a century it is by chance how are you darlings we meant to honour you with a visit now i said as it is we will go on and see elise come back and see her too elise has gone to a matinee said henri you shall take a little tata with me instead i am on topping terms with myself and need someone to listen to my boasts i read my play to martime this week all is well when i finished tears were in his eyes good business we exulted hardly less than he when will it be seen asked jacques will he make it his next production ah that is not settled for that matter he has not actually agreed to take it but he has got the script and he is to write to me in a few days i know well enough what is going to happen i shall have to agree that the leading womans part ought to be less strong and then he will tell me the play is flawless you do not mind sacrificing her if i mind well naturally i mind mais que voulezvous my primary desire is martime his vanity is colossal but it is a mans play and no other actor on the stage could do what he will do with it i constructed it for him from the start you may be sure i will make concessions rather than lose martime ah we are rejoicing this piece means a great deal to us you knowit is ambitious work with this if it succeeds ien effet i am promoted to the front rank you are not at the foot of the class now i said ah but i have written for fees rather than for fame it was not good enough to clothe my wife and children in rags because i aspired to wear laurels the day i entreated elise to marry a boy who had not five hundred francs i was guilty of a crime i have never forgotten the confidence she showed in me that daynor her unwavering belief in me while times were bad in truth my wife has but one failingshe admires me to excess according to her every word i write or speak is inspired but it is not odious to be worshipped she is adorable i ask myself what i should do without her they may say some of the pieces i have done so far are of no account i assure you i have had far more joy from scribbling a farce that bought smart costumes or a bracelet for elise than i could have had from evolving classics that left her worried about the washing bill enfin everything comes at last to him who waitseven a fine day in london heinand now i have felt entitled to devote twelve months to a grand attempt and if it is well receivedi do not romance when i say that if it is well received the thing that will make me proudest will be the admiration of my dear wife while he talked on opening his heart to us we strode towards the boulevard and as we proceeded to the boulevard with never a premonition of disaster it is not hyperbolic to affirm that all paris would have failed to display a trio more united presently he inquired of jacques anything wrong with you you are very quiet i search for a plot sighed our friend and was longwinded he has been able to think of nothing but the enchanting story that ought to blossom from that flowerpot and doesnt i explained by this time he might have the points i ponder are three jacques broke in strenuously who in such environment has the fingering sensibility to tend a pot of pansies what does it express to her how does it happen that she is there i do not see anything in it said henri it has no action how the devil can it have action before there is a plot screamed jacques i tell you the atmosphere is superb it is a picture not a story there is no material in it complained henri you have everything to create except the scene the scene is good but we were still discussing the question sipping vermouth at a cafe when someone exclaimed ah you how goes it and looking up i saw that the cordial hand upon the dramatists shoulder pertained to no less eminent a person than martime himself numa henri was delighted the more so when martime consented to sit down at our table and sip an aperitif too permettez two of my oldest friendsmonsieur camus of lelan monsieur rouelle romancier the actormanager did not allow us to imagine we met upon terms of equality but his greetings were gracious to be candid i had been somewhat impressed to hear our chum call him by his christian name i knew of course that henri was agog to learn whether a decision had been reached about his play and i mentally applauded his air of absorption while martime expatiated upon his performance in the present piece after some minutes i glanced at jacques with a view to our leaving the pair together but before we could move henri desirous no doubt of cloaking his eagerness said lightly as you arrived we were in the midst of a literary controversy monsieur rouelle detects promise of a great story where i see none the point is not uninteresting whereupon he launched into a description of the street and did justice to the pansies though jacques did not look as if he thought so cest tres bien ca said martime with weighty nods it is very fine that let me tell you that you have there a poem in no more authoritative a tone could the academy have spoken ah cried jacques you feel it monsieur there in that vile spot the fairness and fragrance of those pansies not fragrance said henri pansies have no smell struck a note sensationally virginal continued jacques with defiance oui oui concurred martime i suppose it was no trouble to him to do these things but the ideality he threw into his eyes was worth money to see we all regarded him intently and i think he liked the situation even more ideality flooded his gaze and he propped a temple with two fingers i am not of your opinion mon cher he told henri profoundly i find it admirable the three questions that besiege one monsieur burst forth jacquesand i shudderedare who biding amid decay has the imperishable sensibility to tend a pot of pansies of what does it speak to her how comes it that she is there and now it was that the famous man was tempted to a fall tout a fait admirable he repeated buthe displayed a cautionary palmabove all no melodrama the keynote is simplicity simplicity and tenderness for example in the squalid room sits a young girl refined though poora sempstress she dreams always of the sylvan vales that she has left and the lover who is seeking for her andit would be very charmingone day the lover passes the window while she waters the pansies oh my dear numa bosh exclaimed henri genially no sooner had he said it than he recognised his error i am sure martimes eyes flashed poniards and his face turned turnip colour with offence perceiving his indignation jacques began to stammer hasty insincerities and henri also did his utmost to palliate the affront but i could not persuade myself that their efforts were successful for a minute or two martime remained stiff and monosyllabic and then with a few formal words got up and went i fear he was annoyed murmured jacques you fear said henri irascibly i was dismayed to hear resentment in his tone though martime had gone the constraint continued and it was not long before we rose as henri and i walked on after jacques had parted from us i said very stupid of martime you spoke in quite a friendly way and still more stupid of jacques to talk about the story to him he flung back at white heat what possible interest could jacques difficulties have for martime childish butpardon me it was you who first mentioned the matter i said ah dont split straws he growled clearly the incident disturbed him more than a little it was probably a week or ten days afterwards that jacques came to me in great perturbation and volleyed what do you think henri has got his knife into me it appears that martime has returned the play and henri says it is my fault oh nonsense i said how can he say that returned the play i am dreadfully sorry i too but what have i got to do with it did you ever hear anything more preposterous to begin with it is not likely that martime would refuse the piece solely on account of what was said that day and even if he did so it was not i who said it it wasnt till yesterday i knew there was anything wrong blanche met elise elises manner was rather strange and blanche wondered but she had no idea there was any illfeeling naturally she inquired if henri had heard from martime yet then it came out that henri held you responsible blanche was condoling she said what a cruel disappointment for you both dear and elise said coldly yes indeed it is very unfortunate that jacques discussed his affairs in front of martime blanche poor girl was thunderstruck of course she explained to elise exactly what had happened but elise replied with something very vague and when i telephoned to henri he was not himself with me at allhe was very brusque he said i have no wish to talk about the matter there is not the least doubt that he is angry i will have a chat with him said i i went the following day but he had gone to have a turkish bath and elise who received me begged me not to mention the play when i saw him his finest work that took him a year to do practically wasted she said in a stunned fashion it is frightful he is stricken it would be kinder of you not to say anything about it to him yet awhile ill tell him that you came but practically wasted i demurred he will be able to place it with some other management will he not he may but it is not the kind of play for every management and anyhow we shall not get martime in the part it will never now be the immense success that it would have been what an idiot to reject a great part because his vanity was wounded you are certain that is the explanation there is no question about it the script was returned in the most formal waya line to say it was unsuitable henri was prostrate prostrate my poor henri you may realise what a blow it was i am feeling very anxious about him i have persuaded him to go away for a few monthsi am taking him to biarritz what a calamity his meeting jacques that afternoon ah but listen i urged jacques is terribly cut up that henri is bitter against him and between ourselves it is a shade unjust it was not jacques who affronted martime nor even jacques who first referred to the subject it was henri himself henri made a passing allusion she protested jacques made an eternal discussion of it he would never let it drop henri is never unjust he is fairness itself i have never known anyone who was as fair as henri always is also he is not bitter against jacqueswe are not so smallminded that we forget old friendships because of an indiscretion when we come back i shall of course go and see jacques and blanche as usual i have nothing against blancheit was not her fault that jacques was so tactless oh well useless to try to convince people of what they dont want to believe i told jacques that she and henri were going away and predicted that he would find the unpleasantness over when they returned and as a matter of fact i did not attach deep importance to it until a certain morning the sight of a prospectus led me to inquire of jacques if the shares he had been counting on were allotted to him he answered passionately no at that i was startled i asked if he had made an application for them i did not see anything about it soon enough he raged henri had told me to leave it all to him and not a word have i had from him even if i had applied i should not have got them what malice blanche is brokenhearted i will never forgive him for her grief it is not as if i had been seeking a gift at his handshe could have made money for us without its costing him more than a postage stamp an opportunity to do such a service for a friend comes to a man once in a lifetime no his spite against me for nothing is so intense that deliberately he turns his back on the chance it is disgusting we could not believe we could not think it possible he had been such a swine after all his promises so i got his address from the bonne and telegraphed to him you should see his answerthe letter of a stranger on consideration he had not cared to take the responsibility of recommending an investment to me liar blanche cried the whole night through i will never speak another word to him as long as i live and i do not want to see elise either blanches own cousin to show such animosity what a despicable pair words will not express my regret i said and i am amazed at henris attitude but you cannot be sure that elise knows anything about it why should she not know he scoffed i do not suppose that henri can feel very proud of himselfhe may not have confided in her besides elise said she meant to go on seeing you the same as ever that being so she would hardly encourage him to break his word to you in the meanwhile i think you are being unfair to elise henri has been more unfair to my poor blanche he bellowed i do not hear so much of your sympathy for her it was an infamous reply to make but he was in the mood to quarrel with anyone that was handy and i had the magnanimity to let it pass i was sympathising sincerely with blanche and i sympathised even more when i saw her she spoke with less vehemence than jacques but it was evident he had not exaggerated her dejection it seems incredible she said it shows that you never really know anyone nothing could have persuaded me that henri had it in him to behave so badly if you had heard him talking to us about the shareswhat a benefit they would be to us and now to avenge himself for an imaginary wrong she gave a gulp you dont think elise knows ah yes he and she are one in everything i assure you what it would have meant to us to get dividends however small the sums might have been what a godsend to poor jacques driving his pen all day he is working harder than ever to make up for lost timehe has had to put the thought of the pot of pansies aside for the presentand i could cry as i watch him by the way you were going to try to find a plot for that did you nothing occurred to me i said i could say nothing to cheer her either then or later though i often looked in at the flat and did my best and to inflame the indignation the shares rose they rose and went on rising and jacques who had hitherto never so much as glanced at closing prices developed a morbid interest in following their advance i shall not forget the day about three months after the issue when i learnt that they were quoted at forty francs and that if henri had kept his word my host and hostess would have doubled their capital i shall not forget it for two reasons the lamentations they gave way to were exceedingly trying to me on that very afternoon elise walked in i had not known that she was back else i should have prepared her for the situation blanche ignoring the proffered embrace tendered the tips of her fingers and jacques bowed as to a woman he had never seen before elise turned very pale her scared eyes sought mine and i tried by the warmth of my greeting to mitigate the moment for her what is the matter she faltered of us all it is only surprise at your visit said blanche sarcastically impossible to avert it the storm broke just as i surmised elise had been unaware of henris misdeed but though her consternation was only too apparent jacques and blanche were in no mood to let it influence them the tirade against henri to which jacques condemned her was bad to bear she quivered under it she could do nothing but stammer painfully i forbid you to insult my husband i forbid you to insult my husband blanche knew how to stab too in her pathetic voice ah it is useless to talk elise she sobbed as a rich woman you do not understand what three thousand francs would have done for us three thousand francs we have been scraping for eight years to put by as much as that and if henri had been fair to us we should have doubled our means already three thousand francs to jacques who in all his life has never had a son that wasnt wrung out of his poor tired head it is the wickedness towards him that i resenttowards him and our child and what is the cause that henri is unmanly enough to hate another for his own mistake ah it is too petty and contemptible of him for words but remember it is not elises fault i begged i saw that she could endure no more say these things to henri both of you if you mustnot to her blanche is in no need of your corrections shouted jacques hysterically attend to your own affairs my wife talks to her cousin as she thinks fit it is always elise you champion if you feel so deeply for our enemies i wonder that you come here i could scarcely credit my ears but i said very quietly with dignity indeed i shall not put you to the trouble of wondering twice and as blanche remained silentfor which she was very culpable for i looked towards her as i movedi offered my arm to elise who was so much deranged that she could hardly get down the interminable staircase and took her home in a cab as will be readily understood i had no ambition to assist at her next conversation with henri and i did not intend to enter the house unluckily when the cab stopped he was on the veranda and he came to the gate comment what is it he demanded seeing her agitation she is rather upset i said i wont come in yes yes come in tell him what has happened gasped elise peremptorily whereby she in her turn committed a grave fault for she made me witness matrimonial dissension of which i need otherwise have had no knowledge she has been to see jacques and blanche i said following them into the salon ah said henri with reserve yes i have been to see jacques and blanche she panted and a nice time i have had there he decided on hauteur i am quite at a loss if one of you will explain as she looked at me i said they told her you had not done as they expected about the shares i rather gathered that there was some tendency towards feeling hurt hurt on reflection i saw that i had not the right to advise jacques to speculate what of it they do not view it as a speculation i said they much they know of business did you take shares yourself queried elise the cases are not parallel he contended his voice rising excitedly jacques is a poor man i did not feel justified in letting him risk money oh henri she wailed you know very well that was not the reason it was not loyal of you it was very very wrong already it would have been a little fortune for them no wonder they are aggrieved i cannot be surprisedmuch as i have suffered this afternoon i cannot be surprised at what i have had to hear what you have had to hear you have heard that i did not choose to assume the responsibility of conducting another mans affairs and then ah je men fiche i am fed up with jacques i have had to hear you broke a promise because you were meanspirited enough to blame him for your own gaffe to martime she cried of my husband i have had to hear that no i cannot be surprised at what they said they said it was petty and contemptible of youand so it was for an instant it was as if she had hurled a thunderbolt henri stood inarticulate his eyes bulging from his head then bringing his fist on to the table with a blow that made every ornament in the room jump he roared you dare to say it to me your husband you dare to say such a thing you shall ask pardon at once in the presence of the friend who has heard the insult and as it was obvious she would do nothing of the kind he went on without loss of time no i forbid you to apologiseit is vain there are insults that apologies cannot abate a husband who is contemptible to his wife is best apart from heri can find comprehension elsewhere i was having a pleasant daywhat with one menage and the other i was having a pleasant day there ensued a quarrel the more harrowing from the fact that the recriminations poured from a pair whom i knew to be at heart lovers and as often as i endeavoured to steal out either henri or elise would pounce upon me to confirm some point that did not matter when i got away at last my need of stimulant was insupportable i had naturally expected to receive a penitent missive from jacques that night and when there was a knocking at my door i did not doubt that he had come to beg forgiveness in person but it was henri who flung in and dropped into a chair enfin i go back no more he groaned he took my breath away you are mad i stuttered what you part from a wife you adore and who adores you because of a hasty word are you a boy to behave so wildly cest inoui there are words and words his face twitched and crumpled it is because i am not a boy that i see clearly we could never again be happy together the madness would be to try to sit every day opposite a woman who is thinking me contemptible merci i could not endure it every meal every moment would become a hell ah if she were thinking it really but she spoke impetuouslyshe had had much to try her she had only just left jacques and ah mon dieu mon dieu what i owe to that man he vociferated what everlasting afflictions his telling me of his accursed pansies first it annihilated my prospects and now it rends me from my wife and children i shall stipulate that they live with me for half the year but what of the other half while they are being taught that the father who loves them so dearly is a contemptible man disgusting to their mother he rocked to and fro also how am i to make a home for them when they come i leave the villa to elise i cannot afford two establishmentsabove all now that i have lost the production by martime and may never see a son from work that has occupied me for a year malediction on that pot of pansies now listen he had been to the last degree unreasonable but he was suffering and i have a good heart i guarantee that this separation will not last a week i shall have a talk with elise with elise it is i who make the separation he objected with a piteous attempt at dignity and further i have no hostility against you but it is partly through your own talks with elise that she is lost to me ah yes i had stared at him stupefied i understand that you said to her at the time that i was guilty of injustice towards jacques i do not say you traduced me with any vicious motive but unquestionably your irresponsible chatter paved the way to the catastrophe that wrecks my life my turpitude notwithstanding he wept in my room till am keeping me up and he and elise too proved very distressing to me during the days that followed she was equally headstrong i was surprised at her you mean well but pray say no more it is inevitable she answered me tremulously as for that stupid affair of jacques and blanche i daresay i may have misjudged henri they dont understand as a business man no doubt he did what was really best in their own interests i perceived that her commiseration for them had much decreased since it involved her in domestic strife but his conduct towards me i have done with him i am not a fool to imagine an honourable man would desert his wife for a reason like that a performance he did not even forget his razor strop let him go to her he was not an angelno writing man isbut i thought he loved me and i never complained because i admired him because he was the one man in the world to me behind the curtain it hung not even in sight and he did not forget it when he packed brute you heard him say he could find comprehension elsewhere she will not keep his linen in such order as i have done that ill swear to pretend it was just because i believed what jacques and blanche had said i believe nothing that they say i detest them oh they have made a pretty mess of my life those two she was illogical but i was much displeased with jacques and blanche myself the previous day i had seen them in the street it is true that they cast ingratiating glances but in the circumstances they should have done a good deal more and i very properly looked away yes for fully three weeks the estrangement of henri and elise made demands on my time and since each of them viewed the other as the aggressor their criticisms of each other were not unduly diffident nevertheless i continued to do all in my power for them i implored henri to return and i besought elise to write to him though it was no recreation to me to keep pressing counsel upon people who told me they did not want to hear it when there were two consecutive days without henri despairing in my chair the lull was welcome i cannot depict my joyful surprise the next evening on seeing them issue radiantly from the restaurant noel peters arm in arm i had had no news of the reconciliation i rushed to them and clasped their hands hurrah i exclaimed thank goodness how delighted i am the trouble is over their greeting appeared to me a shade constrained oh that didnt amount to much henri mumbled brushing my reference aside no one supposed it did laughed elise lightly and as i found myself at a loss what to say next there was a pause we are going to a theatre said henri we are rather late after a glance at his wife he added in flat tones you will dine with us one night hein ah yes said elise perfunctorily of course when i went we did not allude to what had happened nor was the conversation on general topics as animated as when i had dined there hitherto for the first time at their table i was depressed and it was the last invitation from them i received probably i was embarrassing to them by reason of their having railed against each other to me while they thought they would never make it up also though henri could forgive his admiring wife for once calling him petty and contemptible one may be sure it was bitter to him to remember i had been present when she humiliated him that both he and elise resented my sharing the secret of their separation was as clear as daylight for some months afterwards if i chanced to meet them they would stop and exchange a few words with me but by and by they contented themselves with smiling and finally they preferred to pass without perceiving that i was there when that play of henris was produced two or three years later he had become so alien to me that i should never have dreamed of going to see it if i had not got in for nothing the leading man was not capable of the part and the run was shortby which henris enmity against jacques was doubtless intensified the two couples that used to be so intimate remain at daggers drawn and both couples are strangers to me i do not think there is anything to add excepting that the story of the pot of pansies has not been accomplished to this day the tragic history that i have related is the story of the story that was never found xiv floromond and frisonnette floromond and frisonnette who were giddy with a sense of wealth when they acquired three rooms and had flowers growing on their own balcony and sat upon chairs that they had actually bought and paid for held a reception one fine day the occasion was a christening floromond and frisonnette were of course monsieur and madame jolicoeur and they dwelt in the part of paris that was nearest to arcadia among those present were monsieur tricotrin the unadmired poet monsieur pitou the composer of no repute monsieur lajeunie whose stirring romances so rarely reached a printing office and monsieur sanquereau the equally distinguished sculptor though the company were poor in pocket they were rich in benevolence and since the dearth of coppers forbade silver mugs they modelled their gifts upon the example of the good fairies advancing graciously to the cradle the bard bestowed upon the female infant the genius of poesy epics and odes he declared shall fall from her lips like the gentle dew from heaven and symphonies said the musician she shall drop as nimbly as the newly rich drop needy friends that she might be equipped more fully yet for the stress of modern life the novelist endowed her with the power of surpassing narrative while the sculptor in his turn contributed to her quiver the preeminence of praxiteles then frisonnette hung over her baby saying and one boon besides let her marry her sweetheart and always remember that a husbands love is better than an ermine cloakan allusion which moved floromond to such tenderness that he forthwith took his wife in his arms regardless of us all and which reminded your obedient servant of their story when floromond beheld her first she was in a shop windowthe most tempting exhibit that a shop window had displayed to him in all his fiveandtwenty years if he had stayed in the quarter where he belonged it would not have happened it was early on a spring morning and she was posing a hat for the enticement of ladies who would tread the rue la fayette later in the day floromond sunning himself like a lord though he was nothing better than a painter went on to the garden of the tuileries noting how nicely the birds sang and thinking foolish thoughts had i a thousandfranc note in my pocket instead of an importunate note from a washerwoman ran his reverie i would go back and buy that hat and when she asked me where it was to be sent i would say i do not know your name and address mademoiselle then having departed without another word leaving her speechless with amazement and delight i should never see her any moreuntil not too long afterwards we found ourselves by accident in the same omnibus ciel how blue her eyes were and though he did not omit to reprove himself in the most conscientious manner and the weather changed for the worse his admiration drew him to the rue la fayette at the same hour every day frisonnettes demeanour behind the plate glass was propriety itself but she could not be unconscious that the young mans pace always slackened in the downpour as he approached madame aureolesshe could not be insensible of the homage of his gaze that tuesday morning when dripping he bowed his salutation was so respectful that she felt she would be inhuman to ignore it so the time came when they trod the rue la fayette together making confessions to each other after the shop shut i used to wonder at first whether you noticed me as i went by he told her wistfully i noticed you from the beginning she owned you have such a funny walk the day that you were late my watch was in pawn sapristi how i raced it makes me perspire to think of it i took five minutes longer than usual to dress the window waiting for you if i had guessed and you didnt divine that i came on purpose she shook her head i used to think you must be employed somewhere about what you took me for a clerk asked the artist horrified only at the start i soon saw you couldnt be thatyour clothes were too shabby and your hair was so long i could have wished you to correct the impression by reason of my air of intellect however to talk sensibly could the prettiest girl in france ever care for a man who had shabby clothes and a funny walk well when she was beside him she would not remark them much said frisonnette shyly but i do not think you should ask me conundrums until you have talked politics with my aunt i feel sure she would consider it premature mademoiselle said floromond i am rejoiced to hear that your aunt has such excellent judgment few things would give me greater pleasure than to agree with her politics as soon as you can procure me the invitation and one day floromond and frisonnette descended the steps of a certain mairie arm in armfrisonnette in a white frock and a nutterand the elderly gentleman in the salle des mariages to whom brides were more commonplace than blackberries looked after this bride with something like sentiment behind his pincenez a policeman at the gate was distinctly heard to murmur what eyes and so rapidly had the rumour of her fairness flown that there were nearly as many spectators on the sidewalk as if it had been a marriage of money with vehicles from the livery stables the brides aunt wore her moire antique with coral bracelets and at breakfast in the restaurant she wept but as was announced on the menu wedding couples and their parties were offered free admission to the zoological gardens pianos were at the disposal of the ladies and an admirable photographer executed gratuitously portraits of the couples or a group of their guests at the promise of being photographed in the moire antique a thing that had not occurred to her for thirty years the old lady recovered her spirits and if tricotrin in proposing the health of the happy pair had not digressed into tearful reminiscences of a blighted lovestory of his own there would have been no further pathetic incident floromond and frisonnette like foreigners more fashionable spent their honeymoon in paris for of course frisonnette had to keep on selling aureoles hats home was reached by a narrow staircase which threatened never to leave off and after business hours the sweetheartsas ridiculously enchanted with each other as if they had never been marriedwould exchange confidences and kisses at a little window that was like the upper half of a punch and judy show popped among the chimneypots of the slanting tiles as an afterthought it is good to have so exalted a position said frisonnette there is no one nearer than the angels to overlook us but i pray you not to mention it to the concierge or our rent will soon be as high as our lodging the faint object that you may discern below my floromond is paris and the specks passing by are people they must not pass us by too long however beloved said floromond i am a married man and awake to my responsibilities it would not suit me by any manner of means to share you with millinery all your dear little life more than ever i have resolved to be eminent and when the plate glass can never separate us again you shall have dessert twice a day and a bonne to wash the dishes my child murmured frisonnette come and perch on my lap while i talk wisdom to you for you are very young and you have been such a little while in paradise that you have not learnt the ways of its habitants it chagrins you that you cannot give me dessert and domestics and a cinema every saturday night but because i worship you my little sugar husband because every moment that i pass away from you among the millinery seems to me as long as the rue de vaugirard i do not think of such things when we are together to be in your arms is enough life looks to me divineand if i find anything at all lacking in our heavens it is merely a second cupboard now since you are too heavy for me you may jump down and we will reverse the situation i have strange tidings to reveal to you said floromond squeezing the breath out of heri adore you frisonnette they remained so blissful that many people were of the opinion that providence was neglecting its plain duty here was a thriftless painter daring to marry a girl without a franc and finding the course of wedlock run as smooth as if he had been a prosperous grocer with branches in the suburbs the example set to the youth of the quarter was shocking and a year passed and two years passed and still the angels might see floromond and frisonnette kissing at the attic window then one afternoon it happened that a french beauty hastening along the rue la fayette with tiny toppling steps as if her bust were too heavy for her feet found herself arrested by a toque on view at aureolesand entering with condescension was still more charmed by the assistant who attended to her the chance customer was no one less important than the wife of finotfinot the dressmaker finot the famousand at dinner that night when they had reached the cheese she said to the great man my little cabbage at a milliners of no distinction i have come across a blonde who could wipe the floor with every mannequin we boast she is as chic as a model and as bright as a sequin she is just the height to do justice to a manteau her neck would go beautifully with an evening gown and she has hips that were created for next seasons skirt let her call said the great man adding a few drops of kirsch to his petit suisse she would be good business i assure you declared the lady she talked me into taking a toque more than twice the price of the one i went in forme well i shall have to find a pretext for speaking to heri must go back and see if there is another hat that i care to buy it is not necessary replied her husband go back and complain of the one you bought so the lady talked to frisonnette in undertones and frisonnette listened to her in bewilderment not quite certain whether she was twirling to the top of her ladder or being victimised by a diabolical hoax and the following forenoon she passed by appointment through imposing portals that often she had eyed with awe and finot having satisfied himself that she had brains as well as gracefor they are very wide of the mark who think of his pampered mannequins as elegant mechanical toyssignified his august approval frisonnette went home and described the splendours of the place to floromond who congratulated her with a misgiving that he tried to stifle and later on she told him of the dazzling dejeuners that were provided repasts which she vowed stuck in her throat because he was not there to share them and not least she sought to picture to him the gowns that she wore and sold o visions of another world there are things for which the vocabulary of the academie francaise would be inadequate such clothes looked too celestial to be touched but she was a woman though her head was spinning as finots mirrors reflected her magnificence though she was admiring herself inimitably she accomplished so casual an air that one might have thought she had never put on anything cheaper in her life and being a woman she did not suffer from a spinning head very long she soon became acclimatised in the daytime frisonnette ate delicate food and sauntered through stately showrooms robed like a queenand in the evening she turned slowly to her little old frock and supped on scraps in the garret and now her laughter sounded seldom there gradually the contentment that had found a heaven under the tiles changed to a petulance that found beneath them nothing to commend her gaze was sombre and often she sighed and the misgiving that floromond had tried to stifle knocked louder at his heart by and by the little old frock was discarded and thrust out of view and she wore costumes that made the garret look gaunter still for with her increased salary and commissions she could afford such things floromond knew no regret when she ceased to speak of bettering their abode insteadhis pride had revolted at the thought of astonishing their neighbours on his wifes moneybut the smart costumes made her seem somebody different in his eyes and moodily he felt that it was presumption for a fellow in such a threadbare coat to try to kiss her what a swell you are nowadays the poor boy would say forcing a smile and frisonnette would scoff a swell this rag as she recalled with longing the gorgeous toilettes that graced her in the showroom one treasure there she coveted with all her soul it was an ermine cloak so beautiful that simply to stroke it thrilled her with ecstasy only once had she had an opportunity of luxuriating in its folds under its seductive caress she had promenaded on the aubusson carpet for the allurement of an americaine who after all had chosen something else the mannequin used to think that she who possessed it should be the proudest woman in the world and twice the painter had been wakened to hear her murmuring rhapsodies of it in her sleep if i could sell my ariadne and carry her away to some romantic cottage among the meadows he would say to himself disconsolately then she would see no more of the fangles and folderols that have divided usshe would be my sweetheart just as she used to be but the best that he could do was to sell his potboilers and a romantic cottage among the meadows looked no nearer to his purse than a corner mansion in the avenue vandyck that the fangles and folderols had indeed divided them was more apparent still as time went onso much so that frequently he passed the evening at a cafe to avoid the heartache of watching her repine but it was really waste of coppers for he thought of the change in her all the while and when he lagged up the high staircase on his return he was remembering at every step the frisonnette who formerly had run to greet him at the top you are a devoted companion she would remark bitterly as he entered what do you imagine i do with myself in this hole all the evening while you stay carousing outside i imagine you sit turning up your nose at everything as you do when i am with you he would answer hiding his pain then frisonnette would cry that he was a bear and floromond would retort that her own temper had not improved which was certainly true and after she had exclaimed that it was false and stamped her foot furiously to prove it she would burst into tears and wonder why she remained with a man who not content with forsaking her for cafes came home and calumniated her nose and her temper besides meanwhile finot had been contemplating her performances on the aubusson carpet with rising respect his versatile mind was now projecting the winter advertisements and he determined to entrust to his best blonde one of those duties which from time to time rendered the luckiest of his mannequins objects of unspeakable envy to all the rest finots advertisements were conducted on a scale becoming to a firm whose annual profits ran into millions of francs mon enfant he said to her you have been a very good girl and though you may think you are rewarded royally already as indeed you areand here followed an irritating dissertation upon the softness of her job to which she listened with impatiencei am preparing a treat for you of the first order how would it please you to travel for a couple of months or so a little later on to travel i she stammered you and one of the other young ladies monte carlo vienna rome rome ejaculated frisonnette who had never dreamed of reaching any other rome than the one on the metropolitain railway mademoiselle piganne would contrast most effectively with your tints i think he screwed up his eyes yes we could hardly evolve a colour scheme more delicious than you and mademoiselle piganne whatever capitals we may decide on you will stay at the hotels of the highest standing all matters like that you will do best to leave to the judgment of the chaperon in attendance on you both otherwise you might have the unfortunate experience to find yourself in an hotel not exclusively patronised by the cream of society your personal wardrobe for which you will be supplied with from twelve to fourteen trunks will consist of those creations of my art which best express my soul and your affair will be to attract sensational attention to them while preserving an attitude of the severest propriety that is imperative remember no english or american mother with her daughters beside her must for a single instant doubt that you are morally deserving of her closest stare an open carriage in the park where the climate permitsa stage box at the opera when the audience is most brilliant will of course suggest themselves to your mind but again the duenna and the manservant will organise the programme as skilfully as they will look the parts all that will be required of you is a display brilliant and untiring the rest will be done by others every woman everywhere will instruct her maid to find out all about you and your own maidan employee of the firm in a humble capacitywill have orders to whisper that you are a princess travelling incognito and that your dresses come from me frisonnette could do no more than pant i will speak about it at home monsieur at once and because she foresaw with resentment that floromonds approval would be far from warm she broached the subject to him very diffidently at the back of the little head that finots finery had turned she knew well that if her bear betook himself too often to cafes it was mortified love that drove him to them so she made haste to tell him it might be the best thing for you to get rid of me for a couple of monthsi should return in a much better humour and you would find me quite nice again you think so frisonnette said floromond with a sad smile what do you mean she asked paling i mean he sighed that after the brilliant display it is not our menage under the tiles that would seem to you idyllic repose heaven knows it goes against the grain to beg a sacrifice but if you accept such luxury i feel that you would never bear our straits together again do not deceive yourself little one you would be leaving me not for two months but for ever deep in her consciousness had lurked this thought too and she turned from him in guilty silence you are fond of me then she muttered at last in spite of all if i am fond of you groaned floromond ah frisonnette frisonnette there is no moment even when you are coldest that i would not give my life for you i curse the poverty that prevents me tearing you from these temptations and making you entirely mine once more if i were rich it is i who would give you boxes at the opera and carriages in the park i would wrap you in that ermine cloak and pour all the jewels of boucherons window in your lap i will not go she cried weeping forgive me forgive the way i have behaved i have been wicked yes but i repent it is endedi will not go and that night she was proud and joyful to think she would not go it was only in the grey morning that her heart sank to remember it i must decline she said to finot hesitatingly i have a husband ii could not take my husband mon enfant your husband would not grudge you the little holiday without him one may be sure it was like being barred from eden and the ermine cloak she faltered could i take the ermine cloak the tempter smiled one cannot doubt that among fourteen trunks there would be room for the ermine cloak he told her suavely one november evening when floromond came in his wife was not there he supposed she had been detained in the showroomuntil he groped for a match and then in the dark his hand touched an envelope stuck in the box he trembled so heavily that before he could light the lamp he seemed to be falling through an eternity of fear he read i am leaving you because i am frivolous and contemptible i dare not entreat your pardon but i shall never make you wretched any more when he noticed things again from the chair in which he crouched he found that the night had passed and daylight filled the room he was shuddering with cold and he got feebly up and wavered towards the bed she did not ponder her words babbled the aunt who came to him aghastshe will return to you when the two months are over and she is back in paris you will see she pondered longer than you surmise and she will never return to me he said and what is more a man with nothing to offer can never presume to seek her no i have done with illusionsshe will be no nearer to me in paris than in monte carlo frisonnettes paris and mine henceforth will be different worlds floromond lived without frisonnette among the clothes that she had left behind the dainty things that she had prized had been abandoned now that she was to be decked in masterpieces they hung ownerless the peignoir and tricot and dressesthe pink and the mauve and the plaidgathering the dust and speaking of her to him always she has soared above you dishclouts he would cry sometimes half mad with misery it was you who first estranged usnow it is your turn to be spurned and as he tossed sleepless his fancy followed her or pacing the room he projected some passionate indictment which on reflection he never sent you should try to work his reason told him if you worked you might manage to forget in minutes and setting his teeth he took palette and brush and worked doggedly for hours but he did not forget and the result of his effort was so execrable that he knew that he was simply wasting good paint then because work was beyond him and his purse was always slimmer he began to make dejeuner do for dinner too and not long after that he was reducing his rations more every day it was a haggard floromond who threaded his way among the crowds that massed the pavements when some weeks had passed the boulevards were gay with booths of toys and trifles now great branches of holly glowed on the baroques of the flowervendors at the street corners and the restaurants where throngs would fete the reveillon and new years eve displayed advice to merrymakers to book their tables well ahead my own rejoicings will be held at home said floromond and during the afternoon of new years eve it was by a stroke of irony that the first comrade who had rapped at the door since frisonnettes flight came to propose expenditure two places go begging for the supper at the cafe des beaux esprits he explained blithely and it struck me that you and your wife might join our party quite select mon vieux they promise to do one very well and five francs a cover is to include everything but the wine my wife has an engagement that she found it impossible to refuse said the painter huddled over the fading fire and as for me i am not hungry the other stared there is time enough for you to be hungry by midnight that is a fact assented floromond i may be most inconveniently hungry by midnight but i am less likely to be scattering five francs in plain french my dear bonvoisin if you could lend me a few sous i should feel comparatively prosperous i am like the two places at the beaux espritsi go begging bonvoisin looked down his nose i should have been overjoyed to accommodate you of course he mumbled but at this season you know how it is what with the pestilential tips to the concierge and the postman and one thing and another i am confoundedly hard up myself all my sympathy said floromond amuse yourself well at the banquet and he sprinkled a little more dust over the dying boulets in the grate to prolong their warmth outside big snowflakes fell the man who has never known poverty has never known his fellowman he mused i would have sworn for bonvoisin he has inspired me with an apophthegm howeverlet us give bonvoisin his due and to take a rosy view of things turkeys are very indigestible birds and since i lack the fuel to cook it i am spared the fatigue of going out to buy one for my mahogany tomorrow really there is much to be thankful forthe only embarrassment is to know where it is to be found if i knew where enough tobacco for a cigarette was to be found i would be thankful for that also how the mediterranean sparkles and how hot the sun is to be sure we shall get freckles she and i wont you spare me half of your beautiful sunshade frisonnette upon my word i could grow lightheaded with a little encouragement i could imagine that the steps i hear on the staircase now are hers fortunately i have too much selfcontrol to let fancy fool me nevertheless as he leant listening his face was blanched the steps drew nearer i know of course they go to the room on the other side a moment more and they will pass he told himself holding his breath but the steps halted and a timid tap came it is a child with a billthe laundresss child i know thoroughly it is the laundresss childi do not hope he lied tearing the door open and frisonnette stood there asking to come in i have run away she quavered her teeth were chattering and her fashionable coat was caked with snow i should have come long agoonly i was ashamed you are real said floromond touching her you are not a dream every day i have longed to be back with you and at last i could bear no more do you think you might forgive me if you tried there is a tear on your cheek and your dear little nose is pink with the cold and the snow has taken your feathers out of curl he answered laughing and crying let us pretend there are logs blazing up the chimney and we will draw one chair to the hearth and tell each other how miserable we have beenor better than that how happy we are but still she clung to him shivering and condemning herself and so she repeated i ran away it is a habit i am acquiring finot is furious he has dismissed me i have no job and no money i have come back with nothing my floromond but the clothes i stand up in andand why do i find you with an empty coalscuttle ma foi he stammered loath to deepen her distress as usual that imbecile of a charbonnier has neglected to fulfil the order he becomes intolerable she faltered is that why i notice that your tobaccopouch is empty too oh as for the tobaccopouch said the young man in this ferocious weather i have been reluctant to put on my hat it is natural murmured frisonnette but her eyes were frightened and she investigated the cupboard and when the cupboard was discovered to be as empty as the pouch and the coalscuttle she rushed to him in a panic you are starving she moaned you have starved here while imon dieu i have not come home too soon tut tut said floromond are you trying to pose me for a hero of romance i have been an idle vagabond that is all the cat is out of the bag thoughyou have come home ma frisonnette adoree and i have nothing for your welcome but my embrace and thinking of the want that lay before her he broke down i love you i love you floromond she wept i love you he sobbed i love you frisonnette then in the fading daylight arose a plaintive crythe wail of the itinerant wardrobe dealer chand dhabits chand dhabits she gasped and darted to the window chand dhabits she screamedand stripped the smart costume from her and stood triumphant in her petticoat before the dealers aged legs had toiled up half the stairs she was back in the little old frock that had been cast aside hook me my floromond and her eager arms were laden and her frozen hands showered raiment on the floor the peignoir and tricot and dressesthe pink and the mauve and the plaid we dine tonight she laughed enter chand dhabits and word of honour observed floromond when the clocks of paris had sounded twelve and the pair sat digesting their beefsteak and toasting their toes and she rolled another cigarette for him word of honour you have never looked more captivating than you do nowthat frock becomes you marvellously at the same time the fine clothes i have been gobbling lie somewhat heavy on my sensibilities particularly the fascinating ribbons of the peignoir if only i had kept my nose to the grindstone ah if only we had something better to expect than this handtomouth existence alas on new years day i cannot give you even a bunch of flowers and at that moment hurrying feet approached the houseyoung and excited voices were heard below and what should it prove to be well what it should have proved to be was that his ariadne had in some ingenious way been purchased for a large sum without his knowledge and that a contingent of the quarter had arrived to proclaim his affluence but as a matter of semisober fact it was only a posse of exhilarated students wishing everybody the compliments of the season and playing le chemin de lamour on a trombone still there was a beautiful morning as we know when floromond and frisonnette had flowers on their own balcony and three rooms and chairs that they had actually bought and paid forto say nothing of the baby the moral of which is that there are more new years days than one and its never too late to hope so let us all hope now the end
