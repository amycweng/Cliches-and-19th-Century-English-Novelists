greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in jesus christgalatians iii introduction the chief fault of the quaint companions is that it ends mr merrick is no follower of the wellmade novel school he accepts his liberties as an english novelist and this book has not only the beginning and middle and end of one story but the beginning and some of the middle of another the intelligent reader would be the gladder if it went on to that second end and even then he might feel there was more to be said for this book is about the tragedy of racial miscegenation it is perhaps the most sympathetic and understanding novel in its intimate everyday way about the clash of colour and raceprejudice and racial quality that has ever been written in english and its very merits make its limitation of length and scope the more regrettable it is not a book to read alone one should go from it to le chat maigre of m anatole france and good collaterals to it would be mr archers through afroamerica and mr hesketh prichards where black rules white on the whole the strength of the book lies rather in the earlier part of it elisha lee is the realest most touching individuality in this little piebald group of secondrate humanity he has as the vulgar way of the studio puts itguts when he is hurt he swears and the heart of the reader responds david lee is a weakling diffusing a weakness over all the story of his development the story loses spirit as he replaces his father he is sensitive without strength and expressive without pride he writes he wields what is ultimately the most powerful weapon a man can take into his hand the pen he has we are told the moving touch what more is needed for pride and happiness apparently the normal gratification of a healthy guineapig all mr merricks skill will not reconcile us to the pathos of davids disappointment at the loss of a pretty fool or make us see in him and bee anything more than two unreasonably despondent beings who have merely to look up to rejoice in the gifts of understanding they possess this second story is not a tragedy but a misunderstanding and when mr merrick should begin to elucidate that when indeed he has just got to the gist of his enthralling subject and brought his quaint companions together he sounds a short unjustifiable note of sentimentalityand ends since when mr merrick closed this story eighteen years have passed it is now possible to tell a little more of the fate of bee and david they did come into closer juxtaposition even as mr merrick foreshadowed indeed availing themselves of the wilder courage of these latter days they married they had no children bee developed a practical side that was extraordinarily sustaining to david she learnt to write and he adventuring beyond the delicacies of his earlier days began to produce short fantastic pieces of fiction that had an immense vogue in america but why confine ourselves to the limit of let us glance on a few years davids longdeferred success was now at hand the younger generation hailed him with the utmost delight his name became almost a symbol for the revolt against the lengthy crowded novels of bennett merrick wells cannan compton mackenzie and their elderly contemporaries david was inordinately praised by the aged but still active yeats and elected an original member of the new academy of literature which had just received its charter mr gosse was extremely nice to him davids slight melancholy his effect of illusage patiently borne has never quite deserted him and the subtle charm of bees crumpled sweetness became more and more recognisable with the passing of the years perhaps like the sailor who wanted to fight the villain of the play i have been a little carried away by the reality of the figures before me how real these people are so real are they that one can take them out of their authors hands and look at them in another light and not destroy them that is a very good test of created reality elisha lee is a memorable and unique figure he stands for something that has never been done in fiction before and he is done so well that he must necessarily become a type in our memories he lives in my mind just as micawber or peter quint live and i would never be surprised to find myself in a railway carriage with mrs lee and his stepson how disagreeable they would make the journey bee i did actually see the other day in the hampstead tube she did not look up but i knew that it was bee and how admirable too is professor sorrenford and his comic opera but why go on yielding to a modern convention among publishers that good wine needs a bush and being eager to set my admiration for and interest in mr merrick on record i have written this but having subscribed my testimony i very cheerfully gesture the reader on to the book hg wells chapter i lee had not returned from the concert alone gregarious at all times he never found solitude so little to his taste as when he left the platformwhen he was still excited by the fervour of his voice and the publics applause two of the other soloists had driven to the hotel with him and he had taken them up to his sittingroom to give them champagne and proffer fat cigars though his guests resented his prosperity too bitterly to need reminding of it he had changed his dresscoat for a smokingjacket of plumcoloured velvet and was complacently conscious as he crossed his slippered feet on the windowsill that neither of his fellowartists would fail to notice that he wore silk socks there was a pause in the vociferous conversation somewhere in the distance a clock struck a quarter to one like his companions he had arrived here only in time for his engagement but unlike them he was remaining a fortnight for his pleasure his gaze wandered from their sprawling forms to the view outside the night was fair and behind the silent parade the decorous sea of brighton shimmered becomingly under a full moon fifteen years had slipped by since he was in brighton last and in his mind they were momentarily effaced by a perfectly natural process there rose in the stillness beyond the uncurtained window the apparition of his first love neither of the other men in the room saw it indeed she lingered there only an instantjust for a heartbeatthough some enchantment played upon the scene after she had gone lee turned in his chair and followed the girl into the past in reality he was thirtyone in fancy he was sixteen she had been beautiful even in retracing his youth by the light of experience he would not wrong her by a lesser word she was beautiful and there was justification for his homage but heavens in retrospect he was humiliated to perceive his shyness he beheld his blunders and his ignorance with dismay how very young he had been at sixteenhow very young to be sure the discovery caused him a distinct shock for at the time he was convinced that he was exceedingly old for his age and he had never been back till now to see if it was true he recollected the evening when she first dazzled him he had gone to the theatre here and the overture was not more than half over when his sight was smitten by a girl sitting in the next row she had the slightly disdainful air which becomes a girl to whom the gods have been bountiful and whose dressmaker has done her duty he watched her as man watches woman in the stage when he has yet to realise that she is mortal she was with a lady whose features seemed familiar to him and presently he remembered the ladys name she was mrs tremlett and the girl could be no other than ownieownie who when he stayed in their lodginghouse a few summers since had been in short frocks of a truth it was a very pretty incident and the ordinary boy would have pronounced it jolly luck but heo lout how stupid he had been how selfconscious and impossible you and ownie must want to talk over old times a simple kindly soul the mother he recalled her suggestion and the divinitys involuntary glance at her white kid glove as he released her hand the sentiment of the evening his tremors and his painful struggle to think of something to say recurred to him though fifteen years had gone by since the audience dispersed as they streamed out ownie tremlett had turned with a smile to look at herself in a mirror in the vestibule that was vivid the girls movement and the reflection of her figure with the flimsy white thing over her hairquick with the warmth of yesterday his absurdity of the following morning recurred to him too he had lately acquired a trick with a loop of string and had tramped the town tirelessly with a piece of string in his pocket thrilling with the thought that it might draw their heads together he recollected that at last he had met her but that he didnt show her the trick after allsomehow the careless reference to it that he had rehearsed stuck to his tongue he had said how dye do and agreed that brighton was very full there was a humming in his ears that dulled her voice and he had been obliged to keep clearing his throat he was rather relieved to bid her goodbye reviewing the period he could not remember that there had been any more excepting that he had had the emotion of bowing to her on several occasions yes that was all that had happened really in the lyric that he made up about her things had gone furtherin that he had saved her life and married herbut actually he had said very little and forgotten her very soon nevertheless she had been his first love and his thoughts strayed to heror to his own boyhoodtenderly tonight he wondered if she lived here still and if it often surprised her to reflect that the lad whom she had once known had risen to fame she must be his own age or rather more the fact struck him queerly the cruelties of life had bruised her nowtime had dimmed the radiance of the girl who had patted her golden hair in the mirror for years she had not flitted across his memory but being where he was he saw her again his interest revived and gained ephemeral strength he hoped she was not unhappy the pause came to an end one of the visitors yawned and said something about making a move lee went downstairs with them and they accepted a cigar each from his jewelled case to smoke on their way of course he cant help it said the cellist to the baritone tentatively as they got into stride but he does grate on a gentlemans nerves a bit eh the baritone took his arm and foresaw a cheerful walk what can you expect of a nigger he said with a shrug i always say its a damned insult to us to put us in the same programme as a black chap have you got a matchthis cigar isnt burning straight in the cardroom the gas was still alight and lee went in for a minute to open a local directory he had forgotten the number but her home had been in regency square the name of mrs tremlett appeared agreeably as the tenant of sunnyview house ownie no doubt though was married his youth sang clear to him when he went to bed and it was not entirely mute next day when he took a stroll after breakfast he smiled at his idea but turned attentive eyes and hoped for what he felt to be unlikely it was his humour to declare it possible that he might pass her and he thought that he would know her if they came face to face so elisha lee the negro tenor sauntered along the brighton front looking for ownie tremlett where he had looked for her fifteen years before chapter ii the month was november and the kings road wore its smartest air this was in the time before brighton boasted so many places of amusement and while it was much more amusing people promenaded on the roof of the aquarium after dinner then the pier at night twinkled with diamonds and la fille de madame angot was the popular selection by the band lee had stopped at a florists and bought a rose for his buttonhole in his elaborate toilette twirling a tortoiseshell stick and with his hat tilted a trifle to one side he bore himself proudly nearly all of the last nights audience idled on the front he marked with painful eagerness the quick glances the occasional whispers he provokedalways avid of signs of recognition always fearful of reading derision of his race sometimes at a look he caught his teeth met behind his great lips and fiercely he reminded himself of his empire while he sang it was not so they looked at him then these insolent womenwith the curious stare that they might have levelled at a showmans freak no he could make their cold eyes misty and their hearts throb faster sway them and thrill themhe with his voice the man was to be pitied though nobody pitied him and there were thousands who would have changed skins with him for the sake of his income he was not without vulgarities he was vain he was prodigal his failings were the failings of the average negro intensified by the musical temperament and a dazzling success but he had his higher hours and in these he was doomed to be alone he could buy gay company but he could never gain affection there were many who would laugh with him but there was none to give him a sigh when he reached regency square he hesitated for an instant and then moved slowly up it he had no intention of calling at the house but he wanted to look at the windows again it was pleasurable to stroll round the square it had not changed at all it was just as he remembered it he remembered the bushes at the top of the enclosure and that they had been known to him as the brigands lair a military band used to play three times a week on the lawn when he was a child and he wondered if it did so now as he neared mrs tremletts the door opened and a woman came down the steps she walked listlessly ahead of him his full black eyes dilated and he paused agape presenting a rather comic appearance as the negro so often does when he is in earnest he thought that he had discerned a likeness to ownie in her face but it had flashed on him only for a secondin the circumstances he was very liable to deceive himself he saw that she was in mourningmore that the veil depending from her bonnet proclaimed her a widow he followed she turned the corner and quickening his pace he arrived in preston street just in time to see her enter a fishmongers her position during the few minutes that she remained there was unfavourable but when she came out the view that he caught of her could scarcely have been better and now he was tempted to address her on the chance of being right she passed him before he had thought what to say and he loitered behind her discreetly until she went into a greengrocers a display of fruit offered an alternative to his waiting on the pavement this time he would order some grapes to be sent to his hotel he would order some grapes and utter his name loudly so that she heard it if he had really found ownie she might bow her business was concluded however and she left the shop before anyone attempted to serve him some minutes were wasted before he was free to pursue her he took hasty strides afraid that she was lost her veil came in sight again at the end of the street and dodging among the crowd on the kings road he kept at close quarters to her for a long while wishing that she would cross to the other side and sit down at the foot of ship street she crossed to the other side at last but she did not stop until she reached marine parade on marine parade there were fewer visitors a nursemaid narrated her wrongs while her charges imperilled their necks on the railings here and there a bowbacked man who owned a bathchair enjoyed a respite and a pipe a sprinkling of convalescent londoners basking in the summer weather forgot their shivers in the city of gloom the lady settled herself on a bench lee lounged nearer she was paler and more languid than he recalled her he could see shadows about beautys eyes which the mirror had not shown to him at the theatre but he felt sure it was she though he had believed himself prepared to find her changed he found the difference saddeningjust as if he were a white man and a girl of whom he used to be fond had been met after many years as he drew level with her she noticed him with a quick frown evidently she had misconstrued his interest he stopped and throwing away his cigar with a nourish said miss tremlett the lady in widows weeds looked surprised and indignant and he added hurriedly thats the name i knew you by dont you remember me im elisha lee her expression was astonished still but the indignation had faded when he heard her voice oh she said oh are you i didnt know you again fancy yes i remember its a long time ago let me see he said it must be fifteen years i recognised you at once she regarded him more kindly and gave him a faint smile i shouldnt have thought you would hows that im not shortsighted do you know i was thinking about you yesterday hoped i should meet youand here you are i havent been in brighton since the last time i saw you havent you really no its funny isnt it ive often been comingfor the weekend or a concert but something has always turned up to prevent me well this is firstrate were you at the dome last night no she said i couldnt go i was sorry i heard you in liverpool once let me congratulate youthough i suppose you get such a lot of congratulations that you dont care much about them any more you can bet i care for yours he said have you been living here all the time oh no i left here when i married i only came back after my loss her tone was bitter i saw said lee i saw by your dress thatis it long since you were left a widow twelve months my home was in liverpool while my poor husband was alive why you used to know him mr lee yes of course you did that summer as children we were all together how strange im not sure if you met him afterwards i wonder if you can remember reggy harris the longforgotten name awoke memories of a pastyfaced boy peppered with freckles who had always called him snowball he bowed solemnly for a moment it deprived the situation of all its sentiment to hear that she had married reggy harris things happen queerly dont they she said with a short laugh i married and i left brighton for goodand i sit telling you about it when i am in regency square all over again i never thought i should come back any more excepting on a visit of course i used to come to see mother i hope your mother is well he said yes she answered thank you it was mother who was certain from the first that the singer we read about must be you i had forgotten you were called elisha but she was sure you were and the elisha settled it we did stare i thought you would but im not the only elisha where i come from by a long chalk biblical names are very common among us we like them in savannah where i was born i daresay youd find a good many elishasand as to lees theyre as plentiful as pins you stared eh it seemed wonderful well yes it did but your parents werewere musical too werent they my parents came over here as ban joists when i was a kiddy they played jolly well are they living he shook his head i am quite alone in the world he said theatrically they were spared to see me famous though im glad of that they must have been ever so proud of you they were ever so good to me he replied and his manner was natural again they got decent terms in the musichalls and they sent me to school and did all they could for me it was on one of their tours you know that i stayed in your house they paid some people to give me a good time during my holidays god bless em there was a brief pause a little child trailing her toy spade lagged to a standstill and watched him expectantly he drove her away with an angry gesture the lady blushed i think i must be going she murmured rising ive got to meet my baby and the nurse if you sing down here again mr lee i hope i shall hear you ill sing to you whenever you like he said promptly wont you and mrs tremlett come and have dinner with me at the hotel one evening ive got a piano in my sittingroom my mother so seldom goes out at night let me ask her and do a bit of coaxing oherif you can of course she said though im afraid it would be no good we shall be glad to see you he swept off his hat and took leave of her buoyantly while they talked he had ceased to contrast her with what she used to be and thought only of the young and pretty woman who was present having less refinement than when she was a girl too she made him a more intimate appeal the vulgarities in her blood had come to the surface by this time at seventeen to be a gentlewoman superficially is not impossible but at thirtytwo the varnish cracks he saw her again himself unnoticed as he was returning to lunch a little nursegirla cheap imitation to be called a nurse he thoughtpushed a perambulator and the widow walked drearily beside it threading her way among the fashionable toilettes she looked poor and discontented to him she looked sullen like a woman who resents her fate but she had blue eyes and yellow hair and he had never resisted a desire in his life he promised himself to call on her the next day chapter iii he went early in the afternoon and he found her more cordial than on marine parade though he gathered that she had been unprepared to see him so soon he was shown into a small back parlour reserved for the familys own use and when he entered she was in a rockingchair with her baby on her lap at his playful advances it began to cry and it wailed continuously while he paid it the usual compliments and heard that it was fifteen months old and christened vivian the only one he asked as the noise subsided yes she said i lost my little girl how nice of you to remember your promise i made sure youd forget that was very wicked of you you ought to have known better didnt i show you what sort of a memory ive got well really you did i cant think how you knew me again why you havent changed much he said you were just as goodlooking then dont be so foolish she bent over the baby i knew you directly i caught sight of you you were just coming out of the house what this house were you passing he nodded grinning and i followed you into preston street i saw you in preston street she said you came into the greengrocers didnt you yes but first id had to wait outside a fishmongers oh i had a heap of trouble before i got a chance to speak to you i can tell you you looked solee was fraid did i she gave him instinctively the glance she would have given to a white man oh i had no idea who you were you know i thought thought my admiration infernal cheek eh didnt you look me up and down when i came to the seat sir how dare you you meant i knew his jolly laughter shook him and startled the baby into a fresh outbreak well i was all right when i understood now wasnt ithere there pet suck his ribbons and let his mummy talkdo you know ive got something to ask you mr lee after you had gone it struck me you might be able to give me a hint i want to make use of my voice i thought perhaps you would tell me the best way to set about it i have written to people already but they dont answer andhis mummy will have to send him away if he isnt quiet make use of your voice he said doubtfully oh yes ill help you with pleasure if theres anything i can do but what is it you mean i was thinking of concert singing only in a small way of coursei know i cant expect to do anything marvellousbut ive had a lot of lessons and in liverpool i used to practise hard my masterif youll excuse me for a minute ill take baby upstairs he excused her for that purpose readily and when she came back her mother was with her he found that mrs tremlett had altered too but in the most surprising way when he was a lad she had looked quite old to him and now she looked only middleaged she was the widow of a novelist who had written such beautiful prose that many people had been eager to meet himonce afterwards they talked less about his prose than his manners he had left her their daughter a policy for five hundred pounds and an album of carefully pasted press cuttings during his life she had suffered with him in furnished apartments at his death she took to letting them she was a wellmeaning weaknatured creature for forty years she had related her dream of the previous night over the breakfasttable and read the morning paper after supper she religiously preserved the reviews which she had never understood believed that darwin was a monomaniac who said we sprang from monkeys and that mrs hemans had written the most beautiful poetry in the world mother was quite excited when she heard i had seen you said mrs harris werent you mother you were a very bad girl what do you think mr lee she came home and said that athat ashe gulpeda strange man had stopped and spoken to her such a thing to say and she didnt tell me who it was for ever so long he understood that he had been referred to as a nigger she deprecated her blunder to the younger woman with worried eyes and the latter struck in hastily i was just telling mr lee what i want to do mother he thinks he might help me oh now im sure thats very kind of him indeed you see mr lee its not altogether nice for ownie here and of course having had a home of her own she feels it more still well dear you do its no good denying it if she had something to take her out of herself a little it would be so good for her in every way and we always thought she would make money with her voiceits a magnificent one really mrs harris shrugged her shoulders to talk about its being magnificent in front of mr lee is rather funny but if i could make even a secondrate position she went on i should be satisfied id try for an engagement in a comic opera if i thought i could act but im afraid i should be no good on the stage and one has to start in such tiny parts we had a lady staying with us who used to be in the profession and she was telling us how hard the beginning was and do you imagine that concertengagements are to be had for the asking he said good heavens but of course you dont know anything about the musical worldhow should you i dont imagine that they are to be had for the asking she returned a shade tartly but if one can sing well enough the platform must be easier for a woman like me than the stage by all accounts accounts he echoed whose accounts i could give you accounts that would make your hair stand up do you know that professional singers with very fine voices come over from the colonies to try to get an appearance here and find they cant do it they eat up all the money that theyve saved and go back beggared they go back beaten and beggared it is happening all the time my dear girl you couldnt make a living on the concertstage under five years if you had the voice of an angel not if i had bad luck i daresay she muttered i tell you nobody can do itit isnt to be done it would take you five years to earn a bare living if you were a miracle the americans and australians try it for two or three and clear out with broken hearts and empty pockets its killing they starve while they are struggling to be heard ill give you an example a singer with a glorious voice came to englandi say it glorious i wont mention his name it wouldnt be fair but mind this is a fact he had worked hard in his own countrythey believed in him there they got up a benefit for him before he sailed he had three thousand pounds when he landedand he spent every penny trying to get a footing here and went home in despair do you know that when i give a concert even artists who are making a living go to my agent and offer him twenty twentyfive thirty guineas to be allowed to sing at it they pay to be allowed to sing said mrs tremlett but why should they do that because they cant get into a fashionable programme without and its worth paying for singers who have been at the game half their lives do it i tell you im not supposed to know i dont get their money i leave the agent to engage the people to support me and if he makes a bit extra over the affairwell he forgets to talk to me about it but its a usual thing easy for a woman he turned to mrs harris again and rolled his black head easy poor soul she looks so fine doesnt she when she sweeps down the platform in her satin dress and lays her bouquet on the piano oh dear lord if you knew what she has gone through to get there and what it has cost her to get there and how she has pigged to buy the bouquet and the satin dress you think if you can sing thats all thats wanted do you you can wait and beg for years before an agent will hear your singing and when you are heard at lastif your production is firstrate and the quality pleases him and you are a smart and agreeable woman and you have found him at the right momenthe will ask how many pounds worth of tickets will you guarantee and in spite of everything some women get on she said one would think nobody had ever had an immense success to hear you talk one would think there had never been a patti or ah jehoshaphat an immense success with an immense successwhen it comesyoure the cock of the walk when a woman has made an mmense success she can fill the albert hall and move the world she can move even the english and hold them breathless in the gallery though they have got no chairs and the notices forbid them to sit on the floor the singers who make immense successes are the kings and queens they maynt be able to act or to talkthey may be as stupid as geese but god has given them this wonderful power nobody knows why and sometimes with his other hand he gives them a black skin nobody knows why at the unexpected reference to his colour mrs tremlett started as if she had been pinched and her daughter murmured well i thought you might be able to do something for me i see you only think that im very foolish i havent heard you yet i just warn you what sort of a life it is at the beginning id do any blessed thing i could for you what is your voice come sing to me now oh not now ownie exclaimed the landlady the drawingroom people are in dear and you know they complain so of every sound you are still called ownie i see he said mother used to call me her little own her little ownie when i was no higher than that i believe she raised her hand about a foot from the tableand i have been ownie ever since i suppose i shall never be anything else now though i was christened lilian augusta my voice is contralto ill sing to you the next time you are hereif the lodgers are out she added with a harsh laugh one must consider the lodgers the lodgers heard baby crying in the night and were surprised we didnt keep it in the coalcellar at least thats what they seemed to mean oh my dear protested mrs tremlett feebly im sure they didnt mean that mrs wilcox had gone to bed with a bad headache and was just dropping off to sleep she only said she complained when she thought it belonged to the diningrooms when she heard it was mine she was astonished at the impudence of a landladys daughter in having a baby oh im not finding any fault with what she saidbut her tone was very resentfula lodginghouse isnt the place for a child i know its a little hard on poor baby perhaps thats all lee felt very glad when he rose that the piano had not been opened that she was inhabiting a castle in the air he had no doubt whatever and he flinched from the task of shattering it the woman of thirtytwo who had had a lot of lessons was now a pathetic as well as an alluring figure to him and she did not lose her pathos in the following days for he often met her and she never failed to recur to her desire in their earliest meetings she was considerably abashed in walking beside him and being conscious of his colour at every step always declared herself bound for the least frequented parts but soon she lost much of this embarrassment and even came to take a nervous pride in the increased attention she attracted she reminded herself that it was not as if she were with an ordinary negro or as if he were a famous negro who wasnt recognised nearly all the people they passed knew he was elisha lee and there was nothing to be ashamed of in being seen with him he looked less repulsive to her too on acquaintance she now remembered having noticed niggers with much wider nostrils than those that had looked so wide to her a week ago and his lips didnt seem to protrude so much as they had done at first it was a pity they were so dark if it hadnt been for his lips he really would not have been repugnant at all there was nothing to make one shudder in a merely black skin when one grew used to seeing it and he carried himself splendidly as to his ears if they had only been white they would have been the prettiest ears she had ever seen on a man little delicate ears set close to his head and he could interest her like most of his people he told a good story well and he was full of anecdotes of the musical celebrities it made her feel nearer to the platform to be admitted to the artists room in his confidences but though she hankered after the platform and spoke of her ambition daily she was not an ambitious woman in the sense in which many women are ambitious who besiege the offices of the musical and dramatic agents she was a dissatisfied woman it was not notoriety she thirsted for so much as means she wanted moneythe road by which she earned it was a detail if somebody had left her an independence she would not have been eager to sing at all her life was sour to her as a schoolgirl she had understood that her prettiness was damaged by her surroundings when she was twelve years old she had felt that the hateful card printed furnished apartments in the window ticketed her cheap it was the first card to deteriorate that square that has fallen from grace the society in which girls went to dances and sat on the stairs with rich young men was as unattainable as a carriageandpair she had nothing to expect she looked down on the tradespeople and the residents looked down on her she couldnt even write novels as her father had done and hope to escape her environment in that way she had married when she was fiveandtwentynot so soon as she would have married in happier circumstances not so well as she would have married but for the card in the window she married a furrier even this had been an improvement for her she wore her first sealskin and tasted the joy of comparative extravagance but the business had failed and the bankrupt had died and then there was nothing for her but the brighton lodgings again it was in his sittingroom in the hotel that she at last sang to lee he had asked her and mrs tremlett to luncheonwondering how much he could contrive to spend on itbut the landlady had declared it was impossible for her to leave the house and ownie had come alonefor ten minutes just to hear his opinion she had begged him to let her sing the song through without interrupting her and he said nothing until she finished it had hurt him very much to hear her sing for a few minutes he had almost forgotten her eyes and hair his thick black fingers lingered on the final chord of the accompaniment with thankfulness and with dismay he did not know how to undeceive her well she demanded he struck e f and f sharp still hesitating you use too much force there in swelling the tone of your head voice he said those are your weak notesthey are mine too they are the weak notes with all tenors and sopranos after g the crescendo is easy enough but the e f and f sharp are devils you call my voice soprano she exclaimed why my range is range did your master tell you that the range makes the voice contralto or soprano its the colour of tone not that he kept striking and restriking the notes without looking at her she observed the diamonds on his hands enviously do youare you trying to tell me im no good she asked with a little gasp you have been badly taught he said awfully badly i expected it your voice has never been placed thank you she said its kind of you to be candid she was very pale i suppose theres nothing i can do toto make it all right im afraid not said lee and all because ive been badly taught oh i dont say that it has done harm of coursethe natural colour of the voice isnt there but i dont thinkif you want me to tell you the truthi dont think you could ever have done what you hoped under any circumstances there was a long silence then she forced a smile and put out her hand goodbye she said youre not going like that ah you make me feel a beast do you want it so much think of the hardships youd have to go through even if you could make a start cheer up things arent so bad after all arent they she muttered she sank into a chair why you arent obliged to earn a livingyou have a home anyhow plenty of women havent that there are plenty of them worse off than you i give you my word there arent she cried theres nobody worse off than i am some people are resigned to drig on all their lives and never have enough of anything im not resigned i hate the scrimping and scraping and the peal of the lodgers bells and the drabs of servants who think they can be impudent to you because you let im sick sick sick of it all i got away from it once and now im in a back parlour again with never a soul to speak to how would you like it but you dont know what loneliness means how can you understand what i feelyou why should you say i cant understand he answered because my name is printed in large letters on the bills and ive got all that you want i havent got all that i want doesnt it strike you that inside here i may feel all that a white man feels though no white woman will ever feel the same for me ah thats news to you eh but its true people say of fools like me oh he keeps low company hes happiest in the gutter liars some of us take what we can get thats all the moon we cry for is over our heads and we make shift with its reflection in the puddle i do know what loneliness meanswhen i let myself think about it do i think about it often no not me im not such a blooming fool i enjoy but the knowledge is there and the loneliness is worse than yours money i make pots of moneyi never sing under eighty

happy no youre not you still want something well with me its the same i still want somethingand i shall go wanting all my life so shall i she returned she picked the rings up one by one and held them out to him with a sigh what you wont keep them he inquired though his impulse had taken a theatrical form it was quite sincere keep them she looked at him amazed do you mean to say you really gave them to me to keep why shouldnt i give them to you ill give you anything you like go on put them on ortheyre too big for youput them in your pocket yes i mean ittheyre yours oh she exclaimed i cant keep things from you likebut youre joking i mean it he repeated bless me why not i want you to have them theyre a present you must be mad she faltered i cant accept presents from you its very kind of youvery generousbut it isnt possible he extended his hand an inch at the time she laid them in the yellowish palm and watched him slip them over the fingernails that looked as if they were bruised her heart dropped heavily it wasnt rude to offer them to you was it he asked i didnt mean to offend you you know im not offended she said butbut ladies cant take presents from mennot valuable presents hundreds of pounds worth of rings mustnt i give you anything the rings magnetised her she couldnt wrench her gaze from them what for are you so sorry for methe idiot who thought she could sing its not that its nothing to do with your singing sweets may i give you sweets iher eyelids felli suppose so what else why should you give me anything at all because i want to because ilike you ownie tell me what i can get for you he leant nearer to her she quivered in realising what he meant her physical impulse was to repel him and the cravings of her mind tempted her to let him hope she hesitated a moment get me some sweets then she said unsteadily i must go or i shall be late chapter iv when the time came for him to return to town mrs tremletts firstfloor lodgers left her and lee took the vacant rooms though his headquarters were in london it was understood that he meant to run down to brighton very often during the winter and he explained that he would find private apartments more to his taste than an hotel telegrams from different places were received from him every few days and in sunnyview house the theatrical element in his nature found its supreme expression profuse at all times he surpassed himself here he was infatuatedblind to everything but the passion that had sprung up in himand he meant to show the woman whom he burned to marry the sort of thing he could bestow on his wife the housemaid accustomed to speculating whether the parting tip would be a halfcrown or five shillings was dumfounded by a sovereign almost as often as he rang the bell the supply of roses in his room made it look like a flowershow prize peaches were ordered only that they might be left to rot on the sideboard and he had two bottles of champagne opened daily for the effect of banishing them to the kitchen threeparts full he had not failed either to place a liberal interpretation upon sweets the rain of bonbons and bouquets that descended on the discontented blonde in rusty crape could hardly have been more persistent if she had been a prima donna and his prodigality made the desired sensation in a household where the drawingrooms usually took mental photographs of the joints before they were removed mrs tremlett it horrified but to her daughter there was a strong fascination in it a fascination even more potent than it exerted over the servantsa class who rejoice at extravagance whether it be their own or other peoples she was not backward in deriving the moral she too might enjoy this lavish life if she allowed him to ask her the chance had befallen her so suddenly that it dizzied her she felt strange to herself she could not realise her point of view his admiration for her had improved his appearance very much but it could not quell the race prejudice entirely she knew that if he had been a nonentity she would have found his homage preposterous and ardently as she longed to embrace the life that he could open to her she shrank from the thought of embracing the man she was aware nevertheless that she was precipitating a moment when it would be necessary for her to take a definite course and she was not surprised to hear mrs tremlett broach the subject to her one afternoon the landlady was making out the diningroom bill and ownie had been sitting upstairs in the twilight while lee sang to her at the grand piano that he had hired as soon as he was installed in the morning he practised his cadenzas and phrases alone but in the afternoon he sang and had begged her to go up assuring her that a vocalist needed someone present at such times he had omitted to add that he needed a true musician to sing to her intoxicated him to listen to him stimulated her when his fancy ran riot and he thought of falling at her feet to fall at her feet was his mental picture he always saw himself doing it in an hour like thiswhile the dusk befriended him and his voice was pleading in her senses have you been in there again ownie yes she said pulling the rockingchair to the fire it wasnt very long was it he wants us to go to his concert next week at the albert hall hed like us to stay the night at an hotel of course we should be his guests and it would be a nice change i told him id speak to you about it sleep in town at an hotel oh no dear i shouldnt think of such a thing whatever for because he has invited us because hes going to sing i said i didnt think youd go for the night but we might run away in time to catch the last train i dont much care about going alonethough he wants me to do that if you wont come wants you to go alone she made a blot and put down the pen wants you to go alone as his guest she repeated yes why shouldnt i still if youll come too how can i go and leave everything to look after itself besides it wouldnt be right as to your going alone that would be worse still im sure i dont see dont see what mrs tremlett hesitated dont you think the servants will begin to talk she murmured you know what i mean dear youre up there so muchand hes always sending you things of course i shouldnt like him to leave but its a pity he doesnt see that he oughtnt towell im sure the servants are talking when i wanted you just now about the deposit on the bottles ada said oh shes with mr lee maamid better not call her out i could see what she thought though i pretended not to notice anything what did she think well dear she thought thatthat he was paying you attentions and so he is the poor fellow its quite natural i daresay that he should take to you but i should make him understand that he mustnt be foolish before it goes any further if i were you of course with a man like that it maynt be serious but you cant tell what ideas he may have in his head can you you mean he might ask me to marry him said ownie slowly is that it well my dear i suppose thatridiculous as it sounds i suppose that is what it might come to and of course it would make unpleasantness and we should have the drawingrooms empty at the worst time of the year much better to keep him in his place and to show him that it would be no good ownies abrupt little laugh sounded she swung herself to and fro in the rockingchair rather violently if i did that i think youd have the drawingrooms empty at once his place his place is funny why sometimes hes paid as much as a thousand pounds for four nights and im a pauper you take it for granted then that if he asked me i should say no mrs tremlett looked bewildered her gaze fell and wandered helplessly her brow was puckered when she spoke wouldnt you say no she faltered why should i oh of course if you could care for himof course in the sight of heaven were all equal but it isnt as if he were a white man is it and you scarcely know him i know who he isi might do a good deal worse for myself than marry elisha lee i should be a rich woman i dont think youd be very rich dear it seems to me he must spend every penny he makes even if he does get a thousand pounds for four nights sometimes besides if you mean to marry him just for what he can give you im afraid youd be very miserable youre not a girl i know and you must judge for yourself in these things but i dont think any amount of money would make you satisfied with what youd done if you dont care for himand im sure i dont see how you can when i married your poor father when you married father he had nothing i know and youve had nothing ever since the children of people who marry on nothing are seldom as sentimental as their parents were you were brought up in a comfortable home and so you were romantic and said moneys the least thing i was brought up in a lodginghouse and so im practical and put money before everything else i think she exclaimed i think its wicked that people who make improvident marriages should brag of the folly to their poor children afterwards i am not bragging dear but when a woman has loved her husband she never admits that their marriage was a folly even in her own thoughts a man she sighed a man i am afraid sometimes does as i say youre not a girl and you must know your own mind but the idea seems awful to me i would never have believed you could think of doing such a thing ownie flushed and her shoe tapped the floor irritably just because he is black she muttered where is your religion i thought you said just now that in the sight of heaven all men were equal in heaven no doubt he will be as white as the rest of us returned mrs tremlett after a slight pause but in the meantime hes a nigger and i cant think it would be right her daughter did not reply nor did the elder woman summon courage to recur to the matter she was however relieved on the morrow and the next day to notice that her remonstrance had borne fruit and that ownies visits to the drawingroom were discontinued lee who passed the two days in hourly expectation of them was first restless and then enraged the besetting tendency of the negro in his intercourse with europeans is to take affront and he told himself that her neglect was an insult which she would never have dared to put upon an englishman he left brighton this time without any adieu and he was absent for longer than usual there were two reasons for his going back when he did when women say of another womanas they are often heard to saythat there is nothing in her to explain infatuation they babble for there is no young woman however commonplace who may not appear unique to some man one of lees reasons was that his desire to see ownie again was fevering him the other was that he wanted to know if she meant to occupy the box that he had kept for her he returned late and he had no hope of seeing her that night but he spent the following morning between the windowshis hat and fur coat on the tablewaiting for her to leave the house she had no sooner done so than he descended the stairs with elaborate carelessness and manoeuvred until they came face to face oh mr lee she said so you are back again his resolve to ignore his grievance succumbed to the temptation to reproach her for it i didnt think you knew id been away he said sulkily not know you had been away the innocent wonder of her tone was unsurpassable i hadnt seen you for a long time when i went have you forgotten that a long time she smiled two days wasnt it it seemed a week to me now she had trembled during his absence and though she was as far as ever from knowing whether she wished to marry him she knew at least that she did not wish to avert his asking her so she shot a glance at him before her eyes were lowered and said one cant always do as one likes you know a platitude and a pair of eyes are sometimes potent he walked on beside her mollified what about the concert he inquired ive saved the box for you oh have you she stammered i dont quite know im afraidhave you really saved it rather dont say you arent comingyou as good as promised have you spoken to your mother yes she cant gothats to say she says she cant theres nothing to prevent her but shes so funny you know i dont see how i can go alone why not that would be jollier still dont be unkind i should sing so much better if you were there such nonsense she said iill see of course i should like it awfully ill think about it and tell you tomorrow and on the morrow she told him that she was going she was dogged though mrs tremlett sighed protests her life was dull enough she insisted she meant to extract the little amusement that was to be had lee went to town again jubilantly he had arranged to meet her at the station when she arrived and to travel back with her at night she was to go up in the afternoon and to take her evening frock in a trunk on the day of the concert she found him at victoria attended by a gentlemanly person who he explained was his valet as he greeted her he tossed away a cigar which he had just lighted for that purpose he felt it must impress her with his breeding to see him throw away a long cigar the valet seemed to have little to do but to show that he existed lee led her to a brougham and they were driven to the hotel that was then the most fashionable and ushered into a sittingroom glorified with roses a chambermaid conducted her to a bedroom here more flowers did her honour and on the dressingtable were bottles of scent the largest that could be bought and all of different colours in front of the armchair that had been rolled to the fire was a pair of velvet slippers with the sort of buckles she had coveted in the east street windows she thrilled with a sense of her importance the buckles fascinated her so much that she put the slippers on at once and went back to the sittingroom in them though in his excessive admiration he had chosen a size that cramped her toes she had scarcely rejoined him when a waiter appeared with tea and petits fours she observed that lee was addressed as if he had been a prince arent you going to have any she asked i mustnt he said i must run away in a minute but theyll look after you all right here dont be afraid im not she said laughing did the manager provide the slippers she raised her foot coquettishly and resented her stockings im sure you might have a cup of tea and a biscuit if you may smokei saw you throw away a cigar as you met me he was gratified that this effect had been remarked oh thats nothing he said smoking doesnt hurt you say so because you like it well smoke now then may i why of course you may if it really isnt bad but i always thought it was awful for singers some fools say so mario always smoked just before he sanghe was the only man ever allowed to smoke behind at covent garden i do wish i could stop if you knew how glad i am youve come im glad too she said but i wont encourage you to do anything wrong go home and she was going to say think of me but she felt that her elation was carrying her too far and do your best she added remember i am coming to applaud you he remained for about a quarter of an hour and as soon as he had gone she took the slippers off and spread her feet on the hearth in comfort at halfpast six the deferential waiter appeared again accompanied by anothermute but seeming to deprecate by his shoulders the liberty of moving on the same planet with her for the first time in her experience she dined perhaps because she was a woman the appointments impressed her more than the cuisine but she appreciated the menu too she enjoyed the oysters the strange dark red soup the sole with prawns and little mushrooms and things on the top she liked the bird and the pink frilled cutlets with a wonderful sauce the omelette in blue flames the silver bowl of strawberries and cream inserted in a block of ice the resplendent sweet representing a castle and glowing with multicoloured lights astonished her and the wines that flowed into the glasses stole through her veins deliciously she had not long set down her coffeecup when she was informed that the brougham was at the door she left the tiny flagons of liqueurs untouched and ran back to the bedroom to grimace at her toilette and dip her puff in the powder again in the brougham she felt even more opulent than she had done when lee was beside her in it she felt almost as if it were her own she wrapped the rug about her knees and looked out luxuriously at the gaslit streets soon all the traffic of london seemed to converge the flash of carriagelamps and the clatter of hoofs surrounded her into the cheaper parts of the hall the long black files of patient musiclovers still pressed forward her demeanour was haughty as she was shown to her box to her first glance the great building seemed already full but a thin stream of whitebreasted women and shirtfronts trickled continuously down the red stairway to the stalls a certain exultation possessed her they were all here to hear himthe man who was in love with her somebody climbed to the great organ his name was unfamiliar to her and she did not know what the title of the piece meant he juggled with the stops and flooded the house with a composition in e flat she cared little for the organ it reminded her too strongly of church she was relieved when he finished a lady sailed on to the platform and warbled something of schumanns was it a fact that she could not afford her dress how beautifully it was made she retired amid loud applause her fingertips supported by a gentleman whose functions suggested the ringmaster at a circus she was recalled and bowed deeply three times and tripped off with the ringmaster once more a popular baritone received an encore a lady violinist had painfully thin arms ownie glanced at the programme againyes the next name was mr elisha lee the faces in the serried tiers of the vast dome seemed to crane a little a wave of expectation stirred the throng there was a long pause before he came he bore himself loftilythat was her first thought the slow measured steps that he had been taught to make added to his height the conventional costume in which his native predilections found no scope became him well the unsightly hands were gloved only his black features and frizzy hair marred the dignity of the man as he stood before the hushed audience during the opening bars on the piano he raised his headthe music that he held vibrated for an instant and then from the niggers mouthout over the breathless stalls mounting high and mounting higher to the back of the far massed gallerythere seemed to float gods voice and now nobody remembered that the features were black and no man among the thousands knew what message the voice was bringing to the heart beside him for to all there was a different message that the poet had never told men tightened their lips to hide their tremors the jewels on the womens breasts rose faster among the hot tense crowd that strained over the topmost railings was heard the sobbing of a little childbut only one soul heard it and the child would have been a woman then if she had lived the music was loweredhis arms falling in studied curves to his sides gave the signal for applause there was the moments silence that was so sweet to him he bowed and drew a step back the audience recovered itself the thunders broke she saw fashionable women beating their hands together frantically the roar recalled him again and again he responded and retired with a glance at ownie her eyes were moist and she shivered a little she was not an emotional woman but she was a vain one in part ii he sang early to conform with her arrangements and they drove to victoria where the valet was waiting with her trunk lee guided her to a firstclass compartment and she congratulated herself on her forethought in having taken only a third single at brighton she observed though she betrayed no consciousness of the fact that the guard turned his key in the door after the footwarmers were put in and so asked lee for the second time you were satisfied with me his desire to flatter her was inordinate but it wasnt responsible for the question he was only thirsting to be praised i felt as if i had never heard you sing before she said i felt as if i had never heard anybody sing you thrilled me you have given me a day i shall remember all my life it was perfect from beginning to end i should like to give you many such days he blurted ah she smiledthe faint appealing smile that had always been so effective with harris before he married her im afraid that isnt possible i must think of this one instead her heart throbbed heavily at her boldness even now she was not sure what answer she meant to make why was she encouraging him to ask the question but though he had promised himself to ask it on the journey lee hesitated the question surged to his throat and swelled immensely and stuck there a great timidity was on the nigger who had just swaggered before a multitude the mans heart throbbed heavily at his cowardice he leant forward and tucked the rug round her he was rather a long time tucking the rug round her is that better he muttered youre not cold thank you no im as warm as can be oughtnt you to keep your wrap round your neck not in here he said ill put it on again at the other end sunset is the worst time for me toonot night thats funny i believe its the worst time for all singers the velocity of the train seemed to him phenomenal and a sudden misgiving seized him about the second door somebody might intrude on them at the first stoppage in spite of the tip the minutes flew and in every flashing bank and tree he saw a dangersignal why he said at last why she was at a loss why isnt it possible for you to have other days just as good he was terribly blackshe averted her face before she spoke how can i she murmured i love you he said huskily she had no words he got up and sat beside her she felt his hand groping for hers under the rug and trembled should she let him take it he was holding it do i frighten you she shook her head id give my life for you he cried oh if you can like me a little only a little ill be so good to you you shall never be sorryill give you everything you want i love you i sang to you tonight no white man could adore you as i do cant youcant you forget the difference its cruel to me no no not cruel you could never be cruel i know i know its natural you cant understandyou fill my soul but you can see no deeper than my skin i do like you her voice made answer will you be my wife yes she said she shut her eyes and let him kiss her chapter v and she did not repent the promise nor did her mothers consternation have any effect upon her other than making her lend a willing ear to lees entreaties for a speedy marriage she agreed to marry him at the end of the following month she even came to accept his kisses without shrinking much and to offer her own in return for the jewellery that he brought her only once during the engagement her reflections terrified her the thought crossed her mind that he might lose his voice he might lose his voice and she would have done it all for nothing he would be helpless she would have yoked herself for life to a negro dependent on her exertions what a future what a hell in the moment of alarm it even occurred to herbecause she attended church punctiliously every sundaythat the disaster would be a fitting punishment for the sin she was committing in stifling her better instincts she was abasing herself under a temptationshe might be bowed under a burden as the result characteristically she ignored the fact that to afflict her husband in order to point the moral would be a shade unjust there are many christians who would figuratively fire the house to roast the pig like hoti in the dissertation and quite as many who can reconcile their interests and their conscience by judicious prayer the name of vivian figured in ownies prayer she prayed for strength to act a mothers part to vivian also she determined that before she had been lees wife long she would persuade him to assure his life experience teaches and this precautionary measure had been neglected during her first marriage she was naturally ignorant of the negro temperament or she would have known that there is nothing from which it is quite so averse as providing for emergencies and that she might almost as hopefully have begged him to acquire a creamandroses complexion meanwhile there were paragraphs in the papers and presents were delivered from his fellowartists and from some of the musical societies and there were presents from the public even mrs tremlett began to say it might be all for the best now a man who received big silver teapots from total strangers she felt was entitled to more respect than she had shown to him her grandchild and the adolescent nurse were to remain with her until the honeymoon was over the wedding took place in london and ownie and lee departed for paris where he was to sing if mrs lee had kept a journal at this period it would have been one of the most fascinating of human documents though much of its fascination would have lain between the lines since she inherited nothing of her fathers gift for expression it would have been the gradual diminuendo that told the tale the change of key they stayed in paris nearly five weeks and before a fortnight had passed the outcry in her heart was still she was resigned she did not acknowledge it to herself yet that would not have been written in the diary she did not look it but her avaricious little soul was gratified although her eyes claimed sympathy strangers gave it to her she was prettier still in the extravagant gowns that lee paid forthat true loveliness unadorned is adorned the most is as silly a thing as the poet of the seasons could have saidand the englishmen and americans in paris spoke feelingly of that pretty woman married to a nigger there are women to whom pity is as sweet as noise to the masses and ownie lees abortive conscience found all the anodyne it needed in the perception that she was held a pathetic figure the appealing smile which had always become her so well gained in intensity lucretia might have worn that expression in time if she had taken drives in the bois instead of stabbing herself and lee lee was intoxicated if he had wooed her in a fools paradise at least the shadow of the tree of knowledge had been in it he had had no illusions he had not looked for passion or for tenderness or for understanding it was enough for him as yet to squander devotion on indifference he shook at the touch of the languid woman who accepted his transports with such sovereign calm to pour out money for her adornment to buy diamonds to flash on her fingers and her breast was his delight he had a contract for a six weeks tour in england at six hundred a week and he spent a fortnights fees on jewels for her one morning in the foyers and the streets when he read the mens eyes exultance swelled him they envied his possession of her these blatant fools who were consequential because they had been born with a white skin he cursed them cheerfully in his thoughts arrogant with powerthe woman who attracted them was his wife yet there was one occasion before the honeymoon ended when he seemed almost to stultify himself when the admiration that she roused enraged him instead and was responsible for a burst of resentment they had met a londoner of his acquaintance a singer and lee the elated had presented him to her gaily the singer who was a handsome man and not a gentleman was too bent on being gallant to remember to be polite as he ogled her and curled his moustache and propped his elbows on the cafe table his shoulder excluded lee more and more the conversation became frankly a duologue the art of rebuffing a man without gaucherie is not known to every woman it is in fact the peculiar attribute of the wellbred still ownie was to blame she regarded such impertinence as a compliment and she made no attempt to check it with dignity or otherwise lees scowl grew fiercer and fiercer his lips bulged appallingly and the englishman had no sooner bowed himself away than she beheld her husband in a new light he rose from his chair and put his hand on her arm she could feel that he was trembling but he said nothing until they had walked some steps she turned to him half frightened and half defiant what is it she asked whats the matter with you dont you ever speak to that fellow again he exclaimed hoarsely do you hear i wont have it dont you ever dare to speak to him again if you meet him youre to pass him by is that the way you think a respectable woman ought to behave sitting there andblast him i wish id thrown the glasses in his face she was alarmed and angry too now she tried to subdue him by her tone have you gone out of your mind she said as steadily as she could speak i think you forget who it is youre talking to im talking to you he gasped im talking to my wife dont you forget it either you flirted with him you know you did you sat there flirting with himand in front of your husband you sat flirting with a skunk youd never seen before in front of your husband he came to a standstill gesticulating excitedly you werent so ready with me were you i suppose any man may make love to you if hes white eh but take careyou dont know me yet by god hush she said for heavens sake the people are staring at you she signalled nervously to a cabman and gave him the name of the hotel in the cab lees reproaches were so furious that she drew up the windows to muffle his voice from the passersby the distance between the cafe and the hotel was short and in less than five minutes the courtyard was reached she sprang out and hurried to the bedroom while he paid the fare when he tried the door he found that she had locked it he called to her but she made no answer then he beat at the panels and to avoid a scandal she turned the key is this going on all night she demanded running to the bellpull if you try to hit me ill ring for the manager her dread of receiving a blow was of the slightestsuch fear of personal violence as she had known had faded during the drivebut it was the cruellest thing that she could invent to say on the spur of the moment she clung to the bellpull a picture of agitation the threat the idea that she thought him capable of striking her sobered him he entered shamefacedly you neednt be afraid that i shall hurt you he muttered neednt i she said how do i know that i dont know what you might do you bully youyou coward he winced and stood looking at the ground in silence then i didnt mean to bully you he said huskily iim sorry ownie ill never do it again she saw that she was mistress of the situation her hold on the bellpull relaxed her tone acquired a tinge of shrewishness you wont ever have the chance again she retorted dont flatter yourself youve shown me what i might expecti wont live with you though the words were empty enough they frightened him he took a step towards her in a panic ownie he cried and again ownie im sorry its not the least consequence whether youre sorry or not she sneered she was quite composed now im sure i dont care its very easy to say youre sorry after youve shouted at me and insulted me as much as you want to yes insulted me youah its what i might have expected im ashamed of having married you only a mana man like you would talk so to a woman she saw him shiver she was reminded suddenly of a dog that harris used to beat there was a pause in which she observed the effect of her taunt with satisfaction after a few seconds she turned away and began to unpin her hat at the toilettable it was because i was jealous he stammered i couldnt help iti didnt mean to insult you ah take that backdont say youre ashamed of me trust me and you shall see how good ill be to you in future i love you i love you you dont know how i love you look at yourself in the glass see how beautiful you are how can you wonder that im jealous look at your hairhow soft it is and your skinit feels like a flower id die for you it drove me mad to see you look at another man like that i know i know you didnt mean anything by it but i couldnt bear it ownie forgive me she made no answer she moved carelessly across the room tossing her cloak on to the bed her slippers lay by an armchair and she sat down in it bending over her boots he was on his knees before her in an instant trying to seize her hands she snatched them away with a gesture of aversion and clasped them behind her head i am ashamed she repeated youve disgusted me id let any white man make love to me would i anyhow no white man would be beast enough to say such a thing he put out his hands againnot to caress her this time but as if to ward off the daggers she was planting in him the tears welled into his eyes and with a thrill of power she watched one trickle down the black face forgive me he implored it serves me right for not listening to advice she went on i ought to have known what you would be you cant help being jealous what right have you got to be jealoushow dare you use such a word to me do you suppose that im never going to speak to any other man again because i married you i was wrong he cried i know i was wrongdont say youre ashamed its just because im a coloured man that the jealousy comes oh cant you understand try to make allowances for me dont you see dont you seei remember my colour all the time i never forget it and when you sat there talking sotalking like that to him i hated him because he was white but ill never complain any more i swear i wont you shall do as you likei know how good you are there arent many women who would forgive such behaviour i can tell you she said sulkily she thrust out her foot and he began to unbutton her boot how do i know youll keep your word trust me he begged be kind to meonly trust me she lay back in the chair without replying her pretty face was stubborn still he drew off her boots be kind to me he entreated be kind to me he covered her feet with kisses he knelt there suing to her until she said at last that she forgave chapter vi but it was not in the womans nature to refrain from accepting attentions and showing that they pleased her and it was not in human nature for a husband who loved her to keep his oath and be tolerant before six months had passed there had been halfadozen such scenes lee upbraided more violentlythe reconciliations did not always follow so soon but the order of things was always the same she flirted and he abused her and then grovelled for pardon till her resentment was assuaged her perception of the extent to which she could make him grovel awoke a savage instinct in the woman though her faults were the outcome of weakness not of strength the taste of power excited her and she often remained obdurate merely to prolong the enjoyment of it once she even wounded him for no other reason than to gratify the taste they had returned from a concert and to see the man fresh from his triumph abasing himself before her so shamelessly gave her a vicious pleasure they had taken a house at hampstead a house with an ample garden and the necessary stabling except the practiceroom with its bare polished floor its windows curtainlesscontaining nothing but the piano and two chairsshe had revelled in the furnishing of every corner she wrote to her mother with pride that there wasnt a cheap thing in the place with almost equal truth she might have added that there wasnt a thing beautiful she and lee had one point in common both admired the ostentatious and he found his surroundings nearly ornate enough to justify the amount that had been wasted on them and she had halfadozen servants the tenors stepchild was wheeled to the heath now in fine apparel by a competent nurse in her servants mrs lee aroused less sympathy than in the men whom her husband called his friends they looked down upon her for having married that blacky who was so much more considerate to them as a master than was she as a mistress instinctively she knew it and it was a frequent thing for a maid at the woodlands to be discharged on the grounds of being disrespectful in her manner a landladys daughter and negros wife was the last person likely to submit to disrespect one or two women whom she met had also appeared to take a different view of her position from that taken by the men she found feminine society a shade irksome after her marriage there were a few mortifying incidents from the first still she knew that people who were envious always pretended to be disdainful and the benefits were countless she reminded herself as time went by but for the knowledge of what was in store it would have sufficed for composure to reflect that the other women would act just the same assuming they had the chance her real humiliation came in the form of a baby it was a little yellow baby who in the hour of its birth was not expected to live she did not hear that until some days laterand when she was told she closed her eyes for fear they should betray her thought it was a little yellow baby that she sickened to know her own and when they put it in her arms her flesh shrank from it lees joy enraged her she hated him as he hung smiling over the pillow was angered by what she felt to be his callousness in supposing she could be glad he was enraptured the child was hers and his with the passing of the months he had come to seek more of her than acceptance and it seemed to him that henceforth they must be one she was no longer merely the sovereign who permittedshe was the mother of his boy but his mistake was very brief and it was his child who proclaimed to the man that his marriage had been a madness it was when he saw that she was ashamed of her motherhood that he was ashamed of his passion it was her contempt for their baby that showed him how he himself was despised for her humiliation did not fade and though she tried to hide the feeling all the household knew that she never touched the child without an effort she was humiliated as often as she saw him the pomp of robes and ribbons the lace the paraphernalia of infancy was painful to her when he was carried into the air she winced in imagining the neighbours comments at their windows each time she bent over the bassinet the little face inside looked to her swarthier and more grotesque he was christened david it was lees wish and the matter had no interest for her it was lee who brought him his first toy and who haunted the nurseries in dread of draughts it was lee to whom the nurse soon learnt to turn when she had expensive suggestions to make ownies affection for the other boy had hitherto been somewhat careless but now she was stung to jealousy and knew spasms of devotion which were the outcome of resentment though the man remained as gentle and generous as ever to him she called him poor little vivie in her oughts and a giggling servant who was overheard to remark that his nose was out of joint with somebody was dismissed tempestuously at an hours notice the babys unsightliness increased with its length the stain of the skin deepened only the tiny palms and the soles of the flat little feet retained the yellowish tint the spread nostrils gradually widened the bunch of lip and the high cheekbones took more and more distressfully the negro type vivian had a complexion like a peach and his head was crowned with damp little flaxen curls that had been coaxed round a comb davids face became the colour of a medlar and his hair threatened to be as kinky as his fathers even for a mulatto he was illfavoured and the mulatto and his halfbrother were a queer contrast opposite each other in the perambulator strangers used to stop the nurse in the street and ask questionswhich she seldom failed to repeat to her mistress vivian was robust and had taking ways david was delicate and the most that the maids found to say for him was that he was a very patient baby he made known his desire for food by the whimper which served him for speech but if the bottle didnt come the whimper ceased a faint bleat and he gazed at the undesired world with resignation there was no resignation in lee he rebelled furiouslyrebelled against his wifes disdain and his own weakness for he remained the slave to a passion which he knew degraded him this commonplace woman without intellect without gratitude without pretences held him captive by a purely physical attraction against his will there were hours when he hated her yet she retained the power to fire him with a look and torture him with a glance at another man she was not the woman to be unfaithfulfor one thing she appreciated the advantages of virtue too deeply to jeopardise thembut recriminations lost their terror for her soon and she humoured her vanity without pity or fear and lee was no judge of character in his hell suspicion smouldered too the recriminations were so frantic sometimes that the servants startled from their sleep hung trembling over the banisters and there were crashes heard and broken ornaments were swept up in the morning the nigger was supposed to have thrown them in the mississ face in truth the madman shattered them to keep his hands off her by slow degrees he began to drink not heavilyenough to give the situation a cheerier aspect for awhile enough to shorten his career if he didnt check the habit it was surprising how much brighter the world looked if he took a little whiskyandwaterespecially if he took a little more whiskyandwater often after one of his frenzies of resentment he would remain away from the house for a week though his engagements permitted him to return in two or three days he would sing at exeter or worcester or newcastle as the case might be and then go back to town but not to hampstead moralists in his profession who came upon him dissipating said that he treated his wife damned badly and while he laughed and filled the glasses the thought of her contempt burned in the man and at last the suspicion that he could not drown drove him home as the child grew old enough to be played with there came another influence lees love for his child saved him from many excesses the remembrance of something the boy had said or done would rise in him suddenly and fill him with tenderness the truest pleasure in the singers life was when he walked abroad holding his little sons hand to pick bluebells where fitzjohns avenue stands now or to bear him westward from the swiss cottage in a cab david was not mercenary he jumped at the bluebells as eagerly as at the cab though he had learnt already that hansoms always went to the fairyland where presents hung he was very solicitous about lees safety and lisped cautions against crossing a road when a horse was in sight and the danger of falling through a cellarplate into a coalcellar once the nurse told david that the fascinating berries in the hedge were called deadly nightshade and that if he fiddled with them he would die he was impressed and must never figgle with deadly nightshirt was his next warning to his father at a very early age there were signs that he was ambitious to secure a reputation as a humorist notably an evening when he said his prayers in a facetious voice and met rebuke by explaining that he was only trying to make god laugh but the phase was a brief one and he developed into a mournful child who was found to be more like a girl in his character than a boy now vivian was such an ighspirited little feller david called the lady downstairs mamma because he had been told that was her name and he called his father pops because the diminutive came naturally to him when he was nearly six years old ownie closed a door too swiftly and jammed his finger in it the circumstance caused him to take an unusual libertyhe clung to her knees howling for comfort she looked at the finger and patted him on the frizzy head and said there there it isnt bad suck ititll soon be well she meant to be gracious lee who watched her face caught him in his arms and fondled him till the sobs ceased and there were tears in the mans eyes which the child was too young to understand im so glad you married pops mamma said davidi do like him so it was about this time that he began to understand in a wordless instinctive way that his mother found him disgusting chapter vii the two boys had a daily governess and vivian was her favourite she was an unsympathetic person who prided herself on being extremely just and she was careful to explain that as david was much younger than vivian she set him much shorter tasks she also talked a great deal about the spirit of emulation which she was afraid he lacked to supply the deficiency she offered a prize to the child who earned the greater number of marks by the end of the term vivian took the lead and kept it and when david knew hopeful moments and promised to catch him up yet miss fewster always answered reprovingly that she feared he had let his halfbrother get too far ahead after which david the downcast made less progress still she found him inattentive she told him once how bewilderingly far from the earth the sun was and how comparatively close was the moon in the same minute he asked her if the moon wasnt much the nearest to heaven she sighed and recapitulated figures davids most violent emotions at this period shook him on the mornings when she was late it occasionally happened that she did not arrive at all and then he was free to sit in the garden doing nothinglike a girl he was always hearing now that he was like a girl he began to think it would be rather nice to know one his feverish hope as the clock ticked on the passion of suspense in which he went out to watch for miss fewster praying that she wouldnt appear the sickening thud of his heart as she turned the corner seemed physically to weaken him and always she exclaimed briskly so you came to meet me eh and knowing that she saw through him he would force a hopeless smile and murmur that he had his thought of the lost garden tied a knot in his throat during the lesson hours and the droning of the bees grew so loud sometimes that it was impossible to understand what she said it was really the garden that stood in the way of his writing his exercises so full was it of sounds and scents and of fluttering shadows that he liked to see in the drawingroom there was a silver inkstand which he knew the queen had given to his pops and one day he thought that if he could have this royal object to dip his pen in the exercises might be easier so lee who was nettled by the comparisons lent it to him gladly and miss fewster shuddered but the queens inkstand did not win david the prize isnt it strange that he never sings ownie asked lee reproachfully nearly every child sings or tries to when hes playing about they say this boy cant hum a bar lee frowned and looked away she was telling him something that he knew already well what of it he said well isnt it strange if he is going to sing at all she felt that if he had sung he would have done something to justify his existence nobody can tell if hell sing as a man till hes about eighteen he wont sing as a child of course humph she said what do you mean by humph who wants him to sing as a child exclaimed lee angrily why the hell should he one would think you wanted him to by your tone said the woman im sorry i inquired im sure i was wondering what he would do when he grew up if he hadnt a voice hell do better than ive done i hope anyhow there are worse troubles than having no voice thats lucky for you she retorted if you go on in the way youre going you wont have one long he rapped out an oath which skunk said that which she sniggered everybody some man of course drinks my champagne and runs me down to my wife behind my back runs you down she echoed do you think any manor any woman eithercould tell me more about you than i know and a lot you care dont you i should care if you lost your voice she said shamelessly david was all ears behind a picturebook during this conversation as the boys grew older they knew that their parents constantly quarrelled just as the servants and the tradespeople and the neighbours knew it vivian as was natural had imbibed the servants view and held his stepfather a brute who beat poor mamma in the night he called him to david once a black beast and in the scuffle that followed the younger child got badly beaten his indignation was stronger than his arms david understood quite early that his father was looked down on because he was black he realised that it was a disgrace not to be white that explained why grandmamma had called him poor little fellow and why mamma only kissed him when visitors were present it explained why her rare kisses fell on his cheek like the flick of a wet flannel he began to see things and in gabbling his collects to miss fewster he pronounced with fervour the petition lighten our darkness we beseech thee o lord once he asked lee where he was born in savannah sonny miss fewsters geography lessons had not extended to savannah david wanted to know where it was in america my boy are there other people like you and me in america pops oh yes heaps of them said lee after a stare david was puzzled he had always believed his pops so wise and really he seemed to have done a very thoughtless thing indeed he would have been more sensible himself if id been you i should have stopped there he said at last then nobody would have noticed you so much lee laughed without being amused you see i wanted to be noticed he answered all artists do is that why you came to england well its why i stayed here i came with my father and mother when i was no bigger than you are shall i be an artist too pops when im a man i hope you will and shall i marry a white girl like you did i hope you wont said lee from his heart why asked david because the coloured man who marries a white girl is a fool david he wont be happy i dont think i should like to marry a black one pops then youd better not marry at all replied lee he reflected dont tell your mamma what ive said this was before david went to school vivian and he were sent to a dayschool in the neighbourhood after miss fewster turned the corner for the last time and the elder child reported that david was an awful little duffer in the playground the authorities were not much more flattering about his mental attainments the only high marks that he ever secured were in the compositionclass in which he generally got doublesixand was humbled if he didnt for the rest he was not ambitious it was always harris who brought home a prize bound in calf at the end of the term though it was lee who used to read it harris was popular and conspicuous in the lowerschool eleven lee was a solitary and usually went out with a ducks egg on the horizontal bar harris was as good as many of the boys in trousers lee could barely manage to pull himself up to his chin he was just ten when he fell in love she was a governess who took some of the junior classes before he left in the evening he used to steal back into the silent schoolroom to say good night to her he always found her standing at the wide window looking out at the sunset or the stars she was still young enough to have her dreamsold enough to be weary he never told her that he loved her but she used to lend him her own books and once she called him david and that day he walked up belsize park gardens quivering with joy vivian said cant you talk fatheadand he couldnt from the flyleaves of the books he learnt that her name was minnie the knowledge was rapture for a week he felt that he moved in a different world from the other boys who only knew her as miss pugh once she asked him if he was fond of poetry he associated it with casabianca and the colliers dying child but he would not have sunk in her esteem for a whole holiday and he said yes so she lent him tennysona shabby volume with her favourite passages marked the pencilmarks were very scholastic and precise and the passages were very sad and sentimental poor miss pugh the hardest duty of the governess was to discipline the woman but david was too young to read the poetry in the margin and he was too young to understand the book but parts of maud he read again and again and they throbbed in him they translated what he felt while his father sang and what the shadows were always hinting in the garden it was as if he had been waiting for a chord and it had come the melody of sense intoxicated him to put the garden into words and make music at the same timehow wonderful not long afterwards a master discovered him poring dejectedly over original and precocious verse when he ought to have been engaged with declensions and passed sentence whereat the versifier gave way to tears i dont like to see boys cry when theyre punished lee it isnt english said the englishman meaning that it wasnt brave david looked at him aggrieved i am crying he explained because i couldnt say what i meant but henceforth he spoiled his paper more guardedly when vivian was thirteen ownie complained that he ought to be at a public school instead of at belsize manor it was only right she declaredthey owed him such advantagesand elisha who had never refused her anything but men to flirt with answered carelessly all right my dear why didnt you say so before let him go to eton or harrow then where the swells go send him to any place you like the boys own wish was to accompany one of his chums to a college on the south coast and though ownie parted reluctantly with the idea of eton or harrow where the swells went she gave him his way in the end she told the cook to see that his playbox was properly filled and his stepfather presented him with a fivepound note he made joyous adieux david it was understood would follow him about two years later it was when the time came for david to proceed to the college that vivian began to unburthen his mind to ownie the confidential period was not longlived but during that easter recess they used to walk up and down the garden together disparaging the man who kept them in one of their conversations the lad said impetuously i do wish that dave could be sent somewhere else you know mater i shall get awfully boshed when he joinsits rather hard lines on a fellow why cant he stop at the manor she sighed will it be very bad for you dear well a fellows bound to be boshed of course he wont be in my form but everybody ll know who he is its rather hard lines having a halfbrother whos a blacky hush try and make the best of it she said squeezing his arm im afraid its too late to send him anywhere else now we all have things to put up with vivie i have as well as you yes he returned its a good job he wont be in my form i dont mind so tremendously much the first time anybody gives me any cheek ill jolly well sock their heads oh i know you have things to put up with by jove i wonder how you stand the governor sometimes we learn to stand things as we get older she replied what cant be cured must be endured vivie hes such ai mean leaving his being a negro out of it altogetherhes such a cad it does lick me how you ever did it mater did it she murmured her heart missed a beat well married him you never got on with himi dont see how you could have expected to why i can remember your rows when i was a kid i think it was awful i cant make out how you could do it im hanged if i can she wincedthe colour in her face fluttered a little for an instant she was ashamed her son looked very tall to her and her sale looked very foul but when she answered her tone was saintlike i had a great deal to consider dear she said more than you are old enough to understand to begin with there was you and another thing i was very young and your grandmotheranyhow i did do it and we must make the best of it vivie while it lasts she drew his arm round her waist and was humiliated to feel that it lay there limply they strolled for a minute in silence both thinking of the last words that had escaped her its beastly going out with him you know went on the boy and hes got no tactyoud think hed know a fellow didnt like it we met some chaps in regent street the other daychaps in the fourth i saw em grin as they went by he didnt see he was as cool as a cucumberlugged me into a shop and stood tuck hed have lugged them in too if id given him half a chance youd have been much happier if you hadnt taken him mater it would have been a jolly sight better for both of us not for you she said im sure of that ive always felt that of course there are drawbacks for you now but later on youll appreciate the benefits im sure that when youre older youll say i didnt make the sacrifice for nothing i found it hard to doi prayed to god to make me strong enough but the knowledge that i was able to bring you up to be a gentleman has helped me to bear it all she nodded sadly when youre a man and getting on you neednt see any more of him than you want to she added so when vivian went back to the school david went too and the little mulattos experiences there did nothing to lessen the sensitiveness that had been bred in him he found his formmates brutal and his masters contemptuous probably he exaggerated their contemptcircumstances had made him morbidbut those with whom he was brought in contact were not magnanimous and neither his race nor his temperament was any passport to their favour he was bullied atrociously the taunt of dirty nigger embittered his life when it could not be made aloud it was written on scraps of paper and passed to him under cover of latin grammars a favourite amusement of the form was to pin him to the ground while one of the number set fire to his hair and when it was discovered that he was the weakest among them they punched his head and wrenched his ears twenty times a day often he used to drag himself away from their sports to hide in the gothic corridors or slink round the great cricket field crying with pain but to be found blubbing meant worse pain to follow for then halfadozen stalwart lads would hack his shins and twist his puny arms till he writhed on his knees in agony what he dreaded most were the classes which were held twice a week in an annexe of the college the master who took these always withdrew for five or ten minutes in the middle of the afternoon and no sooner had he gone than a shower of blows drove david to mount a desk by the window and keep watch while the other boys had larks the outcome was always the same his cry of cave suppressed the frolics in good time but the uplifted face of the little beaten sentry through the glass met the masters eyes the instant he set foot in the courtyard and he reentered with a stereotyped inquiry has anybody moved here besides lee to this there was a chorus of no sir then he said lee fifty lines and byandby he came to say two hundred lines so twice a week david got an imposition as well as the kicks and blows apparently it never struck the man as noteworthy that the undesirable post of sentinel was always filled by the same boy it never occurred to him to draw deductions from the fact he was abnormally obtuse even for a schoolmaster elisha had not been sent to a public school himself and when david went home a false shame kept him fromowning that he was illtreated however as he got bigger the worst of his physical sufferings ceased but he was always twitted with his colour always made to feel that he was a lower thing than the lusty young english lads who insulted him with filthy verses and obscene cartoons he never found a chum in the college in all the terms that he was there his real companion was his father in the holidays it was a queer fellowship between the morbid youth and the despised husband before david was sixteen he was lees confidant in all matters he heard about his debts and debauches and his difficulty in reconciling the diminished income with the expenses he also advised though the fees remained the same the engagements were far fewer and the prodigal father waded in a sea of debt perpetually now he talked of the money i used to make and of what my voice was once there was an afternoon in the practiceroom when he gave way to despair sobbing across the piano like a mourner across a grave but that was after a late night when his nerves were out of order david prescribed a couple of glasses of port and a cigar for him and he was soon cheerful enough to suggest a dinner up west the tenor and his ugly son were familiar figures in the regent street restaurants cafe and cafeaulait somebody had nicknamed them at the age of sixteen cafeaulait was a man in his knowledge of one side of lifea man in his reflections and selfrestraintthough he still trembled under the masters glances and boggled over his caesar he boggled indeed over everything except the very occasional essays that demanded no dryasdust facts when he was at liberty to draw on his imagination the essays were a pleasure to him lees was not the nature to expurgate the subject which rankled in him most and the warning that had escaped him to the child was amplified a thousandfold to the boy david understood marriage had spoilt his fathers life marriage was the forbidden fruit in his own the warnings seemed superfluous to him after what he had seen at home and at school he no longer wanted to know a girl he laughed when lee said remember all ive told you when youre mad about some woman yourself your wife would treat you as your mother has treated me youd suffer hell every time a white man spoke to her theres no fear of my ever marrying father ah said lee who knew more of temptation ive seen too much but you havent seen the woman when she comes along youll fool yourself shell be so different from everybody else i thought your mother so different before i got her by god we hadnt been married a month when she threw it in my face that i was a negro david brought him some verses one day and asked him nervously if they could be set and sung for the first time he was timid with his father lee said why do you break your head in your holidays writing things youre always scribbling in your bedroom i hear what do you write about sonny david looked more confused still things come he said theres so much to write about i hope what do you hope i hope i shall always write ive got it in me he blurted you just pray for a voice instead his father answered it will pay you a heap better let fools hammer out the words for you its not the chaps that write things who have good times my boy its the fellows that sing or publish em he read the lines slowly while the author trembled i dont understand what its meant to be he said is it a hunting song its all about the foxs suffering instead of the peoples sport david winced the fox does suffer doesnt he i daresay but the people enjoy themselves a hunting song must be jollypink and tallyho have you ever been to a meet its a very pretty sight let me tell you i know it is but i didnt try to feel like the people who dress up to kill the foxi tried to feel like the fox they all want to kill whats the good of that foxes dont buy songs you should have thought about the fun and the cheers its all on the wrong side its wrongheaded thats what it is i did think about the cheersi thought how they must sound to the fox and i thought when he sees a crowd of big men and women on horses with a pack of hounds chasing him to death the field must look like the world to his fright he has run till hes breathless his legs ll hardly carry him the crowd are gaining on him and his heart feels as if its going to burst they swoop nearer and nearer and hes bedraggled and panting and dead beat oh yes i thought of the cheershe hears them right to the end and then the dogs fall on himsuch a lot of dogsand a man sticks a knife into his body and the lady whos there when he dies carries away a piece of the corpse and feels proud it sounds like a game of savages father whatever it is you wont alter it sonny you dont suppose youre going to make the world any better this was really davids most sanguine hope but he looked modest anyhow i can write the truth he said the truth who the devil wants the truth replied the nigger people hate the truth especially english people theres nothing english people detest so much and they always deny it ill tell you what you might do if you feel like thatyou might make it a bullfight and go for the brutality of foreigners but even then it would be no good for music if you want to do lyrics you must write about love or the valour of englishmen nothing else is any use nobody would sing this i dont want to write about love said david i only write what i feel there are plenty of things in the world besides women and war no good for music why some of it is music listen to this he declaimed his pet stanza entreatingly and waxed boastful cant you hear it they came the last two lines all by themselves they just ran into my head and sang themselves on to the paper i know theyre good youll see wait till im famous when i bring out a volume of poems and everybody is talking about it you wont think im so stupid for wanting to write i tell you ive got it in me lord i wish you had had a better mother said lee dismayed at literary ambition ownie grown rather stout and puffy under the eyes used to read novels in the drawingroom while the pair strolled up and down the garden talking she was fortynine now when they turned the lad could see herthe woman who was contemptuous of them both she wore black mrs tremlett had recently died the crape recalled to lee the little parlour in regency square the period of his courtship her mind was at this time chiefly occupied by the thought of vivian he had left school and she wondered what was to be done with him he himself had no definite views on the subject when she broached the matter to him he said lightly that he was hanged if he knew on the whole he thought he preferred the army and as the army was out of the question he would try his hand at anything they liked he was cheerful and indifferent business she suggested i dont mind he said wheres the oof to come from though will he part between ownie and vivian lee was generally referred to as he i daresay a little could be found to give you a start with dear but i dont know what you could do i had better speak to him about it youre so young and you see we dont know many business people ill tell you whatill go to the cape he said singleton a fellow who left last term is going out there that would be rather jolly it would suit me better than an office go to the cape exclaimed ownie whatever would you do at the cape dont talk nonsense im not going to have you packed off to the worlds end like that you must stop in london where i can see you youre all ive got remember she was hurt that he could propose such a thing oh well he demurred thats rot you know mater a fellow cant sit in his mothers lap all his life singleton has got a mother too i suppose but it doesnt prevent him doing the best he can for himself ownie was silent for a moment then she said we must try to find you something that youll like quite as well dear and there was a little touch of sadness in her voice she was reluctant to acknowledge it but it had forced itself upon her more than once that her handsome young son was a shade selfish it was the fault that jarred upon her most in others time had not left her complacence unimpaired the menace of the future was in her reveries and she had lost her youth and her figure and her admirers decrepit foreigners who smelt of pomatum and dyed their moustaches purple were the only men who languished at her now even her youngest captives had ceased to adore her when they heard vivian five feet ten in his socks calling her mater and she had never reproached him even in her thoughts she felt it was rather cruel that he wasnt more attached to her she very often attempted to discuss the subject of his career with lee but lee found it easier to tip his stepson an occasional sovereign and let him loaf than to give the matter serious consideration vivian was idle for the best part of a year and when he made a beginning it was only in a westend concerthall as assistant businessmanager it was a depressing drop from the altitude on which his mother had foreseen himhe was paid thirty shillings a week and the position was quite subordinate but unless she sold some of her jewellery to put him into a profession there seemed to be nothing else for him to doand he did not incline to any profession except the army so the elder boy went to town every day now and began to cultivate the air of an impresario and the younger continued to meet his muse clandestinely in the college grounds and write surreptitious verse then in the middle of a termone morning during the euclid hourhe was summoned from the college by telegram and sped to the station sick with fear lee was in the provinces very ill chapter viii in the first days of an intended tour he had taken a slight cold he had to leave for birmingham on the morrow and he reached it chilled and shivering to sing was out of the question he remained in the hotel and ordered hot drinks and additional blankets next morning he woke with a cough and sent for a doctor but the cough grew worse in spite of medical aid and when he was joined by a companion whom he had been expecting he was found in bed with pneumonia he was asleep when david arrived in the sittingroom the companion was having dinner david accepted her presence without astonishment she said she supposed he must be hungry and told him to ring the bell he answered that he was not hungry in the least she had peroxideofhydrogen hair and painted cheeks and a coarse voice he sat in an armchair by the fire and looked at her how soon shall i be able to go in he asked trembling theyll tell im youre here when e wakes up she said with her mouth full youd better have something to eat you know david your name is isnt it yes i couldnt eat anything thank you who is taking care of him he knew already that the companion wasnt the doctor sent round two nurses from the hospitala day nurse and a night nurse hes in a bad way you should see how thin es got will heget well inquired his son with a jerk let soap so said the woman she refilled her glass and emptied the bottle have some champagne he shook his head i wish hed wake you better had she rejoined theres nothing like champagne when youre feeling low the waiter reappeared with the sweets bring up another bottle she said and a green chartrooze i dont think ill take any of those whats that onethe floppy thing with the pinkandwhite stuff on it the waiter murmured that it was trifle no i dont want any she made a wretched pun and told him to pass her the cigarettes the box was a silver one that belonged to the sick man the boy winced to see her careless hand thrust in it he wondered what the waiter thought of her wondered that his father wasnt ashamedand knew a gust of selfreproach for condemning him tonight a lump rose suddenly in his throat his eyeballs pricked he stared hard at the fire in a struggle to keep back the tears that were starting to his shame he felt one trickling down his cheek dont you smoke asked the woman not now he muttered and knew that his voice had betrayed him she turned to him surprised whats the matter with you nothing he said angrily what should there be in the road a pianoorgan reeled out a cadenza and then stopped short after the sharp silence that ensued the roll of the traffic seemed to fill the room the cork popped and he drank his wine at a draught go on i dont want any more sure she tilted her glass well heres to temperance and down with champagne though he no longer watched her he was intensely conscious of her presence it weighed upon his senses he resented it with every nerve the odour of her cigarette permeated his thoughts while he waited and he fancied that he could hear her breathe the nurse came in and said that lee was asking for him she warned him not to remain more than a few minutes the sight of her strengthened the boy as he followed this cleanfaced woman in her sober dress a tinge of confidence lightened his apprehension lee had altered painfully his words were whispers in the first moments there seemed something unreal in seeing him lying there so weak davie father sit down why didnt you wire before father it was time enough youre getting on nicely they say perhaps do they know at home lee bent his head the papers but i dont want her here i told her she neednt come but she may and oh no she wont want to there was a pause then he said in firmer tones this is a bad business sonny itll be all right have you seen julia the woman in there yes shes a good sort julialooks after everything most of em would have cleared out and left me david wondered what awaited her elsewhere he turned very coldthe illusion frightened him for in health lee had had no illusions a good sort murmured the man eh yes said the boy faintly shes got a friend here nowcomes in to see her sometimesbut it must be very slow for her not many women would have stopped see that shes comfortable davie ill see to it father lee closed his eyes and his thoughts wandered through the years to a morning when he followed a widow about brighton and overtook her on marine parade the sun shone out to him again and he heard the wash of the waves on the beach he came back to david if i dont pull through itll be an awful mess he said god knows what i owe i i wish id put a bit by for you youll have plenty of time to put by in father dont talk nonsense about not pulling through in a month youll be as strong as ever the woman who was called julia opened the door and whisked over to the dressingtable sorry to bother she said theres another bill from the chemists come in ive got no money left take some said the dying man where do you keep the key she unlocked the drawer and whisked out again there had been a rustle of banknotes a good sort julia he repeated looks after everything i must give her something davie theres my scarfpin somewhere aboutitll do for her tie david left him soon mindful of the nurses instructions and at nine oclock the doctor paid another visit i should like to have a physician down from town if you dont mind stammered the lad the best we can get just as you please said the practitioner stiffly but the treatment in these cases david felt shy and was annoyed with himself for being so the sense inherited and acquired of racial inferiority cowed him as he opposed his opinion to the authoritative strangers yes if you dont mind i should like a physician he insisted after an inward struggle embarrassment lent a ring of defiance to his voice and the doctor thought him a cub so the telegram was written and the cub went out with it himself when he returned to the sittingroom julia was playing cards for coppers with a faded woman in shabby black who was presented to him as mrs hayes a brandy bottle and a syphon stood between the glasses on the table and when mrs hayes won a shilling she tittered lucky at love unlucky at cards my dear as she put on her bonnet she gave a start there i meant to ave bought sixpennorth against my being bad again in the night dear she exclaimed the pubs ll be shut by now and then her hostess summoned the waiter and mrs hayes carried another bottle home under her cape it was in these surroundings rather more than a week after the consultation that the tenor died chapter ix and owniein weeds for the second time in her lifesighed as she had sighed when she lost harris i dont know what will become of me though her youth was gone her egoism remained and even the solicitor was touched by the pathos of her helplessness i was a good wife she said having had a week to convince herself of it its hard that he never made any provision for the future david did not return to school and vivian who found his mothers lamentations wearisome when he was at home began to thaw towards his halfbrother and discussed matters with him the mater is selfish you know he said she only thinks of herself its deuced rough on you and me but she never talks about that i suppose we shall have to go into a poky little house somewhere and pig along with one or two servants eh he was unconsciously picturing the environment in which he had been born i suppose so said david good lord when one remembers all the money that was made you know its awful they ought to have saved the idea of spending every bob and never thinking about tomorrow i dont blame him any more than her of course he added hastily it was her fault too but i wish they had let me go to the cape it isnt a lively lookout to live in a tinpot house here and come home to find the mater fretting over her lost splendours thats what it will beshe isnt the woman to be cheerful when things go wrong i shant be able to stand it i know i shant i shall cut it after a bit and take a room up west she wont let you besides she may need your salary what well whos going to keep her if we dont oh i say exclaimed vivian do you mean to tell me we shall be as poor as all that i dont know i hope we shant im sure i dont want to live at home either now but its likely enough isnt it vivian pondered theres her jewellery he said at last thats worth a lump you know as to your not living at home either one of us will have to its certain she cant be left by herself it wouldnt be right i dont think that my going would trouble her she has never wanted me if she does of course ill stop the thing is i dont know what sort of berth i can expect to get im afraid it wont be very easy forfor a fellow like me to get anything to do will it he tried to force a laugh ive never been in demand so far no there is that said vivian she was talking about it yesterday what did she say only that it wont be so easy as if you wereyou know you ought to have sung dave then youd have been all right fancy if youd had the governors voice by jove there would have been none of this bother at all of course if you can write itll be better than nothing he hesitated and looked a little sheepish for such confidences were new between them you want to go in for being an author dont you david nodded ive sent verses to magazines already only they werent taken i should peg away at it if i were you i always told the mater it wasnt half a bad idea for you when she called it rot it doesnt matter what an author looks like you see if hes as hideous as the veiled johnny in whatsitsname it doesnt show in his books just you go on turning it out thats my advice id like to see some of your things one day still said david i shall have to get a berth at first you know i shall give it up before long of course but i must have one at the start a sincere belief in oneself generally inspires conviction in somebody that is why ownie had never failed to find supporters vivian regarded his halfbrother a shade enviously its my opinion youre not half such a fool as the mater thinks old chap he murmured i wish i could do something of the sort myself though i cant say im nuts on poetry just you swot away if you write enough some of its bound to bring in some coin sooner or later now what have j got to look forward to why nothing at all i can stick on where i am for ever if id gone to the cape i might have come back a millionaire but how on earth can i hope to make any money in a billet in london i thought david said that what you really wanted was to go into the army oh well i didi was younger then we all want to do something silly at that age ive changed my mind about that i want to make money thats all i want id like to be a manager theres plenty of oof to be made in the musical business i can tell you even if you dont sing or play yourself there are lots who doand brains are as good as a voice if it comes to that of course the swell artists get deuced big terms but if youre smart you can get the others to pay you im keeping my eyes open what do you think it isnt difficult to make a profit on a concert if your rents not too high and you go the right way to work its like making a book on a race and after a bit you get cracked up in the papers for your services to musical art in england too if i had something to start with id have a shot at the game tomorrow he stroked an incipient moustache and david looked at him with respect himself he panted to be famousfortune was a detailbut the flourish of qualities that he didnt possess impressed him some little time passed before vivian was relieved of his fear of having to contribute immediately towards his mothers support then when light was shed it was evident that if she sold her diamonds she could withdraw from the woodlands with a considerable sum and the earliest idea was to remove to a villa at balham or wandsworth on the advice of one of the decrepit foreigners however who promised her a clientele she talked presently of taking a boardinghouse at regents park as soon as she was able to sublet the fall was crushing but at least it was better than solitude in a suburb and living on her capital privately too as she foresaw herself ministering to the palates of bachelors with a red lampshade over the dinnertable she considered the possibility of marrying again she was prepared to view purple moustaches with a more lenient eye now and she contemplated a business run on good lines with more complacence than she permitted to appear in the meantime before a tenant was forthcoming several attempts were made to find david employment the decrepit but faithful rallied round herthe least deserving generally receive the most sympathyand though a coloured boy of forbidding countenance was no acquisition he at last obtained a clerkship at a music publishers when he had been engaged at panzettas a few days he broached to his mother his desire to live alone he didnt allude to her lack of affection for him he put the matter on grounds of expedience i dont think my money would be any help to you would it he said fares and lunches run away with a good deal i couldnt give you any more out of a pound a week than it would cost you to keep me if i took a bedroom near panzettas there wouldnt be any fares to pay i saw one advertised for seven shillings quite close by i might go and look at it if you dont mind now she had reflected already that he would be no acquisition to a boardinghouse either and in her heart she was relieved by his proposal still her hesitation was not wholly insincere youre very young to go away by yourself david she demurred youre not seventeen you know i dont think you ought to do that yet im quite old enough to take care of myself if you have no objection i should prefer to go he spoke in the tone that was natural to him when he addressed his mother and it sounded as if he were resigning a situation it pierced even her coldness she flushed and looked down i know youve never been very fond of me of course she faltered now your father is dead i suppose theres nothing to keep you with me i never said that replied david but she observed that he did not deny it i dont see what use there is in stopping hereand in a boardinghouse you would find me in the way too she was startled it came upon her as a shock to discover how well she was understood by the son to whom she had voluntarily revealed herself so little for almost the first time she felt remorseful something of tenderness moved her towards the boy whom she had taught to regard her as a stranger if youll be happier away go she returned in a low voice only dont forget theres always your home if you want to come back one cannot undo the past by a mood missing the confirmation of response she was never keenly aware of it herself but there was a stir of appeal within her as she added the last words thank you said david politely he went to look at the room during the luncheon hour next day it was in soho the ordinary lodginghouse attic with a rickety chest of drawers a white paraffin lamp and a low ceiling that dipped to a window which commanded a fairly extensive view of neighbouring chimneys however he was not dissatisfied the window indeed rather attracted him by reason of a resemblance it bore to the one in the familiar prints of chatterton he settled to move in on the following monday and left a halfcrown as deposit ownie duly informed of his arrangements said little but that she should expect him to come to see her on sundays wherever she might be not so vivian vivian said that he would be very short on a pound a week but that he was to be envied all the same as for himself he had thrown out hints of taking diggings too and the mater had sat on him promptly considering she meant to run a hashhouse her opposition was distinct rot you know because she would have plenty of people to talk to there without him it would have been becoming for david to feel sentimental when he packed his books and his clothes and went to bed in his little room in the woodlands for the last time but he did not he was vaguely surprised at the absence of appropriate emotions a profound relief was in his heart the relief with which the unwelcome embrace solitude there is none deeper he had grown in fetters the burden of knowledge had weighted his soul hampered his speech even cramped his gait and he was to be free his spirit stretched itself the only love that had been given to him had passed away and he expected life to yield no other was resigned to know no other he wasnt seventeen to be alone to be famous as yet he asked no more and he looked forward boldly no suspicion of the disappointments the disillusions that lay before him no inkling of the difficulties that throng the path of the literary idealist leavened his mood when he drew up the blind next morning the sky was fair the garden of his childhood glistened in the sunshine ownie was not an early riser and when he had breakfasted he went upstairs again to say goodbye to her welldont forget to come on sunday she said and he nodded assent his trunk was to be called for and delivered at the lodging during the day so he walked with vivian to the station hampstead was alive with young men walking to the station young men recently introduced into their fathers businesses and proudly conscious of their first silk hats and their gold watchchains no overcoats hid the watchchains though it was freezing david marked the youths pityingly to have no other prospect than an office all ones life he took his seat in panzettas with a new exhilaration the hopes of glory that have faded on an officestool might have provided him with another theme but he did not think of that mentally he examined his manuscripts and decided which of them to submit to an editor next ninetenths of the journals published in london were unknown to him his verse was as yet imitative he believed that the best work was the easiest to sell but the road was hidden from him and he smiled a small fire was smoking in the attic when he reached it his box had arrived he lit the lamp and produced from his pocket a purchase that he had just madeit was a penny bottle of ink when he had had a cup of tea and some breadandbutter he put his clothes in the rickety chest of drawers and arranged his books on the top of it then he took from the trunk pens and foolscap drew the one chair to the table with infinite zest and brushed the crumbs out of his way but he did not write memories flocked thick and fast after awhile he got up and looked out over the chimneypots the view was very cold under the moon the roofs shone white and snow was falling he thought of it falling on a grave the poignancy of sorrow overcame him and he sat huddled by the window the tears dripping down his face chapter x thus began the second book of davids life where so many books of life have begun and where so many are fated to endin a garret of a lodginghouse now too began his acquaintance with larger london no longer the capital of concerts and cafes to him but the london of grim inhospitable streets of dullfaced tramping crowds the london that the millions know sordid and unsmilingcheerful only for a consideration a niggard even of its light there were many evenings when he could not writein the first months many evenings when he did not attempt to writeand drifting from soho he would rove about the city till late rove west and east tempted to unfamiliar quarters by the promise of their names storing impressions he supped at coffeestalls and heard the vagrants talk and rose at dawn to breakfast among the workers and the wastrels in the fiveoclock publichouses near the markets on sundays when it did not rain and he didnt go to see his mother he explored the parks or wandered beyond the stretching tentacles of london in woodland which the monster had not yet absorbed he journeyed among holidaymakers who were boisterous but never gay who shouted but who never laughed the outskirts that he found were beautiful and he yearned to read the hearts of these excursionists who whether they covered the miles in dreary silence or shrieked the burden of a cockney song had always the same vacant gaze the same sad hopeless air he saw that look on everyone in varying degreesthe london look bred of the dismal climate and the gloomy streets he thought that he would recognise a londoner anywhere by his eyes and when he returned he noted how the fairness of england was disfigured where englishmen began to build the love of london which some men have felt was never born in david he could not grow to love it though he tried in time he came to wonder if he was blindif something was lacking in himwhen he read wordpictures of its beauty and knew that he found it execrable true there were many nights when the river mesmerised him and he hung rapt upon the bridges but then the lamps shone only on the water and the spell lay in the vast suggestiveness of a great city that he did not see occasionally he went to the gallery of a theatre more often he saved the shilling and bought a book that he coveted because he realised that he was not eating enough to feel very strong he pawned his watch and chain when he had been in soho about six months it was a severe pang to him to part with what had been his fathers present even to part with it temporarily and only the knowledge that his father if he could advise would bid him pop it for all he could get enabled him to make the sacrifice a week afterwards however his diet had dwindled to its original proportions and his library had much increased meanwhile his manuscripts came back just as often as he enclosed a stamped and directed envelope the word regrets grew odious to him in the work of david lee the word was seldom to be found and he never wrote it without reluctance nobody wanted his poetry nobody thought it worth printing the rosecolour gradually faded from his reveries at the end of a year the boastfulness of boyhood had passed he began to realise how stupendous was the task that he had approached so confidently to attack london with a pen he felt as if he were throwing seashells at a fortress by degrees too he came to understand that a poet must be either celebrated or ridiculous the pennies that he spent in a newsroom showed him that the poet in adversity appealed to the national sense of humour every week he derived encouragement from reading the biographies of great writers of the pastand was depressed when he scanned the reminiscences of successful authors of the day for these always seemed to have arrived so gracefully it surprised him to note that poverty and disdain had been the portion of only those who were dead it happened on a morning in april the event that he never forgot a morning when the sky across the chimneypots was blue and the sparrows hopped in a strange yellow light which the oldest bird on the slates told them was called sunshine david woke up to findnot that he was famous but that his jug of hot water supported a communication by which an editor offered him a guinea for a sonnet and his behaviour was less original than his verse he burned to impart the news to the drudge in curlingpins who brought in his tea and haddock he wanted to pat the heads of the children who were playing tipcat in the roads in soho it is never too early nor too late for the children who fill the roads to play tipcat in bloomsbury they incline to rollerskates in bayswaterthat happy huntingground of the organgrinder and the streetarabthey follow my leader yelling but the passion of soho is tipcat he bought a bunch of daffodils on his way to the office and stuck them on his desk he was still at panzettashis salary had been raised ten shillings by this timeand the prospect of tendering his resignation shone out to his eager eyes again the clouds had hidden it so long that he was dazzled there was the gladness of summer in the sunlight that slanted through the dusty windows all the temptations of the country lurked in the pennyworth of daffodils beside the inkpot he panted to be in the open free to loose the extravagance of joy that swelled his heart its the sort of morning he said in a burst to the accountant who sat opposite that makes you think its hot outofdoors and want to go and pick poppies and hear the rye rustle the accountant lived at ealing and travelled by the same train as a distinguished counsel every day he often mentioned vaingloriously that sir edward jennings had nodded to him on the platform ah he rhapsodised with a carriageandpair to come and fetch you david was a little less than nineteen when his first verses were accepted he was a little less than twenty when they were paid for thus the thoughtfulness of the editor provided him with two distinct occasions for rejoicing he sent several other sonnets to the journal and some of these were taken also but a guinea is the professional pons asinorum and it was a long time before he cashed a cheque for any larger sum the bright prospect of resigning the clerkship receded from him like a willothewisp and byandby he even smiled at his youthfulness in remembering how happy that first acceptance of his work had made him feel and still he wrote sometimes he sat writing poetry in front of the washhandstand until the lampflame waned and bobbed and went out so grew the manuscripts which were to be submitted to the publishers excepting the boardinghouse where ownie reigned on in widowhood he visited no one excepting vivian who made his way to the attic at long intervals no one visited him few among the millions in london were more utterly alone than this young man who alternately hoped and despaired and whether he was elated or despondent had never an ear to heed him heard never a voice that said cheer up vivian and ownie were the only persons who ever inquired about his work and to a dejected man the inquiries of the uncongenial are worse than none at all no strangers could have been more foreign to each other than were the halfbrothers although they had a myriad memories in common it is not time that enables people to understand one another it is temperament the world is heavy with couples who have sat opposite each other for forty years and are still tone deaf to each others humour and stone blind to each others moods and a recent acquaintance may say the right things to both vivian had encouraged poetry while he thought it might pay since it didnt pay he explained that the proper line of action was to deal in something else instead there was nothing unpractical about the son of the late mr harris he was the kind of young fellow of whom it may be predicted even while his pockets are empty that he will rise somehow and throw a few of his scruples overboard in the process he was an occasional caller but never a companion and slowly there crept into davids life a dull resentment of the solitude that had once been a relief a longing for sympathy for tendernessa sense of bitter oppression as he looked in the glass and knew that he must never expect to find these things and the face of every girl became a glass to him and he winced before it when his resources were low he took his midday meal in a vegetarian restaurant a place with a faint distinctive smell and a threecourse dinner for sixpence one of the waitresses there was very pretty and all had arch glances and undertones for the regular customers who cheated hunger with scones and coffee or some dish with an attractive name and a strangely nasty taste only with david none was ever arch once he summoned courage to say more to the pretty waitress than two poached eggs please and the haughtiness of her eyebrows slew him before she turned away often in the streets he saw a negroblack as elisha had beenand across the crowd the gaze of the aliens would meet for a momentdrawn together by something deeper than curiosity but neither could lift his silk hat and say to the other we are both damned so let us be friends because the influence of civilisation prevented their acting like that although their skins were the wrong colour woman impalpable insistent shared the garret with david now and sometimes she was fair and sometimes she was dark but always she was beautiful for at twenty the gift that man counts best in woman is loveliness and at thirty it is wit and at forty it is a keen appreciation of his own from the dreamwomen who let him woo them david heard many odes at first his visitors were coldmere beauties from a hairdressers windowand he could only watch them timidly but by degrees he found his voice and told them how empty the attic had been before they came and while he talked the forms took flesh and blood the lips whispered love words back to him they made him confidences and uttered sweet conceits and thenwhy then the drudge in curlingpins banged with a rejected poem and the room was bare again the slim volume for the publishers grew slowly some evil power of daylight seemed to freeze the verse that he had left aglow so often was a night of exultation followed by an evening of dismay a manuscript of sad surprises yet at last it was finished for even he could find no more to alter then its journeys began and eventually it found a home but it was not treated kindly there and it brought him little recognition and no money he had scarcely realised the intensity of his prayers for it till it failed nor had he known what strength he derived from the hope of fame until the hope sank with the loss of faith in his work the feeling of desolation deepened a passion of revolt possessed him as he looked from the mirror to the future and saw himself perpetually alone because his misery cried for expression he picked up his pen again but though his interest in his art revived as time went by the bitterness was always in his soul even as the years passed there grew within him a hatred of his own persona jealousy of every shopboy who was kissed by a servantgirl for love chapter xi professor sorrenford had five daughters but only the eldest and the youngest were unmarried the others had removed to homes of their own the house of which the early victorian furniture was falling to decay stood in a genteel street in beckenhamptonone of those streets in which every third household hankers after a paying guest and shivers at the proposal of a boarder on the door a brass plate announced in worn lettering that professor sorrenford taught music and elocution and from time immemorial vain efforts had been made to induce the generals to pull down their sleeves before they opened that door in the diningroom which was also the parlourfor the drawingroom was reserved for the reception of pupils in the daytimea girl was lying on the sofa one afternoon before a fire that needed poking her eyes grey and luminous and the fashion in which she coiled her abundant hair gave to her delicate face a character a grandeur which she dissipated when she smiled her smile was perhaps a little foolish when her mouth was in repose she looked a woman to die for when she smiled she was merely a very pretty girl with a pinkandwhite complexion and a dimple in her cheek she wore a pale blue flannelette dressinggown with a superfluity of ribbons and as she was not smiling on the sofa but stitching the dead body of a seagull on to her best hat she had that air of spiritual reflection which always embarrassed her partners so much until they discovered that there was really nothing to be afraid of this was hilda the professors youngest the eldest had been christened hebe but in deference to her wishes no one ever called her so nor did she ever write the name she came in nowbringing the other something in a breakfastcupa girl with a curvature of the spine she was short her shoulders were square her features drawn the lips were thin and sensitive only her eyes denoted to a cursory glance that nature had meant her to be beautiful the angular deformity of the spine that defeated natures intention had resulted from an accident when she was barely three a nursemaids carelessness for a momentthen for the child inactive prostrate long years of suffering while her sisters played her mother died before the torture which the doctor described as rest had worn to an end andas the pastimes of the other girls were denied to herit was hebe who came gradually to fill the mothers place to withhold the bills that would worry the professor and to order fish for dinner when the butchers foot was down it was her part to cut the sandwiches when the other girls went skating and to stop behind and devise high teas for their return it was her part byandby to screw their frocks out of the housekeeping money when they were asked to dances and to sit up to look at their programmes when they came back later still it was her part to watch lovers come into three lives in turn and to contrive three trousseaux and see three younger sisters wooed and wed none of the family remembered any longer that she had not been born to stand aside there is nothing from which we recover more healthily than the affliction of somebody else and that she had a womans heart and all a womans natural longings herself was a fact that her poor exterior obscuredto the perception of other people when we say that we admire a face we mean consciously or not that we admire some attribute that the face suggests to us and when the exterior repels we seldom speculate very curiously about the soul today at the age of twentysix she found the addition of the tradesmens bills less disquieting than formerly by reason of the reduction of the household and since she earned a little money by her brush she was able to sweep a number of thorns from the professors path she was not his favourite daughter because there were hours in which he found the sight of her deformity depressing but when he was troubled about the rent he often exclaimed with emotion that he didnt know what he would do without her what have you got in that cup bee mutton broth she said you didnt eat any dinner have you been asleep no hilda complained i couldnt just as i was dropping off half a dozen doors began to slam is there any salt in it her voice was small and high the first time that one heard it pipe from her queenliness one felt dismayed one felt as if the grand organ stops had produced the effect of a penny whistle bee nodded and made up the fire its snowing again she said why didnt you wait till the spring before you had your influenzathen you might have gone to the seaside afterwards doctor fellowes doesnt think it would do you much good this weather i met him just now in market street and asked him what did he say he thought you had better wait till it was warmer and you could sit about more i went to tuffingtons i couldnt get any of the books on your listthey havent had them down of course miss tuffington said that nobody had asked for them tuffingtons was the principal circulating library and booksellers of beckenhampton the proprietor was at present displaying at threeandelevenpencehalfpenny in wadded roan a line that he had labelled tuffingtons series of padded poets tried and not found wanting specially recommended it was a rare occurrence to find a recent novel there however and he made no reference to padded fiction hildas gesture was more impatient than surprised there were eighteen on that list she said im sure i dont know what we subscribe for i cant keep on reading east lynne and jane eyre all my life didnt you bring anything at all they said theyd try to send you up something tonight before they shut i could only get the book id orderedthe one thats criticised in the review of reviews this month poetry she wrinkled her dainty nose what sinful waste of money where is it lets look its downstairsi left it in the hall when i went to see about your broth shall i fetch it yes do or father will pick it up and then hell elocute it at us all the evening id rather read it myself than that whos in the drawingroom nobody its thursday you knowfathers afternoon at great hunby i was going to send in a steak for his supper but rose always burns them so the last we had came up a cinder i really dont know what to get as the dinner was raw shes quite sure to burn the supper why dont you make him an omelette he likes something substantial when he comes back said bee thoughtfully perhaps eggs and bacon eggs and bacon are so soon over objected hilda and besides if they arent broiling hoti know get him a perrins porkpie bee brightened its pride in its porkpies is a cult in beckenhamptonthey obsess the local mindbut there are pies and pies and perrins are the pinnacle if the king were to consent to sup in a beckenhampton menage the breathless question what shall we give him would be disposed of when someone exclaimed give him a perrins porkpie thats it she said ill tell rose to run out now i dont know what i was about not to think of iti might have brought one in with me she went downstairs again promptly and when she returned the book that she had bought was in her hands this had not as had rossetti and tennyson and the others in the line the cachet of mr tuffingtons special recommendation it was a mere work that he did not stock she gave it to her sister and lit the gas there you are she smiled it will be something to go on with though it is poetry anything is livelier than the advertisement sheets of the newspaper said hilda unwrapping it if youre sure you dont want it yourself im so dull i could read shakespeare what a hideous cover a celibates love songsby david lee why did you order it is he anybody he only seems to have written one thing before the review of reviews said he had genius answered bee and parts of the criticism made me think i should like it no you can be quite comfortable with it ill wait till they send up your novel she pushed an armchair to the hearth and sat down as if she were tired she was as she had said in no hurry for the book though she had been eager to read it a week ago her mind was full of other thoughts this afternoon now that she was free to think them there was the picture that she was unable to begin it floated through her brain elusive and incongruent she had been so pleased last week when she came back from elphicks farm but the more she pondered over the photographs that she had taken there the more she was perplexed it was that barn with the lichened roof that threw her out such colour she couldnt bring herself to forget the barn yet if she didnt the picture would be quite different from the one she proposed to paint her camera was always leading her into temptation she reflected she had bought it to see how her subjects composed and to photograph the trunks and branches of trees in order to study their form at her leisure but since she had had it she was constantly preparing disappointments for herself constantly happening on the impracticable she stared into the fire her elbows on her lap her gaze was wide while she was wondering then her lids drooped low and lower as on the blank canvas of her mental view there grew laboriously a conception her chin was raised and mechanically her thumb made little downward movements in the air the silence lasted perhaps a quarter of an hour it was broken by the younger girl she turned on the sofa petulantly read to me bee theres a dear she exclaimed my eyes ache and the light makes them worse i thought you hated being read to said bee starting and hoping that the start wasnt noticed because it would be considered affectation not by you its elocution lessons in disguise that get on my nerves do go onits very pretty here and there bee took the book reluctantly and began to read by an effort for an instant the fact that she had been curious about it was dormant in her mind but almost immediately she remembered and the cause of her curiositythe expectation of finding in the poetry just the passionate protest that was in her own heartbrought a little eagerness into her voice very soon she came to some lines that had been quoted in the review she read them twiceonce to hilda and once to herself and again she thanked the man for saying that its rather nice isnt it hilda commented as she paused yes she said its rather nice but she held the book before her face as she went on the man revealed her secretstold all that she felt every day of her lifeand she was afraid that hilda must know it though hilda didnt her mind and spirit responded vehemently to his verse he was voicing her soul uttering the emotions which nature woke in her and which she had never been taught to express in her art he cried aloud thoughts that she had nursed in bitterness and thoughts that she had shrunk from too cowardly to own once she questioned if the poet was a man at all wasnt it the outcry of a woman hungry and resentful like herself only gifted with the power to interpret and the courage to avow she questioned only for a minute mans deification of womans beauty a mans illusions about women thrilled through the verse too strongly for her to be deceived but a deep interest in his personality mingled with her gratitude for his work it was a keener interest than had been stirred in her by any other pen she even fancied that she must understand him better than any other of his readers she would have given much to hear him talk and though it was impossiblethough she knew that few things were more unlikely than that she would ever meet himshe winced in reflecting that the very deformity which intensified her appreciation of his genius would make her appreciation a still poorer thing in his regard she was not reading now the present pause had lasted so long that the fear that hilda must divine spurred her to the next line guiltily and she glanced across at hilda as she read it but hilda was asleep she was glad she did not want to read any more just yet or rather she did not want to read any further she wanted to turn back and read some of the stanzas again there was the page that had brought before her eyes so vividly a view of the little tester churchyard from the hill it had made her wonder if he had ever been there when the poplars were blackening against the sky and all was vague suggestion but the lamplit windows of the cottagers and the ghostly gravestones of their dead she had often meant to paint an impression there and when she had found the page the desire to do so flamed in her again fiercer for her admiration of the verse if she could have expressed the feelings that the scene aroused in her the woman would have been a great painter for she felt deeply and originally in spite of the local artschool where the tuitionas in almost every english artschooltended to crush the instinctive feeling of the students her brush had provided her only happiness just as the schoolwhere she had begun to study when she was about fifteenhad provided her only training but she paid for the hours of happiness with days of dumb despair she could not stand before this or any other scene and express clearly what it meant to her and baffled she knew it she painted very pretty pictures of average merit poetical things with considerable charm but further she could not go she felt that her pictures lied about her almost as basely as her body lied she tried to believe that they maligned her because she was still young she reminded herself often that the greatest of our landscape painters had not accomplished the work that made them famous until they were nearly fortyin constables case not till later she did not know that her stumblingblock was that while she had heard a great deal about the virtues of rossetti and burnejones and ford madox brown a great deal about the eighteenthcentury masterpieces and the technique of reynolds and gainsborough and romney she had heard nothing at all about the virtue of going to nature direct for her impressionshad never been told that her own likings were as valuable as rembrandts or velazquez if she would only set them down with sufficient sincerity and courage she was one of manyone of the crowd of artists possessing a certain amount of talent and individualitywho are born in england but whom england cannot teach and for lack of the guidance that is not to be had in their own country they are for ever stultifying themselves instead of doing what was promised by their natural gifts they learn to imitate the work of the painter who has scored the biggest success of the year to try to imitate the old masters to treat deliberately a commonplace subject in a commonplace way with a view to pleasing the powers of the royal academy what they do not learn is to stand with an open mind receptive and emotional in a scene of the everyday life about them forgetting all the pictures they have seen and all the juries and the ignorance of the british picturebuying public until they know that the thing they are feeling and wanting to convey isnt a mere memory of the work of someone else but a true impression of life or nature drawn from their inner selves if hebe sorrenford could have studied in paris for four or five years she would have been a better painter and a happier woman but she did not realise it and as the professor could not have spared her it was perhaps as well that she did not the servant entered to lay the supper the porkpie crowned by parsley on the dish she said the master had complained that the beer from the new barrel was thick and inquired if she should draw some for him or bring up a bottle of stout bee replied that her father would rather have the stout he came home soon afterwards a man with mild manners and a dejected back who had written several songs that had never been published and one song that had been successfulunder another composers name he had also a sanguine temperament which had survived the corrections of thirty years a musician who had never learnt to blow his own trumpet he had failed for want of audacity and because he was always eager to persuade himself that it was policy to accept injustice rather than face an unpleasant interview he was inclined like most men who yield in the wrong places to be exacting and consequential at home worn out father eh he bent to their caresses and sank into a chair worn out he sighed stretching his feet for slippers bee brought them to him and moved the footstool what news he asked hows the invalid the invalid has trimmed a hat hilda answered how did you get on today dear he sighed again young simpson isnt coming back next term so much for simpson so much the less for us she said why not because hes a curate and puffed with vanity and i let him choose the charge of the light brigade last lesson and pretended he didnt squeak hes so highly satisfied with his elocutionary graces that he thinks he has nothing more to learn thats the worst of the elocution pupils if you encourage them they get conceited and give you up and if you dont encourage them they get disheartened and give you up pupils he spread his hands seeking epithets to stigmatise pupils and the mayor said bee it was the mayors morning with you wasnt it the mayor my dear was if possible more hopeless than ever he talks through his teeth and as to his finals you never get even a g half the forty minutes go in grammar lessonsnot to be mentioned of course ive been working on his address with him now for a fortnight and he still says gentlemen you was she laughed theres nothing like leather she said the mayor had made his fortune out of boots it seems only the other day we used to see his wife scrubbing her doorstep when we went through hippodrome place anyhow his wife carries the position better than he does hilda put in you might almost take her for a lady if you looked at her in a hurry and if you didnt hear her speak added the professor his gaze wandered to the dish rested on the pie and gladdened a perrins he exclaimed good children im hungry he rubbed his hands and shuffled to the table lets sit down yes he went onbut he spoke slowly now because to cut a perrins was a riteyes young simpson is leaving and miss kimbers classwell you know about miss kimbers class only seven piano thumpers now as against twelve at midsummer if it werent for the private lessons at the room it would hardly pay to go over to great hunby on mondays and thursdays any more hilda my dear did i give you a piece of the jelly she bent her stately head to see the grace of her slender figure had been apparent when she moved from the couch the length of limb at the mean table laid with a soiled cloth she looked a goddess to whom men might offer worship sacrifices for the recompense of her regard to offer her porkpie seemed a profanationuntil she smiled the school advertises your name in the herald said bee theres that yes he admitted theres the ad and of course it means recommendations to other schools too still the fees are not high and the little girls are not interesting wait till the opera is produced she said it will be taken some day and then ah yes echoed hilda wait till the opera is produced father conducting and uswe which is itin a private box has any manager got it now dad years ago so many years ago that they told falsehoods to one another about its age pretending that the poor dear was less ancient than it was the man had written a light opera the librettist being a friend even unluckier than he by half the theatres in london and many in the provinces this opera had been rejected its leaves were tattered and the librettist had long since renounced his pen in favour of auctioneering in the north but the professor nursed his illusion still still wove dreams around his opera over his evening pipe it was the family fetich they played its airs and sang its lyrics and laughedstill laughedat the auctioneers familiar jokes when their best friends supped with them the piano was opened and fathers opera was the feature of the entertainment when it happened as it sometimes did that the receipt of the discoloured bundle was acknowledged by a curt managerial note the composer who had so little to encourage him was uplifted by thatin fancy felt the baton in his fingers and foretasted all the rapture of his first night at such times he paid visits his eyes twinkled and his stoop had nearly gone theyre nibbling my boy he would say and then again with a beam and a toss of the head the managers are nibbling but when it is added that the score was musicianly and the airs were tuneful and that the rejected work would have been performed long before puns went out of fashion if sorrenford had only been a wellknown name there remains less humour in the pathos than his acquaintances enjoyed the old man looked up from his plate and smiled roguishly its odd you should mention the opera just now he said because theres a prospect i told you all the bad news first and was keeping that for the end wait till weve finished supper and i willhe chuckledi will a tale unfold they were all eagerness but they knew his idiosyncrasies too well to demur at the delay until the moment arrived which for no good reason he had fixed upon to tell his tale questions would be useless they exchanged glances wondering how good the news really was and recalling past prospects that they might not be disappointed when the facts came out presently they rose and went back to the hearth he filled his pipe carefully extinguished the spill and placed it with deliberation on the mantelpiece next he made himself comfortable in the only comfortable chair ha he said well dad well my dears it has been whispered to memind this is to go no further you mustnt mention this i was told in confidence yes father yes we wont breathe a word well i was told in confidencehe puffed placidlythat the theatre royal ischanging hands they were a little slow changing hands im told that mobsby is likely to give it up i hear that in a few months time the royal may be run by some other managera manager who one may say without being unduly sanguine is sure to be more enterprising for new brooms sweep clean ah said bee you think the opera will have another chance there oh oh cried hilda think his expression was gay his manner important there was even a tremor of triumph in his tone think dont you see for yourself what it means my dear women are very dense in practical matters reallyyour poor mother god bless her was just the same dont you see that it is one of the best things that could have happened for the opera im not sure im not by any means sure that it isnt quite the best thing remember who i am im somebody here not rich far from it but in my wayin the little world of beckenhamptona personage i may say that i thinki dont want to flatter myself but in my way in the little world of beckenhampton a personage yes yes dada personage of course you are good so far so good well what follows he took three slow whiffs of the pipe again the new manager wants to ingratiate himself with the beckenhampton public he says to himself i could hardly do a cleverer stroke of business than open my campaign with the work of one of the oldest and most respected of the residents its as good for him to get the opera as for me to give it to him our interests are identical weso to speakwe link arms they caught a little of his confidence and affected more but wont the touring companies stand in the way they asked tschut let him give it a production thats all i wanta fortnight a week even a night will be enough to make it known once it is heard there will be offers from london it will get about how the audience received it the managers will see the criticismsi shall post them to all the principal theatres myself i think i really do think that the poor opera has got its chance at last he mixed some whisky and water and dilated on the subject till his daughters bedtime at eleven oclock they kissed him and went upstairs in their hearts they felt a little ashamed because they had pretended to more enthusiasm than the great tidings aroused the professor hummed snatches of the overture and lay back seeing visions in the fire do you think its really of any consequence that the theatre is changing hands inquired hilda on the landing oh i dont know said bee drearily poor father lets hope it is as long as we can they had occupied separate rooms since there had been rooms to spare and when bee went into hers she took david lees book with her she sat under the gas bracket readinga little crooked figure with rapt eyesuntil the clock of st sepulchres boomed her to her feet dismayed chapter xii she was standing in her studio in front of her academy picture wondering lazily when it would be finished and if it would get in she had exhibited several times at birmingham and manchester and last spring her the grove is all a pale frail mist in the leeds exhibition had sold for thirty guineas but she had had nothing hung yet in the royal academy though she had sent there more than once her studio was an attic on the discoloured walls and stacked in corners on the floor were early worksa record to the investigator of the various stages she had passed they were all therethe pictures that one would have expected to find there were the usual attempts at family portraits the usual stilllife groups of gingerjars japanese fans and bowls of flowers there were the more ambitious canvases depicting lackadaisical females posturing in medieval landscapespainstaking exaggerations of a famous mans most obvious faults there were the subjects with silver beeches and willowy streams painted after she had given her heart to landscape for good and all and had returned to beckenhampton entranced by the work of corot compared with those early insincerities the picture on the easel was a masterpiece but she was not looking at them for encouragementindeed not many of them were in a position to be observednor was she at work though the colours on the palette were freshly set although her gaze wandered constantly from the picture to the study beside itshowing in miniature the same stretch of gorsegrown common the same sunk wayfarer upon a benchher brush was motionless and presently she tossed it to the table with a gesture of impatience she was thinking of a celibates love songs a fortnight had passed since she bought it and the volume haunted her she had been filled by an intense desire to write to the author to tell him of the effect his poetry had had on her also to ask him one or two questions about it such impulses are obeyed by a thousand women every day in the year but to this woman remote unfashionable the desire seemed so romantic and even immodest that she blushed at the temptation she wondered again if such things were done wondered if the appreciation of an obscure bent plain little artist would excite his ridicule it was the latter doubt that deterred her most strongly the fear that he might scoff the sensitiveness to her deformity which made it an ordeal to her to confront a stranger which made her ashamed of her christian name rendered her shy even in correspondence and she shrank as much from revealing herself on paper as in speech still this correspondent would not know that she was bent or plain or an obscure artist so there would be nothing for him to scoff at excepting perhaps the way she expressed her ideas she reflected for a moment that the h sorrenford which was her usual signature might even conceal her sex that fancy faded almost as it rose since her object in writing would be to obtain an answer she ought to enclose an envelope stamped and addressed yes he was bound to know that the appreciation was a womans she faltered again and wished that the poet were not a man in one respect she resembled all the readers who want autographs or information she was supported by the remembrance that she meant to spare him the expense of the penny stamp it emboldened her to begin the letter she had not a sentence in her mind when she sat down and her opening lines were the lines that popular authors have come to know by heartthe lines with which even less favoured authors are familiar before long though the knowledge that she was free to destroy the letter when it was finished made her spontaneous and she ceased to consider the propriety of her action forgot to question whether he would sneer or not she was not a literary woman and she did not write literary english but she was an unhappy woman who for the first time in her life had experienced the joy of finding herself understood and she came nearer to uttering what she meant with her untutored pen than she had ever done with her misguided brush because she was not literary she believed that when she suppressed the pronoun i she stilled the personal note and the true value of the letter lay in its suggestiveness the pleasure of expressing her love her gratitude for the verse was very great and though she chose to ignore the fact that the pages were destined to meet his eyes the inward consciousness of it remained forceful when the letter was written she read it slowly through and twice she made as if to tear it up but she did not tear it up she put it away irresolutely it occurred to her now that she could direct it only to the office of the publisher and several times during the day she wondered if the publisher would forward it once in recalling something that she had said she regretted a word that had been used and she wished she could substitute a weaker one she went to the studio and took the letter out and examined it she wrote with a j and the word was thick and black the alteration would be noticeable she did not like the thought of that was averse from giving to an unaffected letter an air of artifice and she was reluctant to copy it she stood hesitating a long while but how foolish she was she had not decided yet that she meant to post it at all the same on the morrow she vacillated hourly she wanted so much to post it but it seemed such a preposterous thing to do the more she reflected the more certain she was that she would feel ashamed if she yielded to the desire still she would put the letter in the pocket of her jacket she could determine whether it should go into the pillarbox or the fire while she was out beckenhampton itself is not picturesque though the outskirts are pretty enough the visitor finds nothing to admire in the town save the factorygirls some of whom are beautifulexcepting on sunday when they wear their best clothes and mock pearl necklaces she was tired to death of the long dull stuccoed roads that offered nothing to the imagination she crossed the marketplace and passed a postoffice and made her way towards london street in london street the misses simpson nodded to her without stopping they agreed that she was beginning to look old poor girl as they went on in her hand were the letter and the cheesemongers bill which she was about to pay the fancy did not strike her but the two things that she held were typical of her existence she paid the bill and turned homeward now she walked more slowly and when she reached the postoffice again she paused she moved a step closer to itand wavered the thought came to embarrass her that she was making herself more ridiculous still by so much hesitation at the worst the man would throw the thing aside and forget it she wished that it had been sent at once or that she had never written it at all the whole incident seemed to her intolerably stupid she pushed the letter hastily into the box chapter xiii yes davids success had come it had not been won so easily as was imagined by the readers who had never heard of him till now for he had written for many papersverse and articles toobefore a celibates love songs appeared it had not come so soon that success intoxicated him but it had come a decade earlier than it comes as a rule even to the fortunate it was the pity of it that the recognition he had wooed so ardently found his embrace at last a little passionless a humbug his friends if he had had any would have called him when he hinted as much but some of fames fairness had faded in the courtship or the wooer had lost some of his capacity for rapture the interviews and the introductions that might have been his were not forthcoming because nobody had met him yet but he was conscious of no sacrifice in waiving them on the contrary he shrank distressed from the thought of thrusting his negro face between the public and their appreciation of his verse mr norton his publisher might have intimated suavely that his personality had a distinct commercial value but david had even excused himself from calling on his publisher few things are more circumscribed than widespread literary fame and davids was only spreading though a celibates love songs was in brisk demand and a second edition the authors mother in her boardinghouse at regents park had not heard of it yet vivian was travelling as businessmanager of a dramatic company and at present the poets parentage had not transpired at panzettas somebody might have given the kickoff to a ball of personal gossip remembering the whisper of the exclerks tendencies but before a volume of poems penetrated to panzettas it would have to see not two but twenty editions in solitude as complete as when he saw his first sonnet printed or whenas an unattached journalisthe bade the clerkship goodbye david lived today the residence of the new poet whom mr norton had discoveredthere are always paragraphists who talk naively of the publisher or manager discovering a writer who has been pealing at the bell for yearswas a philistine and even shabby firstfloor in an undesirable street shadowed by grays inn road on his notepaper he ignored grays inn road and flaunted mecklenburgh square when he worked his eyes rested now on an oleograph of romeo and juliet in a gilt frame instead of on a washhandstand and his meals were laid by a domestic who removed her curlingpins by noon and was clean by teatime one does not attain distinction as a poet without acquiring certain luxuries he was not writing this morning he seldom did much good until the gas was lighteduntil the bawl of hawkers and the riot of children and the clatter and crash of milkcans had ceased in the evening there were only pianoorgans to prevent his earning a living and by ten or eleven oclock even these finished he was not writing when the second post was delivered he had his overcoat spread on the table and was trying to expunge a greasespot with a rag soaked in turpentine there was a letter for him though the servant was slow in coming upstairs the grease spot was still slower in yielding to his treatment and when she thudded across the room he was still rubbing vigorously his publishers name was on the envelope so he put the rag down wondering if there was any important news at the sight of an enclosure and a printed slip conveying mr nortons compliments he said damn for enclosures usually proved to be circulars from presscutting agencies he opened bees letter with little interest and fingers that smelt of turpentine the feeling roused in him by the first lines was a very commonplace onethe gratified flutter of a young artist who is praisedbut after a few seconds the letter affected him more subtly it was not merely that miss h sorrenford who desired a reply admired his work so did more authoritative critics nor was it simply that he was thankful to her for owning it he had been thankful to them too it wasnt only that her appreciation was intelligent a few of the criticisms had been more than that the arresting fact was that he was stirred by curiosity about her for once a woman permitted him a glimpse of her soul and the loneliness of his life made the strange event more fascinating he wondered who she was and how she looked and was humiliated to reflect how disenchanted she would be if she could see him he read the letter twice before he put it in his pocket and smiled again at the diffidence of her beginning what was the picture in her mindthe seclusion of a study a secretary sorting the poets morning mail he regarded his surroundings ruefully he thought he would reply to her on the morrow but the curiosity she had wakened in him did not subside on the contrary her letter kept recurring to him during the day and he pondered what he should say he was young enough to quake lest his response should dethrone him because the matter was engrossing he sat down to answer her the same afternoon and he found himself writing at much greater length than he had intended as he took the second sheet of paper the doubt arose whether such prolixity would not cheapen him in her view unaccustomed to a crown he was of course afraid of its slipping off he left the table and revolved a polite and colourless note that seemed more consistent with the position to which she elevated him but he wasnt satisfied with it to assist his meditations he reread her letter and now he realised that at the back of his mind lay the desire to hear from her again the note would frustrate it he returned to the table and went on with the fifth page by dint of squeezing his wisdom a good deal he contrived to avoid encroaching on page six late on the next day but one he received a few lines of acknowledgment from her they were grateful but they provided no reason for his addressing her any more he was chagrined and it would have astonished bee much to know how often david lees thoughts turned to her at the end of a week she was sufficiently astonished she recognised the writing on the envelope and the package a shade incredulously he begged her acceptance of his first book which he hoped she would like as well as his second he even hinted that he awaited her opinion of it with considerable eagerness she thanked him by return of post and when another week had gone by her opinion was expressed she had written with a faltering pen this time because she did not like his first book so well as his second and was perturbed by the necessity for saying so david put down the letter discomfited he had been looking for it every day and the knowledge that he had been impatient made him angrier still he was incensed with himself for having provoked the disappointment why had he sent her the book the tepidity of her praise never a superlative besides in parts she failed to see his meaning after all she was less spiritual than he had thought her if her earliest letter had stirred his imagination less deeply the correspondence which he had rescued once would now have been allowed to die as it was he wrote to her not long afterwards defending himself from her criticism and explaining a passage which he said she misunderstood it was manifest that he was wounded she repliedevidently abased by his displeasurethat she had not presumed to criticise so does humility juggle with words the poet was appeased and then mortified to feel that he had been a churl he scribbled a line of deprecation also angling for further favours he tied an inquiry to the end of it thus the correspondence entered upon its second stage in its second stage they exchanged letters at longer intervals but he ceased to invent pretexts for asking her to reply and she signed herself sincerely yours h sorrenford instead of yours very truly when the spring came he complained it is nearly a month since i heard from youthe bareness of the breakfasttable affronts me every morning and bee who had been the prey of scruples put them from her and wrote again they were wholly natural the letters that had begun to mean so much they would have seemed unnatural only if they had been published with an editors foreword proclaiming that the writers were strangers to each other david wrote on impulse in the hours when he was loneliest bee responded gladly when the temptation to confess herself was too strong to be denied there was no news in the letters hers especially were poor in factsher thoughts about a book he had recommended to her the impression of a ramble through the fields seldom more he was surprised sometimes to reflect how little he knew about the woman whom at other times he seemed to know so well it surprised the woman that she could unveil her soul with such audacity to a man she had not met only in moments she realised that she was able to write without constraint because they had not met he didnt know her and unknown she was unembarrassed the disparity between her body and her mind ceased to oppress her until the envelope was sealed she would not even tell him she was an artist lest he should make inquiries and discover that she was deformed in their sensitiveness to their exteriors as well as in their hunger for love these two were akin often when the man wrote to her he shivered in imagining her aversion if she could see her correspondents face often when the woman posted her answers she was ashamed conjecturing his fancyportrait of her and cowering before her crooked shadow on the road and his fancy sketched a score of portraits of her she had youthhe was sure of thatyet she was not so young that her outlook was a girls she had beautymanlike he clung to that although he had so good a cause to know that lovely thoughts may inhabit unlovely homes but after it was said how little had been told he craved the definite was she fair or was she dark were her eyes brown or blue what colour was her hair was she small or queenly at once he longed to see her and trembled at the thought of revealing himself to her astounded gaze frequently he was harassed by the thought that an opportunity for their meeting would occur and he wondered what excuse he could offer for avoiding it her letters were friendly frank one day he might open one to learn that she was coming to town how could he dare to greet her i am david lee he foresaw her start the colour falling from her face the effort with which she put out her hand after the shock and then yes they would talk together for a little while unhappily she would be painstakingly polite and struggle to conceal the dismay that he read in her every tone and gesture and afterwards there would be a difference in her letters and by degrees they would grow shorter and presently they would ceaseand the woman who had given him a new interest in life would be lost while he could retain this sweet and strange companionship he swore he would retain it the shock must come to her some time he supposed from a newspaper paragraph for the presentbut cowardice could not quiet his curiosity and again and again he wished that he could see her once always he wondered how she looked bees dread of his suggesting a visit to her was deepened by the fact that if she seemed reluctant to receive him her correspondence would assume a clandestine air into the womans life as well had come a new and eager fascination she too desired and feared together she wanted to hear him talk she did not ask herself if he was handsome but she wanted to hear him talk what joy to have a presence that he would approve to be able to tear open his welcome letters with no misgiving one day to read that he was coming and go down to the drawingroom a graceful figure in a becoming frock without the terror of reading consternation in his gaze she pictured her entrance as it must be his blank astonishment as she appeared on the threshold their perfunctory conversation with a lump in her throat his pitiful pretence that he was pleased that he had come how her letters would shrivel in his remembrance she bowed her head each was fast falling in love with an individuality each was frightened at the thought of meeting the others eyes the man said bitterly she would shrink from a mulatto the woman sighed no doubt he thinks me beautiful chapter xiv april was drawing to a close and every evening the professor said have you heard from the academy my dear and sighed when she answered no she had begun to conclude that the suns last rays was rejected and it distressed her to think of the money that she had laid out on the frame before the order for that frame was given the price had been exhaustively debated at the suppertable she knew that a good frame was a recommendation to a hanging committeeher father had argued that an artists work ought to stand on its own merits in his demeanour now she read a reproach of her extravagance and each time that he asked her if she had heard yet it was a greater effort to her to reply at last howeverone evening when hope had almost died in herthe servant entered the room with a letter the professor lolled in the armchair smoking his pipe hilda was engrossed in a new novel from turlingtonspublished in the previous springand bee herself was sitting idle her thoughts flew to david lee as she watched the girl advance towards her she had withheld from her family the fact of her correspondence with the poetwithheld it not because they would regard her friendship with him as an impropriety but because they would consider she was making herself ridiculousand she prayed that her father would not ask from whom the letter came the handwriting relieved her anxiety and the crest on the flap excited her the next moment she pulled her varnishing ticket from the envelope from the academy my dear yes she exclaimed ive got in whats that said hilda glancing up from the book got in oh have youhow nice what do they say inquired the old man let me see its a ticket for varnishing day she said i wonder how im hung very odd he remarked that they didnt send it you before he read the ticket attentively pursing his lips and turned it over as if a clue to the delay might be discovered at the back what did i tell you i knew it would be all right a pity you wasted such a lot on the frame now eh my dear she could not perceive that the mistake was demonstrated but his legitimate triumphs were so few that it would have been petty of her to grudge him an illusory one it must have been among the doubtfuls she explainedthe pictures they didnt make up their minds about at oncethats why i didnt hear before of course he said there are pictures that are put away to be examined again the committee cant decide about them right off whether they are taken eventually dependserdepends on circumstances they are called the doubtfuls he returned her information to her with the air of letting her into a secret i expect they thought it a bit dull you knowa bit dull its prettyits a pretty thingbut it wants more sunshine it isnt bright enough you havent got the blaze of the gorse into it thats what youve failed inyou havent got the blaze of the gorse its eight oclock in the evening she said the title is the suns last rays the sunshine was paling from her spirits too extraordinary she reflected that it was possible for those who always meant well always to miss saying the things one wanted to hear both he and hilda were genuinely pleasedshe knew ityet how flat the news had fallen and neither of them had cried i wonder how youre hung yes you dont convey the glory of summer unfortunately the thing isnt gay enough theres no heat in it no glare thats whats the matter with it my dearthere isnt the glare there should be now to do justice to that scene to paint it to advantage you should have shown it on a scorching afternoon under a vivid sky the tramp on the seat should have been hotmopping his forehead there might even have been a touch of humour in the figure of the tramp as it is he only looks tired you understand what i mean oh yes she murmured i understand but that isnt the picture i wanted to do i meant the wayfarer to look tired i wanted to get what george eliot called the sadness of a summers evening into it mopping his forehead with a red handkerchief now would be natural and the red would liven the picture up you might paint a red handkerchief in before the academy opens mightnt you think it over my dear a red handkerchief and a brighter light on the gorse would improve the thing wonderfully its a pity the man isnt more to the front more important he isnt prominent enough thats where the fault lies reallythe tramp isnt prominent enough though it exasperated him to hear the ignorant try to criticise music he never hesitated to dogmatise about the arts of which he knew nothing himself and as she listened to him the elation that had been born within her faded into lassitude the fact that good news had come appeared to be already forgotten her sister having said how nice was again immersed in the novel and while her father discoursed didactically without once speculating how her picture had been hung it seemed to bee that her successes were always made an opportunity for homilies in her home rather than for rejoicing how her work had been hung and how it would look were doubts that filled her mind when she travelled to town on varnishing day it was only in moments she even remembered that she was nearing the city that held david lee she knew the change that removal from the studio wrought in the aspect of a picture and she crossed the great courtyardas an exhibitor for the first timewith increasing nervousness she went upstairs and for a quarter of an hour wandered through the rooms in an unavailing search then she discovered her work high in a corner beside a picture of a child in a bright blue frock playing with a puppy on a brussels carpet she stopped with a heartquake though she had prepared herself to be disappointed the shock sickened her surrounded by other pictures also clashing with it in subject and treatment and viewed in the harsh light of the academy her quiet landscape appeared to her insignificant and unfamiliar she marvelled that there could have been hours when she was pleased with it she stood rooted there seeking the qualities that had endeared it to her they had goneeverything had gone it was the ghost of the landscape that she had painted that appalled her from the academy walls the ghost of it she drooped drearily to a stepladder and sat down when she had recovered sufficiently to return to the picture she put on a light varnish which brought up the colour of the parts that had sunk in but varnish could not brighten her mood and she had little hope that no would ever find a purchaser she had often reflected with a tremor that when david lee went to the academy he might observe her work and recognise her name in the catalogue in the novels that hilda borrowed from tuffingtons the academy was always revealing somebodys identity to someone else he moved to where the crowd was densest and a minute later a halfcry escaped his lips the scene that had never faded from his memorythe scene of their farewellglowed upon the canvas he knew that only one hand could have portrayed itknew that the artist who had leapt to fame must be the trustful girl whom he had loved and lost now that there was no danger of the work attracting mr lees notice she wondered why she had feared its doing so her misgiving that it might lead to his finding out the truth about her seemed ridiculous she even parted regretfully with the prospect of arousing his admiration in the train her despondence was deepened by the thought of having to give an account of the days experiences when she arrived while she could imagine nothing sweeter than to be approaching a home where affection was interpreted by tact her soul fainted before the ordeal of detailing the disappointment to her father and hilda she knew that she would feel worse in the parlour than she did in the train that besides being dejected she would be incensed whether things went well or whether they went badly she mused it was an equal effort to have to talk about them if the listeners seized upon the trivial and ignored the pointif they put faith in what they were meant to smile at and were sceptical where they were asked to believe how often she had gone home brimming with news and no sooner imparted the first item than she wished fervently that she hadnt any at all the porters bawled beckenampton and she got out with a sigh and made her waydusty unwilling tiredtowards the house when she entered it there were some letters lying on the hall table and she saw one among them for herself from david she picked it up rejoicing a flush warmed the whiteness of her cheeks and she forgot she was fatigued her homecoming had been happier than she expected after all chapter xv in june she went to surrey for a month she generally managed to make studies in the country during a few weeks in the year and more often than not took hilda with her the professor agreeing to their departure with as generous an air as if he were paying the expenses hilda went with her again this time they had the luck to light on godstone where they found surprisingly attractive quarters andwhat was stranger stilla sufficiency of simple food the typical village consisting chiefly of drawbacks and publichouses godstone was quite exceptional although it was the very quintessence of the countryall cows and clover and quietudethe milk there was not watered with an audacity that would have startled a dairyman of the london slums fresh butter could actually be obtained without much difficulty at a price only a little higher than it was sold at in the cities crowning marvel in the country they were not bowed under a burden of obligation in securing green vegetables though that was certainly because the kemps grew such luxuries in the garden village tradesmen never supply what the customer ordersthey occasionally oblige him with it to foster a fine spirit of indifferentism there is nothing like the knowledge that your competitors are as bad as yourself laundresses and village tradesmen are the only truly independent classes in england of course there were drawbacks even here there were for instance a butchers and a grocers opposite daisymead and this meant flies and wasps investigating daisymead in large numbers the butcher threw the onus of the wasps on the grocers sugar and the grocer said that wasps were harmless things if you hadnt no fear of em and was bitter about the butchers flies panics were frequent in the lodgers parlour and as the window faced the shops it became a question whether it was better to be stifled or stung in the morning while the artist worked hilda loitered under the appletrees and languished in basketchairs and light frocks where the shade lay deepest in the landlords field one could see the railway from the field and many a young fellow in the trains saw hilda and regretted that godstone wasnt his destination in the afternoon there was the tangle of the woods to wander throughso close that it was a constant temptation to get lost there and there was the way that began with wild strawberry blossom and rose to wooded heights below which the county spread like a green tablecloth decked with a box of toys and then after avenues of giant firs where darkness fell no matter how fierce the sun there were the surprises of lichened glades where one tiptoed among the ferns in hope of fairies with her easel and her canvases and her camera bee found the days all too short she found the days too short but there was a charm in the evenings too the final saunter along the still white road before supper just as far as the gate where the rabbits scampered or the bridge by the watermill where strange birds sometimes flashed among the boughs the hush of the little lamplit room with a book afterwards if one liked a glimpse of the stars from the gardenpath a breath of the flowersand then to bed she had written to david a few days after her arrival and his first letter to surrey came when she had been installed in daisymead about a fortnight she opened it by the little stack of hay which was all that the field had granted this year he wrote that her description of her surroundings made london still more loathsome to him that he wished vainly he could escape from it a somewhat laboured reference to his journalistic work followeda plaint that though they had become such good friends it seemed unlikely they would meet a pucker crept between her brows as she read she wondered why he said that wondered why he found it necessary all at once to harp upon the difficulties of taking a short journey to see her it was as if he were warning her not to expect him had he interpreted her enthusiasm for the place as a hint to him to come she tried discomfited to remember what her words had been after a minute she went on reading and then she saw that all this had been the prelude to a requesta none too skilful prelude but that she did not see so i have been summoning my courage to ask you she scanned the next lines rapidly and the letter quivered in her hand he asked her for her photograph she leant against the fence dismayed her first thoughtto explain that she hadnt a likeness of herself to sendforsook her under the fear of his thinking her ungracious if she did not promise to be photographed when she went home confused she sought an excuse that would sound natural never had she exaggerated her disfigurement more morbidly never had her face appeared uglier to her her shoulders higher her back more bent to send him her photograph she felt that it demanded the courage of a heroine his petition darkened the day to her it threatened her in the night she woke to be harassed by it again to send him her photographto show him what she was again and again she asked herself if her hold on him was strong enough to withstand the revelation momentarily she wished she were a man it was womans mission to be beautiful and he he shrank from ugliness she could read it in his work to him woman meant beauty beauty of worshipped form and face sweet hands sweet hair sweet cheeks sweet eyes sweet mouth each singly wooed and won the lines of rossettis that had flouted her insignificance since she was a girl jeered at her now she found no comfort in the next yet most with the sweet soul shall loves espousals then be knit yes thenafter the rest was wooed woman meant features to inspire men and a form to make them mad in a transport of imagination she imagined almost with a mans desires and hung before her glass abased but after all how could confession rob her of her happiness she had woven the tie between them of her thoughts her spirit it was her mind that pleased himhow could the knowledge that she was misshapen destroy his interest in her mind she insisted that it could notand deep in her heart was hurt to feel that his interest in her was this purely intellectual thing he cared too little for her handclasp even to travel to see her then she was a fool to hesitateshe would write him the truth next resentment scorched her that caring so little he had put this humiliation upon her a whim a spasm of curiosity and he had made her suffer so her misery cried that he was not worth it but tears sprang to her eyes at the same moment she would write to him before her courage failed her she would write as soon as hilda was settled in the field for the morning her folly should end today she was eager to write at once fearful that if she waited long her mood would change when she saw the landladys daughter in the passage she asked her to come to the parlour before she went out and take a letter to the post the girl said she wouldnt forget and the arrangement trivial though it was gave to the woman a sense of something accomplished she was dimly aware too that it would shorten her ordeal on the breakfasttable there was another letter for her redirected by the professor hilda called her attention to it for you she piped in her thin voice what hours youve been dressing i began to think you were never coming down do pour the tea out or it will be cold it has been standing there ten minutes you shouldnt have waited for me she poured the tea and picked up the letter absently it was an invitation to exhibit the suns last rays in liverpool and at any other time the request would have excited her now she was too preoccupied to find it interesting oh she murmured oh what they want the suns last rays at the walker art gallery when the academy closes thats all wheres that pass me the salt will you liverpool shall you let them have it oh yes she said i suppose so why not the carriage will cost a lot wont it no it wont cost anything theyll send for the picture and return it to me free of charge if it isnt sold her lips tightened and she looked away through the window engrossed as she was she noticed that her sister did not say how jolly for you but wont the carriage cost a lot in the course of the summer hilda would refer to the invitation casually as that nice letter you had from liverpool quite unconscious that she had shown no perception of its being nice when it came why dont you eat your breakfast she asked now having exhausted the subject of the picture i dont want it said bee you can have this egg too if you like when the table was cleared and she was left alone she sat down to her task what should she say now that the pen was in her hand her eagerness deserted her and the thought of dispelling his delusion made her tremble again her arguments of a while ago recurred to her vainlyshe was as sure that he imagined her what she would like to be as she was sure that ugliness repelled him she set her teeth and dipped the pen in the ink she could find no words presently she addressed the envelope but the notepaper was still blank in the kitchen the mother and the girl were talking she could hear them quite distinctly and dont forget to call in about the bread as you come back she glanced at the clock and wrote desperately i cannot do as you wish she scrawled because i have never been photographed in my life i have never been photographed because i am deformed and no not like that she couldnt say it like that she sat motionless again hearing the loud ticking of the clock and hating herself the clock struck insistently she pushed the sheet of paper aside and searched through the blottingbook for another there was no other in it so she went to the chiffonnier and opened the drawer in the drawer there were several things besides the stationery a sketchbook some unmounted photographs that she had taken last week in penshurst some unmounted photographs that she had taken last week of hilda she picked one of them up mechanically and stood looking at it stood looking at the photograph of hildaa study in sunlight and shadow dreaming in a garden chair under the boughs there was a knock at the door and miss kemp came in im just going miss she said have you got your letter ready what said bee huskily without turning im just going is your letter ready yes muttered the woman she ran back to the table and thrust the photograph in the envelope and put it in the girls hand chapter xvi david sat hunched in a chair the likeness on his knees he had risen determinedly and put it from him twicelodged it against one of the eyesores on the mantelpiece that were referred to as the ornaments but after intervals of abstraction he had found that he was nursing it again he had a lurking consciousness that if he put it from him half a dozen times it would be back on his lap before five minutes had gone by it surpassed all his dreampictures of her the situation confused him he could not realise it quite with the photograph under his eyes he had for a friend this young this beautiful girl though he had vaguely imagined her beautiful the definite was bewildering his letters seemed suddenly audacious to himthere was a breath of the incredible in the thought that he had written them to her and hers still more wonderful the thought of hers his correspondent was this daughter of the gods serene imperial proudthe girl who wrote to him was like this he had for a friend this young this beautiful girl for a friend his manhood abjured the word was she not his by a subtler stronger bond than friendship if the community between them could be called friendship what was love she had yielded herself to himher spiritual selfsurrendered to his keeping thoughts more sacred than her body he craved to go to her and trembled with the dread of effacing by his personality the impression that he had made upon her by his art to let his looks destroy the love his soul was waking in her no he could not go he must be strong but if he daredif only it were possible she livedit was no vision conjured up by lonelinessshe lived she was smiling speaking thinking of him not thirty miles away he was fevered by the idea of their meeting as it might have beenas it would have been if he had had a white skin he found her here where she was sitting the sunlight touched her just as nowyour friend has come to you the eyes in the portrait shone to him and he saw gladness in their gaze the trees had darkened and the stars were lit how long a time had passed in his fancy there was no calendar but the photograph had magic powers he was telling her he loved her the eyes looked tenderer the bosom swelled the lipsoh madman the thing was only paper after all if the delusion had lasted a second longer then a new idea possessed him he might see her at leasthe might see her without her knowing who he was it must be easy to catch a glimpse of her in such a place as she had described easier by far than it would be when she was at home he would go to godstone on the first fair morning and discover daisymead and linger in its neighbourhood till she came out perhaps when he arrived it would be wet then he must obtain a bedroom for the night he might even stay a week why shouldnt he he might stay a week and see her every day his thoughts spun exultantly she and her sister themselves were in lodgingsthere was nothing to prevent his seeking rooms in the same house but his name well he could assume a name for the week he would go as tremlett by no earthly chance could mr tremlett looking as he looked suggest david lee to her mind he might stroll round the field when she was in it sit near her under the trees he might even speak to her after a day or two by degrees she would grow used to his appearance in the circumstances in the solitude she might not disdain his company one evening he might avow himself talk to her of his work tell her all that was in his heart for heron an evening when the moon was hidden and she couldnt see his face elisha had once said to him when i was in love with your mother i used to sing to herin the dusk the dead mans words came back to him and he shivered he thought i am following in my fathers way awe fell upon him he heard his fathers warnings againwas walking with him on the lawn for an instant the past had swept so near that the present seemed unreal the scent of the trite flowerbeds the scenes of jealousy the taunts of the languid woman toying with her rings the sound of her sneering laugh even the rustle of her dress all these things were close close upon him he thought of his childhood and it ached in him anew his own child would not escape wouldnt it be cruel wouldnt it be monstrous to bring a child into the world to suffer as he had suffered himself human nature pleaded that his own child would know a different kind of mother and memory answered we always think a woman so different before weve got her but she was different yes he affirmed it to the dead his father would have owned that she was different she was different but the world was the same the recollection of his schooldays the consciousness of all his dull empty years of passionate rebellion menaced him it would be a cowardice it would be a crime to snatch a joy of which his child must pay the cost awe had fallen on him and of awe was born an ardent wish to pin the thought to paper to capture it for verse it was a gruesome thought that even his will was leagued against him but while half his consciousness shrank from it appalled the artist in him allured by the thoughts poetical promise darted to it admiringly tremulous with the fear that it might escape with the verbal artificer whose servitude is complete it is always so this instinctive inevitable appraisement of the spirit it is the penalty of his degrading craft he has surrendered to a power which holds nothing sacred not a sons remembrance nor a fathers love nor a husbands agonynot death nor devotion nor despair and the power is inexorable and remorseless he may forget in hours and rejoice and suffer simply like a free man but the clash of his chains will jangle on the divinest melodies of his life forcing him to scrutinise and analyse and define when he were worthier merely to feel he shall register the heartbeats of his passion and whittle an aphorism with his head on the breast of his bride his mind is for ever alert to estimate the literary value of his soul when he fondles his child his idolatry cannot save him from seeking copy in his emotions and when he sorrows by a grave his tears shall not blind him to the virtues of a lament that has not been written before the morrow was fine but david did not go to godstone just to ascertain how long it took to get there however he bought an a b c a fascinating book with the breeze of the moors and the splash of the sea in it and the suggestiveness of old townlets with quaint names the toss of a channel crossing and the lights of the boulevard are in it and the luxury of ideal hotels in english gardens and the aroma of afterdinner coffee under the trees the reader may arrive in imagination at a thousand delightful places for sixpence and he did not go on the next day either though he had half a mind to do so during the afternoon and only stayed at home because he vacillated until it was too late to catch the train he succumbed on the third day an omnibus jolted him to charing cross with his bag behind his legs and he bought a copy of a weekly journal with an essay by him in it and was fortunate enough to secure a corner seat exhilaration was in his veins as he saw the flag waved he would even have forgotten his colour if a lady who had entered the compartment while he was reading his essay had not looked affronted when he displayed his face the train loitered about the city in so exasperating a fashion that he began to think it would never get any further than london bridge but after about twenty minutes it dragged itself away and puffed surreyward with a hundred shrieks at the shout of godstone he threw the paper down and made haste to disencumber himself of the bag a spirit of adventure possessed him as he turned from the cloakroom and strode into the pebbled yard he did not inquire for daisymead at once it was enough that he was here he saw the receding train glide far along the line watched the smoke trail across the distance and dissolve the roar came to him more faintlywas not unpleasant and was still his eagerness melted into peace he crossed the pebbles and walked along the winding road the perfume of honeysuckle was blown across his nostrils the hedges were gemmed with the pink of bachelors buttons and the blue of birdseye meadows sloped graciously it was the country his soul gave thanks for that sweet and rare thing silence at first he thought it silence then as his hearing became attuned to the surroundings he grew conscious that the air was indeed alive with soundwith a twittering and trilling with the hum of bees and the whisper of long grass running in silver wavelets before the wind it must also be said that he was aware of the buzzing of a fly which accompanied him for nearly half a mile and kept alighting on his neck he picked some wildflowers that caught his glance and stuck them in his coat they were beautiful and he wondered what they were presently he met a band of village children and inquired the flowers names the youngest of the party perhaps was twelve they stared and did not know the notes of a stormcock held him calling in an elm again he wondered a woman came down the road with a basket on her arm and he spoke to her and asked what bird is that she was old and bent and had lived here all her life she stared and did not know ive never took no heed o birds she answered it was the country he trusted that information would be easier to acquire when he sought the house a stile suggested a pipe and smoking he noticed a hedgegap and found himself at the entrance to a wood it must be the wood of which he had heard the wood that she had pictured to him in her letters he always thought of her as she the formality of miss sorrenford as impossible in meditation and he could hardly think of her as h she had said that she came here constantly it might be that she would come while he lingeredit might be that the bushes hid her from him now in the sadden fancy it appeared to him that the wood was the scene where he desired most fervidly to find herthat it was here that he must first behold her in order to complete the joy he parted the brambles and pushed eagerly into the depths he pressed into the labyrinth as ardently as if he could hope to speak to her if they met how dark it was with the sky shut out the foliage sighed a little overhead the tangle was so low that often he had to stoop his feet crushed the litter of dry dead leaves the branches of the wildrose clung to his clothes he attained to light solitude engulfed him and the bracken was as high as his knees in the cool moist hush he could hear a twig drop upon the moss he stood reflecting that it was not a place for a girl to roam in unprotectedthe nearest habitation might have been miles away near as it was no scream could reach it no cry for help was likely to penetrate even to the road his mind was now less occupied with agreeable visions of discovering her than with solicitude for her safety every day at this moment he was startled by a stealthy tread a rough figure was creeping cautiously between the trees he did not see david but for an instant david saw nothing but him nothing but the cruel eyes the avid face the upraised arm for an instant in the next he sawtrusting itself to earth a few yards offa starling and the lad stole towards it greedily the only thought quickened in him by its loveliness the idea of smashing it with a stone it was the country the birds plumage gleamed like satin the little creature was so confident so fragile so happy that the hellishness of the thing turned the mans heart sick he flung his pipe and the starling flew upward saved a second before the stone was hurled the lad was both aggrieved and contemptuous viewed as a missile the pipe argued the man a fool then david who burned to thrash him explained himself with heat but the other showed such dull amazement at his indignation such utter lack of understanding that wrath gave place to misery in the poet it even seemed to him as he moved away that he had been unjust a little later in the year cultured men and graceful women would also murder birds for fun one bird or another with a gun or a stone to the yokel too his shame was sport the difference in the barbarism was only a difference of class david had had enough of the wood having recovered his pipe among the ferns he made his way out and sauntered back along the highroad overtaking a large sack slung across the shoulder of a small boy who at close quarters revealed the peaked cap and uniform of a postman he asked to be directed to daisymead and learnt that he had not far to go it was a low white house with stiff white curtains hanging in the windows and full white roses climbing on the walls the sight of it disappointed him rather and it seemed to him to be on the wrong side of the way though he had never preconceived its situation consciously a flight of steps led to a white gate and a patch of frontgarden wonderfully ablooma revel of pinks and canterburybells and the velvet of sweetwilliam he gave a knock questioning a little how to account for his application for he saw no card with the familiar london legend furnished apartments over the door it was opened by a strapping woman drying her hands on her apron she was not a peasanther eyes were alert her face was mobile and though she had grey hair she bore herself erect her gaze widened at him there was even a tinge of apprehension in it good morning he said im looking for roomsor for one room if i cant get any more have you any to let yes answered the woman hesitatingly can i see them well im not quite sure she faltered he understood that it was his appearance that made her doubtful i dont know whethermight i ask oo it was that recommended you he pointed airily the postman directed me here ive just come down from town my luggage is at the station im not sure whether my husband d care to take in any more people this year weve got two ladies staying with us already and if youll wait a minute ill see what e says about it he waited in suspense she returned after a consultation in the kitchen her husband with her though the man came fully informed of what was wanted david felt sure that it would be necessary to begin at the beginning again and in this he wasnt mistaken the couple stood contemplating him curiously waiting for him to speak good morning he said im looking for two rooms or for one room if i cant get any more have you any to let well we ave got two rooms admitted the man can i see them the householder scratched his head well i dont know he said slowly my wife ere shes not quite sure whether she could manage with anybody else this summer are you emma theres two ladies staying ere now and it makes a bit o work for her dont it emma you might get a room a bit lower down very likely what was it you were wanting oh anything would suit me exclaimed david with an ingratiating smile and suppressed rage im not particular at allonly i should have liked to go to a house where i could be sure of being comfortable yours looks so pretty and so clean its the only place ive seen round here that i should care to pay much in he had been struggling to recall their nametrying to see it mentally in one of bees lettersand it flashed upon him now cold meat and cleanliness mrs kempit is mrs kemp i think he made her a bow cold meat and cleanliness are worth more than late dinners ander the sentence would not round itself he forced another smile for climax you might eat off any floor in this ouse she declared deciding he was human im sure you might he replied in london we dont often see a house like it i can tell you youve not been in london long i suppose she said you come from abroad dont you no ive lived in london all my lifemy business is there thats why i go to the country when i get a holiday ah said mr kemp reflectively its a great place londonroom for all sorts in it yes said david what lovely roses you have mrs kemp and how sweet the pinks smell what flowers are those in the cornerthe high purple flowers against the wall them she said lor im a poor one at flowers what do you call em john i dunno said john well i dont wonder you think twice about taking lodgers but ihe laughed feeblyim a very honest person i wouldnt steal so much as a leaf there was a pause they all looked at one another what do you say john she murmured we might manage to take the young man in perhaps eh you wont find me any trouble if you do youll give me a firstrate character when i leave you cried david with geniality that exhausted him about rent said mr kemp what did you think of paying what do you want the couple exchanged anxious glances mr kemp breathed heavily well we have had as much as a pound for those two rooms for a lady and three children through the summer he said of course added the woman for only one person call it a pound said david whipping out his purse and i suppose its fairest to pay in advance my name is tremlett ill just look round and then ill go to the station and get my bag and so it was accomplished the same roof sheltered him and her he smiled now naturally in savouring the fact his little sittingroom was at the back overlooking the cabbages and a red rosebordered path that led to the hennery and the field its oldfashioned shabbiness was not without a charm and having yielded consent mrs kemp adopted a solicitous manner with a strong flavour of wondering compassion in it she still seemed to him in moments to be marvelling silently that he was able to talk her language when he came in from the station he found that she had brightened his table with a bowl of poppies and elderblossom gathering the poppies had robbed them of their sprightliness and they hung shrivelled like pricked airballs but the delicacy of the elderblossom was exquisite and he liked the tone of what she called the old crock because wildflowers pleased him less in his coat than anywhere else he put those that he was wearing into a mug preserved on the mantelshelf on the front of the mug he saw a view described as rickmansworth church from the east and on the base he saw the inscription made in germany his mind began to misgive him about the sisterperhaps she would prove a dragon in the way he half hoped that mrs kemp would let fall some particulars when she brought in his chop she said nothing to the point however nor did he hear any voice about the premises to wake sensations when his dinner was eaten he went out to the path and threw eagerglances round the field but the two chairs under the trees were empty and there was nobody in sight so he came back and smoked a pipe on the sofa a young girl entered with his tea he judged her rightly to be the kemps daughter she evidently came to ascertain how a mulatto looked and she was not disinclined to hear one talk he felt that he was enlarging his circle of acquaintances amazingly in a day here he had spoken to more people than he addressed at home in a month from miss kemp he learnt in conversation that she had just been getting tea ready for the ladies too she coupled the information with a reference to one pair of hands he waited for her to add the companion phrase about her head never saving her legs but she did not she was a nice girl and not uneducated though she did say one pair of hands when she meant one person and when he bewailed the fact that it had begun to rain and she brought him some novels to pass the time he was surprised to find what novels she read however they entertained him very little his soul was divided between dejection at the weather and gratitude for her kindness he was so unused to kindness that the landladys daughter offering to lend him books seemed to him a tender and a touching thing the chairs had been brought indoors the rain rattled on the laurels and strewed the petals of the roses on the path through the long twilight a pair of heavy hands in a neighbouring cottage laboured a hymnthe village pianist always chooses hymnswith mournful persistence david stood at the window recognising despondently that the ladies would remain in their parlour all the evening the field of his expectations would be void and profitlessit might even be too wet for them tomorrow chapter xvii but it was not when he woke the day was radiant a guileless sky denied its misdemeanour merrily mrs kemp in clattering the china asked him how he lay last night he thanked her and took a mental note of the locution inquiring in his turn when the rain had ceased for answer she snorted rain and frowned reproof at the sunshine and he attributed her manner to crops his pouch was empty she told him that tobacco could be obtained at the grocers so he went across the road presently and bought some at a little shop that proclaimed itself renowned for its breakfasteggs and celebrated for its bacon as he came out a woman passed him laden with a canvas and a sketching box a campstool and what looked like a bunch of rods she was pale and slight he saw that she was deformed as he hurried by he didnt take much notice of her a chair had been put back in the shade of the boughs and he waited feverishly where it was well in view soon a girl strolled down the path between the roses she wore a white frock and had a book in her hand her face dazzled him his heart leapt to greet her she entered the field and sat down under the tree the photograph had come to life he leant gazing at her unnoticed chapter xviii this was the event of his second day here this was all he had seen her the knowledge sang in his senses momentarily he felt that if his visit yielded no more it would have been bountiful enough when her glance lighted on him he read her thought in it and drew back ashamed he turned away ashamed and afraid of seeming to intrude in town he had dared to picture himself sitting near her watching her movements breaking the ice in godstone selfconsciousness confounded him she appeared to him unapproachable he had even been humiliated by her look hilda said to bee that afternoon theres another lodger here hes a niggeror something of the sort isnt it a nuisance i wonder the kemps take that kind of people in with us in the house oh is he staying here said bee i saw him coming out of peters perhaps he is only down for the weekend i dont suppose hell be in our way if he does make himself objectionable you had better come out with me in the morning while he stops i think i could keep him at a distance without that returned hilda scornfully besides he would never have the impudence what horrid luck though if it had been a man come to stay here now it would have been rather nice but they had no reason to complain of his being in their way the new lodger did not attempt to scrape acquaintance with them although in the next two days they often passed him idling in the garden or sauntering along the road he refrained so punctiliously from staring at them that they were able to steal a few glances themselves bee observed that he looked unhappy and was fond of flowers and hilda remarked that he wore a wellcut suit and had a nice taste in neckties evidently not a common nigger she said a medical student or something she was not concerned though it was clear that he had come for longer than the weekend on tuesday she was obliged to acknowledge his existence it was a stupid incidentto happen with a nigger it might as easily have happened with somebody worth meeting say with one of the young men who bowled into the stationyard in dogcarts and looked as if they wished they knew her she had gone out to get a daily paper and the lodger was in the shop buying foolscap she was told that the last of the newspapers had just been sold to him as soon as he heard that he stammered something about not depriving her of it he stood before her with his strawhat in one hand and the paper extended in the other she thanked him but said that it really had no interest for her at all he persisted she was firmand left him overwhelmed by his gaucherie in not persuading her to take it ten minutes latermrs kemp to miss hilda sorrenford mr tremlett has done with this paper so e says you can ave it now if you like miss hilda sorrenford understanding that the message has suffered in delivery tell mr tremlett i am much obliged to him and in the evening when she saw him in the garden she bowed and said that she thought the weather was a little cooler david went back to his foolscap having discovered that it is sometimes much easier to write poetry about a girl than to talk to her and already he was reconciled to her voice because it was hers prose was still a crutch that he couldnt afford to drop and he had hoped to transfer some of an essay from his head to the foolscap by bedtime his subject was before him nothing less than an acorn sprouting a slender stem and a handful of leaves in a tumbler of water spying it in the woods he had brought it home and given it honour to mrs kemps diversion he had enthroned it on the table that little acorn bursting with the ambition to be a tree and as he sat wondering at it the slip of a stalk had grown to be gnarled and old and the bunch of leaves had towered above the centuries children came to play beneath it who were chided for forgetting whether elizabeth or victoria had reigned first over england in the long ago and generations of lovers had flitted past its shade prattling of eternity the story of the acorn had clamoured in him to be written but now he was too excited and unhappy to work besides how could he say it all in two or three thousand words it asked to be a book how clumsy he had been in the shop stuttering and blundering like a schoolboy how absurd in the garden with his fatuous monosyllable why couldnt he disguise his shyness he had disguised it well enough from the landlady when he paid her compliments on the doorstep nobody would have suspected how turbulent his nerves were then at the time he had been proud of his fluencyare not shy people always proud of being fluent even when they hear themselves saying things they dont meannow he remembered it wistfully jealous of himself and his letters his letters mocked him to write to a girl like that and be tonguetied in her presence the thing was laughable but he had learnt her name at last for when he made mrs kemp his messenger she had said oh you mean miss ilda estimated by emotion it was ages before it happened before their relations advanced beyond goodmorning or goodevening with a platitude dropped in passing and a commonplace returned with the lifting of his hat yes estimated by emotion it was ages before it happened but according to the almanac he had been here exactly nine days she was under the same tree in the same chair he had seen her settle herself there half an hour ago and for half an hour he had been questioning how she would receive him if he joined her what should he say first could he give to the indulgence a sufficiently casual air in fine what sort of figure would he cut he ruffled his manuscript irresolutely in a yard close by somebody was hammering at a fence it appeared to him that somebody began to hammer at a fence as often as he tried to work there was no possibility of his writing even if he made another attempt and inclination pulled him hard towards the field he gathered the papers up and put them cautiously away as a criminal removes clues when he gained the path she had risen from the chair and was running bareheaded in his direction he did not for an instant see more than that more than that she was running and he wondered then he saw her face and her voice reached him and he realised that she was running for help so they ran towards each other for five perhaps ten seconds she as if pursued and he seeking the cause a wasp she panted in my hair a wasp get it out a wasp why must one always echo in emergencies he called himself a fool dont be frightened keep still ill get it out in a minute quick quick she said pulling at her hair frantically i shall go mad keep still he repeated take your hands downitll sting you he could hear the angry buzzing of the thing but it was entangled hidden and her hair dizzied him she found the diffidence of his touches exasperating take the pins out she cried yes yes take them out oh not like that be quick her impatience showed his breathlessness the way he fought reverence down and tore them out as fast as she her hair rained over his hands and swept his arms the wasp gave a last buzz venomously oh thank you so much i hope i do hope you arent stung she said stung he was faint shaken by a hurricane of new and strange emotion its all right thanks ive given you a lot of trouble she said apologetically it was silly of me to make such a fuss i suppose but i cant tell you what it felt like i can imagine ive always been afraid it would happen one day the place swarms with them doesnt it they come from the shops across the road he said he was being stupid he felt it his little minute of authority was over and he was selfconscious again she began to pick up the hairpins from the grass david stooped too as she looked at his hands she thought of the service they had rendered and shuddered slightly absorbed he watched her lift her hair and twist it in a hasty coil and stab it thrice with unconcern in the people of the dream street there is a line that was born at this moment though it was not written till long afterwards you have been staying here for some time havent you he blurted yes nearly a month she said how pretty it is isnt it we came here for my sisters workshe paints you know yes i know i saw her before i saw you though i didnt know she was your sister then she seems to work hardi mean she is out a great deal yes its just the sort of country she likes i think shes sorry were going she talks about coming back in the autumn to make some more studies here youre going he said blankly are you when our month is up the day after tomorrow we only came for a month there was the slightest pause while he cursed himself for wasted weeks and you he asked do you paint too i oh no she smiled her foolish smile complacent in the consciousness of youth and a profile his eyes allayed her misgivings about her hair i dont do anything im quite ordinary she said david smiled with her there was a fascination in pretending to know nothing of her mind when he believed he knew so much its original to be ordinary now that everybody is a genius is everybody a genius she looked a shade vacant perhaps you live in london our home is in beckenhampton in the provinces i am afraid we are rather out of it oh one can be quite as much out of it in london what can be more provincial than the life of the average londoner he goes to his business after breakfast and he goes back to his villa after tea the few friends he makes are naturally in the same groove and talk about the same things why he went on overjoyed to have found his tongue he has no more acquaintance with artistic london or political london or fashionable london than the people with businesses and villas in the other towns i dont understand the average londoners idea that because his own particular hencoop is in the capital he must have a wider range of vision than all the other hens in the kingdom i dont know what its based on one would suppose that the sight of the general post office from the top of a bus every day converted people into a kind of intellectual aristocracy the suburbs snigger at the provinces and bloomsbury sneers at the suburbs and the truth is that outside a few exclusive circles londoners get all their knowledge of london from the newspaperswhich the provincials are reading at the same time she was not interested in the subject it struck her only as a strange one for him to discuss i suppose so she said still in london one sees things and one can get books to read its as difficult to get a new book in beckenhampton as it is to get cream in the country is that difficult he asked thinking of keatss tight little fairy oh you dont know the country very well try they look at you amazed when you ask for it she laughed last year when we went away we took a new american tinned thing in the shape of a breakfast food with us i forget what it was called a sort of porridge they told you on the tin that it was to be eaten with cream carelessly cream i believe in america cream isnt a curiosity our efforts to get threepennyworth there was only one place for miles round where there was the slightest chance of ita dairy belonging to a great lady who supplied the public with milk as a favour i dont mean that she didnt take their money but that the customers had to call for the milk and carry it away we used to go there two or three times a week and kowtow to a consequential dairy woman we almost thought at first she must be the great lady but when she accepted our tips we concluded she wasnt she unbent so far as to promise to try to manage it for us one morning after about a fortnight we reckoned it would have cost us two shillings by the time it was managed i daresay it would have cost more but we decided that we couldnt afford the price of threepennyworth of cream in the country and we never got any i cant say im very fond of the country on the whole why i imagined you loved it that ishe corrected himself hastilyyouve the air of being so contented out here have i oh i do gush about it sometimes butshe shrugged her shoulderscountry walks are rather tiresome after youve got used to them dont you think so he hesitated i think they must have been pleasanter before bicycles were invented he said its difficult to enjoy a stroll along a country lane when you have to keep skipping into a hedge to save yourself from being cut in halves men who drive realise their responsibility but every counterjumper seems to ride a bicycle and the cad in power is always dangerous the most exasperating thing about the country to me is the blindness and deafness of the people to all the beauties round them ill except mr kemp because ive discovered that he notices the birdsthey steal his grain and he shoots thembut ive been trying to learn the names of the wildflowers ever since ive been here and its impossible one might as well inquire at bethnal green i didnt know that she said i havent tried to find out but certainly everybody is very stupid there was a moments silence his glance wandered and reverted to her she made a delightful picture she was as lovely a philistine as ever looked to the main chance with the gaze of a goddess and for him she had the magic of letters that she had never written the seduction of thoughts that she had never known he would not admit to himself that a shade of disappointment was clouding his mood her name was cried before he spoke again hilda where are you hark my sisters calling she said i expect dinners ready she moved towards the house david beside her and met bee coming down the path mr tremlett has been saving my life bee ive been attacked while you were out mr tremlett was very kind answered bee smiling how did he do it the three loitered in the doorway talking and she thanked him seriously when she understood what had happened he noted that her tones were grave and sweet and pitied her and his gaze kept straying to the beautiful face after a minute he turned away and the sisters went inside hes quite a gentleman said the girl and im sure he must have been stung though he pretended he wasnt it would have been quite romantic if he had been another colour she loved me for the dangers i hadaverted murmured bee whats thata quotation asked hilda chapter xix the rest of the day was barren and in the knowledge that their visit was so near its end david chafed at each empty hour he had seen hilda for a moment only since the morning standing aside as she came down the stairs he had asked her if she was going to the field again and she shook her head saying that she had a letter to write he thrilled with the fancy that it might be a letter to himself how queer to think that she might even give it to him to post still queerer to reflect that the thoughts which had so often held him captive and the blithesome chatter that had rung so false were coin from the same mint if they had been the strangers to each other that she believed he would never have divined the gold beneath the small change for that matter he too had been commonplace the soul wasnt a jackinthebox to jump to order oh mr thackeray dont breathed charlotte bronte disillusioned when he helped himself again to potatoes and probably he had said nothing to justify her homage by the time the cheese came he david lee had talked potatoes more than likely the girl whom he had found trivial had found him trite ever recurring and overthrowing his reverie was a gust of sensationin part a perfume in part a sickness in which it seemed to him that the scent of her hair was in his throat before he left town he had scribbled a few lines expressing his gratitude for the photograph and now it occurred to him that an answer might be lying at his lodging already he wished he could read it he wished he could reread all the letters here while he was seeing her he felt that to do so would help him without defining his need he felt that the letters tangible familiar would lessen the vague sense of unreality that blew across his mind during a few seconds he craved more to reread the letters than to find himself alone with her not so in the morning he rose eagerly while he dressed it seemed to him that he had been unreasonable yesterday he accused himself of having resented circumstances of having all unconsciously expected her to accord to tremlett the confidences she made to lee that was absurd ostensibly a stranger a mulatto thrown in her path by chance how could he hope for her to lift her veil but let her keep it downit couldnt hide her from him let her yield a fingertip after she had bared her hearthe knew her even as she knew herself he smiled to think that by a word he could transfigure her it was too soon he was afraid to speak it the complexity of the emotion that he foresaw in her warned him back but the idea of power was sweet to him he could tear the veil aside and call the real woman breathless to his view he the stranger there was a throb of triumph in his delusion the day was sunday and when he joined her he found the sisters together he regretted that the elder had remained at home although he knew that he had had nothing to hope from a teteatete you dont paint today miss sorrenford no she said i dont paint on sunday good gracious exclaimed hilda i should think she didnt what do you suppose the kemps would say to her we should be turned out shouldnt we bee oh yes i forgot the kemps he said it would shock them of coursebee he assumed was a diminutive of beatrice ive only spent one sunday here it was rather depressing everybody looked so out of placeall the villagers seemed to have gone why do they dress up and spoil themselves on sunday it was as if a lot of supers in a play had come on in the wrong scene hilda smiled theyd think you had very bad taste if they heard you say so you might as well try to persuade a servant that she looks smarter in a frilled cap and a muslin apron than when she goes out to meet her young man poor people always make frights of themselves on sundayand they pride themselves on their boots creaking poor people he answered and the little childrenthat was worse still it made me wretched to see the children my heart ached for them whenever i went to the door oh you noticed them said bee did you yes its painful their hushed voices and their sad eyes they mustnt play theyre forbidden to be happy they sit in solemn groups talking in whisperscursing sunday i often think if one of them forgets and laughs its mother comes out and shakes itto teach it to love god bee dont get on the platform or we might as well have gone to church we do go to church mr tremlett dont think we never do any better than this please but one doesnt feel so religious in the country on sunday as one does in a town it must be something in the air perhaps its because in the country one feels so much more religious every other day of the week said david bee had frowned discomfited she sat silent in her silence david was sorry for the beautyher banter had been so innocent the frown the tightened lips seemed to him an undeserved reproach then he talked to the wrong woman while the right woman listened and he was even a little piqued that his earnestness couldnt rouse the wrong woman to permit him a glimpse of the poetry that was not in her but once when her skirt fluttered against his hand it was not the thought of the poetry in her that sent a shiver up his arm and it was not the thought of her sensibility that made his heart gallop as imagination gave him back the tingle of her hair that was herself her pretty fleshandblood the potent pinkandwhite reality of her something he said some chance remark brought a line of a celibates love songs to bees mind her thoughts darted again to the photograph and for the thousandth time she wished she could recall her stupid act for the thousandth time she sought the courage to acknowledge it the confession from which she had shrunk at the beginning looked by comparison easy i am deformed well at least no one could laugh at that but i sent my sisters likeness instead of my own that was ridiculous contemptible and how could she explain the impulse wouldnt the man put his own construction on it wouldnt he thinkwouldnt it be tacitly to admitthat she was in love with him still did the folly she had committed matter very much he would never see her never see her or hilda either if he had meant to come surely he would have come already sooner or later the correspondence would die and she would be alone again was it necessary to degrade herself in his sight he would think she was in love with him once more the question that she was always trying to evade flared through her brain did it really mean thatin love with a man she had not met she said the thing was impossible and felt it was indecent and knew it was true the man had needed an appeal to the senses before he repudiated the term of friendship the woman had no such need she knew that she loved him although she refused to own it she loved him for his mind for all that was herself in him for all that was kin to her but beyond her reach and now while her reverie might have borne her far from the conversation at her side she was forced to listen to him though she had no suspicion that it was he who talked the mind that she loved compelled her to listenfor david was striving to make the dainty hilda lift a corner of the veil and there being no veil she could not lift it but the woman whose presence he had half forgotten felt her sympathies stirred within her strongly and could have given him thought for thought and note for note while she sat there silent and unheeded there was no veil he was straining to clutch a phantasm surrendering to the temptations of his fancied power and whilst the poet pluming himself on power put forth his intellect to master the girl that there was not the indolent pinkandwhite girl that there was was mastering him he talks too much now he has got over his shyness she murmured as he moved away im glad he has gone are you said bee why im not he interested me really well i wish you had joined in then instead of sitting there mum why didnt you i dont think he would have been very grateful he didnt want to talk to me hildas admirable eyebrows rose just a shade higher than they would have risen if she had been surprised because she knew what was meant she said what do you mean i could see he wanted to talk to you he always does i think its rather a good thing were going home tomorrow good heavens dont be so idiotic do you suppose for a single moment i could no i was thinking of him poor fellow said bee i daresay he is unhappy enough without any other trouble it was not unpleasant to hear that she was esteemed so dangerous the girl essayed the languid tone of her favourite heroines what an imagination you have she drawled now he only struck me as a dull person who didnt know when to get up when a man looks like that he ought to be very careful what he talks about so few subjects go with his complexion bee thoughtoh the arrogance of beauty it would even deny to the others the right to have beautiful minds in the afternoon a thunderstorm broke over godstone and rain fell with more or less violence all the evening it saved hilda from being bored by him again for their train next day was an early one and after breakfast she was upstairs a good deal watching the trunks being packed once or twice as she tripped to bee from the sittingroom with a book or a workbasket or a packet of labels he met her in the passage and she threw him the brave smile of one who was sunny in fatigue but there was no opportunity for conversation to david the shadow of her departure had fallen across daisymead already already he felt desolate in anticipating its emptiness when she had gone it seemed to him quite a month ago that he had arrived here and the few scenes of their brief association now that the end had come were as dear to his regret as close companionship even the period of his bashfulness and despondence had a tender charm in looking back at it he was eager to flee with his memories to town instinctively conscious that in no place would he be so forlorn as in the place where she had been but there would be heavy hours before he was able to go poignant hours in which to miss her first it had been in his mind to walk to the station with them both but she did not seem to wish it so he bade them goodbye in the front garden while the porter was making the luggage fast on the truck the landlady and her daughter had come out too and at the last minute mr kemp appeared he had a dead bird in his hand hilda uttered an exclamation of pity as she saw it and bee was mute oh the dear what bird is it mr kemp a green linnet miss he said mischeevious things a linnet i thought linnets were always brown id no idea they were ever so pretty as this why its perfectly lovely what a shame they arent all made green yes its a showy thing admitted mr kemp the brown un aint much to look at alongside it thats a fact he rubbed his hand on his coat and put it out to her in farewell but the green linnet has got no song the sisters went slowly up the road and david followed the showy figure with his eyes until the road swerved chapter xx well my dears said the professor and how are you eh got nice and sunburnt and done yourselves good have you bee my dear you might just touch the belli told the girl not to make the tea until we rang let me have a look at you both now he looked at hilda come come thats first rate and whats the news oh were splendid she replied i dont think theres any news we just did nothing that is i did nothing and bee worked you might have come down to us dad if only for a day we were always expecting a wire to tell us you were coming yes i know my dear he said i know you wrote me when i read your letter i thought i really would go down i made up my mind to now i know what ill do i thought i wont answer herill say nothing about itand on saturday ill pack my bag and take her by surprise but god bless my soul when saturday came i couldnt get away my dear i couldnt get away his glance wandered to his other daughter and rested on her doubtfully or perhaps it was you who wrote bee one of you did i know its all the same just the same father she said all the same we both wanted you the teapot was brought in presently and half a dozen words were uttered which did more to make her feel at home again than anything that had happened yet the servant knocked a cup over put a forefinger inside it in setting it right and said in a hoarse whisper can i speak to you miss when the conference with the servant was over bee carried her fathers cup to the armchair and took hildas to the sofa and the professor murmured in the tone that belongs to afterthoughts and did you make your studies bee yes thanks father thats right many oh just as many as i hoped to do im rather pleased with one of them thats right anything new here father in a way my dear in a way the new man has taken over the theatre royal mobsby has left the town i hear he has gone to nottingham you might give me another piece of sugar a very small pieceor break a lump in halves the new man taken over the theatre said hilda have you written to him about the opera have you father asked bee searching the sugarbasin yes he said yes i did write to him im afraid hes not a gentleman i dropped him a line explaining matters and offering to call on him one day when he had an hour to spare if he would suggest an appointment and heeri got no answer perhaps the letter didnt reach him dear i fancied that might be the reason said the professor the same idea occurred to me so i wrote to him again butno im afraid both letters reached him now mobsby used to answerill give him credit for that he wasnt enterprising but he was civil at all events he made excuses for declining my work this mr jordan seems to have no enterprise and no politeness either we dont go to the royal any more my dears i put my foot down about that for the future when we take tickets for a theatre they shall be for the grand the royal always has the best companies though pouted hilda and the audience at the grand is so dirty for all that we shall go to the grand repeated the professor its the only dignified protest i can make while the royal remains under this fellows management it will see no money of mine i am quite firm on that pointunless of course diplomacy effects anything he added unless diplomacy effects anything diplomacy cant effect much with a man who doesnt answer your letters said hilda her voice was tart what more do you think of doing then father inquired bee have you a plan i never let the grass grow under my feet you know when there is an opportunity i make the most of it a friend at court may do a great deal and the other afternoon he sipped slowly and spread his handkerchief across his knee it seemed almost providential i dont do such a thing once in two months but it was a very hot day and i was tired and thirsty it was on my way home from great hunby i turned into the george for something to drink my dear and i made the acquaintance of mr jordans business manager the thin edge of the wedge perhaps though i am never sanguine of course i did no more than mention the operathe merest wordbut he seemed interested the next time we meet i shall refer to it again it may lead to something he was intelligent he may pull the strings im never sanguine but it stands to reason that the business manager of a theatre has a lot to say in the conduct of affairs if i cultivate him he looked about him impatiently you might pass me the tobaccojar my dear she got up and took it from the mantelpiece and gave it to him here it is father if you cultivate him you think he might use his influence with mr jordan just so but festina lente my dearhasten slowly dont look too far ahead its because people look too far ahead that they trip in reading aloud the same principle exactly the eye travels too fast and the tongue stumbles half the mistakes that the pupils make in reading blank verse are due to the fact that they look too far ahead in life as in reading we should clearly enunciate one word at a time what was i going to say yes having made his acquaintance theres no telling what it may lead to if i show the young man a little hospitality its quite on the cards that mr jordan may sing a different tune and ask me to let him hear the opera if he should do that ii am not vindictiveif he should do that and give the work his honest consideration we would certainly go to the royal as usual the prospect of his showing a new young man a little hospitality smoothed the frown from hildas brow the young men of beckenhampton were mercenary and girls who had been her schoolfellows and knew her agegirls who had no other attraction than their fathers incomeshad married in their teens she was not without a lurking fear of being left on the shelf as she phrased it in which misgiving she resembled a multitude of girls who look equally superior to the fear and the phrase it is indeed an unpleasant comment on our method of bringing up the maiden that in the minds of even the most modest girls the eagerness to marry should precede the wish to marry any man in particular to the blunter and less refined sensibilities of the male there seems something a little indelicate in this impartial eagerness the professors intention commended itself to hilda so warmly that during the next few days she introduced the subject of the opera more than once it was not until she had been back from godstone a week however that the growth of the grass to which he had made reference was in any way checked and then chance was the mower she had gone but with him ostensibly to help him to choose a hat and of a truth to prevent his choosing one for the years during which man is free to exercise his own judgment about his own clothes are few as they turned into market street he gave her a nudge so hard that it hurt her and waving his hand to a stranger slackened his pace the stranger who had been hurrying past saw that the elderly bore was accompanied by a bewilderingly pretty girl and came promptly to a standstillin his bearing all the deference which a young man can yield to old age under the eyes of beauty oh how do you do professor sorrenford ah pleased to meet you again exclaimed the professor let meermy daughter mr harrismy daughter vivian made another bowone far different from the shamefaced bob of the local swains hilda thought it was indeed modelled on the obeisance he saw the lovers make to the heroines when he was counting the house in the dresscircle mr harris is a newcomer to the town said the professor blandly i am afraid mr harris must find it very dull murmured the girl the jeune premier was his exemplar still it reveals new attractions every day he declared he looked at her significantly her eyelids drooped the father saw nothing but the opera in his desk yes i think myself there are many attractions to be found in the place he said though as an old residentone of the very oldest residents in facti may be too partial perhaps i have been in beckenhampton nowhow many years i begin to lose count people will tell you that the name of sorrenford is as well known here as the name ofha hathe name of the theatre royal itself mr harris is interested in the theatre royal my dearthe scene of so many of our pleasant evenings oh indeed she was gently surprised youre at the theatre mr harris in the front he said i hope we shall give you some pleasanter evenings still under the new regime miss sorrenford we mean to make the house one of the most goahead theatres in the provinces his tone was bright inspiriting he struck her as likely to succeed in anything that he undertook we shall not fail to sample theerthe bill of fare said the professor ha ha the bill of fare we shall pay you an early visit i hope youll return it a composers time is not his own but we are always glad to see our friends on sunday nights if you have nothing better to do one sunday i shall be charmed mr harris is busy on week nights like yourself put in hilda with a smile to be surelike myself sunday is really the only day a professional man has a chance to be sociable isnt it we have a bond in common take us as we are mr harris drop in pot luck and a little music and a hearty welcome now dont forget let us be among the first in beckenhampton toto make you feel at home in it i shall be charmed repeated vivian gazing undisguised admiration at hilda she gave him her hand he crossed the road victoriously the father and daughter continued their way to the hatters for some seconds the old man was silent wrapt in ecstatic reverie then he broke out well eh not badwhat do you think did you notice how glad he was i invited him hes been asking about me since i saw him hes been turning the opera over in his mind thats the plain english of it very cordial but he cant take me in theres the pounds shillings and pence interest underneath my dear i saw through him he chuckled hes nibblingthe business manager is nibbling it wont be long before he comes youll see wed better have a perrins for supper next sunday my dear on the chance of his turning up vivian was much pleased to have somewhere to go and he made no longer delay in presenting himself than he considered that appearances required sunday had been dismal enough while he was with a company on tour here in his new post without even a game of napoleon on a railway journey to mitigate the tedium he had found it drearier still the opportunity for talking to a girl who wasnt a barmaid would have tempted him had the girl been plain when she was admitted to be the prettiest girl in beckenhamptonor as the landlord of the george had it the belle of our townhe felt that it was really a matter for rejoicing and his hosts greeting was as warm as his invitation certainly his performance on the cello after supper was rather a nuisance but the belle made a delightful picture as an accompanist and when she sang an entirely new ballad about dead days and a garden with a tune that a fellow could catch to take away the taste of the classics commanded by her papa the visitor felt quite a stir of sentiment and he was given another whiskyandsoda and another of the six cigars which the professor had arranged in a cigarbox that had lain empty for years even when father had been persuaded to let mr harris hear something from the opera and mr harris began to realise that the garrulous old gentleman wanted more from him than compliments the evening was not a disappointment the younger girl was so enchanting and the atmosphere of a home was such a novelty it was impossible for vivian to be sorry he had come though he perceived that it would be unwise to define the boundaries of his position in the theatre if he wished to come often do you play or sing yourself mr harris bee inquired no he said no im not musical in this musical family he regretted to acknowledge it sure asked hilda swinging round on the stool oh yes unfortunatelyquite sure he was at the point of adding though i was brought up in the thick of it all but to explain that his mothers second husband had been a negro was never agreeable to him im awfully fond of it though i could listen to singing all night wont you give us something else do please dont get up i really dont know what there is she ruffled the stack beside her listlessly im afraid theres nothing else for me to sing let me help you find something if you can if you really havent had enough he went across to her and they bent their heads over the heap together and he hung at the piano while she sang another entirely new ballad about days that were no more and a stream when she finished he murmured thank you and threw into his manner the suggestion of being too much moved to say anything more lengthy its rather pretty isnt it she said lifting her eyes in the candlelight yes and your voice he sighed expressively oh she looked down again affording him a good view of her lashes and stroked the keys my voice is really as small as a voice can be ive never heard one that carried me away as yours does do you knowi suppose youll be shockedbut i like the drawingroom balladsometimesnearly as well as the classical things i like them better she said archly do you he was delighted so do i i hadnt the courage to own that i darent let my father hear it would be high treason they both laughed the pretence of having a secret together was quite charming i see there is a concert announced for thursday fortnight at the town hall remarked the professor those are pleasures youre unable to enjoy mr harris eh i suppose you cant leave the theatre but there is a big bill we shall have some fine artists we shall have a treat quite a rare treat yes said vivian i know im afraid itll spoil our thursday nights house i wish they had fixed it for another evening thursday is our best night in the dresscircle as a rule how lovely it must be exclaimed hilda to go to the theatre every evening though i suppose you get tired of it too i should think it was nicer in the country than in london said bee isnt it you do see a different piece here every week yes he answered one gets a change but i never see a piece right through you know theres so much to do in front the business of a theatre observed the professor ponderously is naturally enormous the outsider has no conception of theerintricacies of theatrical management these young ladies look at the stage in the limelight they know nothing of the commercial element of the enterprise the sea of figures in which the manager wades is to them of course a terra incognita vivian stroked his moustache and hid a smile yes the figures are a bit of a bore he said i was acting manager to a company on tour before i joined jordan that was more bother still you know acting manager said hilda to manage the acting i should have thought was jolly oh i had nothing to do with the stage acting manager and business manager mean the same thing how curious yes it is rather odd no i had nothing to do with the stage but there were the journeys to arrange then and there are always people in a company who grumble at the train call whatever time its for if you take them early they complain because they have to get up so soon and if you take them late they say theyve never known a tour on which they had to make so many journeys at night and of course its always the poor acting managers fault why not take them in the afternoon wouldnt that get over the difficulty well you cant travel from bristol to yarmouth in an afternoon and that was one of the journeys we had to make the train call was for twelve oclock saturday night after the show and we didnt get into yarmouth till the next evening how cross some of them were so should i have been he tried to look as if he couldnt imagine her cross it wasnt very pleasant certainly at four in the morning we were at a standstill black dark and we had to stick in the station till halfpast seven there was no refreshment room open of course we all sat shivering in the train and it rained oh how it rained about six oclock one of the ladies asked two or three of us into her compartment and made tea with a little spiritlamp that she had brought i think i enjoyed that tea more than any ive ever drunk but we didnt get a solid meal till we reached peterboroughthree hours more to wait it had stopped raining by then and we had roast mutton at an hotel and yawned at the cathedral i hope you took the good samaritan who had given you the tea said the professor we did yes as a matter of fact the leading man proposed to her during the wait at peterborough it was the tea that had done ithe said he hadnt believed any woman could look so nice at am of course the other ladies declared she had curled her hair before she invited us into the compartment but that was jealousy he was a goodlooking chap and getting ten pounds a week they were engaged all the tour do you mean that they married then bee asked no they didnt marry but they were engaged all the tour they quarrelled at the grand islington her father had been a celebrated wit and she used to say awfully insulting things and think they were funny it was nearly midnight when he rose to go he was perhaps less impressionable than most young men of his age less addicted to wasting time in flirtations that promised nothing more satisfactory than a kiss and a keepsake but as he strode down the silent road to his apartments he was not quite fancyfree in the moonlight his reverie was not quite so practical as usual he resolved to send a box to the professor at the earliest date that it was desirable to put a little paper out and as he foresaw himself welcoming the party in the foyer he was gratified to reflect that he looked his best in an evening suit he was also gratified to reflect that the belle must go for walks and examine the windows in the high street and that her sister couldnt be always with her after he had gone the professor said well he was taken by what he heard of the opera i think hell mention it to jordan if im not very much mistaken rome wasnt built in a day but ive laid the foundation stone were getting on yes im sure he liked it answered bee i wish it had been mr jordan himself though dont you think mr harris is rather young to have much authority father tut tut replied the composer tetchily what nonsense hes shrewd hes a smart fellow what do you suppose he came forto smoke a cigar with me business men dont run after strangers for nothing you talk without considering theres always a motive for these friendly actions my dear women dont look beneath the surface i could never teach your poor mother god bless her to look beneath the surface i daresay hell drop in next sunday again it wouldnt surprise me at all he turned to hilda as he generally did when he wasnt in trouble and hilda noddedand smiled chapter xxi the following morning there came to miss h sorrenford a letter from david leean urgent letter because he had been so long impatient demanding an explanation of her silence the explanation was that each time she had reread the note of thanks he had written before leaving town her imposture had looked to her more shameful but after considering a great deal how to say as much in her answer she did not say it at all she told him instead something of her feelings in returning to the house that was called her home it was very sweet very strange to david to receive the first of her confessions breathing a familiar presence hilda had never seemed so close to him as she did in the hour when he pored over these pages of her sisters he heard hildas voice while he welcomed bees thoughts when he replied to bee he saw hildas face and it was the face not the thoughts that maddened him with longing it was the face that was dizzying him as he paltered with his conscience and offered prayers to the future though he did not discriminate though he associated the soul of the woman with the form of the girl the triumph was to the physical the form not the soul tempted him to renounce his fathers gospel even while he proclaimed the soul his justification the charm of the womans letters lay no longer in what she said but in his belief that the girl said it hildas fairness not bees mind held his love and in his confidences to bee there was a cadence that there had not been a difference which she strove to persuade herself was imaginary because to admit that it existed would be to realise that the photograph had wrought mischief there was nothing tangible no word to point to but beneath the intimate record of his doings and the references to his work underlying the intuition which enabled him to respond as always to more than she had spelt she felt something in her friends letters that was new somethingshe was conscious of it only in momentssomething that made them now a mans letters to a woman when september was nearing its end david received a few lines from ownie she wrote i have been meaning to congratulate you oh the success of the book of poems that people are talking about so you have made a hit well i am very glad i was always sure when you were a child you would do well at writingyou have all my poor fathers talent well i am very glad though i havent had a chance to read it and never seen anything of you i am delighted to hear you have done so well i hope you are well and dont forget i like to see you whenever you have time to spare she remained on paper his affectionate mother his conscience pricked him for his last visit had been paid in the spring when he sent a copy of the book which he knew would bore her to the verge of extinction he promised to call on her the next sunday he went in the afternoon the latest of the swiss lads to be described in the advertisements as man servant opened the door while struggling into his coat his english was as unintelligible as his predecessors and david had doubts whether she was at home while he waited in the hall dinner was over but the smell of it lingered she was unlikely to be out he thought the swiss sped back and delivering himself of strange syllables led the way to the drawingroom it was empty and the smell of dinner was less strong here after some minutes ownie came in her hair was yellow still but the yellow of a restorer not the yellow of her youth and under this piteous travesty of the past her aged face looked older the years had caricatured her defects and her business had stamped its mark upon her ownie was a bulky woman with a long upper lip and a fretful vulgar mouth in conversation she had the restless eye and mechanical smile of the boardinghouse keeper who during three meals every day makes an effort at cheerful smalltalkillustrating the advantages of the district in which her boardinghouse is situatedwhile she listens suspensive to the servant inquiring behind a chair whether the occupant will take any more of the girl who had once smiled victoriously in the mirror of a theatre vestibule nothing was left in her stead was all the pathos of a lifetime only to the bulky woman it was given still to discern a likeness to the girl nature had yielded that she did not see herself as she was to her the rouge on her cheeks was not so palpable the wrinkles were not so deep dyed painted dreary she sank into a chair and yawned widely with her hands in her lap i thought you were never coming again she said he pleaded stress of work and ive been in the country since i saw you well how are you mother oh nothing to brag about the heat has been killing hasnt it i should have liked a change too i havent been able to read your book yeti cant read for long it tries my eyes so i must get some new glasses well are you making a fortune out of it its selling splendidlyfor poetry yes i shall make a good deal by it strange to say if you want a change why not go to brighton for a week or two ihe was embarrassedi can give you the money oh it isnt that she explained with another gape i cant leave the house whos going to look after it while im gone its an awful drag if you havent got a housekeeper and if you have you cant go away and leave everything to her fancy you with money to spare though well youve got to thank me for that davidyour cleverness comes from my side you didnt have your fathers voice you know if you hadnt written i dont know what youd have done he did not know either his life would have been insupportable if he hadnt written he looked beyond her vaguely and nodded is the house full he asked pretty full theyre most of them new nowamericans and people up for a few weeks the others ll be coming back at the end of the month theres another boardinghouse opened round the corner they keep the gas full up in every room all the evening as an advertisement yes its stupid not enough people pass here in the evening to make it pay it isnt as if it were at the seaside would you like a cup o tea or anything no thanks he said you may as well i want a cup o tea myself itll wake me upi was just going to have forty winks when the man told me you were here im sorry he rang the bell i wish id come at another time oh it doesnt matter she returned theres always something i suppose you havent heard from vivian i never hear from him i think its nearly a year since i saw him what is he doing hes got a firstrate berth he left the company at the end of the last tour you knew he was on tour with a theatrical company didnt you hes settled in one place nowmuch nicer for him than travelling all the time a great improvement in every way she roused herself to boast feebly about vivian not many young men of his age get into such a thing its a very responsible position to be business manager of a theatre and theres the salary all the year roundevery week hes sure of so much thats an advantage you cant hope for eh you may be comfortably off one year and have nothing the next writing is so precariousyou never know where you are i jog along said david amiably oh yes she allowed im sure its wonderful your keeping yourself as you have and its nice to have your book talked about but of course theres no certainty about your professionyou cant depend on that sort of thing she tittered fame is all very well but im afraid vivian would say give me a regular income hell be up on sunday if youd like to see him yes ill come in he answered what town has he gone to beckenhampton she said the theatre royal beckenhampton he looked at her wideeyed do you know it nno he said no i dont know it exactly how long has he been there oh two or three months hes having great times i believehes so popular wherever he goes he gets asked out to supper parties and all that she hesitated toying with the keeper on her finger as he remembered her toying in his childhood with rings that flashed but now the ring no longer turned i rather fancy theres an attraction she went on more slowly i hope to goodness it isnt serious dont let out that i said anything when you meet him i didnt mean to mention it an attraction she lifted her fat shoulders impatiently there may be nothing in it but young men are so soft any girl can catch the smartest of them it wouldnt astonish me a bit when he comes up to hear that hes engaged i had a gushing letter from him a few weeks ago telling me hed met the prettiest girl hed ever seen i know what that means he wouldnt have written about her if he hadnt lost his head and he doesnt answer my questions it looks as if hes making an idiot of himself who is she asked david in a low voice he didnt say whats the difference who she is you may be sure she hasnt got a sixpence to bless herself with a nice mess hell make of his life if he doesnt take care its a lucky thing for you that you havent got that sort of risk to run a young man married is a man thats marred as ouida says shakespeare he said in the same dull tone not ouida was it its at the beginning of one of ouidas books i know if your brother gets married at his age he might as well hang himself at once the tremor was in his pulses still but beckenhampton was not a villagethe coincidence was so unlikely he kept repeating that it couldnt be if his salary is such a good one and hes fond of her he demurred such a good one wellshe was a shade confusedits good enough for him as he is it wouldnt go far with a wife and family to keep besides a mans always better off single than married only hes so soft as soon as a pretty face comes along some artful minx who wants a home makes up to him and all of a sudden he imagines he cant go through life without her good lord if a man could see into a girls head while shes gushing about the view and pretending shes an angel men are taken in by every girl they meet the fools her scorn of the fools was in no wise restrained by the fact that she had captured two husbands herself she was thinking of her son when a woman lives to see the arts by which she gained her husband practised to ensnare her son candour can reveal no more nor in the badly constructed tragedy of life is there any other situation that comes so close to poetical justice david found the afternoon the most irksome that he had spent at regents park though he told himself that his misgiving was fantastic it continued to disturb him and while he sipped weak tea and made perfunctory responses he was trying to define hildas feeling for him questioning whether it was in womans nature for hilda to write to him as he believed she wrote and yet to be susceptible to the courtship of another man vivian was handsome debonair so popular wherever he went yes vivian had always been popular he remembered bitterly might not the passion of a lover at her side prove a stronger force than the worship of a correspondent which had never been confessed could she not saymight she not be happy to saythat by never a word had her letters to himself been more than the letters of a friend then vivian would take her from him vivian who it seemed to him in a burst of fear and jealousy had always taken everything would rob him of her too but again the coincidence was so improbable besides his mother might be wrong she might be exaggerating the idlest fancy perhaps vivian had no desire to marry anyone he was relieved when the clock gave him an excuse to rise well goodbye mother he avoided her complexion and dropped a kiss on her dyed fringe must you go she said erdavid if youre really sure you can spare a few pounds id be very glad of the money to get a new dress with i havent got a decent thing to put on for dinner this blouse is so shabby im ashamed to sit at the table in it he promised to send what she wanted and took up his hat when his hand was on the doorknob she asked him if he would stay to supper but he declined the invitation as he made his way home he repeated more than once that his tremor was ridiculous and assured himself that he was much amused at his folly he smiled stiffly to prove his amusement still he wished that the week were past and vivian had come to town he would feel easier when he had seen vivian chapter xxii ownies conjectures were not misleading her the business managers views of life had been deranged to dress well and have a good time now appeared to him less dazzling a prospect than to clothe hilda and have a home confronted by temptation he had been no stronger than the multitude he was prepared to travel the course handicapped and like every other young man at the inevitable crisis persuaded himself that a pair of arms round his neck would accelerate the pace hilda too was in love moreover she was in love with the idea of being married she had passed the stage at which the beauty of every family looks forward to wedding a millionaire and although she had gathered something of vivians position by now she meant to accept him when he asked her one of the greatest sacrifices for love that a girl in the provinces can make is to marry and remove to local lodgings there were perfervid moments when hilda felt equal even to this but in moods less headlong it was her intention to remain engaged to him until he secured a similar appointment in another town meanwhile vivian wondered whether she would be startled if he confessed his feelings thus early fearful that he might lose it all he resolved to be discreet so he confided to her facts of which she was unaware and withheld the one that she knew it was a vast relief to him to settle the matter of the opera between them of late the opera had seemed to darken his future and when he had intimated nervously that her father overestimated his influence with mr jordan he thanked heaven to see that she did not find the news an overwhelming shock one afternoonit was on the friday after ownie unbosomed herself to davidhilda exclaimed what do you think bee the man who wrote a celibates love songs is mr harriss halfbrother he has just gone the colour left bees face her heart thudded who she faltered david lee no mr harris he dropped in just now to return a book isnt it strange his mother married twice she married elisha lee the black tenori dont know how she could have done it the poet is their sona mulatto fancy the woman stood stonestill she moved by a blind instinct to a chair it seemed to her a long time before she could reach chair a mulatto she said faintly yesalmost a nigger mr harris says hes ashamedi could tell though he tried to sound casual of course it isnt nice for him to have a halfbrother like that is it and then his mother doing such a thing i was awfully sorry for him poor fellowhe did look so uncomfortable while he was talking of course he hung on to his brothers cleverness and all that butwell he cant be very proud can he bee made no answer she did not hear a mulattoalmost a nigger for an instant her mind was dwarfed by it she could not think beyond it could see no further than the monstrous personality that seemed to close upon her almost a nigger the instant was heavy affrighting with his presence in the next her thoughts flashed to the mulatto who had gone to godstoneand she knew that he was the man he must look rather like that mr tremlett i suppose hilda was saying she nodded yes fancy a nigger writing poetry you dont seem very interested i thought youd gasp when i told youyou liked his book so much did you oh i am interested yes fancy his writing poetry she felt sick stupefied she could not talk david lee was a mulatto was the poor young man with the swarthy skin and the negro features whom she had pitied condescendingly whom she had passed and repassed and addressed with no emotion she sat struggling with the thing she did not doubt it she never questioned it for a moment it was so obvious now that she even wondered that she had not suspected it then but anomalously david seemed for the first time strange to her remote the association dazed her and before the physical impression all the sense of familiarity receded tremlett was david lee he had been to seek her as the cloud of her confusion lifted she saw the reason of his long delay saw why at last he had assumed a name light was shed upon his work its sorrow was illumined she understood the secret of its intimate appeal like herself he suffered and was despised he had been to seek her afraid to tell her who he was her no not herhilda she stared across the room at her sister blankly hilda had renounced the effort at conversation and was in a lovereverie over a novelette it was hilda he had been to seek attracted by her photograph he had gone at last not to find the writer of the letters but the girl whose likeness he had seen only when the likeness reached him had he cared to go and he had followed hilda about the garden looked at her with his heart in his eyeshe was fond of her yes it was to hilda that his letters were really written nowand hilda would probably marry his halfbrother her misery and shame were profound she did not define the vague pained stir of another feeling in her breast she was engulfed by the knowledge that she had brought a new grief into his life had given him still more to bear she hated herself and she felt that when he learned the truth he too would hate herthat he must that he would curse the misshapen fool who had cheated him into loving the girl who would be his brothers wife when hours had passed she untied the letters that had come to her since her return from surrey and read them in her bedroom slowly by the light of recognition the sore stir of the subtle feeling within her was stronger as she read them realising that they were meant for hilda but compassion for him swept her like a flood the spirit of the man spoke to her again she found herself again sensitive to his spiritless dominated by his face they were meant for hilda always her mind reverted to this it became her ascendant thought she locked the letters in their drawer and tried to consider the one that she must write and now she shuddered before confession not so much in dread of the throes that she would suffer as of the blow that she would deal his confidences were meant for hilda and he must be told that hilda had never heard from him had never responded by a line she perceived dismayed that the words explaining it would sound to him the words of a strangerof a little woman with a crooked back claiming her sisters qualities yes the very qualities that had first pleased him he attributed to hilda now and in herself when he understood they would fall to nothingness her sympathies were abstractions shadows the realities were hildas lips and eyes and lithe straight form while she sat there hilda came to the room with a message bee did not look at her as she answered she tried to think it was because she had been crying but there was another reason which she would not see which she shunned because the inborn prejudices of a white woman feared to own itin her heart there was a jealousy of hilda sunday came before she had written to david he went to regents park uneasily vivian and his mother were in the little room halfparlour halfoffice in which she made out the bills and received applicants for board residence it was clear that he had interrupted an altercation vivians smile of greeting was an obvious effort and ownie was frankly discomposed for two or three minutes while the young men exchanged remarks she kept silent breathing quickly her nostrils dilated her mouth compressed then she broke out why dont you tell david your news your brothers going to be married david dont you congratulate him on his luck is that so said david turning to him so the mater says muttered vivian i didnt know it myselfim not engaged yet she sniggered oh it doesnt take long to get engaged you can soon do that if you want to well i do want to and i mean to marry her if shell have me he exclaimed and now youve got it so we neednt say any more how pretty she said between a sneer and a sob she has a beautiful influence over you i must sayto make you rude to your mother oh of course he returned its all her fault that you take it badly isnt it its all her fault that you quarrel with me when i confide in you thats rich it strikes me ive behaved about as well as a fellow could in telling you how things stand i neednt have said anything till it was settled i think you might pretend to be glad even if you arent glad yes glad whats to prevent your being glad one would imagine i was doing you some infernal injury by the way you talk im talking for your own good youre too young to get married before youve been oh i know all about that he cried i should always be too young according to you i tell you what it is youre not thinking of my good at allyoure thinking of yourself you dont like the idea of my marrying youve got it in your head that youll lose me if i marryyou said so at the beginningand so you call me names and run her downa girl youve never seenand try to persuade yourself its holy affection for me but it isnt it isnt anything of the kind its just selfishness and as youve used such very plain english ill use some too and tell you so its sheer selfishness to want me to spoil my life to please you what have you ever done for me that you should expect me to sacrifice myself for you i think its disgusting his handsome face was flushed his manner insolent the girl to whom his attachment presented him at his best would scarcely have recognised her lover here at his worst he stirred in ownie memories of his father memories of scenes in the liverpool villa when the fur business had become involved she did not speak her lips twitched although her objections appeared to david unreasonable he felt sorry for her whatever her faults towards others she had always been fond of vivianit jarred that vivian reproached her for selfishness after a little pause she said wistfully if thats the way you feel im afraid i cant expect to see much of you in future whether you marry or not you dont see much of me now i dont live here but you belong to me still she pleaded he looked towards david with an air of triumph you see what i say is quite true it isnt for my sake that shes against my marrying but for her ownim to sacrifice myself because shes jealous david lit a cigarette without replying all this time his pulses were impatient for the sound of the girls name ownies humility deserted her her temper flamed though there were still tears in her voice sacrifice she retorted its a fine sacrifice to keep your comfort the sacrificell come in if you throw yourself away for the first pretty face you meet i thought you had more senseyou talk like a sentimental boy sacrifice yourself in a years time youd have forgotten you ever wanted her and shed be engaged to somebody else any young man can get spoony on any girl if he sees enough of her why dont you pick up a girl of a different sort you must have plenty of opportunities if you want to play the fool choose a girl who doesnt aim at getting married vivian rose with fury in his veins he made a desperate effort to disguise it to answer her with dignity i must decline to discuss the matter if you can compare the love of my life withwith that kind of thing theres no more to be said oh she exclaimed exasperated what an idiot you are marry her then and drag uphill with a wife and a family on your back and see how you like it make haste before the bargain has gone i daresay shell jump at any man who asks her ah it isnt every woman wholl jump at any man who asks her he said savagely youre not a fair judge on that point you know the blood swept up to her forehead and then she blanched and the rouge stains looked grotesque she trembled as if the blow had been struck with his fists her dyed head went down in her hands and she began to sobunrestrainedly hysterically in an abandonment of wretchedness he watched her discomfited his anger dwindled in view of her defeat and already he repented his taunt he decided ashamed to pretend that he did not understand what she was crying about david went over to her murmuring encouragement let me alone she quavered go away both of you i dont want anyone i dont know what has upset you vivian stammered i didnt mean anything particular you did she gasped you insulted meyou tried to you said i was too low to judge heryour mother was too low to judge her ill never talk about your marriage again as long as i live i dont want to hear about it she dabbed her eyes and cheeks impetuously and moved to the door i hope youll be happy thats all im going ive nothing more to say the door closed and there was a moments pause her sons looked at each other damned nonsense said vivian scowling i didnt mean any harm i wish i hadnt come she has gone up to her bedroom said david constrainedly youd better run up after her what forto have another scene no thank you ive had enough well i suppose we may as well go i think ill just say a word to her first will you wait for me i wont be long you will wait wont you i want to talk to you vivian nodded all right but dont tell her that i want to come up because i dont its beastly this sort of thing good lord one would think i was dependent on her one would think she was making me an allowance give me a cigarette david found a servant to point madams room out to him and tapped timidly ownie had thrown herself on the bed and at his entrance she turned in the hope that it was his brothers oh its you she said has he gone no hes downstairs heim sure hes sorry he hurt you mother hes hard she faltered hard as nails he doesnt care he doesnt care for me a bit you heard how he talked to me what have i ever done for him he asked what have i ever done for him you know you know very well how good ive always been to vivian when he was a child i never refused him anythingi studied him in every wayhe was always first to me and this is how he treats me he talks to me as if i were a stranger it wouldnt trouble him for a minute if he never saw me again oh you shouldnt say that he murmured it isnt true hes got a rough tongue but his heart is good he doesnt show what he feels hes just as unhappy now as you are but heit isnt easy for him to find the right words you understand that really only youre too sore to remember it yet he only thinks of that girl she sobbed jealous he called me if i am jealous what of it hes all ive got and shes taking him away from me im not young any more i havent the interests that i used to have i dont want to be left alone he doesnt care a snap of his fingers for me now he never cared much but i wouldnt see it and now he cares nothing nobody cares for me theres not a soul to mind whether i live or die oh it was nice of you to come upits more than he didbut youre not fond of me david you never were im not blaming youim not unjustits my own fault that but it isnt my fault with him god knows it isnt if i deserve anything i deserve to be loved by vivie i dont ask for much i dont expect miracles but i did expect to be treated well by vivie when i was old when i was lonely and i had nobody else to turn to the tears had streaked the rouge on her quivering face her yellow hair disordered by the pillow showed the lines of age that it was trained to hide timeworn and desolate she lay huddled on the bed making her moan while he sought pityingly to comfort her and it pained him that he could not speak of his own affection for herthat she could not believe him if he did when she was more tranquil he left her she had not asked for her elder son to be sent to her nor did he inquire whether he was wanted youve been long enough he said well is she better yes david answered coldly she is better have you anything to do what time do you go back vivian explained that he was not returning to beckenhampton till the morrow ive business here thats why i came up no ive nothing to do till eight oclockthen ive got to see a man at the eccentric they descended the steps and after a furtive glance at his halfbrother he added deprecatingly it has been going on for an hour pretty nearlyyou only heard the fagend of it i can tell you that what ive had to listen to would have tried the patience of a saint it embarrassed him to walk in the streets with david and he signed to a passing hansom where shall i tell him to drive ill come to your place with you if you like his contrition by no means abated his sense of being illused nor did his indifference to his companion extend to his companions disapproval that david should be presuming to censure him was a situation not the less annoying because it seemed to him anomalous and they were no sooner in the cab than he began vehemently to expatiate upon his grievance david waited with rising eagerness for an opportunity to frame the question that again engrossed him if i had guessed how shed take the news thered have been none of this confounded row at allid have left her in the dark its an encouraging thing upon my soul it is to be bullied when you make a confidant of your mother whats it to do with her anyhow it wont cost her anything how does it affect her if i marry its not as if i had to keep hershes in no need of my assistance ive never given her a pound in my life he seemed to regard this as conclusive and repeated it on my honour ive never given her a pound in my life shed be every bit as well off if i were married as she is now im single there isnt a grain of logic in her objection it isnt even as if i were living at home hang it i scarcely ever see her its a regular doginthemanger attitude she adoptsshe hasnt got me herself and she grudges me to anybody else that isnt the way she looks at it said david while youre single she feels she has still got you who is the girl shes beautifulshes absolutely the most beautiful girl i ever met sheshes the top stair of the highest flight of an artists imagination you should see the people turn round after her wherever she goes and shes as clever as shes goodlooking i never believed i should meet a woman whod understand me as she does jump at the first man who asks her ha ha you can take your oath shes had proposals enough young as she is i didnt come up with the intention of talking about it at all it was the mater pumped me i thought she was entering into it at the startshe was smiling she seemed interested i gave myself away before i dreamt she was going to make a fuss then it began a bit of a sneer a little ridicule pretending it was all too silly to talk seriously aboutafter shed led me on after shed made me think she was sympathising then when she saw that didnt work she got nasty she began to show her clawsi was a fool in every other sentence a man is the best judge of his own life i know what i want without anybody telling me id have proposed long ago if i were sure it would be all right i havent much to offer unfortunately throwing myself away im no catch for a girl like that and then of course i dont know i think she does but i cant swear she cares for me perhaps when it came to the pointshe may only like me as a friend whats her name said david how did you meet her i met her father first and then he asked me up to the house id seen her already then or i daresay i shouldnt have gone i might have missed everything if she hadnt been with him that afternoon funny eh did it ever strike you how a fellows life is often altered by things that dont seem anything at the time i mean how the biggest things turn up from things that youd think dont matter theres a new idea for your poetryyou go in for original fancies like that dont you i read somewhere that your books full of em her father is very amiable to me buthes not very wide awakei dont think he sees how the land lies he maynt be keen on giving his daughter to me when i spring it on him even if she accepts me i wish she hadnt got a father if she were on her own in the profession the running would be easier for me they marry in the profession on nothingsome of themlive in lodgings and carry the babies down to the station on sunday mornings its different with a girl like her and the town is full of johnnies who are in their governors businesses and could offer her a decent homea villa on the hunby road and a couple of servants it makes one a bit shaky about ones chances you know the cab stopped before david could obtain the answer that he sought and he opened the door with his latchkey and led the way upstairs his restlessness under the flood of discourse loosed upon him had heightened his misgiving there had been nothing to justify his fear except enthusiasmno word to suggest that it was hilda who was referred to he kept telling himself so but fluttering in his senses there was a nervous inexplicable conviction that it was hilda reason could not still it he even dreaded to repeat his question feeling that with insistence the bolt would fall he took the whisky and a syphon out of the miniature sideboard and called on the landing for tumblers vivian dropped into the armchair on the hearth yes it doesnt make a fellow sanguine to remember how much better she might do he went on i dont mean that shes mercenarynothing of the sortbut i daresay her family will be against it not that theyre particularly well off themselves as far as that goesrather the reverse still they have got a house its not being able to take a house that makes a fellow look so hard up it doesnt show while hes singlei might have a thousand a year now for all anybody can tellbut if i stop in diggings after im married itll be a different pair of shoes theres no doubt that when a fellow marries he advertises his position for all the world to see im sick of diggings so am i said david the drudge had burst in with the glasses vivian got up and lounged about the room is that where you write he asked he wandered to the smaller table in a corner on which some manuscript lay and swung round with an ejaculation good heavens how did you get this he held up hildas photograph the answer to davids question had come it reverberated as if he had been unprepared almost he felt that he had been unprepared he stared at his brother mutely this is her likeness isnt this hilda sorrenford how did you get it she sent it to me replied david dragging out his voice sent it to you sent it to you why she doesnt know you oh yes she knows me that is she writes to me writes to you yes what about i must explain to you its difficult to say we have written to each other for a long time she wrote first about my workshe liked itand then somehow we began to correspond regularly she doesnt know that were related i havent spoken of youi didnt know she had ever seen you i dont understand ive spoken of you she didnt say she knew you why did she make a secret of it i cant think why have you ever met her yes its the most extraordinarywhere she was in the country this summer with her sister bee yes bee i went down there that was after she sent me the likeness i wanted to see her i had rooms in the same house for a few days upon my soul and she let me thinkwhy she seemed astonished to hear you were ashe knew nothing about you except your name there was silence for an instant do you mean she was astonished to hear i was a mulatto asked david you told her yes how long ago the other day when last week this week this week david turned aside it was a week since he had received bees last letter what did she say he faltered she was astonished horrified nno she wasnt so interested as all that but i dont understand he exclaimed again you said just now that you had met her she doesnt know ive met hershe doesnt know it was i i took another name i called myself tremlett you called yourself tremlett why what the devil is all this aboutwhat did you take another name for i didnt want her to discover ii wasnt a white man not then not so soon i was afraid afraid afraid she might stop writing to me if she knew so help me god it sounds as if youre telling me you are in love with her yes said david quietly that is what i have to tell you i am in love with her they stood looking into each others eyes for several seconds neither of them moving is this a joke asked vivian harshly oh no its true its perfectly true im sorry very sorry to hear youre fond of her but i loved her before i heard ityou mustnt forget that it oughtnt to make bad blood between us whatever happens ive told you as soon as i could ive been quite open with you iim hanged if im quite sure now what youre driving at said vivian after another pause youre sorrywhatever happens what is it youre doingwarning me do you meanyou dont mean to say you think shell marry you i hope and pray she will if she cares more for you of course she wont what he forced a laugh are you out of your mind why the things preposterous its an insult to her to imagine it look here i dont want a row with you you must see very well that its no good we dont make ourselves its not your fault that youre not the same as other fellows its your misfortunebut you cant expect a decent girl to marry a coloured man its against nature our mother did said david ive had quite enough about that besides we all know she was wretched and ive told you hilda belongs to me dont come interfering it has gone too far already with the correspondence and the likeness i cant make it out she doesnt belong to you if she belonged to you id say nothing she belongs to neither of usshe can choose the one she likes best well let her choose if my love is preposterous if its an insult to her why are you frightened for me to go and plead frightened vivian blazed do you think im jealous of you you know better youre frightened yourselfyou said so when you went to her it was like a coward by your own showing youve hung about her under a false name i suppose that was open was it youve been trying to get round her by your poetry havent you trying to sneak her fancy before she knew what you were like go and pleadand be damned to youand hear what shell say now she knows what you are he waited for an answer affected another laugh and then turned to the table and picked up his hat david drew close to him shaking you make the quarrel he panted do you you complain by what right she was dear to me before you had ever seen her before you had ever heard of her before youd set foot in the town she lives in you complain its for me to resent not you all our lives since we were children youve had everything i was denied because you were goodlooking and i was hideous when we were boys your good looks made things harder for me as men all the pleasure of life has been for you while ive had nothing but contempt and at last when a girl has come to care for meto care for what i am my work my thoughts my feelings the things that are myselfyou must blunder in the way and want to take her from me too you taunt me with my colour it ought to remind you of what ive had to bear it ought to shame you for asking me to give up to you the only chance of happiness ive ever had if ive been a coward i was what the intolerance of minds like yours has made me show your own couragetake your appeals to the girl you love dont beg me to stand aside for you you taunt me with my colour wait till she does talk to her as best you canand so will i for once im not afraid of your good looksshe has seen deeper than my skin tell her that you love her and find which has more power to move her heartyour face or the words in me and while he boasted he believed in the power of words not knowing that he had preferred a face himself when he was alone he cried looking uglier still and late in the evening he wrote his first loveletter it was a very long letter he wrote of the joy that the correspondence had brought him of the years of loneliness and suffering that had made him afraid to own the truth he wrote of the day the portrait came his temptation his weaknessof his longing to confess himself at godstone and of the fear that had still held him back he poured out the story of his life the story of his childhood of his youth and of his love he prayed to her for pity for tenderness for heaven he said that on the morrow he would go to her to hear her answer and because the need for pretending ignorance of the name was past now he addressed the letter to miss hilda sorrenford in full chapter xxiii it reached her early the next afternoon she was sitting before the diningroom fire with a shilling manicure set in her lap polishing her fingernails there was no one else in the room bee had gone back to the studio and the professor was at great hunby the handwriting was unfamiliar and she opened the envelope with as much interest as was natural in a girl whose letters were few astonishment laid hold of her at the first lines she glanced instinctively at the address again and then found the last page and looked at the signature her lovely eyes dilated her brows climbed high truth to tell she had a rather stupid air as she sat deciphering davids declaration with her mouth ajar and the file and the rubber and the little powderbox lying in her lap only two points were intelligible to her the mr tremlett she had met was david lee and he adored her it can never be unpleasant to be adored she by no means shared the opinion that his adoration was an insult though she did not regard it seriously but she was too bewildered even to simper her photograph their correspondence at every reference to these things she felt more dazed by what extraordinary mistake could a man from whom she had never heard till now imagine that he had been corresponding with her after she had stared at the fire and smiled at herself in the glass she mounted to the studio her eyes still wide a glimmer of amusement in them just look at this read it through she exclaimed holding the letter out bee was writing and rose confused what is it a proposal she giggled i mean it from david lee its a mystery bee started her gaze wandered from the letter in hildas hand to the letter on the table she did not speak read it repeated hilda id rather not she answered painfully its written to you what rubbish well listen then youd better sit down again my dearhe worships me at great length she dropped into a chair herself and began to declaim the pages with zest in moments she looked up with a comment or grimace the woman sat passive never meeting her glance she listened to davids avowal of devotion to her sister dumblyline after line to the endher hands hanging at her sides her chin sunk only her meagre bosom showed that she was listening for the first time it heaved to love words that were not ordered for the ears of allfor the first time in her life she heard a mans passion crying out to flesh and blood when she raised her head at last she was white to the lips whats the matter contrition love and pity surged in her in the distorted body all the forces of womanhood beat at his appeal she yearned over the story of his childish years like a mother she trembled to his passion like a wife the thin hands strained across the lifting bosom she found her voice theres something i must tell you ii ought to have told you before its i who have been writing to him she said you its you who have been what do you mean why does he write to me then he doesnt know i always signed myself h of course and one day he asked for my photograph i she hesitated she drooped before the girl abjectly you sent him mine cried hilda bee nodded her eyes to the ground the pause was broken by hildas giggle whatever did you do that for she said the deformed woman spoke by a gesture then he came to godstone and fell in love with you she went on huskily i didnt know it was he when we were there i only guessed when i heard he waswhen i heard what his brother had told you about him i was writing to him when you came in to say that i had deceived him its too late the harm is done but i was writing it was an awful shame exclaimed hilda with sudden heat supposing he has talked to viviani mean mr harrisabout it i expect he hashe seems to know his brothers here why what a liar i shall look it was a beastly thing to do bee what will his brother think of me youre fond of mr harris arent you inquired bee humbly perhaps anyhow i dont want him to imagine im such a hateful liar as to pretend i dont know a fellow ive been corresponding with for months that can soon be put right i wish id done no worse harm than that what else have you done for goodness sake bees lips tightened she pointed to davids letter which had fallen to the floor have you forgotten he loves you she asked oh hilda was relieved well youll have to own up to everybody thats all she said i hope youll like it but carrying on a correspondence with a man youve never seenyou thats what gets over me what on earth did you find to say to him i wrote about his work and why should you have minded his knowing about your accidentwhat difference did that make reallyher vexation melted into amusementit may have been all about poetry and the fine arts but it was going rather far wasnt it if i had done such a thinga secret correspondence with a strange man id never have believed it of you im appalled i shouldnt like to call you fast butand he turns out to be a nigger her laughter pealed oh its funny it is it is its screaming he loves you said the woman again flushing to the temples try to remember it the ridicule in the girls stare shamed her through and through she picked the scattered pages up and folded them hilda took them negligently and stood struggling to control her mouth smiles still played hideandseek with the dimple in her cheek which likeness has he got of me she said after a minute it was the one i took at godstone you might as well have sent the one you took of me in the tucked chiffon while you were about it that thing at godstone didnt show the best side of my face he loves you cried bee passionately are you made of wood youre the world to him he thinks you understand him hes coming to you today praying for your answer have you got no feeling in you cant you pity him good lord said hilda dont go on at me like that of course i pity him im very sorry for him indeed im sure i think i shall write him a very nice note after he has got over the shock she added complacently hoping hell soon forget me and find comfort in his work i might do that mightnt i something very kind and when he comes today what when he comes you dont expect me to explain matters to him do you no i must do that i know it serves me right for not having told him before but hell ask to see you afterwardsto say goodbye to you youll go down and speak to him i shant do anything of the sort it isnt likely to say goodbye to me why the mans a stranger to me it would be most horribly embarrassingi should feel a perfect idiot you can tell him i had to go outor that im not well besides i shouldnt think he would ask to see me when he hears he has been taken in why should he why should he because he loves you because hes hungry for you mad for you because youre pretty and soft and made for men to admire and hell want to look at your face and touch your hand and hold it for a second longer than he ought to and if you let him would it kill you would it be so much to give him can you read that lettercan you hear his lifeand smirk and talk of your embarrassment to him itll be worse than embarrassment itll be despair youre very rude said hilda paling i think youre in love with him yourself upon my word i do do you it would be very strange wouldnt it im not pretty like you and ive got a crooked spineso im not a woman you can hardly believe that i could be in love can you i really dont know what to believe stammered hilda when you talk like that i should have thought youd have respected yourself more than to fall in love with a niwith a mulatto at any rate i respect myself because i do love himi love him better than its in you to love anybody you fool you doll youll write him something very kind and think youre condescending if that letter had been written to me id have thanked god for it on my kneesgod knows its true yes i love himwith all my body and all my soul and if he had wanted me instead of you and i had looked no further than my own joy id have given myself to him body and soul and been proud ah ssh the girl faltered you dont know what youre saying and been proud she sobbed yes i do know i mean it without fearit would have been my honour body and soulhis and mineone mind one life one flesh id have gloried thats love thats human she shrank against the wall and bowed her head there under the failures of her art go away from me dont stare at me im a cripple no one ever cared for mei wish i were dead in the hush of the next instant a bell rang their gaze met startled neither spoke both listened intently the servant came up the stairs with slow heavy feet she said mr lee to see miss hilda where is he murmured the girl in the drawingroom miss the attic was still again after the servant went her footsteps struck the oilcloth of the top stairs harshly and fell duller on the carpet and subsided in the hall in the silence the sisters sat looking away from each other as strangers look one of us must go down to him said hilda at last in a nervous gasp ill go down as soon as i can bee answered chapter xxiv he waited restlessly the suspense that had shivered in him on the journeythat sickened him as the fly rattled through the townhad culminated with the sight of the house in which she lived he was in her home there was nothing gracious in the shabby formal room where the music and the elocution lessons were given no flowers lent a touch of nature to the early victorian vases on the mantelpiece no piece of fancywork had been forgotten to humanise the asperity of the clumsy furniture with the hint of a womans presence but he was in her home and everything in the room spoke to him things quite trivial quite trite woke emotion in him because they were familiar to her they took unto their inanimate ugliness some of the fascination of her life he stood on the faded hearthrug watching the door after the servants feet had clattered to the basement all was quiet except the clock which ticked behind him sadly he became acutely conscious of its tick in the long waiting it stole into his nerves and heightened his misgiving at last he caught a sound outside the door the handle stirred for an instant it was as if hilda were before him he knew that upheaval of the chest with which a man sees the woman of whom he is despairing turn the corner he moved a step towards the door breathlesslyand then blankness fell and bee came slowly in how do you do mr lee she murmured how do you do miss sorrenford she did not offer him her handshe felt that it would be unfair to make him take her hand before he knew what she had to say she did not ask him to sitshe did not think of it in the pause the significant tick of the clock vibrated in him you expected to see my sister she began monotonously reciting the sentence she had prepared i have come instead because i have something to tell you she wont see me asked david in a whisper she made an effort to swallow when she got your letter i was writing to you ii have behaved very badly i had no ideai did not think of the consequences hilda has neverthe letters youve received havent come from hilda all the letters have come from me he did not start only his eyes showed that he had heard he stood gazing at herand she knew that she had killed something in him the dark lips moved watching them she understood that he said from you yes she muttered it was i who wrote about your poems ive written all the letters hilda hasnt written hilda has never heard from you before she didnt send you her likenessi sent it you wanted mine im deformedi didnt like to tell youi sent hildas i didnt think it would matteri didnt think long enoughit was an impulse i shall never forgive myself as long as i live nothing can tell you how ashamed i am youre a stranger to hilda she doesntits impossibleyoure a stranger to her she was trembling violently she put out a hand to a chair and sat down david still stood motionless his gaze fixed a stranger to her he echoed she only met you at godstone there was nothing at godstone toto make you hope she might care for you was there was there no he said dully no there was nothing at godstone to make me hope she might care for me it was at godstone i began to love her thats all your name is bee my name is hebe she answered bitterly i am called bee forfor short i understand hilda has never written to meshe has never heard from me before i understand of course youve explained it andand i do understand i think but all the same i have believed sheoh god he broke out it was a cruel thing to do why what for wasnt i wretched enough to do this to mefor nothing to spare your petty pride she twisted her hands in agony all my life i shall be sorry sorry thank you all mine i shall be sorry too if you had wished to torture meif you had tried i love her shes more to me than all the world than the only soul i think of in the next i love her do you know what it means to say id die for her says nothingmy life is empty but the one joy i have had has been my work and i would give all the work ive done and all the power to do any moreid give it gladly just to kiss her once if she knewif i could tell her what i feel for her there mightmightnt there be hope for me yet no she said the tears were running down her face shes fond of someone else of vivian oh she is fond of him is she dont cry i didnt mean to make you cry it cant be helped now forgive me she sobbed dont hate me say that you forgive me may god make her happy with him murmured the man deaf and blind forgive me forgive me she moaned it was cruel what you said was true ive tortured youto spare my pride to spare my vanity but forgive me say you forgive me what ive done i forgive you he said after all you were no more cowardly than i was you might have told me so you didnt it was some minutes before either of them spoke another word if she had loved me cried david suddenly he fell on to the couch and hid his face in his hands if she had loved me if she had loved you said bees pitying voice it would have been worse for you to bear you would have had a harder trial she couldnt have married you it would have been wrong he raised his head because im what i am he asked no she saidand her wet eyes did not fall before himbecause of what your child would be had you ever thought of that yes for my own childhood seems the other day i knowive heard your letter dont grudge me having heard it your child would suffer too not so deeply perhaps but the world wouldnt be kind to him if your child were a girl god knows the world wouldnt be kind to her it is a very barren world for some of us but we oughtnt to steal our joy ought we we oughtnt to make others pay for it you know that hilda would know it she couldnt have been your wife if she had loved me he said brokenly she wouldnt have argued so the woman who loved you with all her heart and soul would have argued so affirmed the woman and you would have suffered more in knowing that she loved you when you had to lose her the knowledge that she loved you would have brought no light into your life it would have made your loneliness lonelier how can you say because you are a man and a woman would it be different with a woman yes she answered out of her longing a womans loneliness would be less for knowing she was loved what is my sin he cried out why should the freedom of other men be always denied to me i have the same feelings the same heeds the same god put them in me you are so righteous you teach me my duty have you no duty towards me the world mouths the scriptures that tell us all men are brothers and persecutes me while it cants from the time i can remember it has been so my own mother was ashamed of me at school they prayed god to pardon the jews and the infidelstake from them all hardness of heartand came out from the service and beat the nigger as a man i have never had a friend is it charity is it justice to make a pariah of me why should i be shunned i was given life i didnt ask for it no she said gently but could you bear to have your child say that to you it is a brutal world a merciless world when they tell us it is a beautiful world they tell a lie they speak with their eyes shut to everything that is painful to see when browning wrote gods in his heaven alls right with the world i think god must have shuddered i know you believe in a life afterwards where all the crookedness down here will be put straightall the crooked backs and things try to be strong and wait for the explanationand the soul you spoke of and youve your work to help you if i could only work like you i am not righteous i am not very patient i have rebelled as passionately as you do if it can comfort you to know it i suffer as you do we are alike we twoyou and i werent made for happiness forgive me said david i might have remembered that you suffer you can understand me but you always have understood me it recurred to him with surprise that from her came the letters that he had treasured it was difficult to realise that the mind within the bent little woman who seemed a stranger was indeed the one so near to him even as yet their affinity left him desolate it was still to hilda that his spirit turnedhilda despoiled of all the qualities by which he had justified his love but sovereign still still hilda how strange it is he murmured your letters used to make me very happy and the letters are real arent they i think i was ready to love her for what she wrote only only then you loved her for herself yes vivian will marry her now vivian would be glad to know what i know he is afraid she doesnt care for him ifif she wonders whether he loves her you might tell her that i know he does i boasted to him yesterday how he might laugh at me today im so sorry for you its a wornout word it seemed an insult to you when i used it just now but what other is there the relief will come youll pour your pain into your poetry youll write something beautiful and great because of what youre suffering and know that it is beautiful and great the pain will fade a little because youll feel you utter it so well he looked beyond her thoughtfully yes he said it sounds paltry doesnt it but its true are we so shallow we she sighed im not an artist i am dumb i used to thinkbut what has that to do with it tell me he said i used to think i must have genius i didnt think a little gift like mine could cry so loud if people knew some of the things i have done in my life they would laugh becausebecause one has no right to feel like that and be mediocre it is silly did you know as a child that you had power i always longed i remember telling my father once that it was in me i lost hope afterwards ive been so miserable i could hear it in your work you seemed to be speaking for me sometimes i wanted to thank you for such a long while before i found the courage to do it if i had guessed what was to come of it i did nearly tear the letter upso nearly i used to ask myself what youd say if you could see me i was frightened i shouldnt hear from you any more if you knew what i was like i should have heard from you shouldnt i yes shall i hear from you still her gaze rose to him wonderingly do you mean that she faltered do you want to i dont know he said it would keep the pain alive you wouldnt be able to bear it he was silent a moment pondering your letters made me happy he repeated they have been all ive hadi shall be poorer without them yes i must have them ill try not to think of her when i read them ill read them for what they arewhat they were to me before i saw her this isnt the end if you are sure you wish it write to me i will always answer she promised the poignancy was fading from their tones as the anger against her had already faded from his heart by degrees they talked more freely she lost the bearing of a penitent before her judge the weakness was all the mans and it became her part to comfort a slow thankfulness that she had been revealed to him began to tinge the greyness of his outlook in him and in her a sense was dawning that they could never again be so utterly alone when she went to the door with him not an hour had passed since he uttered his reproachesand upon the threshold he took both her hands and she said its not goodbye on the morning when davids father followed a blonde in crape along the brighton seafront the band was playing la fille de madame angot when david held bees hands and she said its not goodbye the present century was born so far as the lives of david lee and hebe sorrenford are lived the story of their lives is told where it ends another is beginning and to some of us it must seem that the story of their friendship can end only when the man or woman dies for the sympathy between these two who in spirit are one cannot die that must last longer than their youth and longer than their passions i who have said what has been believe it must last longer than the bodies that belie their souls the pages of the story are blank and we can do no more than guess how time will write it but after hilda has become vivians wife and when the musicroom is silent it cannot be rash to think that bee will make her new home close to davids and since nature calls to both that through some village street the figures of the quaint companions will pass together every dayand pass together for so many days that at last the rustics cease to point at them alike in their ideals in their feeling for beauty alike even in their weaknesses how can they drift apart far on in the unwritten story i see no separation but the night i see them working together hoping togetherhopeful of an immortality for davids verse which perhaps it will not winbut both happier both braver each of them fortified by the others love when the name of ownie is unspoken and she rests as lilian augusta widow of elisha lee i see them together still and i think there is no knowledge in his comrades heart that david does not share excepting that his history has held such love as women give to men where children sing if i am not wrong one day he will know that too but he will learn it only where there is a fuller charity and a clearer lightin a world where a hue of the skin cannot ostracise and a crook of the body cannot ban the end
