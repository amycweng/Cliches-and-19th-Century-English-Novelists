find much to dwell upon the best way to enjoy it is to follow the path along the meadows underneath the inland rampart of the sussex hills here is pasture rich enough for the daintiest sheep to dream upon tones of varied green in stripes by order of the farmer trees as for a portrait grouped with the folding hills behind and light and shadow making love in play to one another also in the breaks of meadow and the footpath bendings stiles where love is made in earnest at the proper time of year with the darkbrowed hills imposing everlasting constancy any man here however sore he may be from the road of life after sitting awhile and gazing finds the good will of his younger days revive with a wider capacity though he hold no commune with the heights so far above him neither with the trees that stand in quiet audience soothingly nor even with the flowers still as bright as in his childhood yet to himself he must say somethingbetter said in silence into his mind and heart and soul without any painful knowledge or the noisy trouble of thinking pure content with his native land and its claim on his love are entering the power of the earth is round him with its lavish gifts of lifebounty from the lap of beauty and that cultivated glory which no other land has earned instead of panting to rush abroad and be lost among jagged obstacles rather let one stay within a very easy reach of home and spare an hour to saunter gently down this meadow path here in a broad bold gap of hedge with bushes inclined to heal the breach and mallowleaves hiding the scar of chalk here is a stile of no high pretence and comfortable to gaze from for hath it not a preface of planks constructed with deep anatomical knowledge and delicate study of maiden decorum and lo in spite of the planksas if to show what human nature isin the body of the stile itself towards the end of the third bar down are two considerable nicks where the shortlegged children from the village have a sad habit of coming to think here with their fingers in their mouths they sit and muse and scrape their heels and stare at one another broadly taking estimate of life then with a push and scream the scramble and the rush down hill begin ending as all troubles should in a brisk pullup of laughter however it might be too much to say that the cleverest child beneath the hills or even the man with the licence to sell tea coffee snuff and tobacco who now comes looking after them finds any conscious pleasure or feels quickening influence from the scene to them it is but a spread of meadows under a long curve of hill green and mixed with trees down here brown and spotted with furze up there to the children a playground to the men a farm requiring repairs and a good bit of manure so it is and yet with even those who think no more of it the place if not the scenery has its aftermath of influence in later times when sickness absence or the loss of sight debars them men will feel a deep impression of a thing to long for to be longed for with a yearning stronger than mere admiration or the painters taste can form for he whatever pleasure rises at the beauty of the scene loses it by thinking of it even as the joy of all things dies in the enjoying but to those who there were born and never thought about it in the days of age or ailment or of better fortune even in a brighter climate how at the sound of an ancient name or glimpse of faint resemblance or even on some turn of thought untraced and unaccountableagain the hills and valleys spread to aged vision truer than they were to youthful eyesight again the trees are rustling in the wind as they used to rustle again the sheep climb up the brown turf in their snowy zigzag a thousand winks of childhood widen into one clear dream of age chapter ii coombe lorraine how came that old house up there is generally the first question put by a londoner to his southdown friend leading him through the lowland path it must have a noble view but what a position and what an aspect the house has been there long enough to get used to it is his hosts reply and it is not built as they are where you live of the substance of a hat that large oldfashioned house which looks as if it had been much larger stands just beneath the crest of a longbacked hill in a deep embrasure although it stands so high and sees much less of the sun than the polestar it is not quite so weatherbeaten as a stranger would suppose it has some little protection and a definite outline for its grounds because it was built on an old and extensive settlement of the chalk a thing unheeded in early times but now very popular and attractive under the name of landslip of these there are a good many still to be traced on the sides of the sussex hills caused as the learned say by the shifting of the greensand or silt which generally underlies the more stable chalk few however of them are so strongly marked and bold as this one which is known as coombe lorraine it is no mere depression or irregular subsidence but a sheer vertical drop which shows as if a broad slice had been cut out from the chine to the base of the highland here in the time of william rufus roland de lorraine having a grant from him or from the conqueror and trusting the soil to slide no more or ignorant that it had ever slidden built himself a dwellingplace to keep a lookout on his property this abode no doubt was fitted for warlike domesticity being founded in the fine old times when every gentleman was bound to build himself a castle it may have been that a little jealousy of his friend de braose who had taken a larger grant of land although he was of newer race and had killed fewer men than sir roland led this enterprising founder to set up his tower so high at any rate he settled his penates so commandingly that if bramber castle had been in sight he might have looked down its chimneys as freely as into his villeins sheepcotes bramber castle however happened to be round the corner this good knights end according to the tradition of the family was not so thoroughly peaceful as a life of war should earn one gentle autumnal evening sir roland and his friend and neighbour william de braose were riding home to a quiet supper both in excellent temper and spirits and pleasant contempt of the country the harvestmoon was rising over breadths of corn in grant to them and sheep and cattle tended by their villeins once the owners each congratulated the other upon tranquil seizin and the goodwill of the neighbourhood when suddenly their way was stopped by a score of heavy englishmen these in their clumsy manner sued no favour nor even justice only to be trodden down with fairness and show of reason ye shall be trodden all alike de braose shouted fiercely having learned a good deal of english from the place he lived in clods are made to be trodden down out of my road or i draw my sword the men turned from him to sir roland who was known to be kind of heart ye do the wrong thing to meet me thus he answered in his utmost english the thing that is to say i hearken but not with this violence speaking thus he spurred his horse and the best of the men made way for him but one of them had an arrow straining on the cord with intent to shootas he said to the priest at the gallowsde braose and him only as the two knights galloped off he let his arrow in the waning of the light fly after them and it was so strongly sped that it pierced backharness and passed through the reins of roland de lorraine thus he died and his descendants like to tell the story it is not true although maintained by descendants of de braose that he was the man that was shot and the knight who ran away sir roland the pious duties rendered by the five brave monks from fcamp were for the soul of sir roland as surely as the arrow was for the body of de braose but after eight hundred years almost let the benefit go between them whichever way this may have chanced in an age of unsettled principles sure it is that the good knight died either then or afterwards also that a man was hanged at a spot still shown in his behalf and that he felt it such an outrage on his sense of justice after missing his proper shot that even now he is often seen when the harvestmoon is lonely straining a long bow at something but most careful not to shoot these however are mere legends wherewith we have nought to do and it would have been as well to leave them in their quiet slumber if it could have been shown without them how the house was built up there also one may fairly fancy that a sweet and gallant knight may have found his own vague pleasure in a fine and ample view regarding which matter we are perhaps a little too hard on our ancestors presuming that they never owned such eyes as ours for scenery because they knew the large impossibility of describing it chapter iii lineage and lineaments whether his fathers felt or failed to see the beauty beneath their eyes the owner of this house and land at the time we have to speak of deserved and had the true respect of all who dwelled below him it is often said that no direct descendant bred from sire to son still exists or at any rate can show that he has right to exist from any knight or even cook known to have come with the conqueror the question is one of delicacy and therefore of deep feeling but it must be owned in candour upon almost every side that there are people here and there able to show something the present sir roland lorraine could show as much in this behalf as any other man in england here was the name and here the place and here that more fugitive being man still belonging to both of them whether could be shown or not the strict red line of lineage sir roland lorraine was the very last man likely to assert it he had his own opinions on that allimportant subject and his own little touches of feeling when the matter came into bearing his pride was of so large a nature that he seldom could be proud he had his pleasant vein of humour about almost everything wholly free from scoffing and most sensitive of its limit also although he laid no claim to any extensive learning or especially accurate scholarship his reading had been various and his knowledge of the classics had not been allowed to fade away into misty memory inasmuch as he added to these resources the further recommendation of a fine appearance and gentle manners good position and fair estates it may be supposed that sir roland was in strong demand among his neighbours for all social purposes he however through no petty feeling or small exclusiveness but from his own taste and likings kept himself more and more at home and in quietude as he grew older so that ere he turned sixty years the owner of coombe lorraine had ceased to appear at any county gatherings or even at the hospitable meetings of the neighbourhood his dinnerparty consisted only of himself and his daughter alice his wife had been dead for many years his mother lady valeria was still alive and very active and having just numbered fourscore years had attained the right of her own way by right or wrong she had always contrived to enjoy that special easement and even now though she lived apart little could be done without her in the household management hilary sir rolands only son was now at the temple eating his way to the bar or feeding for some other mischief and alice the only daughter living was the baronets favourite companion and his darling now whether from purity of descent or special mode of selection or from living so long on a hill with northern consequences or from some other cause to be extracted by philosophers from bestial analogiesanyhow one thing is certain these lorraines were not and had not for a long time been at all like the rest of the world around them it was not pride of race that made them unambitious and well content and difficult to get at neither was it any other ill affection to mankind they liked a good man when they saw him and naturally so much the more as it became harder to find him also they were very kind to all the poor people around them and kept well in with the church and did whatever else is comely but long before sir rolands time all sussex knew and was content to know that as a general rule those lorraines went nowhere neighbours who were conscious of what we must now begin to call cooperative origin felt that though themselves could claim justices of the peace high sheriffs and knights of the shire among their kin yet they could not quite leap over that romantic bar of ages which is so deterrent perhaps because it is so shadowy neither did they greatly care to press their company upon people so different from themselves and so unlikely to admire them but if any one asked where lay the root of the difference which so long had marked the old family on the hill perhaps no one least of all any of the lorraines themselves could have given the proper answer plenty of other folk there were who held aloof from public life simplicity kindness and chivalry might be found by a man with an active horse in other places also even a feeling as nearly akin as our nature admits to contempt of money at that time went on somewhere how then differed these lorraines from other people of equal rank and like habits with them men who differ from their fellows seem by some law of nature to resent and disclaim the difference those who are proud and glory in their variance from the common type seldom vary much from it so that in the year of grace the mighty comet that scared the world spreading its tail over good and bad overhung no house less conscious of anything under its roof peculiar than the house of coombe lorraine with these lorraines there had been a tradition ripened as traditions ripen into a small religion that a certain sequence of christian names must be observed whenever allowed by providence in the heritage these names in right order were roland hilary and roger and the family had long believed and so had all their tenants that a certain sequence of character and the events which depend upon character might be expected to coincide with the succession of these names the rolands were always kindly proud fond of home and of their own people lovers of a quiet life and rather deep than hot of heart a hilary the next of race was prone to the opposite extremes though still of the same rootfibre sir hilary was always showy affable and romantic eager to do something great pleased to give pleasure to everybody and leaving his children to count the cost after him there ought to arise a roger the saviour of the race beginning to count pence in his cradle and growing a yard in commonsense for every inch of his stature frowning at every idea that was not either of land or money and weighing himself and his bride and most of his principles by troyweight chapter iv father and favourite upon a very important day as it proved to be in his little world the th of june sir roland lorraine had enjoyed his dinner with his daughter alice in those days men were not content to feed in the fashion of owls or wild ducks who have lain abed all day in winter or summer at coombe lorraine the dinnerbell rang at halfpast four for people to dress and again at five for all to be down in the drawingroom and all were sure to be prompt enough for the air of the southdown hills is hungry and nature knew what the demand would be before she supplied her best mutton there when the worthy old butler was gone at last and the long dark room lay silent alice ran up to her fathers side to wish him over a sip of wine the good old wish that sits so lightly on the lips of children darling papa i wish you many happy happy returns of the day and good health to enjoy them sir roland was sixty years old that day and being of a cheerful even and pleasant though shy temperament he saw no reason why he should not have all the bliss invoked on him the one great element in that happiness now was looking at him undeniably present and determined to remain so his quick glance told that he felt all this but he was not wont to show what he felt and now he had no particular reason to feel more than usual nevertheless he did so feel without knowing any reason and turned his eyes away from hers while he tried to answer lightly this would not do for his daughter alice she was now in that blush of time when everything is observed by maidens but everything is not hinted at at least it used to be so then and still is so in good places therefore alice thought a little before she began to talk again the only trouble to her knowledge which her father had to deal with was the unstable and romantic character of young hilary this he never discussed with her nor even alluded to it for that would have been a breach of the law in all dulyentailed conservatism that the heir of the house even though a fool must have his folly kept sacred from the smiles of inferior members now hilary was not at all a fool only a young man of large mind knowing that her father had not any bad news of hilary from whom he had received a very affectionate letter that morning alice was sorely puzzled but scarcely ventured to ask questions for in this savage island then respect was shown and reverence felt by children towards their parents and she although such a petted child was full of these fine sentiments also now in her seventeenth year she knew that she had outgrown the playful freedoms of the babyhood but was not yet established in the dignity of a maiden much less the glory of womanhood so that her sunny smile was fading into the shadow of a sigh when instead of laying her pretty head on her fathers shoulder she brought the low chair and favourite cushion of the younger times and thence looked up at him hoping fondly once more to be folded back into the love of childhood whatever sir rolands trouble was it did not engross his thoughts so much as to make him neglect his favourite he answered her wistful gaze with a smile which she knew to be quite genuine and then he patted her curly hair in the oldfashioned way and kissed her forehead lallie you look so profoundly wise i shall put you into caps after all in spite of your sighs and tears and sobs a head so mature in its wisdom must conform to the wisdom of the age papa they are such hideous things and you hate them as much as i do and only the other day you said that even married people had no right to make such frights of themselves married people have a right to please one another only a narrow view perhaps of justice buthowever that is different alice you never will attend when i try to teach you anything sir roland broke off lamely thus because his child was attending more than himself to what he was talking of like other men he was sometimes given to exceed his meaning but with his daughter he was always very careful of his words because she had lost her mother and none could ever make up the difference papa cried alice with that appealing stress upon the paternity which only a pet child can throw you are not at all like yourself today my dear most people differ from themselves with great advantage but you will never think that of me now let me know your opinion as to all this matter darling her father softened off his ending suddenly thus because he saw the young girls eyes begin to glisten as if for tears at his strange new way what matter papa the caps oh no the way you are now behaving very well then are you quite sure you can bear to hear all you have done amiss no my dear i am not at all sure but i will try to endure your most heartrending exaggerations then dear papa you shall have it all only tell me when to stop in the first place did you or did you not refuse to have hilary home for your birthday much as you knew that i wanted him you confess that you did and your only reason was something you said about trinity term sadly incomprehensible in the next place when i wanted you to have a little change today uncle struan for dinner and sir remnant and one or two others my dear how could i eat all these think of your uncle struans size papa you are only trying now to provoke me because you cannot answer you know what i mean as well as i do and perhaps a little better what i mean is one or two of the very oldest friends and relations to do what was nice and help you to get on with your birthday but you said with unusual ferocity darling i will have none but you upon my word i believe i did how wonderfully womenat least i mean how childrenastonish one by the way they touch the very tone of utterance after one has forgotten it i dont know what you mean papa and your reflection seems to be meant for yourself as everything seems to be for at least a week or i might say come lallie come now have some moderation well then papa for at least a fortnight i will let you off with that though i know it is much too little and when you have owned to that papa what good reason can you give for behaving so to mememe as good a child as ever there was can me me me after living through such a fortnight of mortificationthe real length of the period being less than four hours i believecan she listen to a little story without any excitement oh papa a story a story that will make up for everything what a lovely pleasure there is nothing i love half so much as listening to old stories i seem to be living my old age over before i come to any age papa i will forgive you everything if you tell me a story alice you are a little too bad i know what a very good girl you are but still you ought to try to think when you were only two years old you looked as if you were always thinking so i am now papa always thinkinghow to please you and do my best sir roland was beaten by this because he knew the perfect truth of it alice already thought too much about everything she could think of her father knew how bad it is when the bright young time is clouded over with unreasonable cares and often he had sore misgivings lest he might be keeping his pet child too much alone but she only laughed whenever he offered to find her new companions and said that her cousins at the rectory were enough for her if you please papa she now broke in upon his thinking how long will it be before you begin to tell me this beautiful story my own darling i forgot i was thinking of you and not of any trumpery stories but this is the very day of all days to sift our little mystery you have often heard of course about our old astrologer of course i have papaof course and with all my heart i love him everything the shepherds tell me shows how thoroughly good he was very well then all my story is about him and his deeds oh papa then do try for once in your life to be in a hurry i do love everything about him and i have heard so many things no doubt you have my dear but perhaps of a somewhat fabulous order his mind or his manners or appearance or at any rate something seems to have left a lasting impression upon the simple folk hereabout better than a pot of money an old woman told me the other day it was better than a pot of money for anybody to dream of him it would do them more good no doubt but i have not had a pinch of snuff today you have nearly broken me alice but still you do allow me one pinch when i begin to tell you a good story three papa you shall have three now and you may take them all at once because you never told such a story as i feel sure it is certain to be in all the whole course of your life before now come here where the sun is setting so that i may watch the way you are telling every word of it and if i ask you any questions you must nod your head but never presume to answer one of them unless you are sure that it will go on without interrupting the story now papa no more delay chapter v the legend of the astrologer two hundred years before the day when alice thus sat listening an ancestor of hers had been renowned in anatolia the most accomplished and most learned prince in all lesser asia was agasicles syennesis descended from mausolus made immortal by his mausoleum and from that celebrated king syennesis of cilicia there had been after both these were dead and much of their repute gone by creditable and happy marriages in and out their descendants at a little over and a little under twentytwo centuries ago and the best result and issue of all these was now embodied in prince agasicles the prince was not a patron only but also an eager student of the more recondite arts and sciences then in cultivation especially he had given his mind to chemistry including alchemy mineralogy and astrology devoting himself to these fine subjects and many others he seems to have neglected anthropology so that in his fiftieth year he was but a lonesome bachelor troubled at this time of his life with many expostulationsgenuine on the part of his friends and emphatic on that of his relativeshe held a long interview with the stars and taking their advice exactly as they gave and meant it married a wife the next afternoon and so far as he could make out the right one this turned out well his wife went off on the occasion of her first confinement leaving him with a daughter born ad and all women pronounced her beautiful the prince now spent his leisure time in thought and calculation he had almost made his mind up that he was sure to have a son and here was his wife gone and how could he risk his life again so upon the whole he made up his mind that matters might have been worse although they ought to have been much better and that he must thank the stars and not be too hard upon any one and so he fell to at his science again and studied almost everything in that ancient corner of the world old caria the fine original leleges looked up to the prince and loved him warmly and were ready by night or day to serve him or to rob him they saw that now was the finest chance while he was looking at the stars with no wife to look out for him for them to do their duty to their families by robbing him and this they did with honest comfort and a sense of going home in the proper way to go prince agasicles growing older felt these troubles more and more as a general rule a man growing older has a more extensive knowledge that he must be robbed of course and yet he scarcely ever seems to reconcile himself with maturing wisdom to the process and so it happened to this good prince not that he cared so very much about little trifles that might attract the eye of taste and the hand of skill but that he could not even with the aid of all the stars find anything too valuable to be stolen hence as his daughter artemise grew to the fulness of young beauty he thought it wise to raise the most substantial barrier he could build betwixt her and the outer world there happened to be in that neighbourhood then an active supply of villains of this by no means singular fact the prince might well assure himself by casting his eyes down from the stars to the narrow bosom of his mother earth but whether thus or otherwise forewarned of local mischief the carian prince took a very strong measure and even a sacrilegious one in or about the year of our reckoning he walled off his daughter and other goods in a certain peninsula of his own clearly displayed in our maps and as clearly forbidden to be either trenched or walled by a pythia skilled in trimeter tone who seems to have been a lady of exceptionally clear conservatism the prince as the sage of the neighbourhood knew all about this prohibition and that it was still in force and must have acquired twentyfold power by the lapse of twenty centuries and as the sea had retreated a little during that short period it was evident that jove had been consistent in the matter he never meant it for an island else he would have made it one agasicles therefore felt some doubt about the piety of his proceeding retaining as he did in common with his neighbours some respect for the classic gods his respect however for the stars was deeper and these told him that young artemise was likely to be run away with by some bold adventurer a peninsula was the very thing to suit his purpose and none could be fairer or snugger than this of his own the very site of ancient cnidos whereof venus once was queen undeterred by this local affection or even the warnings of delphi the learned prince exerted himself and by means of a tidy hedge of paliure and aspalathus made the five stades of isthmus proof against even thicktrousered gentlemen a fortiori against the natives all unendowed with pantaloons neither might his fence be leaped by any of the roving horsementurks cilicians pamphylians karamanians or reavers from the chain of taurus this being fixed to his satisfaction with a couple of sentries at the gate and one at either end prompt with matchlocks and above all the young lady inside provided with many proverbs prince agasicles set forth on a visit to an armenian sage reputed to be as wise as himself almost with him he discussed alhasen vitellio and their own contemporary kepler and spent so many hours aloft that on his return to his native place he discovered his own little oversight this was so very simple that it required at least a sage and great philosopher to commit it the learned man appears to have forgotten that the sea is navigable so it chanced that a gay young englishman cruising about in an armed speronera among the gan islands and now in the carpathian sea hunting after pirates heard of this eastern cynosure and her walled seclusion this of course was enough for him landing under the promontory where the cnidian venus stood he fell and falling dragged another into the wild maze of love mazed they seemed of course and nearly mad no doubt to other folk to themselves however they were in a new world altogether far above the level and the intellect of the common world artemise forgot her pride her proverbs and pretensions she had lost her own way in the regions of a higher life and nothing to her was the same as it had been but yesterday heart and soul and height and depth she trusted herself to the englishman and even left her jewels therefore they two launched their bark upon the unknown waters the damsel with her heart in tempest of the filial duties shattered and the fatherland cast off yet for the main part anchored firmly on the gallant fluke of love the youth in a hurry to fight a giant if it would elevate him to her artemise with all her rashness fared much better than she deserved for leaving an adoring father the wrong side of the quickset hedge the bold young mariner happened to be a certain hilary lorraine heir of that old house or castle in the southdown coombe possessed with the adventurous spirit of his uncles the famous shirley brothers he had sailed with raleigh and made havoc here and there and seen almost as much of the world as was good for himself or it enlarged by travel he was enabled to suppress rude curiosity about the wishes of the absent prince and deferring to a better season the pleasure of his acquaintance he made all sail with the daughter on board as set forth already and those two were made into one according to the rites of the old greek church in the classic shades of ida and to their dying day it never repented either of themmuch when the prince returned and found no daughter left to meet him he failed for a short time to display that selfcommand upon which he had for years been wont to plume himself but having improved his condition of mind by a generous bastinado of servants peasants and matchlock men he found himself reasonably remounting into the sphere of pure intellect in a night or two an interesting conjunction of heavenly bodies happened and eclipsed this nebulous world of women in a few years time he began to get presents eatable drinkable and good gradually thus he showed his wisdom by foregoing petty wrath and when he was summoned to meet a star militant to his grandson he could not help ordering his horse chapter vi the legend continued although this prince knew so much more of the heaven above than the earth beneath he did not quite expect to ride the whole of the way to england at smyrna he took ship and after some difficulties and dangers landed at shoreham full of joy to behold his four grandchildren who proved to be five by the time he saw them the sussex roads were as bad as need be and worse than could be anywhere else but the sturdy oxen set their necks to drag through all things thick or thin and the prince stuck fast to his coach as firmly as the coach stuck fast with him having never seen any roads before he thought them a wonderful institution and though misled by the light of nature to grumble at some of his worst upsets a little reflection led him softly back into contentment a mind irretrievably analytic at once distinguished wisdoms element in the sussex reasoners gin us made thase hyur radds gooder volk ood be radin down droo em avery dai amost the lard in heaven never made radds as cud ever baide the work if stranngers cud goo along wiout bin vorced to zit down and mend un when this was interpreted to his highness he was so struck with its clear sound sense and logical sequence that he fell back and for the rest of his journey admired the grandeur of english character this sentiment so deeply founded was not likely to be impaired by further acquaintance with our great nation for more than a twelvemonth prince agasicles made his home in england and many of his quaint remarks abode on sussex shepherds tongues for generations afterwards recommended as they were by the vantage of princely wisdom for he picked up quite enough of the language to say odd things as a child does and with a like simplicity with this difference however that while the great hits of the little ones by the proud mother chronicled are the lucky outbursts of happy inexperience the old mans sage words were the issue of unhappy experience nevertheless he must have owned a genial nature still at work for he loved to go down the village lane when the wind was cold on the highland and there to wait at a cottage door till the children came to stare at him and soon these children had courage to spy that in spite of his outlandish dress pockets were about him and they whispered as much to one another while their eyes were testing him at other times when the wind was soft and shadows of gentle clouds were shed in chase of one another this great man who had seen the world and knew all the stars hanging over ithis pleasure was to wander in and out of the ups and downs and nooks of quaintlyplaited hills and feast his eyes upon their verdure after that when the westering light was spreading the upland ridge with gold and the glades with grey solemnity this man of declining years was well content to lean on a bank of turf and watch the quiet ways of sheep often thus his mind was carried back to the land of childhood soothed as in his nurses arms by natures peace around him and if his dreams were interrupted by the crisp fresh sound of browsing and the ovine tricks as bright as any human exploits he would turn and do his best to talk with the lonely shepherds these in their simple way amused him with their homely saws and strange content and independence and he no less delighted them by unaccustomed modes of speech and turns of thought beyond their minds and distant wisdom quite brought home thus and by many other means this ancient prince of noble presence and of flowing snowwhite hair and vesture undisgraced by tailors left such trace upon these hills that even his ghost was well believed to know all the sheeptracks afterwards pleased with england and with english scenery and customs as well as charmed with having five quite baby stars to ephemerise this great astrologer settled to stay in our country as long as possible he sent his trusty servant memel in a merchantship from shoreham to fetch his implements and papers precious things of many kinds and curiosities long in store memel brought all these quite safe except one little thing or two which he accounted trifles but his master was greatly vexed about them the prince unpacked his goods most carefully in his own eightsided room allowing none but his daughter to help him and not too sure about trusting her then forth he set for a real campaign among the stars of the southdownsand suppercall and breakfastbell were no more than the bark of a dog to him and thus he spent his nights alas forgetful of the different clime under the cold stars when by rights he should have been under the counterpane this grew worse and worse until towards the middle of the month of june ad his mind was altogether much above the proper temperature great things were pending in the heavens which might be quoted as pious excuse for a little human restlessness the prince with his implements always ready either in his lanternchamber or at his favourite spot of the hills according to the weather grew more and more impatient daily for the sun to be out of the way and more and more intolerant every night of any cloudiness selfperplexed downcast and moody except when for a few brief hours a brighter canopy changed his gloom into a nervous rapture he wasted and waned away in body as his mind grew brighter after the hurried night he dragged his faint way home in the morning and his face of exhausted power struck awe into the household no one dared to ask him what had happened or why he looked so and he like a true philosopher kept all explanations to himself and then he started anew and strode with his samian cloak around him over the highest darkest and most lonesome hill out of peoples sight one place there was which beyond all others suited his purposes and his mood a wellknown landmark now and the scene of many a merry picnic chanctonbury ring was then a lonely spot imbued with terror of a wandering ghostan ancient ghost with a long white beard walking even in the afternoon with its head bowed down in search of somethinga vain search of centuries this longsought treasure has now been found not by the ghost however but a lucky stroke of the ploughshare and the spectral owner roves no more he is supposed with all the assumption required to make a certainty to have been a tenant on chancton manor under earl gurth the brother of harold and being slain at hastings to have forgotten where his treasure lay the ring as of old is a height of vantage for searching all the country round with a telescope on a breezy day it is the salient point and foreland of a long ridge of naked hills crowned with darker eminence by a circle of stormhuddled trees but when the astrologer agasicles made his principal nighthaunt here the ring was not overhung with trees but only outlined by them and the rampart of the british camp if such it were was more distinct and uninvaded by planters so that here was the very place for a quiet sage to make his home sweeping a long horizon and secure from interruption to such a citadel of science guarded by the fame of ghosts even his daughter artemise or his trusty servant memel would scarce dare to follow him much less any of the peasants who from the lowland seeing a distant light crossed themselves for that fine old custom flourished still among them therefore here his tent was pitched and here he spent the nights in gazing and often the days in computation not for himself but for his descendants until his frame began to waste and his great dark eyes grew pale with it chapter vii the legend concluded artemise and all around the prince had been alarmed of late by many little symptoms he always had been rashly given to take no heed of his food or clothes but now he went beyond all that and would have no one take heed for him or dare to speak of the matter much hence without listening to any nonsense all the women were sure of one thingthe prince was wearing himself away the country people who knew him and loved him with a little mystery said it was no wonder that he should worry himself for being so long away from home in manners and in places also sure it must be a trial for him out all night in the damp and fog and he no sense of breeches there was much of truth in this no doubt as well as much outside it yet none of them could enter into his peculiar state of mind so that he often reproached himself for having been rude but could not help it every one made allowance for him as englishmen do for a foreigner as being of a somewhat lower order in many ways in creation yet with a mixture of mind about it they admired him more and more the largeness of his nature still was very conspicuous in thishe never brought his telescope to bear on his own planet his heart was reaching so far forward into future ages that he strove to follow downwards nine or ten entails of stars to know what was to become of all that were to be descended from him a highly interesting but also a deeply exhausting question this perpetual effort told very hard upon his constitution for nothing less than fatal worry could have so impaired his native grace and lofty courtesy yet before his sudden end a softer and more genial star was culminant one evening when ones time comes to be certainwhether by earthly senses or by influence of heavenof the buoyant balance turning and the slender span outspun tender thinkings and kind wishes flow to the good side of us through this power the petty troubles and the crooked views of life and the ambition to make others better than we care to be and every other little turn of wholesome selfdeceptionthese drop off and leave us sinking into a sense of having lived and made a humble thing of it whether this be so or not upon the th day of june in the year prince agasicles came home rather hot and very tired and fain for a little sleep if such there were to wear out weariness but still he had heavy work left for that night as a mighty comet had lately appeared and scared the earth abundantly yet now he had two or three hours to spare and they might as well be happy ones therefore he sent for his daughter to come and see to his food and such like and then to sit with him some few minutes and to watch the sunset artemise still young and lovely knew of course from eastern wisdom that womans right is to do no wrong so that she came at once when called and felt as a mother ought to feel that she multiplied her obedience vastly by bringing all her children being in a soft state of mind the old man was glad to see them all and let them play with him as freely as childhoods awe of white hair allowed then he laid his hand upon roger the heir of the house and blessed him on his way to bed and after that he took his supper waited on by artemise who was very grateful for his kindness to her children so that she brought him the right thing exactly at the right moment without overcrowding him and then she poured him sparkling wine and comforted his weary feet and gave him a delicious pipe of persian meconopsis free from the bane of opium yet more dreamy than tobacco also she sprinkled round him delicate attar of the vervain sprightlier and less oppressive than the scent of roses until his white beard ceased to flutter and the strong lines of his face relaxed into soft drowsiness observing thence the proper time when sweet sleep was encroaching and haste and heat and sudden temper were as far away as can be from a man of eastern blood artemise his daughter touched him with the smile which he used to love when she was two years old and upward and his thoughts without his knowledge flew back to her mother father to me father dearest she was whispering to him in the native tongue which charms the old as having lulled their cradles father to me tell what trouble has together fallen on you in this cold and foreign land melody enough was still remaining in the most melodious of all mortal languages for a child to move a father into softer memories at the sound of ancient music thus revived and left to dwell child of my breast the prince replied in the very best modern hellenic a strong desire to sleep again hath overcome mine intellect thus is it the more suited father for discourse with such as mine let your little one share the troubles of paternal wisdom suasion more than this was needed and at every stage forthcoming more skilfully than english words or even looks could render ere ever the paternal wisdom might be coaxed to unfold itself and even so it was not disposed to be altogether explicit ask me no more he said at last enough that i foresee great troubles overhanging this sad house oh father when and how and what how shall we get over them and why should we encounter them and will my husband or my children the prince put up one finger as if to say ask one thing at a time the while he ceased not to revolve many and sad counsels in his venerable head and in his gaze deep pity mingled with a fathers pride and love then he spoke three words in a language which she did not comprehend but retained their sound and learned before her death that they meant thisknowledge of trouble trebles it now bestloved father she exclaimed perceiving that his face was set to tell her very little behold how many helpless ones depend upon my knowledge of the evils i must shield them from it isnay by your eyesit is the little daughter whom you always cherished with such love and care who now is the cause of a mind perplexed as often she has been to you father let not our affairs lay such burden on your mind but spread them out and lighten it often as our saying hath it oftentimes the ear of folly is the purse for wisdoms gems i hesitate not i doubt no longer i do not divide my mind in twain the wisdom of them that come after me carries off and transcends mine own as a mountain doth a halfpeck basket wherefore my daughter artemise wife of the noble englishman with whom she ran away from caria and mother of my five grandchildren she is worthy to know all that i have learned from heaven ay and she shall know it all father to me dearest yes oh how noble and good of you she shall know all continued the prince with a gaze of ingenuous confidence and counting on his fingers slowly it may be sooner or it may be later however i think one may safely promise a brilliant knowledge of everything in five years after we have completed the second century from this day but now the great comet is waiting for me let me have my boots again uncouth barbarous frightful things but in such a country needful his daughter obeyed without a word and hid her disappointment it is only to wait till tomorrow she thought and then to fill him a larger pipe and coax him a little more perhaps and pour him more wine of burgundy tomorrow never came for him except in the way the stars come in the morning he was missed and sought for and found dead and cold at the end of his longest telescope in chanctonbury ring he died and must have known for at least a moment that his death was over him for among the stars of his jottingchart was traced in trembling charcoal sepeli ubi cecidibury me where i have fallen chapter viii astrological forecast alice lorraine with no small excitement heard from her fathers lips this story of their common ancestor part of it was already known to her through traditions of the country but this was the first time the whole had been put into a connected narrative she wondered also what her fathers reason could be for thus recounting to her this piece of family history which had never been as she felt quite sure confided to her brother hilary and like a young girl she was saying to herself as he went onshall i ever be fit to compare with that lovely artemise my eversolongback grandmother as the village people call it and will that fine old astrologer see that the stars do their duty to us and was the great comet that killed him the one that frightens me every night so and why did he make such a point of dying without explaining anything however what she asked her father was a different question from all these oh papa how kind of you to tell me all that story but what became of artemiselady lorraine i suppose she was no my dear mistress lorraine or madame lorraine perhaps they called her the old earldom had long been lost and roger her son who fell at naseby was the first baronet of our family but as for artemise herselfthe daughter of the astrologer and wife of hilary lorraine she died at the birth of her next infant within a twelvemonth after her father and then it was known why he had been so reluctant to tell her anything oh i am so sorry for her then she is that beautiful creature hanging third from the door in the gallery with ruches beautifully picked out and glossy and wonderful gold lace on her head and long hair and lovely emeralds hanging down as if they were nothing yes said sir roland smiling at his daughters style of description that of course is the lady and the portrait is clearly a likeness at one time we thought of naming you after herartemise lorrainefor your nurse discovered that you were like her at the mature age of three days oh papa how i wish you had it would have sounded so much nicer and so beautifully romantic just so my child and therefore in these matteroffact times so deliciously absurd moreover i hope that you will not be like her either in running away from your father or in any other wayexcept her kindness and faithfulness he was going to say in her early death but a sudden touch of our natural superstition stopped him papa how dare you speak as if any one ever in all the world could be fit to compare with you but now you must tell me one little thingwhy have you chosen this very day which ought to be such a happy one for telling me so sad a tale that a little more would have made me cry the reason my lallie is simple enough this happens to be the very day when the two hundred years are over and the astrologers will or whatever the document is may now be opened his will papa did he leave a will and none of us ever heard of it my dear your acquaintance with his character is perhaps not exhaustive he may have left many wills without wishing to have them published at any rate you shall have the chance before it grows dark to see what there is me or iwhichever is rightme or i to do such a thing papa when i was six years old i could stand on my head but now i have lost the art alas now alice do try to be sensible if you ever had such an opening you know that i do not very often act rashly but you will make me think i have done so now unless you behave most steadily papa i am steadiness itself but you must make allowance for a little upset at the marvels heaped upon me my dear child there are no marvels or at any rate none for you to know all you have to do is to go and to fetch a certain document whether you know any more about it is a question for me to consider oh papato raise me up so and to cast me down like that and i was giving you credit for having trusted me so entirely and very likely you would not even have sent me for this document if you had your own way about it alice sir roland answered smiling at her knowledge of him you happen to be particularly right in that conjecture i should never have thought of sending you to a lonely and forsaken place if i were allowed to send any one else or to go myself and i have not been happy at thinking about it ever since the morning my father do you think that i could help rejoicing in such an errand it is the very thing to suit me where are the keys papa do be quick i have no intention my dear child of hurrying either you or myself there is plenty of time to think of all things the sun has not set and that happens to be one of the little things we have to look to oh how very delightful papa that makes it so much more beautiful and it is the astrologers room of course my dear it strikes me that you look rather pale in the midst of all your transports now dont go if you are at all afraid afraid papa now you want to provoke me you quite forget both my age it appears and the family i belong to my pet you never allow us to be very long forgetful of either of those great facts but i trust i have borne them both duly in mind and i fear that i should even enhance most needlessly your selfesteem if i were to read you the directions which i now am following for strangely enough they do contain predictions as to your character such as we cannot yet perceive much as we love you to have come to pass oh but who are the we papa if everybody knows iteven grandmamma for instancewhat pleasure can i hope to find in ever having been predicted you may enjoy that pleasure alice as exclusively as you please even your grandmother knows nothing of the matter we have now in hand or elseat least i should say perhaps that if it were otherwise she would have been down here of course papa and have marched up to the room herself but if the whole thing belongs to ones self nothing can be more delightful than to have been predicted especially in glowing terms such as i beg you now papa to read in glowing tones to me alice i do not like that style ofwhat shall i call iton your part persiflage i believe is the word and i am glad that there is no english one it is never graceful in any woman still less in a young girl like you hilary brought it from oxford first and perhaps he thought it excellent lay it aside now once and for all it hopes to seem a clever thing and it does not even succeed in that at these severe words spoken with a decided attempt at severity alice fell back and could only drop her eyes and wonder what could have made her father so cross upon his birthday but after the smart of the moment she began to acknowledge to herself that her father was right and she was wrong this flippant style was foreign to her and its charms must be foregone i beg your pardon father dear she said looking softly up at him i know that i am not clever and i never meant to seem so quite right alice never attempt to do anything impossible saying this to her sir roland said to himself that after all he should like to know very much where to find any girl half so clever as lallie or any girl even a quarter so good and so loving and so beautiful the sun is almost gone behind the curve of the hill and the scrubby beech and the nick cut in the gorsebush alice you know we only see it for just the midsummer week like that alice came with her eyes already quit of every trace of tears with vanity and all petty feelings melting into larger thought the beauty of the world would often come around and overcome her so that she felt nothing else the sun must always be the same sir roland said rather doubtfully after waiting for alice to begin no doubt he must always be the same but still the great herschel seems to think that even the sun is changing if he is fed by comets as our old astronomers used to say he ought to be doing very well just now alice the sun is above ground still for people on the hilltop and there is the comet already kindling of course he is papa he never waits for the suns convenience but i must not say thati forgot there would be no english name for itwould there now papa you little tyrant what troubles i would inflict upon you if i studied the stars but i scarcely know the belt of orion from the northern crown astronomy does not appear to have taken deep root in our family but look there is part of the sun again emerging under chancton in five minutes more he will be quite gone now is the time for me to read these queer directions which contain so poetical an account of you alice warned by his former words and reduced to proper humility did not speak while her father opened the small strip of parchment at which she had so long been peeping curiously it is written in latin sir roland said and has been handed from father to son unsealed and as you see it from the time of the prince till our time may i see it papa what a very clear hand but you must translate it for me then here it isto the father and master of the family of lorraine whoever shall be in the year according to christian computation agasicles syennesis the carian bids hail do thou on the th day of june when the sun has well descended or departeddecesserit the word issend thy eldest daughter without any companion to the astronomers cnaculumwhy he never ate supper the poor old fellow unless it was the one he died ofand there let her search in a closet or cupboardin secessu muri the words are as far as i can make outand she will find a small document which to me has been in great price there will also be something else to be treated pro re natathat means according to circumstancesand according to the orders in the document aforesaid the virgin will be brave and beautiful ready to give herself for the house and of swiftlygrowing prudence if there be no such virgin then the need for her will not have arisen it is necessary that no young man should go and my document must lie hidden for another century it is not possible that any one of uncertain skill should be certain but there ought to be a great comet also burning in the sky of the same complexion as the one that makes my calculations doubtful farewell whosoever thou shalt be from me descended and obey me papa i declare it quite frightens me how could he have predicted me for instance and this great comet and even you then you think that you answer to your description my darling i do believe that you do but you never shall give yourself for the house or for fifty thousand houses now will you have anything to do with this strange affair or will you not much rather would i hear you say that you will have nothing to do with it and that the old mans book may sleep for at least another century now papa you know how much you would be disappointed in me and do you think that i could have any selfrespect remaining and beside all that how could i hope to sleep in my bed with all those secrets ever dangling over me that last is a very important point with your excitable nature you had better go always through a thing it was the same with your dear mother here are the keys my daughter i really feel ashamed to dwell so long on a mere superstition chapter ix the legacy of the astrologer the room known as the astrologers by the maids less reverently entitled the stargazers closet was that old eightsided or lanternchamber which has been mentioned in the short account of the carian sage and his labours he had used it alternately with his other quarters in the chancton ring for this had outlook of the rising as the other had of the setting stars at the eastern end of the house it stood away from roofs and chimneytops commanding the trending face of hill and the amplitude of the world below from northwest round the north and east to the rising point of fomalhault to this room alice now made her way as if she had no time to spare with quick light steps she passed through the hall and then the painted library as it was called from some old stained glassand at the further end she entered a little room with double doors her fathers favourite musingplace in the eastern end of this quiet chamber and at the eastern end of all there was a low and narrow door this was seldom locked because none of the few who came so far would care to go any further for it opened to a small landingplace dimly lit as well as damp and leading to a newel staircase narrow and made of a chalky flint angular and irregular alice stopped to think a little all things looked so uninviting that she would rather keep her distance surely now that the sun had departedwhether well or otherwisesome other time would do as nicely for going on with the business there was nothing said of any special hurry so far as she could remember and what could be a more stupid thing than to try to unlock an ancient door without any light for the keyhole she had a very great mind to go back and to come again in the morning she turned with a quick turn towards the light and the comfort and the company then suddenly she remembered how she had boasted of her courage and who would be waiting to laugh at her if she came back without her errand fearing further thought she ran like a sunset cloud up the stairway fifty or sixty steps went by her before she had time to think of them a few in the light of loopholes but the greater part in governed gloom or shadowy mixture flickering then at the top she stopped to breathe and recover her wits for a moment here a long black door repelled hera door whose outside she knew pretty well but had no idea of the other side upon this she began to think again and her thoughts were almost too much for her with a little sigh that would have moved all imaginable enemies the swiftly sensitive girl called up the inborn spirit of her race and her own peculiar romance these in combination scarcely could have availed her to turn the key unless her father had happened to think of oiling it with a white pigeons feather when she heard the bolt shoot back she made the best of a bad affair in for a penny in for a pound faint heart is fain two bites at a cherry and above all noblesse oblige with all these thoughts to press her forward in she walked quite dauntlessly and lo there was nothing to frighten her everything looked as old and harmless as the man who had loved them all having made or befriended them his own little lathe with its metal bed cast by himself from a mixture of his own defying the rust of centuries wanted nothing more than dusting and some oil on the bearings and the speculum he had worked so hard at for a reflecting telescopepartly his own idea and partly reflected as all ideas are some years ere the time of gregorythe error in its grinding which had driven him often to despair might still be traced by an accurate eye through the depth of two hundred dusty years models patterns moulds and castingsmany of which would have shown how slowly our boasted discoveries have grownalso favourite tools and sundry things past out of their meaning lay about among their fellows doomed alike to do no work because the man who had kept them moving was shorterlived than they were now young alice stood among them in a reverential way they were of course no more than other things laid by to rust according to mans convenience and yet she could not make up her mind to meddle with any one of them so that she only looked about and began to be at home with things her eager mind was always ready to be crowded with a rash young interest in all things it was the great fault of her nature that she never could perceive how very far all little things should lie beneath her notice so that she now had really more than she could contrive to take in all at once but while she stood in this surprise almost forgetting her errand among the multitude of ideas a cloud above the sunset happened to be packed with gorgeous light unbosoming itself to the air in the usual cloudy manner it managed thereby to shed down some bright memories of the departed one and hence there came a lovely gleam of daylights afterthought into the northwestern facet of the old eightsided room alice crossed this glance of sunset wondering what she was to do until she saw her shadow wavering into a recess of wall there between the darker windows to the right hand of the door a little hover of refraction striking upon reflection because it was fugitive caught her eyes she saw by means of this a keyhole in a brightened surface on a heavy turn of wall that seemed to have no meaning in right of discovery up she ran passed her fingers over a plate of polished sussex iron and put her key into the hole of course the lock had been properly oiled perhaps and put into working order sometimes even within the last hundred years but still it was so stiff that alice had to work the key both ways and with both hands ere it turned and even after the bolt went back she could not open the door at once perhaps because the jamb was rusty or the upper hinge had given forward whatever the hesitation was the girl would have no refusal she set the key crosswise in the lock and drew one corner of her linen handkerchief through the loop of it and then tied a knot and with both hands pulled inasmuch as her handkerchief was not made of gauze or lace or gossamer and herself of no feeble material the heavy door gave way at last and everything lay before her is that all oh is that all she cried in breathless disappointment and yet laughing at herself no jewels no pearls no brooches or buckles or even a gold watch and the great astrologer must have foreseen how sadly in this year of our reckoning i should be longing for a gold watch alas without it what is the use of being brave and beautiful here is nothing more than dust mouldy old deeds and a dirty cushion alice had a great mind at first to run back to her father and tell him that after all there was nothing found that would be worth the carrying and she even turned and looked round the room to support this strong conclusion but the weight of ancient wisdom pressed on the young imagination by the stamp of mystery held her under and made her stop from thinking her own thoughts about it he must have known better of course than i do only look at his clever tools i am sure i could live in this room for a week and never be afraid of anything but even while she was saying this to herself with the mind in command of the heart and a fine conscientious courage there came to her ears or seemed to come a quiet low unaccountable sound it may have been nothing as she tried to think when first she began to recover herself or it may have been something quite harmless and most easily traced to its origin but whatever it was in a moment it managed to quench her desire to live in that room with quick hands now delivered from their usual keen sense of grime she snatched up whatever she saw in the cupboard and banged the iron door and locked it with a glance of defiant terror over the safer shoulder first and then over the one that was nearer the noise then she knew that she had done her duty very bravely and that it would be a cruel thing to expect her to stay any longer and so to shut out all further views of anything she had no right to see she slipped back the band of her beautiful hair and under that cover retreated chapter x a boy and a donkey at this very time there happened to be a boy of no rank and of unknown order quietly jogging homeward he differed but little from other boys and seemed unworthy of consideration unless one stopped to consider him because he was a boy by no means virtuous or valiant neither gifted by nature with any inborn way to be wonderful having nothing to help him much he lived among the things that came around him to his very utmost and he never refused a bit to eat because it might have been a better bit and now and then if he got the chance without any more in the background than a distant view of detection he had been imagined perhaps to lay hand upon a stray trifle that would lie about and was due but not paid to his merits nobody knew where this boy came from or whether he came at all indeed or was only the produce of earth or sky at some improper conjuncture nothing was certain about him except that there he was and he meant to stay and people for the most part liked him and many women would been glad to love him in a protective way but for the fright by all of them felt by reason of the magistrates these had settled it long ago at every kind of session that this boy though so comparatively honest must not be encouraged much he had such a manner of looking about after almost anything and of making the most of those happy times when luck embraces art above all he had such exhaustive knowledge of appletrees and potatoburies and cows that wanted milking as well as of ticklish trout and occasional little ducks that had lost their waythat after longtried lenience and allowance for such a neglected child justice could no longer take a large and loving view of bonny bonny held small heed of justice even in the plural number whenever he could help it the nature of his birth and nurture had been such as to gift him with an outside view of everything if people liked him he liked them and would be the last to steal from them or at any rate would let them be the last for him to steal from his inner meaning was so honest that he almost always waited for some great wrong to be done to him before he dreamed of making free with almost anybodys ducks widely as he was known and often glanced at from a wrong point of view even his lowest detractor could not give his etymology many attempted to hold that he might have been called in some generative outburst bonnie by a scotchman of imagination others laughed this idea to scorn and were sure that his right name was boney because of his living in spite of all terror of bonyparty but the true solution probably was as with all analytic inquiries the thirdthat his right name was bony because his father though now quite a shadowy being must have at some time or other perhaps gone about crying rags and bones oh these little niceties of origin passed by bonny as the idle wind he was proud of his name and it sounded well and wherever he went the ladies seemed to like him as an unknown quantity also which mattered far more to him the female servants took to him and with many of these he had such a way that it found him in victuals perhaps twice in a week nevertheless he was forced to work as hard as could be this summer the dragging weight of a hopeless war as all except the stout farmers now were beginning to consider it had been tightening more and more the strain upon the veins of trade and the burden of the community this good boy lived in the side of a hill or of a cliff as some might call it white and beautiful to look at from a proper distance here he had one of those queer old holes which puzzle the sagest antiquary and set him in fiercest conflict with the even sager geologist but in spite of them all the hole was there and in that hole lived bonny without society what is life our tenderest and truest affections were not given us for naught the grandest of human desires is to have something or other to wallop and fate in small matters so hard upon bonny had known when to yield and had granted him this that is to say a donkey a donkey of such a clever kind and so set up with reasoning powers and a fine heart of his own that all his conclusions were almost right until they were beaten out of him his name was jack and his nature was of a level and sturdy order resenting wrongs accepting favours with all the teeth of gratitude and braying as all clever asses do at every change of weather his personal appearance also was noble striking and romantic and his face reminded all beholders of a wellcoloured pipebowl upside down for all his muzzle and nose were white as snowy white as if he always wore a nosebag newly floured from the nearest windmill but just below his eyes and across the mace of his jaws was a ring of brown and above that not a speck of white but deepening into cloudy blackness throughout all his system then like the crest of hector rose a menacing frontlet of thick hair and warlike ears as long as horns yet genially revolving and body and legs to complete the effect conceived in the very best taste to match these great virtues of the animal found their balance in small foibles a narrowminded selfseeking vein a too vindictive memory an obstinacy more than asinine no sense of honour and a habit of treating too many questions with the teeth or heels these had lowered him to his present rank as may be shown hereafter to any worked and troubled mind escaping into the country it would have been a treat to happen round some corner suddenly when the sun throws shadows long upon bonny and his jackass in the ripe time of the evening when the sun is at his kindest and the earth most thankful and the lines of every shadow now are well accustomed when the air has summer hope of never feeling frost again and every bush and tump and hillock quite knows how to stand and look when the creases of yellow grass and green grass by the roadside leave themselves for explanation till the rain shall settle it and the thick hedge in the calm air cannot rustle unless it holds a rabbit or a hare at playwhen all these things in their quiet way guide the shadowy lines of evening and the long lanes of farewell what can soothe the spirit more than the view of a boy on a donkey bonny therefore was in keeping with the world around him as he always contrived to be when he came home on jack that evening from a long days work at shoreham the lane was at its best almost with all the wild flowers that love the chalk mixed with those that hug the border where the chalk creams into loam among them bonny whistled merrily as his favourite custom was to let the pixies and the fairies ere he came under the gloom of the hill understand that he was coming and nobody else to frighten them soothed with the beauty of the scene and the majesty of the sunset jack drew back his ears and listened drowsily to his master britannia rule the waves was then the anthem of the nation and as she seemed to rule nothing else though fighting very grandly all patriotic britons found main comfort in commanding water the happiness of this boy and donkey was of that gleeful seesaw chancing which is the heartiest of all this has a snugness of its own which nothing but poverty can afford and luck rejoice to revel in as a rich man hugs his shivers when he has taken a sudden chill and huddles in over a roaring fire and boasts that he cannot warm himself so a poor fellow may cuddle his home and spread his legs as he pleases for the sake of its very want of comfort and the things it makes him think of all to be hoped for byandby and bonny was so destitute that he had all the world to hope for he lived in a hole in the scarp of chalk at the foot of the gully of coombe lorraine and many of his delightful doings might have been seen from the lofty windows if anyone ever had thought it worth while to slope a long telescope at him but nobody cared to look at bonny and scatter his lowly happinessthan which there is no more fugitive creature and none more shy of inspection being of a light and dauntless nature bonny kept whistling and singing his way over the grass and through the furze and in and out the dappled leafage of the summer evening while jack with his brightest blinkings picked the parts of the track that suited him the setting sun was in their eyes and made them wink every now and then and threw the shadow of long ears and walking legs and jogging heads here and there and anywhere also a very fine lump of something might in the shadows be loosely taken to hang across jack in his latter parts coming after bonnys legs and choice things stowed in front of them the meaning of this was that they had been making a very lucky longshore day at the mouth of the river adur and on their way home had received some pleasing tribute to their many merits in the town of steyning and down the road jack had no panniers for his master could not provide such luxuries but he had what answered as well or bettera long and trusty mealsack strongly stitched at the mouth and slit for inlet some way down the middle so that as it hung well balanced over his sturdy quarters anything might be popped in quickly and all the contents must abide together and churn up into fine tenderness as for bonny himself the shadows did him strong injustice such as he was wont to take from all the world and make light of the shadows showed him a ragged figure flapping and flickering here and there and random in his outlines but the true glow of the sunset full upon his face presented quite another bonny no more to be charged as a vagabond than the earth and the sun himself were but a little boy who loved his home such as it was and knew it and knew little else dirty perhaps just here and there after the long dry weatherbut if he had been ugly could he have brought home all that dripping to the little fellow himself as yet the question of costume was more important than that of comeliness and his dress afforded him many sources of pride and selfsatisfaction for his breeches were possessed of inexhaustible vitality as well as bold and original colour having been adapted for him by the wife of his great patron bottler the pigman from a pair of bottlers leggings made of his own pigskin the skin had belonged in the first place to a very remarkable boar a thorough calydonian hog who escaped from a farmyard and lived for months a wild life in st leonards forest here he scared all the neighbourhood until at last bottler was invoked to arise like meleager and to bring his pigknife bottler met him in single combat slew him before he had time to grunt and claiming him as the spoils of war pickled his hams at his leisure then he tanned the hide which was so thick that it never would do for cracklings and made himself leggings as everlasting as the fame of his exploit with these was bonny now endued over most of his nether moiety shoes and stockings he scorned of course but his little shanks were clean and red while his shoulders and chest were lost in the splendour of a coachmans crimson waistcoat at least they were generally so concealed when he set forth in the morning for he picked up plenty of pins and showed some genius in arranging them but after a hard days work as now air and light would always reassert their right of entrance still there remained enough of the mingled charm of blush and plush to recall in soft domestic bosoms bygone scenes for ever pastbut oh so sweet among the trays to judge him however without the fallacy of romantic tendernessthe breadth of his mouth and the turn of his nose might go a little way against him still he had such a manner of showing bright white teeth in a jocund grin and of making his frizzly hair stand up and his sharp blue eyes express amazement at the proper moment moreover his pair of cheeks was such after coming off the downs and his laugh so dreadfully infectious and he had such tales to tellthat several lofty butlers were persuaded to consider him even the butler of coombe lorrainebut that will come better hereafter only as yet may be fairly said that bonny looked up at the house on the hill with a delicate curiosity and felt that his overtures might have been somewhat ungraceful or at least illtimed when the new young footman just taken on took it entirely upon himself to kick him all the way down the hill this little discourtesy doubling of course master bonnys esteem and regard for the place at the same time introduced some constraint into his after intercourse for the moment indeed he took no measures to vindicate his honour although at a word as he knew quite well bottler the pigman would have brought up his whip and seen to it and even if any of the maids of the house had been told to tell miss alice about it bonny was sure of obtaining justice and pity and even halfacrown quick as he was to forget and forgive the many things done amiss to him the boy when he came to the mouth of the coombe looked pretty sharply about him for traces of that dreadful fellow who had proved himself such a footman with jack to help him with jaw and heel bonny would not have been so very much afraid of even him such a strongsiding champion had the donkey lately shown himself still on the whole and after such a long days work by sea and shore the rover was much relieved to find his little castle unleaguered the portal thereof was a yard in height and perhaps fifteen inches wide not all alike but in and out according to the way the things or the boy himself went rubbing it a holy hermit once had lived there if tradition spoke aright but if so he must have been as narrow of body to get in as wide of mind to stop there at any rate bonny was now the hermit and less of a saint than a sinner the last glance of sunset was being reflected under the eaves of twilight when these two came to their home and comfort in the bay of the quiet land from the foot of the steep white cliff the green sward spread itself with a gentle slope and breaks of roughness here and there until it met the depth of cornland where the feathering bloom appearedfor the summer was a hot onereared upon its jointed stalk and softened into a silvergrey by the level touch of evening the little powdered stars of wheat bloom could not now be seen of course neither the quivering of the awns nor that hovering radiance which in the hot day moves among them still the scent was on the air the delicate fragrance of the wheat only caught by waiting for it when the hour is genial bonny and jack were not in the humour now to wait for anything the scent of the wheat was nothing to them but the smell of a loaf was something and jack knew quite as well as bonny that let the time be as hard as it wouldand it was a very hard time already though nothing to what came afterwardnevertheless there were two white loaves charmed by their united powers out of maids who were under notice to quit their situations also on their homeward road they had not failed entirely of a few fine gristly hocks of pork and the bottom of a skin of lard and something unknown but highly interesting from a place where a pig had been killed that weeka shameful outrage to any pig in the time of hearted cabbages now jack tend theezell said bonny with the air of a fullgrown man almost while he was working his own little shoulders in betwixt the worn hair on the ribs and the balanced bag overhanging them jack knew what he was meant to do for he brought his white nose cleverly round just where it was wanted and pushed it under one end of the bag and tossed it carefully over his back so that it slid down beautifully when this great bag lay on the ground or rather stood up in a clumsy way by virtue of what was inside of it the first thing everybody did was to come and poke and sniff at it and though the everybody was no more than bonny and his donkey the duty was not badly done because they were both so hungry when the strings were cut and the bag in relief of tension panted ever so many things began to ooze and to ease themselves out of it first of all two great dollops of oarweed which had well performed their task of keeping everything tight and sweet with the hungry fragrance of the sea then came a mixture of almost anything which a boy of no daintiness was likely to regard as eatable or a child of no kind of culture to look upon as a rarity bonny was a collector of the grandest order the one who collects everything here was food of the land and food of the sea and food of the tidal river mingled with food for the mind of a boy who had no mindto his knowledge in the humblest way he groped about and admired almost everything now he had things to admire which in the heat of the day and the work had been caught and stowed away anyhow the boy and the donkey had earned their load with such true labour that now they could not remember even half of it jack by hard collarwork at the nets bonny by cheering him up the sand and tugging himself with his puny shoulders and then by dancing and treading away and kicking with naked feet among the wastrel fish full of thorns and tails shed from the vent of the dragnet by the spent farewell of the shoaling wave for on this very day there had been the great midsummer haul at shoreham it was the old custom of the place but even custom must follow the tides and the top of the summer springtides when the fish are always liveliest happened for the year to come on the th day of june bonny for weeks had been looking forward and now before him lay his reward after many sweet and bitter uses of adversity this boy at an early age had caught the tail of prudence it had been to his heart at first a friendly and a native thing to feast to the full when he got the chance and go empty away till it came again but now being grown to riper years and after much consideration declared to be at least twelve years old by the only porkbutcher in steyning bonny began to know what was what and to salt a good deal of his offal for this wise process he now could find a greater call than usual because through the heat of the day he had stuck to his first and firmlygrounded principlenever to refuse refuse so that many other fine things were mingled jumbled and almost churned among the sundry importations of the flowing tide and net all these now he well delivered so far as sappy limbs could do it upon a cleanish piece of ground well accustomed to such favours then bonny stood back with his hands on his knees and jack spread his nose at some of it loaves of genuine wheaten bread were getting scarce already three or four bad harvests following long arrears of discontent and hanging on the heavy arm of desperate taxation kept the country and the farmers and the people that must be fed in such a condition that we who cannot be now content with anything deserve no blame when we smack our lips in our dainty contempt of our grandfathers bonny was always good to jack according to the way they had of looking at one another and so of the choicest spoils he gave him a halfpeck loaf of a fibre such as they seldom softened their teeth with jack preferred this to any clover even when that luxury could be won by clever stealing and now he trotted away with his loaf to the nearest stump where backingpower against his strong jaws could be got here he laid his loaf against the stump and went a little way back to think about it and to be sure that every atom was for him then without scruple or time to spare he tucked up his lips and began in a hurry to make a bold dash for the heart of it more haste less speed is a proverb that seems at first sight one of the last that need be impressed upon a donkey yet in the present instance jack should have spared himself time to study it for in less than a moment he ran up to bonny with his wide mouth at its widest snorting with pain and much yearning to bellow but by the position disabled there was something stuck fast in the roof of his mouth in a groove of the veiny black arches and work as he might with his wounded tongue he was only driving it further in his great black eyes as he gasped with fright and the piteous whine of his quivering nose and his way altogether so scared poor bonny that the chances were he would run away and so no doubt he must have done being but a little boy as yet if it had not chanced that a flash of something caught his quick eye suddenly something richly shining in the cavern of the donkeys mouth this was enough of course for bonny his instinct of scratching and digging and hiding was up and at work in a moment he thrust his brown hand between jacks great jaws and drew it back quickly enough to escape the snap of their glad reunion and in his hand was something which he had drawn from the pouch of the net that day but scarcely stopped to look at twice in the huddle of weeds and the sweeping it had lain among many fine gifts of the seaskates and dogfish seadevils stingrays thornbacks inky cuttles and scollops cockles whelks green crabs jellyfish and everything else that makes fishermen swear and then grin and then spit on their palms again afterwards in bonnys sack it had lain with manifold boons of the lifegiving earth extracted from her motherly feeling by one or two good butchers bonny made no bones of this fish flesh fowl or stale redherringhe welcomed all the works of charity with a charitable nose and fingers not of the nicest so that his judgment could scarcely have been prejudicially affected by any preconceived opinionas our purest writers love to saywhen he dropped this thing and smelled his thumb and cried lord how it makes my hands itch after such a strong expression what can we have to say to him it is the privilege of our period to put under our feet whatever we would rather not face out at the same time to pretend to love it and lift it by education nevertheless one may try to doubt whether bonnys grandchildren if he ever presumed to have any thrive on the lesson as well as he did on the loaf of charity chapter xi chamber practice there used to be a row of buildings well within the sacred precincts of the inner temple but still preserving a fair lookout on the wharves and the tidal gut at their back till the whole view was swallowed by gasworks here for long ages law had flourished on the excrete things of outlawry fed by the reek of whitefriars as a good nettle enjoys the mixen already however some sweeping changes had much improved this neighbourhood and the low attorneys who throve on crime and of whom we get unpleasant glimpses through our classic novelists had been succeeded by men of repute and learning and large practice and among all these there was not one more widely known and respected than glanvil malahide kc an eminent equitybarrister who now declined to don the wig in any ordinary cause he had been obliged of course to fight like the rest of mankind for celebrity but as soon as this was well assured he quitted the noisier sides of it but his love of the subtleties of the law spun into fairer and frailer gossamer by the soft spider of equity as well as the power of habit kept him to his old profession so that he took to chamber practice and had more than he could manage sir roland lorraine had known this gentleman by repute at oxford when glanvil malahide was young and believed to be one of the best scholars there in the days when scholarship often ripened as it seldom does now to learning for the scholarship now must be kept quite young for the smaller needs of tuition hence it came to pass that as soon as hilary lorraine was quite acquit of oxford leadingstrings and had scrambled into some degree his father who especially wished for some reasons of his own to keep the boy out of the army entered him gladly among the pupils of mr glanvil malahide not that hilary was expected ever to wear the horsehair much unless an insane desire to do so should find its way into his open soul but that the excellent goodness of law might drop like the gentle dew from heaven and grow him into a justice of the peace hilary looked upon this matter as he did on too many others with a sweet indifference if he could only have had his own way he would have been a soldier long ago for that was the time when all the spirit of britain was roused up to arms but this young fellows great fault was to be compact of so many elements that nothing was settled amongst them he had great gifts as mr malahide saidextraordinary talents we say nowbut nobody knew least of all their owner how to work them properly this is one of the most unlucky compositions of the human mindto be applicable to everything but applied to nothing if hilary had lain under pressure and been squeezed into one direction he must have become a man of mark this his father could not see as a general rule a father fails to know what his son is fit for and after disappointment fancies for a little time at least himself a fool to have taken the boy to be all that the mother said of him nevertheless the poor mother knows how right she was and the world how wrong but hilary lorraine from childhood had no mother to help him what he had to help him was good birth good looks good abilities a very sweet temper and a kind and truly genial nature also a strongish will of his own whenever his heart was moving yet ashamed to stand forth boldly in the lesser matters and here was his fatal error that he looked upon almost everything as one of the lesser matters he had of course a host of friends from the freedom of his manner and sometimes he would do such things that the best or even the worst of them could no longer walk with him things not vicious but a great deal too far gone in the opposite waysuch as the snatching up of a truly naked child and caressing it or any other shameful act in the face of the noblest christendom these things he would do and worse such as no toady with selfrespect could smile at in broad daylight and such as often exposed the lad to laughter in good society one of his best friends used to say that hilary wanted a vice or two to make his virtues balance this may have been so but none the less he had his share of failings for a sample of these last he had taken up and made much of one of his fellowpupils in these wellconnected chambers this was one gregory lovejoy a youth entirely out of his element among fashionable sparks steadfast ambition of a conceptive mother sent him against his stars to london and here he became the whetstone for those brilliant blades his fellowpupils because he had been at no university nor even so much as a public school and had no introduction to anybody who had never heard of him now the more the rest disdained this fellow the more lorraine regarded him feeling with a sense too delicate to arise from any thought that shame was done to good birth even by becoming conscious of it except upon great occasions and so without giving much offence or pretending to be a champion hilary used to shield young lovejoy from the blunt shafts of small humour continually levelled at him mr malahides set of chambers was perhaps the best to be found in equity walk inner temple his pupilsten in number always because he would accept no more and his high repute insured no lessthese worthy youths had the longest room facing with three whiteybrown windows into numa square hence the view contemning all utilitarian edifices freely ranged across the gardens classic walks of asphodel to the broad lethean river on whose wharves we are such weeds for paper buildings named from some swift sequence of suggestion reared no lofty height as yet to mar the sedentary view all who have the local key will enter into the scene at once so far at least as necessary change has failed to operate but mr malahides pupils scarcely ever looked out of the windows none however should rashly blame them for apathy as to the prospect they seldom looked out of the windows because they were very seldom inside them in the first place their attendance there was voluntary and precarious they paid their money and they took their choice whether they ever did anything more each of them paidor his father for hima fee of a hundred guineas to have the run of the chambers and most of them carried out their purpose by a runaway from them the less they came the less trouble they caused to mr glanvil malahide who always gave them that much to know when they paid their fee of entrance if you mean to be a lawyer he said i will do my best to make you one if you only come for the name of it i shall say but little more to you this of course was fair enough and the utmost that could be expected of him for most of his pupils were young men of birth or good position in the english counties to whom in their future condition of life a little smattering of law or the credit of owning such smattering would be worth a few hundred guineas common law of course was far more likely to avail them in their rubs of the world than equity but of that fine drug they had generally taken their dose in pleaders chambers and were come to wash the taste away in the purer shallows of equity hilary therefore might be considered and certainly did consider himself a remarkably attentive pupil for he generally was to be found in chambers four or even five days of the week coming in time to read all the news before the five oclock dinner in hall whereas the honourable robert gumption and sir francis kickabout two of his fellowpupils had only been seen in chambers once since they paid their respective fees and the reason of their attendance then was that they found the towels too dirty to use at the billiardrooms in fleet street the clerks used to say among themselves that these young fellows must be dreadful fools to pay one hundred guineas because any swell with the proper cheek might easy enough have the go of the chambers and nobody none the wiser for they wouldnt know him nor the other young gents and least of all old horsewig however there chanced to be two or three men who made something more than a very expensive lounge of these eminent chambers of these worthy fellows rice cockles was one who had been senior wrangler two years before and from that time knew not one good nights rest till the woolsack broke his fall into his grave and another was gregory lovejoy cockles was thoroughly consciousas behoves a senior wranglerof possessing great abilities and lovejoy knew on his own behalf that his mother at least was as sure as could be of all the wonders he must do hilary could not bear rice cockles who was of a dry sarcastic vein but he liked young lovejoy more and more the more he had to defend him youths who have not had the fortune to be at a public school or a college seldom know how to hold their tongues until the world has silenced them gregory therefore thought no harm to boast opportunely one fine may morning when some one had seen a tree blossoming somewhere of the beauty of his fathers cherrytrees how noble and grand they must be just now one sheet of white white white he said as big as the inner and the middle temple and lincolns inn all put together and then how the bees were among them buzzing knowing which sorts first to milk and the tortoiseshell butterflies quite sure to be out for the first of their summering but in the moonlight best of all when the moon was three days short of full then was the time an unhappy londoner must be amazed with happiness then to walk among them was like walking in a fairyland or being lost in a sky of snow before a flake begins to fall a delicate soft world of white an inandout of fancy lace a feeling of some white witchery and almost a fright that little white blossoms have such power over one where may one find this grand paradise asked rice cockles as if he could scarcely refrain his feet from the road to it five miles the other side of sevenoaks gregory answered boldly i know the country does your father grow cherries for covent garden market of course he does didnt you know that thenceforth in chambers lovejoy was always known as cherry lovejoy and he proudly answered to that name it was now the end of june and the cherries must be getting ripe the day had been very hot and sultry and hilary came into chambers later than his usual time but fresh as a lark as he always was even mr malahide had felt the weight of the weather and of his own threescore years and five and in his own room was dozing the three clerks in their little den were fit for next to nothing except to be far away in some meadow with sleepy beer under aldertrees even rice cockles had struck work with one of those hopeless headaches which are bred by hot weather from satire a thing that turns sour above freezingpoint and no one was dwelling in the long hot room save the peaceful and steady gregory even he with his resolute will to fulfil his mothers prophecies could scarcely keep his mind from flagging or his mouth from yawning as he went through some most elaborate answer to a grand petition in equitythe iniquity being to a common mind that the question could have arisen but mr malahide of course regarded things professionally lovejoy thy name is love misery cried young lorraine who never called his fellowpupil cherry though perfectly welcome to do so i passed an opticians shop just now and the thermometer stands at that quill must have come from an ostrich to be able to move in such weather even the counsellor yields to the elements hark how he winds his sultry horn is it not a great and true writer who says i tell thee that the quills of the law are the deadliest shafts of the evil one come therefore and try a darting match gregory felt no inclination for so hot a pastime he had formed however a habit of yielding to the impulsive and popular hilary which led him into a few small scrapes and one or two that were not small lorraines unusual brightness of nature and personal beauty and gentle bearing as well as an inborn readiness to be pleased with everybody insured him a good liking with almost all kinds of people how then could young lovejoy of a fine but unshapen character and never introduced to the very skirts of good society help looking up to his champion hilary as a charming deity therefore he made way at once for hilarys sudden freak for darts the whole world being at war just then as happens upon the average in every generation cherry lovejoy slung his target a legal almanac for the year then he took four long quills and pared them of their plumes and split the shafts and fitted each with four paper wings cut and balanced cleverly his aptness in the business showed that this was not his first attempt and it was a hard and cruel thing that he should now have to prepare them but the clerks had a regular trick of stealing the young pups darts from their unlocked drawers partly for practice among themselves but mainly to please their families capital beautifully done cried hilary as full of life as if the only warmth of the neighbourhood were inside him we never turned out such a good lot before i could never do that like you but now for the tips my dear fellow any fool can do what i have done but no one can cut the tip at all to stick in the target and not bounce back only you mr lorraine mister lorraine now gregory lovejoy i thought we liked one another well enough to have dropped that long ago if you will only vouchsafe to notice you shall see how i cut the tip so that the wellsped javelin pierces even cover of calfskin it was done in a moment by some quick art inherited perhaps from prince agasicles and then they took their stations from the further end of the room they cast for thirty feet or more perhaps over two great tables scarred by keen generations of lawyers hilary threw the stronger shaft but gregory took more careful aim so that in spite of the stifling heat the contest grew exciting blest if they young donkeys knows hot from cold said the senior clerk disturbed in his little room by the prodding and walking and the lively voices sooner them than you nor me the second clerk muttered sleepily when the most ungrammatical english is wanted a copying clerk is the man to supply it in spite of unkindly criticism the brisk aconitic strife went on and every hit was chronicled on a long sheet of draft paper sixteen to you eighteen to me cried gregory poising his long shadowed spear while his coat and waistcoat lay in the folds of a suit that could never terminate and his square kentish face was even redder than a ripe mayduke at that moment the door was opened and in came mr malahide just so he said in his quiet way i now understand the origin of a noise which has often puzzled me lorraine what a baby you must be can a baby do that said hilary as he stepped into poor gregorys place and sped his dart into the chancellors eye the bullseye of their target that was well done mr malahide answered perhaps it is the only good shot you will ever make in your profession i hope not sir under your careful tuition i am laying the foundations of a mighty host of learning at this the lawyer was truly pleased he really did believe that he took some trouble with his pupils and his very kind heart was always gratified by their praises and he showed his pleasure in his usual way by harping on verbal niceties foundations of a host lorraine foundations of a pile you mean and as yet lusisti pilis but you may be a credit to me yet allowance must be made for this great heat i will talk to you tomorrow with these few words and a pleasant smile the eminent lawyer withdrew to his den feigning to have caught no glimpse of the deeplyblushing lovejoy for he knew quite well that gregory could not afford to play with his schooling and so like a proper gentleman he fell upon the one who could hilary saw his motive and with his usual speed admired him what a fine fellow he is he said as if in pure selfcommune from the time he becomes lord chancellor i will dart at no legal almanac but the present fellowhowever the weather is too hot to talk of him lovejoy wilt thou come with me i must break out into the country what cried gregory drawing up at the magic word from his stool of repentance and the desk of his diminished head what was that you said lorraine fair indeed is the thing thou hast said and fair is the way thou saidst it tush shall i never get wholly out of my ignorant knowledge of greek plays of languages that be or have been only two words survive this weather in the streets of london town one is rus and the other country it is a sweet and decorous thing to die on behalf of the country that line i remember well you must have seen it somewhere it is one of my earliest memories and not a purely happy one but that is patria not rus patria is the fatherland rus is a fellows mother none can understand this parable till they have lived in london lorraine said gregory coming up shyly yet with his brown eyes sparkling and a steadfast mouth to declare himself you are very much above me of course i know i am uncommonly proud to hear it hilary answered with his most sweet smile because i must be a much finer fellow than i ever could have dreamed of being now you know well enough what i mean i mean in position of life and all that and birth and societyand so on to be sure said hilary gravely making a trumpet of blotting paper any other advantage gregory fifty if i could stop to tell them but i see that you mean to argue it now argument is a thing that always now gregory just acknowledge me your superior in argument and i will confess myself your superior in every one of those other things well you know lorraine i could scarcely do that because it was only the very last time exactly said hilary so it wasthe very last time you left me no more than a shadow caught in a cleft stick therefore friend gregory say your say without any traps for the sole of my foot well what i was thinking was no more than thisif you would take it into consideration nowconsidering what the weather is and all the great people gone out of london and the streets like fire almost and the lawyers frightened by the comet quite as if as if almost as if it were the devil come for them exactly so bellows clerk told me after he saw the comet that he could prove he had never been articled and when you come to consider also that there will be a row tomorrow morningnot much of course but still a thing to be avoided till the weather coolsi thought at least i began to think my dear fellow what anxiety in this dreadful weather is fever nothing nothing at all lorraine but you are the sweetesttempered fellow i ever came across and so i thought that you would not mindat least not so very much perhaps my sweet temper is worn out i have no mind to mind anything gregory come and dine with me that is how you stop me always lorraine i cannot be for ever coming and come to dine with you i always like it but you know to be sure i know that i like it too it is high time to see about it who could dine in hall today and drink his bottle of redhot port i could and so could a hundred others and i mean to do it unless unless what mysterious gregory by your face i know that you have some very fine thing to propose have you the heart to keep me suspended as well as uncommonly hungry it is nothing to make a fuss about lorraine you want to get out of town for a little wholesome air i want to do the same and something came into my head quite casually such things have an inspiration out with it at last fair gregory well then if you must have it how i should like for you to come with me to have a little turn among my fathers cherrytrees what a noble thought said hilary a poetic imagination only could have hit on such a thought the thermometer at and the cherriescan they be sour now such a thing is quite impossible gregory answered gravely in a very cold wet summer they are sometimes a little middling but in such a splendid year as this there can be no two opinions would you like to see them now lovejoy i can put up with much but not with maddening questions you mean i suppose that you could enjoy halfadozen cool red cherries if you had the chance to pick them in among the long green leaves halfadozen halfapeck and halfabushel afterwards where have i put my hat i am off if it costs my surviving sixpence lorraine all the coaches are gone for the day but you are always in such a hurry you ought to think a little perhaps before you make up your mind to come remember that my fathers house is a good house and as comfortable as any you could wish to see still it may be different from what you are accustomed to such things are not worth thinking about custom and all that are quite below contempt and we are beginning to treat it so the greatest mistake of our lives is custom and the greatest delight is to kick it away will your father be glad to see me he has heard me talk of you many a time and he would have been glad to come to london though he hates it so abominably to see you and to ask you down if he thought that you would require it it is a very oldfashioned place you must please to bear that in mind also my father and my mother and all of us are oldfashioned people living in a quiet way you would carry on more in an hour than we do in a twelvemonth we like to go all over things ever so many times perhaps like pushing rings up and down a stick before we begin to settle them but when we have settled them we never start again as you seem to do now gregory gregory this is bad when did you know me to start again ready i am to start this once and to dwell in the orchards for ever in a few words more these two young fellows agreed to take their luck of it there was nothing in chambers for lovejoy to lose by going away for a day or two and hilary long had felt uneasy at leaving a holiday overdue therefore they made their minds up promptly for an early start next morning ere the drowsy town should begin to kick up its chimneypots like a sluggards toes gregory said lorraine at last your mind is a garden of genius we two will sit upon bushelbaskets and watch the sun rise out of sacks before he sets we will challenge him to face our early waggon covent garden is our trysting spot and the hour am oh day to be marked with white chalk for ever i am sure i cant tell how that may be answered the less fervent gregory there is no chalk in our grounds at all and i never saw black chalk anywhere but can i trust you to be there if you dont come i shall not go without you and the whole affair must be put off no fear gregory no fear of me the lark shall still be on her nestbut wait my friend i will tell the counsellor lest i seem to dread his face lovejoy saw that this was the bounden duty of a gentleman inasmuch as the learned lawyer had promised his young friend a little remonstrance upon the following morning the chances were that he would forget it and this of course enhanced the duty of making him remember it therefore hilary gave three taps on the wormeaten door of his good tutor according to the scale of precedence this rule wasinferior clerk one tap headclerk two taps pupil being no clerk at all and paying not drawing salary as many taps as he might think proper in a reasonable way hilary of course began as he always managed to begin with almost everybody i am sorry to disturb you sir and i have nothing particular to say in that case why did you come lorraine it is your usual state of mind well sir said hilary laughing at the terse mood of the master i thought you had something to say to mea very unusual state of mind he was going to say on your part but stopped with a wellbred youths perception of the unbecoming yes i have something to say to you i remember it now quite clearly you were playing some childish game with lovejoy in the pupils room now this is all well enough for you who are fit for nothing else perhaps your father expects no work from you and if he did he would never get it you may do very well in your careless way being born to the gift of indifference but those who can and must work hardis it honest of you to entice them you think that i speak severely perhaps i do because i feel that i am speaking to a gentleman it is uncommonly hard said hilary with his bright blue eyes half conscious of a shameful spring of moisture that a fellow always gets it worse for trying to be a gentleman you have touched a great truth mr malahide answered labouring heavily not to smile but so it always must be my boy i am sorry to vex you but to be vexed is better than to grieve you like young lovejoydont make him idle sir i will dart at him henceforth whenever i see him lazy instead of the late lord chancellor now sitting upon asphodel lorraine the great lawyer suddenly asked in a flush of unusual interest you have been at oxford quite recently they do all sorts of things there now have they settled what asphodel is no sir i fear that they never will there are several other moot questions still but with your kind leave i mean to try to settle that point tomorrow chapter xii with the costermongers martin lovejoy gregorys father owned and worked a pleasant farm in that part of kent which the natives love to call the garden of eden in the valley of the upper medway a few miles above maidstone pretty hamlets follow the soft winding of the river here an ancient race of settlers quiet and intelligent chose their home and chose it well and love it as dearly as ever to argue with such people is to fall below their mercy they stand at their cottagedoors serenely as thirty generations of them have stood a riotous storm or two may have swept them but it never lasted long the bowers of hop and of honeysuckle trimmed alleys and rambling roses the flowering trees by the side of the road and the truest of true green meadows the wealth of deep orchards retiring awayas all wealth doesto enjoy itself and where the land condescends to wheat the vast gratitude of the wheatcropnobody wonders after a while that these men know their value the early sun was up and slurring light upon london housetops as a task of duty only having lost all interest in a thing even he can make no hand of but the brisk air of the morning after such a night of sweltering and of strong smells under slates rode in the perpetual balance of the clime and spread itself fresh cool draughts of newborn day as vague as the smile of an infant roved about yet were to be caught according to the dewlines and of these the best and truest followed into covent garden under the force of attraction towards the green stuff they had dwelt among here was a wondrous reek of men before the night had spent itself such a babel of a marketmorning in the berryseason as makes one long to understand the mothertongue of nobody many things are nice and handsome fruit and flowers are fair and fresh life is as swift as life can be and the pulse of price throbs everywhere yet upon the whole it is wiser not to say much more of it martin lovejoy scarcely ever ventured into this stormy world in summer and autumn he was obliged to send some of his fruit to london but he always sent it under the care of a trusty old retainer master john shorne whose crusty temper and crisp wit were a puzzle to the cockney costermonger throughout the market this man was known familiarly as kentish crust and the name helped him well in his business now in the summer morning early hilary lorraine with his most sprightly walk and manner sought his way through the crowded alleys and the swarms of those that buy and sell even the roughest of rough customers when both demand and supply are rough though they would not yield him way at any rate did not shove him by a swell to buy fruit for his sweetheart was their conclusion in half a glance at him here sir here you are berries for nothing and cherries we pays you for eating of them with the help of these generous fellows hilary found his way to john shorne and the waggon the horses in unbuckled ease were munching their wellearned corn close by for at that time covent garden was not squeezed and driven as now it is the tailboard of the waggon was now hanging upon its hinges and kentish crust on his springy rostrum dealt with the fagend of his goods the market in those days was not flooded with poor foreign produce fair to the eye but a fraud on the belly and full of most dangerous colic englishmen at that time did not spend their keenest wits upon the newest and speediest measures for robbing their brother englishmen and a native would really buy from his neighbour as gladly as from his born enemy master john shorne had a canvas bag on the right side of his breeches hanging outside full in sight defying every cutpurse that age was comparatively honest nevertheless john kept a club cut in mereworth wood quite handy and at every sale he made he rang his coin of the realm in his bag as if he were calling bees all round the waggon this generally led to another sale for money has a rich and irresistible joy in jingling hilary was delighted to watch these things so entirely new to him he had that fatal gift of sliding into other peoples minds and wondering what to do there not as a great poet has it still reserving his own strength and playing on the smaller nature kindly as he loves it but simply as a child rejoices to play with other children so that he entered eagerly into the sudden changes of johns temper according to the tone the bidding and most of all the importance of the customers that came to him by this time the cherries were all sold out having left no trace except some red splashes where an overripe sieve had been bleeding but the kentish man still had some bushels of peas and new potatoes and bunches of coleworts and early carrots besides five or six dozens of creamy cauliflowers and several scores of finehearted lettuce therefore he was dancing with great excitement up and down his van for he could not bear to go home uncleared and some of his shrewder customers saw that by waiting a little longer they would be likely to get things at halfprice of course he was fully alive to this and had done his best to hide surplus stock by means of sacks and mats and empty bushels piled upon full ones crusty thou must come down old fellow cried a oneeyed costermonger winking first at john and then through the rails and even at the springs of the van half the load will go back to kent or else to the cowkeeper if so be you holds on so almighty dear ha then joe are you waiting for that go to the cowyard and take your turn they always feeds the oneeyed first gentlemen nowwhile theres anything left weve kept all the very best back to the last cos they chanced to be packed by an irishman first goes in must first come out paddy are you there to stick to it be jabers and how could i slip out when the hape of you was atop of me and right i was be the holy poker there it all is the very first in the bottom of the vhan now are you nearly ready john asked gregory suddenly appearing through the laughter of the crowd here is the gentleman going with us and i cant have him kept waiting come up master greg and help sell out if you know the time better than i do john shorne was vexed or he would not so have spoken to his masters son to his great surprise with a bound up came not gregory lovejoy who was always a little bit shy of the marketing but hilary lorraine declared by dress and manner clearly marked as now they never can be of an order wholly different from the people round him let me help you sir he said i have long been looking on i am sure that i understand it forty years have i been at un and i scarcely knows un now they takes a deal of mannerin sir and the prices will go in and out no doubt and yet for the sport of it let me help you master shorne i will not sell a leaf below the price you whisper to me in such height of life and hurry half a minute is enough to fetch a great crowd anywhere it was round the market in ten seconds that a grand lord was going to sell out of grower lovejoys waggon for a great wager of course it must be and all who could rush rushed to see hilary let them get ready and waited till he saw that their money was burning meanwhile crusty john was grinning one of his most experienced grins dont let him oh dont let him gregory shouted to the salesman as hilary came to the rostrum with a bunch of carrots in one hand and a cauliflower in the otherwhat would his friends say if they heard it nay ill not let un john shorne answered mischievously taking the verb in its now provincial sense why should i let un it cant hurt he and it may do good to we in less than ten minutes the van was cleared and at such prices as grower lovejoys goods had not fetched all through the summer such competition arose for the honour of purchasing from a nobleman and so enchanted were the dealers ladies many of whom came thronging round with hilarys bright complexion gay address and complaisancy well done my lord well done indeed crusty john to keep up the fiction shouted when he had pouched the moneygentlemen and ladies my lord will sell again next week he has a heavy bet about it with the prince regtush what a fool i am they will send me to prison if i tell as a general rule the more suspicious people are in some ways the more credulous are they in all the rest kentish crust was aware of this and expected and found for the next two months extraordinary inquiry for his goods friend gregory wherefore art thou glum said hilary to young lovejoy while the horses with their bunchedup tails were being buckled to again lorraine was radiant with joy both at his recent triumph in a matter quite unknown to him and even more because of many little pictures spread before him by his brisk imagination far away from london every stamp of a horses hoof was as good as a beat of the heart to him lorraine the sensible gregory answered after some hesitation i am vexed at the foolish thing you have done not that it really is at all a disgrace to you or your family but that the world would take it so and we must think as the world does must we asked hilary smiling kindly well if we must let us think it on springs at the word he leaped into the fruitvan so lightly that the strong springs scarcely shook and gregory could do no better than climb in calmly after him geewugg cried master shorne and he had no need to say it twice the bright brass harness flashed the sun and the horses merrily rang their hoofs on the road to their native land of kent chapter xiii to the cherryorchards hilary lorraine enjoyed his sudden delivery from london and the fresh delight of the dewy country with such loud approval and such noisy lightsomeness of heart that even crusty john perched high on the drivingbox above him could not help looking back now and then into the van and affording the horses the benefit of his opinion a right down hearty one he be asll make some of our maids look alive and the worst time of year for such work too when the maydukes is in and the hearts a colouring hilary was sitting on an empty half sieve mounted on an empty bushel and with his usual affability enjoying the converse of paddy from cork as everybody called the old irishman who served alike for farm road or market as the lad of all work but gregory lovejoy being of a somewhat grave and silent order was already beginning to doubt his own prudence in bringing their impulsive friend so near to a certain fair cousin of his now staying at the hospitable farm in whom he felt a tender interest poor lovejoy feared that his chance would be small against this dashing stranger and he balanced uncomfortably in his mind whether or not he should drop a hint at the first opportunity to lorraine concerning his views in that quarter often he almost resolved to do so and then to his diffidence it seemed presumptuous to fancy that any young fellow of hilarys birth and expectations would entangle himself in their rustic world at bromley they pulled up to bait man and beast three fine horses and four good men eager to know the reason why they should not have their breakfast lorraine although very short of cash as he always found the means to be demanded and stood out for leave to pay for everybody this privilege was obtained at lastas it generally is by persistencyand after that it was felt that hilary could no longer be denied his manifest right to drive the van he had driven the brighton fourhorse coach the whole way to london times and again and it was perfectly absurd to suppose that he could not manage three horses master john shorne yielded his seat apparently to this reasoning but really to his own sure knowledge that the horses after so long a journey would be on their way to stall as quiet as lambs in the evening therefore he rolled himself up in the van and slept the sleep of the man who has been up and wideawake all night for the sake of other people the horses well knew the true way home and offered no cause for bit or whip and they seemed to be taken sometimes with the pleasure which hilary found in addressing them they lifted their tails and they pricked their ears at the proper occasions genially till the heat of the day settled down on their backs and their creases grew dark and then lathery and the horsefly which generally forbears the pleasure of nuisance till july in this unusually hot summer was earnest in his vocation already therefore being of a leisurely mind as behoves all genuine sons of the soil master shorne called a halt through the blazing time of noon before battling with the backbone of kent as the beautiful north down range is called here in a secluded glen they shunned the heats of canicula under the sign of the pig and whistle thus the afternoon was wearing when they came to sevenoaks and passing through that pleasant town descended into the weald of kent no one but hilary cared for the wonderful beauty and richness of the view breadth upon breadth of fruitland woven in and out with hops and corn and towards the windings of the medway pastures of the deepest green even now after the heat of the sun and thirst of the comet that drank the dew turning on the left from the tunbridge road they threaded their way along narrow lanes where the hedges no longer were scarred with chalk but tapestried with all shades of green and even in the broken places rich with little cascades of loam careless dogrose played above them with its loose abandonment and honeysuckle was almost ready to release its clustered tongues but travellers joythe joy that makes all travellers long to rest in kentabode as yet in the hopeful bud a pendent shower of emerald these things were not heeded much but pleasantly accepted by the four men and three horses all felt alike that the world was made for them and for them to enjoy themselves and little they cared to go into the reason when they had the room for it with this large sense of what ought to be they came to the gate of old applewood farm a great white gate with a padlock on it this stopped the road and was meant to do so for martin lovejoy gregorys father claimed the soil of the road from this point and denied all right of way public or even private to all claimants of whatsoever kind on the other hand the parish claimed it as a public thoroughfare and two farmers further on vowed that it was an occupation road and what was more they would use it as such grower lovejoy as the neighbourhood called himnot that he was likely to grow much more but because of his cherryorchardshere was the proper man to hold the gate against all his enemies when they sawed it down he very promptly replaced it with cast iron and when this was shattered with a foldpitcher he stopped their premature triumph by a massive barrier of wrought metal casehardened against rasp or cold chisel moreover he painted it white so that any nocturnal attack might be detected at a greater distance when paddy had opened this gate with a key which he had carried to london they passed through an orchard of mayduke cherries with the ripe fruit hanging quite over the road no wonder you lock the gate said lorraine as crusty john now on the box again handed him a noble cluster with the dark juice mantling richly under the ruddy gloss of skin do you mean that we should get them stolen gregory asked with some indignation for his kentish pride was touched oh no we should never get them stolen nobody about here would do such a thing then they dont know whats good answered hilary jumping at another cluster i was born to teach the kentish public the proper way to steal cherries well they do take them sometimes the truthful gregory confessed but we never call it stealing any more than we do what the birds take valued fellowstudent thy strong point will not be the criminal law but you must have a criminal love of the law to jump at it out of these cherrytrees it was my mothers work as you know ah there she is and my cousin phyllis for the moment lovejoy forgot his duty to his friend and particular guest and slipping down from the tail of the van made off at full speed through the cherrytrees hilary scarcely knew what to do the last thing that ever occurred to him was that any one had been rude to him still it was rather unpleasant to drive or be driven up to the door of his host sitting upon a bushel basket and with no one to say who he was yet to jump out and run after gregory and collar him while he saluted his mother was even a worse alternative in a very few moments that chance was gone for the team with the scent of their corn so nigh broke into a merry canter and rattled along with their ears pricked forward and a pleasant jingling neither did they stop until they turned into a large farmyard with an oasthouse at the further end of it the dwellinghouse was of the oldest fashion thatched in the middle at each end gabled tiled in some places and at some parts slabbed yet on the whole it looked snug dry and happy here with one accord halted the nags and shook themselves in their harness and answered the neighs of their friends in the stables hilary laughing at his own plight but feeling uncommonly stiff in the knees arose from his basket and looked around and almost the first thing that met his gaze destroyed all his usual presence of mind this was a glance of deep surprise mingled with timid inquiry and doubt from what master hilary felt at once to be the loveliest sweetest and most expressive brown eyes in the universe the young girl blushed as she turned away through fear of having shown curiosity but the rich tint of her cheeks was faint compared with the colour of poor lorraines that gay youth was taken aback so utterly by the flash of a moment that he could not find a word to say but made pretence in a wholesale manner to see nothing at all particular but the warm blood from his heart belied him which he turned away to hide and worked among the baskets briskly hoping to be looked at and preparing to have another look as soon as he felt that it could be done meanwhile that formidable creature whose glance had produced such a fine effect recovered more promptly from surprise and felt perhaps the natural pride of success and desire to pursue the fugitive at any rate she was quite ready to hear whatever he might have to say for himself i must ask you to forgive me lorraine began in a nervous manner lifting his hat and still blushing freely for springing so suddenly out of the earthor rather out of this van i mean though that cant be right for i still am in it i believe that i have the pleasure of speaking to miss phyllis catherow your cousin mr lovejoy is a very great friend of mine indeed and he most kindly asked or rather what i mean to say is invited me to come down for a day or two to this delightful part of the world and i have enjoyed it so much already that i am surethatthat in fact that i hope you may soon enjoy it more she did not in the least mean any sarcasm or allusion to hilarys present state still he fancied that she did until the kind look coming so sweetly from the kind warm heart convinced him that she never could be so cruel i see the most delightful prospect i ever could imagine of enjoying myself lorraine replied with a glance imparting to his harmless words the mischief of that which nowadays we call a most unwarrantable personal allusion but she did not or would not take it so how kind of you to be pleased so lightly but we do our best in our simple way when any one kindly comes to see us why miss catherow i thought from what your cousin said to me that you were only staying here for a little time yourself you are quite right as to miss catherow but i am not my cousin phyllis i am only mabel lovejoy gregory lovejoys sister by jove how glad i am cried hilary in his impetuous way what a fool i must have been not to know it after i saw him run to meet his cousin in the orchard but that treacherous gregory never told me that he even had a sister now wont i thoroughly give it to him you must not be angry mr lorraine with poor gregory becausebecause phyllis is such a beautiful girl dont let me hear about beautiful girls as ifas if there could be any good enough for gregory she answered coming cleverly to his rescue for he knew that he had gone too far but wait till you have seen cousin phyllis there is one thing i shall not defer for the glory of seeing a thousand miss catherows and that is the right that i have to shake hands with my dear friend gregorys sister he had leaped from the van some time ago and now held out his hand a good strong one pleasingly veined with cherryjuice and she with hospitable readiness laid her pretty palm therein he felt that it was a pretty hand and a soft one and a hearty one and he found excuse to hold it longer while he asked a question now how did you know my name if you please while i made such a stupid mistake about yours by your bright blue eyes she was going to answer with her native truthfulness but the gaze of those eyes suggested that the downright truth might be dangerous therefore for once she met a question with a question warily was it likely that i should not know you after all i have heard of you this pleased him well in a general way for hilary though too free if possible from conceit and arrogance had his own little share of vanity therefore upon the whole it was lucky and showed due attention to his business that grower lovejoy now came up to know what was doing about the van martin lovejoy was not a squatter by seven years stamped into tenant right which means very often landlords wrong nor was he one of those great tenant farmers who even then were beginning to rise and hold their own with landed gentry his farm was small when compared with some but it was outright his own having descended to him through longburied generations so that he was one of the everdwindling class of franklins a class that has done good work for england neither obtaining nor craving thanks old applewood farm contained altogether about six hundred acres whereof at least twothirds lay sweetly in the vale of medway and could show root stem or bine against any other land in kent and therefore any in england here was no fear of the heat of the sun or the furious winters rages such a depth of nature underlay the roots of everything nothing ever suffered from that poverty of blood which makes trees canker on a shallow soil and no tree rushed into watery strength which very soon turns to weakness through having laid hold upon something that suited only a particular part of it and not the trees alone but all things grew within that proper usage of a regulated power yet with more of strength to come up if it should be called for which has made our land and country fertile over all the world receiving submissively the manners and the manure of all nations this is a thing to be proud of but the opportunity for such pride was not open to the british mind at the poor old time now dealt with martin lovejoy knew no more than that the rest of europe was amassed against our island and if england meant to be england every son of that old country must either fight himself or pay martin would rather have fought than paid if he had only happened to be a score and a half years younger hilary lorraine knew well when martin lovejoy took his hand and welcomed him to old applewood that here was a man to be relied on to make good his words and mind a man of moderate stature but of sturdy frame and some dignity ready to meet everybody pretty much as he was met glad to see you sir he said i have often heard of you master lorraine it is right kind of you to come down i hope that you are really hungry sir to the last degree answered hilary i have been eating off and on but nothing at all to speak of in the noble air i have travelled through our air has suited you i see by the colour of your cheeks and eyes aha the difference begins as i have seen some scores of times at ten miles out of london and we are nearly thirty here sir from that miserable place excuse me master lorraine i hope i say nothing to offend you my dear sir how can you offend me i hate london heartily there must be a million people there a great deal too good to live in it we are counting everybody this year and i hear that when it is made up there will be a million and a quarter i cant believe it i cant believe it there never was such a deal before and how can there want to be so many now this numbering of the people is an unholy thing that leads to plagues all the parsons around here say that this has brought the comet and they may show something for it and they preach of jerusalem when it was going to be destroyed they have frightened all our young maids terribly what is said in london sir scarcely anything mr lovejoy scarcely anything at all we only see him every now and then because of the smoke between us and when we see him we have always got our own work to attend to wonderful wonderful answered the grower who can make out them londoners about their business they would go if korah dathan and abiram were all swallowed up in front of them for that i like them i like a manbut come in to our little supper sir chapter xiv beauties of the country the next day was sunday and hilary having brought a small bag of clothes with him spent a good deal of the early time in attending to his adornment for this he had many good reasons to give if only he had thought about them but the only selfexamination that occurred to him was at the lookingglass here he beheld himself looking clean and bright as he always did look and yet he was not quite satisfied as he ought to have been with his countenance there is room for a lot of improvement he exclaimed at himself quite bitterly how coarse and how low i begin to look but there is not a line in her face that could be changed without spoiling it there again hairs hairs coming almost everywhere beautiful girls have none of that stuff how they must despise us all their hair is ornamental and ours comes so disgracefully when he had no one else to talk to hilary always talked to himself he always believed that he knew himself better than anybody else could know him and so he had a right to do and so he must have done just now if doubtful watch of himself and great shaking of his head could help him at last he began to be fit to go down according to his own ideas though not at all sure that he might not have managed to touch himself up just a little bit morewhich might make all the difference he thought that he looked pretty well but still he would have liked to ask gregory before it was too late to make any change and the beautiful eyes fell upon him but gregory and all the rest were waiting for him in the breakfastroom and no one allowed him to suspect how much he had tried their patience young lovejoy showed a great deal of skill in keeping lorraine to the other side of the table from phyllis catherow and hilary was well content to sit at the side of mabel phyllis in his opinion was a beautiful girl enough and clever in her way and lively but lovely was the only word to be used at all about mabel and she asked him to have just a spoonful of honey and to share a pat of butter with her in such a voice and with such a look that if she had said here are two ounces of colddrawn castor oilif you take one ill take the other he must have opened his mouth for it so they went on and neither knew the deadly sin they were dropping tothat deadly sin of loving when the level and entire landscape of two lives are different through the rich fields and across a pretty little wandering brook which had no right to make a quarter of the noise it was making this snug party went to church accurate knowledge of what to do as well as very pretty manners and a sound resolve to be overnice rather than incur the possibility of pushing led the two young men from london rather to underdo the stiles and almost go quite away than to express their feelings by hands whenever the topbar made a tangle according to the usual knot of it the two girls entered into this and said to themselves what a very superior thing it was to have young men from london in comparison with young hopgrowers who stood here and there across them and made them so blush for each inch of their legs what made it all the more delicate and ever so much more delightful was that the excellent grower was out of the way and so was mrs lovejoy for the latter being a most kindhearted woman had rheumatic pains at the first churchbell all up the leaders of her back so that the stiles were too many for her and master lovejoy was compelled to drive her in the onehorse shay by the time these staid young men and maidens came to the little churchyard gate everything was settled between them as if by deed under hand and seal although not so much as a wave of the air much less any positive whisper of the wind had stirred therein the import of this unspoken and even undreamed covenant was that gregory now must walk with phyllis and see to her and look at her without her having any second thoughts concerning hilary hilary on the other hand was to be acknowledged as the cavalier of mabel to help her when she wanted helping and to talk when she wanted talking although it might be assumed quite fairly that she could do most of that for herself feeling the strength of good management all of them marched into church accordingly in the very same manner they all marched out after behaving uncommonly well and scarcely looking at one another when the clergyman gave out that the heat of the weather had not allowed him to write a new discourse that week but as the same cause must have made them forgetful of what he had said last sunday when many of them seemed inattentive he now proposed with the divine assistance to read the same sermon again to them with the unconverted youthful mind a spring like that of jackoutofthebox at the outer door of the church jumps up after being so long inside into that liberal goodwill which is one of our noblest sentiments anybody is glad to see almost everybody and people though of one parish in great joy forego their jangling the sense of a grand relief and a conscience wiped clean for another week leads the whole lot to love one another as far as the gate of the churchyard but our young people were much inclined to love one another much further the more they got into the meadowland and the strength of the summer around them with the sharp stroke of the sun and the brisk short shadows of one another the more they were treading a dangerous path and melting away to each other hilary saw with romantic pride that mabel went on as well as ever and had not a bead on her clear bright cheeks while at the same time phyllis though stopping to rest every now and thenbut hilary never should have noticed this such things are below contempt in this old and genial house the law was that the guest should appoint the time for dinner whenever the cares of the outer work permitted it and as there were no such cares on sunday hilary had to choose the time for the greatest event of the human day this had been talked of and settled of course before anybody got the prayerbooks and now the result at two oclock was a highly excellent repast to escape the power of the sun they observed this festival in the hall of the house which was deliciously cool even now being paved with stone and shaded by a noble and fragrant walnuttree mrs lovejoy knew what many even good housekeepers seem not to knowto wit that to keep a room cool it is not necessary to open the windows when the meridian sun bombards for goodness sake let us have some air in such weather as this they cry when they might as well say let us cool the kitchen by opening the door of the oven lorraine was one of those clever fellows who make the best of everything which is the cleverest thing that can be done by a human being and he was not yet come to the time of life when nothing is good if the dinner is bad so that he sat down cheerily and cheered all the rest by doing so of course there were many things said and done which never would have been said or thought of at the dinnertable of coombe lorraine but hilary though of a very sensitive fibre in such matters neither saw nor heard nor felt a single thing that irked him there was nothing low about anybody whereas there was something as high as the heavens ambrosially busy with the very next plate he made himself to the very utmost of his power agreeable except at the moments when his power of pleasing quite outran himself then he would stop and look at his forkone of the fine old twopronged fellowsand almost be afraid to glance to ask what she was thinking she was thinking the very things that she should have known so much better than to think but what harm could there possibly be in scarcely thinking so much as dreaming things that could have nothing in them who was she a countrygirl to set herself up and behave herself as if anybody meant anything and yet his eyes and the bend of his head and his choice of that kidneypotato for her as if he were born a growerand then the way he poured her beerif there was nothing in all this why then there was nothing in all the world save empty delusion and breaking of heart hilary sitting at her knifehand felt a whole course of the like emotions making allowance for gender how beautifully she played her knife with a feminine tenderness not to make a cruel slice of anything and how round her little wrist was popping in and out of sleeves according as the elbow went and no knob anywhere to be seen such as women even of the very latest fashion have and then her hair was coming towards him when she got a bit of gristle so that he could take a handful if the other people only would have the manners not to look and oh what lovely hair it was so silky and so rich and bright and full of merry dances to the music of her laugh and he did not think he had ever seen anything better than her style of eating without showing it clearly enjoying her bit of food and tempting all to feed their best yet full of mind at every mouthful and of heart at every help but above all when she looked up quite forgetting both knife and fork and looked as if she could look like that into no other eyes but his with such a gentle flutter and a timid wish to tell no more and yet a sudden pulse of glad light from the innocent young heartnothing could be lovelier than the way in which she raised her eyes except her way of dropping them these precious glances grew more rare and brief the more he sought for them and he wondered whether anybody else ever could have been treated so then when he would seem to be doubtful and too much inclined to stop a look of surprise or a turn of the head would tempt him to go on again and there would be little moments both on his side and on hers of looking about at other people with a stealthy richness with a sense of some great treasure made between them and belonging to themselves in private a proud demand that the rest of the world should attend to its proper business and then with one accord a meeting of the eyes that were beginning more and more to mean alike all this was as nice as could be and a pretty thing to see still in a world that always leaves its loftiest principles to accumulate at the lowest interest and once in every generation to be a mere drug in the market love is used not in games alone as the briefest form of nothing all our lovers bred as lovers must be under school boards know what they are after now and who can pay the ninepence but in the ancient time the mothers had to see to most of that mrs lovejoy though she did not speak or look particularly had her own opinion as to what was going on close by and she said to herself i will see to this it is no good interfering now i shall have miss mabel all to myself in threequarters of an hour chapter xv oh ruddier than the cherry mrs lovejoys lecture to her daughter seemed likely to come just a little too late as so many excellent lessons do for as soon as he saw that all had dined the host proposed an adjournment which was welcomed with no small delight by all except the hostess now master lorraine and my niece phyllis what say you if we gather our fruit for ourselves in the shady places or rather if we sit on the bank of the little brook in the orchard where there is a nice sheltered spot and there we can have a glass of wine while the maidens pick the fruit for us capital answered hilary what a fine idea mr lovejoy but surely we ought to pick for the ladies instead of letting them pick for us no sir we will let them have the pleasure of waiting upon us it is the rule of this neighbourhood and ought to be observed everywhere we work for the ladies all the week serve honour and obey them on sundays they do the like for us and it is a very pleasant change mabel dont forget the pipes do you smoke master lorraine if so my daughter will fill a pipe for you that would be enough to tempt me even if i disliked it whereas i am very fond of it however i never do smoke because my father has a most inveterate prejudice against it i promised him some time ago to give it up for a twelvemonth and the beauty of it is that there is nothing he himself enjoys so much as a good pinch of snuff ah there i am getting my revenge upon him my sister will do anything i ask her and he will do anything she asks him and so without his knowledge i am breaking him of his snuffbox aha well done i like that and i like you too young man for your obedience to your father that virtue is becoming very rare rarer and rarer every year why if my father had knocked me down i should have lain on the ground if it was a nettlebed till he told me to get up now greg my boy what would you do well sir i think that i should get up as quick as i could and tell my mother aha and i should have the nettles then well said greg my boy i believe it is what all the young fellows nowadays would do but i dont mean you of course master lorraine come along come along mabel you know where that old madeira is that your poor uncle ambrose took three times to calcutta ah poor man i wish he was here as fine a fellow as ever shotted a cannon at a frenchman nelson could have done no better and it did seem uncommonly hard upon him never to go to churchyard however the will of the lord be done now mind the new patent corkscrew mabel was only too glad to get this errand to the cellar with filial instinct she perceived how likely she was to catch it as soon as her mother got the chance not that she deserved it oh no not in the least her conscience told her that much was she to be actually rude to her fathers guest and her brothers friend and as if she was not old enough now at eighteen and a quarter to judge for herself in such childish matters as how to behave at dinnertime by the side of a pebbly brookwhich ran within stonethrow of the house sparkling fresh and abundant from deep wellsprings of the hillrangethey came to a place which seemed to be made especially for enjoyment a bend of the grassy banks and rounded hollow of the fruitland where cherry and apple and willowtree clubbed their hospitable shade and fugitive water made much ado to quiver down the zigzag rill here in cool and gentle shelter the grower set his four legs down ie the four legs of his chair because like all that in gardens dwell he found mother earth too rheumatic for him especially in hot weather when deep sluggish fibres radiate the groweress also had her chair borne by the sedulous hilary all the rest like nymphs and shepherds strewed their recumbent forms on turf god almighty said master lovejoy fearing that he might be taking it too easy for the sabbathday really hath made beautiful things for us his creatures to rejoice in with praise thanksgiving and fruitfulness mabel put them two bottles in the brooknot there you stupid child cant you see that the sun comes under that old root in the corner where that shelf of stone is thank you master lorraine what a thing it is to have a headpiece but god almighty never made among all his wonderful infinite works the waters and the great whales and the fruittree yielding fruit whose seed is in itself and the green herb for meat which means to come to table with the meat his mercy endureth for ever and he never showed it as when he made tobacco and clay for tobacco pipesthe white clay that he made man of with this thanksgiving he began to smoke now martin i never could see that answered mrs lovejoy the best and greatest work of the lord ought to have been for the women first good wife then it must have been the apple ah gregory i had your mother there however we wont dispute on a sunday it spoils all the goodness of going to church and never leaves anything settled mabel run away now for the fruit while gregory feels if the wine is cold master lorraine i hope our little way of going on and being over free on a sunday perhaps does not come amiss to you hilary did not look as if anything came amiss to him as now he lay at the feet of mabel on the slope of the sweet rich sward listening only for her voice more liquid than even the tone of the brook he listened for it but not to it inasmuch as one of those sudden changes which at less than half a breath vapour the glass of the feminine mind was having its turn with the maiden mabel felt that she had not kept herself to herself as she should have done who was this gentleman or what that she should be taken with him so suddenly as to feel her breath come short every time that she even thought of her mother a gentleman from london too where the whole time of the court was spent as master shorne brought news every week in things that only the married women were allowed to hear of in the present case of course she knew how utterly different all things were how lofty and how grand of heart how fearful even to look at her muchstill for all that it would only be wise to show him or at least to let him seethat at any rate for the present now mabel when are you going for the cherries phyllisbless my heart alive gregory are you gone to sleep what are all the young people made of when a touch of summer spreads them only fit to sprawl about bring three sorts of cherries mabel gregory shouted after her mr lorraine must be tired of maydukes i am sure the black geans must be ripe and the eltons and the early amber and go and see how the whitehearts are on the old tree against the wall much he knows about cherries i believe grumbled mr lovejoy john doe and richard roe be more to his liking than the finest griffins why the whitehearts havent done stoning yet what can the boy be thinking of it was the growers leading grievance that neither of his two sons seemed likely to take to the business after him here was the elder being turned by his mother into a thieves counsellor and the younger was away at sea and whenever he came home told stories of foreign fruit which drove his father into a perfect fury so that now it was martins main desire to marry his only daughter to some one fitted to succeed him who might rent the estate from gregory the heir for the land had been disgavelled it is a pleasing thing to a young manay and an old one may be pleasedto see a pretty girl make herself useful in pretty and natural attitudes and that pleasure now might be enjoyed at leisure and in duplicate for phyllis catherow was a pretty or rather a beautiful young woman slender tall and fair of hue not to be compared with mabel according to hilarys judgment but infinitely superior to her in the opinion of gregory all that depends upon taste of course but mabels beauty was more likely to outlast the flush of youth having the keeping qualities of a bright and sweet expression and the kind lustre of sensible eyes these two went among the cherrytrees with fair knowledge what to do and having light scarves on their heads brought behind their ears and tied under the curves of their single chins because they knew that the spars and sprays would spoil their lovely sunday hats even without the drip of a cherry wounded by some thirsty thrush the blackbirds pop them off entire and so do the starlings but the thrushes sit and peck at them with the juice dripping down on their dappled breasts and a flavour in their throats which they mean to sing about at their leisure but now the birds that were come among them meant to have them wholesale phyllis being a trifle taller and less deft of finger bent the shady branches down for mabel to pluck the fruit mabel knew that she must take the northern side of the trees of course and the boughs where the hot sun had not beaten through the leaves and warmed the fruit also she knew that she must not touch the fruit with her hand and dim the gloss but above all things to be carefulas of the goose with the golden eggsto make no havoc of the young buds forming at the base of every cluster for the promise of next years crop hilary longed to go and help them but his host being very proud of the grandeur of his madeira wine would not even hear of it and mrs lovejoy for other reasons showed much skill in holding him so that he could but sit down and admire the picture he longed to be part of hence he beheld in the happy distance in and out the wellfed trees skill and grace and sprightly movements tiny baskets lifted high round arms bent for drawing downward or thrown up for a jumping catch and everything else that is so lovely and safe to admire at a distance byandby the maids came back bearing their juicy treasure and blithe with some sage mysticism of laughter they had hit upon some joke between them or something that chanced to tickle them and when this happens with girls they never seem to know when the humour is out of it and of course they make the deepest mystery of a diminutive jest so harmless that it hits no one except themselves mrs lovejoy looked at them strongly her time for commonsense was come and she thought they were stealing a march upon her by some whispers about young men the last thing they should ever think of whereas the poor girls had no thought of anything of the kind neither would they think one atom more than they could help of what did not in the least concern them if their elders who laid down the law would only leave them to themselves and it was not long till this delightful discretion was afforded them for after a glass or two of wine the heat of the day began to tell through the cool air of the hollow on that worthy couple now kindly hand in hand and calmly going down the slope of life they hoped they had got a long way to go yet and each thought so of the other neither of them had much age being well under threescore years just old enough to begin to look on the generation judiciously but having attained this right at last after paying heavily what good could they have of it if young people were ever so far beyond their judgment meditating thus they dozed and youthful voice and glance and smile were drowned in the melody ofnose the breeze that comes in the afternoon of every hot day unless the sky is hushing up for a thunderstorm began to show the underside of leaves and the upper gloss of grass and with feeble puffs to stir the stagnant heat into vibration like a candle quivering every breath at first was hot and only made the air feel hotter until there arrived a refreshing current whether from some watermeadows or from the hills where the chalk lay cool the heat is gone said martin lovejoy waking into the pleasant change it will be a glorious afternoon pooh what is this to call hot weather only three years ago in i remember well it may have been hotter then my dear said mrs lovejoy placidly but it did not make you forget your pipe and be ungrateful to providence about me why where can the children be cried the grower i thought they were all here just this moment it is wonderful how they get away together i thought young lorraine and gregory were as fast asleep as you or i oh there i hear them in the distance with the girls no doubt all alive and merry ay and a little too merry i doubt answered mrs lovejoy a little too much alive for me why they must be in the wallgarden now goodness alive i believe they are and nobody to look after them well if they are they cant do much harm they are welcome to anything they can find except the six strawberries i crossed and mabel will see that they dont eat those crossed strawberries indeed now martinmrs lovejoy never could be brought to understand crossbreedingtheyll do something worse than cross your strawberries unless you keep a little sharper lookout theyll cross your plans master martin lovejoy and its bad luck for any one who does that i dont understand you wife any more than you understand the strawberries how could they cross them at this time of year why dont you see that this gay young lorraine is falling over head and ears in love with our darling mabel whew that would be a sad affair the grower answered carelessly i like the young fellow and should be sorry to have him so disappointed for of course he never could have our mab unless he made up his mind to turn grower shorne says that he is a born salesman perhaps he is also a born grower now husband why do you vex me so you know as well as i do that he is the only son of a baronet belonging as gregory says to one of the proudest families in england though he doesnt show much pride himself thats certain is it likely they would let him have mabel is it likely that we would let mabel have him but this is all nonsense wife you are always discovering such maresnests tush why i didnt fall in love with you till we fell off a horse three times together i know that of course but that was because they wanted us to do it the very thing is that it happens at once when everybodys face is against it however youve had your warning martin and you only laugh at it you have nobody but yourself to thank if it goes against your plots and plans for my own part i should be well pleased if mabel were really fond of him and if the great people came round in the end as sooner or later they always do there are very few families in the kingdom that need be ashamed of my daughter i think and he is a most highly accomplished young man he said last night immediately after prayertime that i might try for an hour and he would be most happy to listen to me but i never never could persuade him that i was over forty years old therefore husband see to it yourself things may take their own course for me trust me trust me good wife said martin i can see as far as most folk can what stupes boys and girls are to be sure to go rushing about after watery fruit and leave such wine as this here madeira have another glass my dear good creature to cheer you up after your prophecies meanwhile in the large oldfashioned garden which lay at the east end of the house further up the course of the brook any one sitting among the currantbushes might have judged which of the two was right the unromantic franklin or his more ambitious but sensible wife gregory and phyllis were sitting quietly in a fine old arbour having a steady little flirt of their own and attending to nothing in the world besides phyllis was often of a pensive cast and she never looked better than in this mood when she felt the deepest need of sympathy this she was receiving now and pretending of course not to care for it her fingers played with moss and bark the fruits of the earth were below her contempt and she looked too divine for anybody on the other hand the rarest work and the most tantalizing tricks were going on at a proper distance between young mabel and hilary they had straggled off into the strawberrybeds where nobody could see them and there they seemed likely to spend some hours if nobody should come after them the plants were of the true carolina otherwise called the old scarlet pine which among all our countless new sorts finds no superior perhaps no equal although it is now quite out of vogue because it fruits so shyly what says our chief authority fruit mediumsized ovate even and regular and with a glossy neck skin deep red flesh pale red very firm and solid with a fine sprightly and very rich pine flavour what lovelier fruit could a youth desire to place between little pearly teeth reserving the right to have a bite if any of the very firm flesh should be left what fruit more suggestive of elegant compliments could a maid open her lips to receive with a dimple in each mantled cheeklips more bright than the skin of the fruit cheeks by no means of a pale red now although very firm and solidand as for the sprightly flavour of the whole it may be imagined if you please but is not to be ascertained as yet now i must pick a few for you mr lorraine you are really giving me all you find and they are so scarceno thank you i can get up very nicely by myself and there cant be any brier in my hair you really do imagine things where on earth could it have come from well if you are sure of course you may remove it now i verily believe you put it there well perhaps i am wronging you it was an unfair thing to say i confess now wait a moment while i run to get a little cabbageleaf a cabbage leaf now you are too bad i wont taste so much as the tip of a strawberry out of anything but one how did you eat your strawberries pray with my mouth of course but explain your meaning you wont eat what i pick for you out of what out of anything else in the world except your own little beautiful palm now how very absurd you are why my hands are quite hot let me feel them and judge for myself now the other if you please oh how lovely and cool they are how could you tell me such a story mabel beautiful mabel i am not at all beautiful and i wont be called so and i know not what they may do in london but i really think consideringat least when one comes to consider that to consider what you make me tremble you do look so ferocious ah i thought you couldnt do it long inconsiderate creature what is it i am to consider you cannot consider well then remember remember it is not twentyfour hours since you saw me for the very first time and surely it is not right and proper that you should begin to call me mabel as if you had known me all your life i must have known you all my life and i mean to know you all the rest of my life and a great deal more than that it may be because you are gregorys friend you are allowed to do things but what would you think of me mr lorraine if i were to call you hilarya thing i should never even dream of i should think that you were the very kindest darling and i should ask you to breathe it quite into my earhilary hilaryjust like that and then i should answer just like this mabel mabel sweetest mabel how i love you mabel and then what would you say if you please i should have to ask my mother said the maiden what i ought to say but luckily the whole of this is in your imagination mr lorraine you have lost your strawberries by your imagination what do i care for strawberries hilary cried as the quick girl wisely beat a swift retreat from him you never can enter into my feelings or you never would run away like that and i cant run after you you know because of phyllis and gregory there she goes and she wont come back what a fool i was to be in such a hurry but what could i do to help it i never know where i am when she turns those deep rich eyes upon me she never will show them again i suppose but keep the black lashes over them and i was getting on so welland here are the stalks of the strawberries of every strawberry she had eaten from his daring fingers he had kept the stalk and calyx breathed on by her freshly fragrant breath and slyly laid them in his pocket and now he fell to at kissing them then he lay down in the carolinas where her skirt had moved the leaves and to him weary with strong heat and a rush of new emotions comfort came in the form of sleep and when he awoke in his open palm most delicately laid he found a little shellshaped cabbageleaf piled with the fruit of the glossy neck that admirable writer dr hogg chapter xvi oh sweeter than the berry these doings of hilary and his lovefor his love he declared her to be for ever whether she would have him for hers or notseem to have taken more time almost in telling than in befalling although it had been a long summers day to them it had passed as a rapid dream so at least they fancied when they began to look quietly back at it forgetting the tale of the golden steps so lightly flitted over by the winged feet of love martin lovejoy watched his daughter at suppertime that sunday and he felt quite sure that his wife was wrong why the girl scarcely spoke to lorraine at all and even neglected his plate so sadly that her mother was compelled to remind her sharply of her duties upon which the grower despatched to his wife a smile of extreme sagacity which being fetched out of cipher and shorthand by the matrimonial key contained all thiswell you are a silly as you always are when you want to advise me the girl is coldshouldering that young fellow the same as she does all the young hopgrowers and well she knows how to do it too she gets her intellect from her father now please not to put in your oar mrs lovejoy another time till it is asked for moreover he thought that if mabel took the smallest delight in hilary she could not have answered as she had done when that pious youth in the early evening expressed his sincere desire to attend another performance of divine service i had no idea said the simple gregory that you made a point of going to church at least twice every sunday i seldom see you of a sunday in london but the very last place i should go to to find you would probably be the temple church that is quite a different thing dont you see a country church and a church in london are as different as a meadow and a marketplace but surely mr lorraine you would find the duty of attending just the same thus spoke mrs lovejoy who seldom missed a chance of discharging her duty towards young people quite so of course i do mrs lovejoy but then we always perform our duties best when they are pleasures and besides that i have a special reason for feeling bound as one might say to go to church well in the country i suppose one must not venture to ask you what that reason is sir oh yes to be sure it is just this i have an uncle my mothers brother who is a country clergyman well done master lorraine said the grower while the rest were laughing you take a very sensible view sir of things it is too much the fashion nowadays to neglect our tradeconnections but gregory will go with you and phyllis and mabel the old people stay at home to mind the house for we always let the maidservants go oh father cried mabel poor phyllis is so overcome by the heat that she must not go and i must stop at home to read to her so that the good lorraine took nothing by his sudden religious fervour except a hot walk with gregory and a wearisome doze in a musty pew with nobody to look at with fruitgrowers monday is generally the busiest day of the week except friday after paying all hands on the saturday night and stowing away all implements they rest them well till the sunday is over having in the summertime earned their rest by nightwork as well as daywork through the weary hours of the week this is not the case with all of course many of them especially down in kent grow their fruit or let it grow itself and then sell it by the acre or the hundred acres to dealers who take all the gathering and marketing off their hands altogether but for those who work off their own crops the toil of the week begins before the daystar of the monday at least for about six weeks it is so according to the weather and the length of the busy season before the stars fade out of the sky the pickers advance through the strawberry quarters carrying two punnets each yawning more than chattering even whisking the grey dew away with their feet startling the lark from his nest in the row groping among the crisp leaves for the fruit and often laying hold of a slug instead that is the time for the true fruitlover to try the taste of a strawberry it should be one that refused to ripen in the gross heat of yesterday but has been slowly fostering goodness with the attestation of the stars and now if it has been properly managed properly picked without touch of hand and not laid down profanely when the sun comes over the top of the hedge the look of that strawberry will be thisat least if it is of a proper sort the beard of the footstalk will be stiff the sepals of the calyx moist and crisp the neck will show a narrow band of varnish where the dew could find no hold the belly of the fruit will be sleek and gentle firm however to accept its fate but the back that has dealt with the dew and the sides where the colour of the back slopes downward upon them such a gloss of cold and diamond chastity will lie that the human lips get out of patience with the eyes in no time everybody was so busy with the way the work went on all for their very life pretending scarcely to have time to breathe whenever the master looked at them that the berries were picked and packed and started long before the sun grew hotstarted on the road to london the cormorant of the universe hilary helped with all his heart enjoying it with that triumphant entrance into any novelty which always truly distinguished him he carried his punnets and kept his row as soon as they had shown him how as well as the very best of them dividing his fruit into firsts and seconds and keeping the toppers separate of course he broke off many trusses entireripe fruit green fruit and barren blossomuntil he learned how to meet his nails and how much drag to put on the stalks a clever fellow learns all that from an hour or two of practice but one thing there is which the cleverest fellows can learn by no experiencehow to carry the head for hours upside down without hurting it how to make the brain so hard that it cannot shift or else so soft that the top is as good as the bottom the question is one for a great physician who to understand it must keep his row and pick by the job then let him say if he has learned how to explain the wellestablished fact that a woman can pick twice as fast as a man for who could assent to the reason assigned by one of themselves magnanimouslythat women was generally always used to keep their heads turned upside down leaving such speculative inquiries to go on for ever hilary who knew better than to say a word about them came in for his breakfast at six oclock and ate it as thoroughly as he had earned it the master a man of true kentish fibre obstinate placable hearty and dry made known to his wife and to everybody else his present opinion of hilary martin lovejoy never swore he never went beyond god knows or the lord in heaven look down on us or some other good exclamation sanctioned by the parish vicar as a general ruleproved by many exceptionsthe kentish men seldom swear very hard heart alive young sir he exclaimed piling hilarys plate as he spoke with the jellied delights of cold pigeon pie you have been the best man of the morning ah dont you be in a hurry good wife no tea or coffee our way thank ye no nor any caskwash weve worked a little too hard for that mabel whatever has come to you that you keep always out of the way so and i never saw you anigh the baskets now dont pipe your eye child im not going to scold thee if thou didst have a little lieabed here take this here key child a winks as good as a nodah she knows pretty well what to do with it for mabel was glad to turn away as quickly as possible after a little wellmanaged curtsey to hilary whom she had not seen for the morningcertainly through no fault of hisand without a word she went to the dresser for in these busy times they took their breakfast wisely in the kitchen and from the wooden crook unhung a quaint little jug with a narrow neck and a silver lip and handle with this she set off down a quiet passage and some steps to a snug stone cellar where the choicest of the homebrewed ale was kept although it lay well beneath the level of the ground and no ray of sun pierced the wired lattice the careful mistress of the house had the barrels swathed closely with wetted sacks the girl with her neat frock gathered upfor she always was cleanliness itselfwent carefully to the corner cask and lifted the wet sack back from the head lest any dirty water should have the chance of dripping upon her sleeve then she turned the tap and a thin bright thread ran out of it sideways being checked by some hops in the tube perhaps or want of air at the ventpeg but mabel held the jug with all patience although her hand shook just a little now said the grower to hilary when she came back and placed the jug at her fathers side without a word master lorraine let me pour you a drop not to be matched in kent nor yet in all england i do believe homegrown barley and homegrown hops and the soft water out of the brook that has taken the air of the sky for seven mile or more without a drain anigh it ah those brewers can never do that they must buy their malt and their musty hops and pump up their water and boil it down to get the flintstones out of it but our brook hath cast the flintstones and the other pebbles all along that makes a sight of difference sir every water is full of stones and if you pump it up from the spring the stones be all alive in it but let it run seven miles or eight and then it is fit to brew with ah to be sure now that explains a great many things i never understood hilary would have swallowed a camel rather than argue at this moment young sir just let me prove it to you just see the colour it runs out and the way the head goes creaming lord ha mercy if she has gived us a glass or a stags horn from the mantelpiece why mabel childmabel art thou gone why nobody wants to poison thee i think sir i saw your daughter go round the corner by the warmingpan this side of where the broom hangs then all i can say is she is daft she worked very hard last week poor thing and yesterday she was amoving always when the lords day bids us rest i must beg your pardon master lorraine our kentish maids always look after our guests when i was at school i read in the grammar that the moon always managed the women but now i do believe it is the comet let the comet come say i when the markets are so bad i feel that i am ready to face almost anything and now we must drink from the jug i reckon hilary saw that his host was vexed but he felt quite certain in his own heart that mabel could never be so rude or show such resentment of any little excess of honey on his part as to go away in that sour earnest and make the two of them angry a dozen things might have happened to upset her or turn her a little askew and her own father ought to know her better than he seemed to do and lo ere the grower had quite finished grumbling mabel reached over his shoulder unseen and set his own pet glass before him and then round hilarys side she slid without ever coming too nigh him and the glass of honour of the house cut in countless facets twinkled like the pleiads at him adorn me said the grower now i call that a true good girl girls were always made master lorraine for the good of those around them if anybody treats them any way else they come to nothing afterwards mabel dear give me a kiss you deserve it and there it is for you now be off like a good maid and see what they be at in vale orchard while master lorraine and i think a bit over these here two glasses the rest of the day was much too busy and too much crowded with sharp eyes for any fair chance of lovemaking for they all set to at the cherrytrees with ladders crooks and hanging baskets and light boys to scale the more difficult antlers strip them and drop upon featherbeds and though the sun broke hot and bright through the dewcloud of the morning and quickly drank the beaded freshness off the face of herb and tree yet they picked and piled and packed according to their sort and size the longstalked dancers that fringe the bough and glance in the sun so ruddily you must have had a deal too much of this young lovejoy said to hilary when the noonday meal had been spread forth and dealt with in a patch of fern near a breezy clump if i had worked as you have done my fingers would scarcely have been fit for a quill this side of next hilary term my dear fellow be not i pray you so violently facetious the brain when outraged takes longer to resume its functions than the fingers do moreover i trust that my fingers will hold something nobler than a quill ere the period of my namesake sir hilary charged at agincourt i hope you will do nothing of the sort said gregory with unwitting and unprecedented poetry lovejoy my wits are unequal altogether to this encounter the brilliancy of your native soil has burst out so upon you that i must go back to the southdown hills before i dare point a dart with you nevertheless on your native soil i beat you at picking cherries that you do and strawberries too and still more so at eating them but if you please you must stop a little my mother begs as a great favour to have a little private talk with you hilarys bright face lost its radiance as his conscience pricked him was it about mabel of course it must be and what the dickens was he to say he could not say a false thing that was far below his nature and he must own that he did love mabel and far worse than thathad done his utmost to drag that young and innocent mabel into love with him and if he were asked about his fatheras of course he must beon the word of a true man he must confess that his father would be sadly bitter if he married below his rank in life also that though he was the only son there were very peculiar provisions in the settlement of the lorraine estates which might throw him entirely upon his own wits if his father turned against him also that though his father was one of the very best men in the world and the kindest and loftiest you could find still there was about him something of a cold and determined substance and worst of all if the whole truth was to be shelled out as he must unshell it he knew in his heart that his father loved his sisters little finger more than all the members put together of his own too lively frame chapter xvii very shy things mrs lovejoy sat far away from all the worry and flurry and fun of picking and packing and covering up she had never entirely given herself to the glories of fruitgrowing and she never could be much convinced that any glory was in it she belonged to a higher rank of life than any of such sons of cain her father had been a navycaptain and her cousin was attorneygeneral this office has always been confounded in the provincial mind with rank in a less pugnacious profession even mrs lovejoy thought when the land was so full of militiamen that her cousin was the general of the devils own of the period therefore she believed herself to know more than usual about the law as well as the army and of course the navy and this high position in the legal army of so near a relation helped no doubt to foster hopes of the elevation of gregory i beg your pardon mr lorraine she began as hilary entered the bower to which she had just retired for calling you away from a scene which you enjoy perhaps from its novelty and where you make yourself i am sure so exceedingly active and useful but i feared as you must unluckily so very soon return to london that i might have no other chance of asking what your candid opinion is upon a matter i have very near at heart deuce and all thought hilary within himself being even more vexed than relieved by this turn of incidence she is much cleverer than i thought instead of hauling me over the coals she is going to give me the sack at once and i didnt mean to go for a week at least mrs lovejoy enjoyed his surprise as he stammered that any opinion he could form was entirely at her service i am sure that you know what it is about you must have guessed at once of course when i was rude enough to send for you what subject is nearest to a mothers heart i wish to ask you what they think of my son gregory in london lorraine for the moment was a little upset his presence of mind had been worked so hard that it was beginning to flutter and shift and much as he liked his fellowpupil he had not begun to consider him yet as a subject of public excitement i thinki really think he said while waiting for time to think more about it that he is going on as well as ever could be expected maam if he had wanted to vex his hostesswhich to his kind nature would have been one of the last things wantedhe scarcely could have hit on a phrase more fitted for his purpose why mr lorraine that is exactly what the monthly nurses say i hope you can say something a little better than that of gregory i assure you mrs lovejoy nothing can be finer than the way he is going on his attention punctuality steadiness and everything else leave nothing to be desired as all the winemerchants always say mr malahide holds him up as a pattern to be avoided because he works so hard and i think that he really ought to have country air at this time of year and in such weather for a week at the very shortest poor boy why should he overwork himself then you think that three days change is scarcely enough to set him up again he wants at least a fortnight maam he has a sort of a hacking cough which he does his best to keep under and the doctors say that the smell of ink out of a pewter inkstand and the inhaling of blottingpapersuch as we inhale all dayare almost certain in hot weather to root a tussis or at any rate a pituita inwards mrs lovejoy was much impressed and tenfold so when she tried to think what those maladies might be dear me she said it is dreadful to think of i know too well what those sad complaints are my dear grandfather died of them both do you think now mr lorraine that mr malahide could be persuaded to spare you both for the rest of the week i scarcely think that he could mrs lovejoy we are his right hand and his left your son of course his dexter hand and my poor self the weaker member still if you were to write to him nicely as of course you would be sure to write he might make an effort to get on with some of his inferior pupils it shall be done before the van goesby the very next mail i mean and if they can spare you do you think that you could put up with your very poor quarters for a few days longer mr lorraine i never was in such quarters before and i never felt so comfortable he answered with a gush of truth to expiate much small hypocrisy and thereby he settled himself for ever in her very best graces if mrs lovejoy had any prideand she always told herself she had nonethat pride lay in her best featherbeds a smile quite worthy of her larger husband and of her pleasant homestead spread itself over her thoughtful face and hilary for the first time saw that her daughter after all was born of her what can be sweeter than a smile won from a sensible woman like that then you give us some hope that we may endeavour to keep you a few days more sir the endeavour will be on my part he answered with his most elegant bow as all the temptation falls on me i do hope that mr malahide will do his best to spare you both though to lose both his right hand and his left hand must be very melancholy to a lawyer mrs lovejoy that is nothing we think nothing of such trifles we are ready to fight when we have no hands nor even a leg to stand upon yes to be sure you live by fighting as the poor sailors and soldiers do the general of the attorneys now is my first cousin once removed now can you tell me what opinion he has formed of my gregory of course there must be a number of people trying to keep my poor boy back pressing him down as they always do with all that narrow jealousy but his mothers cousin might be trusted to give him fair play now dont you think one never can tell answered hilary the faster a young fellow goes up the tree the harder the monkeys pelt him but if i only had a quarter of your sons ability i would defy them all at once from the lord chiefjustice downward oh no now mr lorraine that really would be bad advice he has not been called to the bar as yet and he must remember that there are people many years in front of him no no let gregory wait for his proper time in its proper course and steadily rise to the top of the tree with patience mr lorraine you know with patience all things come to pass but i must go to the house at once and write to mr malahide do you think that he would be offended if i asked him to accept a basket of our choicest cherries and strawberries i scarcely think that he would regard it as a mortal injury especially if you were to put it as a tribute from his grateful pupil hilary lorraine how kind of you to let me use your name and you have such influence with him gregory is always telling me no doubt he will accept them so however when she came to consider the matter mrs lovejoy with shameful treachery sent them as a little offering from that grateful pupil her own son while she laid upon hilary all the burden of this lengthened mitchingtime as in the main perhaps was just moreover she took good care that shorne should have no chance of appearing in chambers as he was only too eager to do for her shrewd sense told her that the sharp wits there would find him a joy for ever and an enduring joke against gregory it is scarcely needful to say perhaps that throughout the rest of the week lorraine did his utmost to bring about snug little interviews with mabel and she having made up her mind to keep him henceforth at his distance felt herself bound by that resolution to afford him a glimpse or two once in a way for she really had a great deal to do and it would have been cruel to deny her even the right to talk of it and hilary carried a basket so much better than anybody else and his touch was so light and he stepped here and there so obediently and so cleverly and he always looked away so nicely if any briery troubles befellas now and then of course must bethat mabel began every day to think how dreadfully she would miss him and then as if it were not enough to please her ears and eyes and mind he even contrived to conciliate the most grateful part of the human system as well as the most intelligent for on the tuesday afternoon the turn of the work and the courses of fruit led them near a bushy corner where the crafty brook stole through as clever and snug a dingle as need be for a pair of young people to drop accidentally out of sight and earshot for here the corner of the orchard fell away as a quarry does yet was banked with grass and ridges so that children might take hands and run but if they did so they would be certain to come to grief at the bottom unless they could clear at a jump three yards which would puzzle most of them for here the brook without any noise came under a bank of good brown loam with a gentle shallow slide and a bottom content to be run over trout as im a living sinner cried hilary with a fierce delight as he fetched up suddenly on the brink and a dozen streaks darted up the stream like the throw of a threaded shuttle my prophetic soul if i didnt guess it but i seem to forget almost everything why miss lovejoy miss mabel lovejoy mabel miss lovejoy or any other form insisting on the prefix despotically have i known you for a century or more and you never told me there were trout in the brook oh do let me see them please to show me where cried mabel coming carefully down the steep lest her slender feet should slip they are such dears i do assure you my mother and i are so fond of them but my father says they are all bones and tail i will show them to you with the greatest pleasure only you must do just what i order you they are very shy things you know almost as shy as somebody mabel mabel mab where are you came a loud shout over the crest and then gregorys square shoulders appeareda most unwelcome spectacle why here i am to be sure she answered where else do you suppose i should be the people must be looked after i suppose and if you wont do it of course i must i dont see any people to look after here except indeedhowever you seem to have looked so hard it has made you quite red in the face i declare now greg my boy cried hilary suddenly coming to the rescue i called your sister down here on purpose to tell me what those things in the water are they look almost like some sort of fish why trout lorraine didnt you know that i thought that you were a great fisherman if you like to have a try at them i can fit you out though i dont suppose you could do much in this weather miss lovejoy did you ever taste a trout hilary asked this question as if not a word had yet passed on the subject oh yes answered mabel no less oblivious my brother charles used to catch a good many they are such a treat to my dear mother and so good for her constitution but i dont think my father appreciates them allow me to help you up this steep rise it was most inconsiderate of me to call you down miss lovejoy pray do not mention it mr lorraine gregory how rude you are to give mr lorraine all this trouble but you never were famous for good manners if i meddle with them again thought gregory may i be adorned as my father says however i must keep a sharp lookout the girl is getting quite independent and ioh i am to be nobody ill just go and see what phyllis thinks of it but mabel who had not forgiven him yet for his insolent remark about her cheeks deprived him of even that comfort now gregory dear you have done nothing all day but wander about with cousin phyllis just stay here for a couple of hours if you cant work yourself your looking on will make the other people work i am quite ashamed of my inattention to mr lorraine all the afternoon i am sure he must want a glass of ale after all he has gone through and while he takes it i may be finding charlies tackle for him i know where it is and you do not and charlie left it especially under my charge you remember that is the first i have heard of it however if lorraine wants beer why so do i send phyllis out with a jug for me yes to be sure dear to be sure how delighted she will be to come as delighted as you are to go he replied but she was already out of hearing and all he took for his answer was an indignant look from hilary an excellent and most patient fisherman used to say that the greatest pleasure of the gentle art was found in the preparation to fish in the making of flies and the knotting of gut and the softening of collars that have caught fish and the choosing of what to try this time and how to treat the river the treasures of memory glow again and the sparkling stores of hope awake to a lively emulation hilarys mind had securely landed every fish in the brook at least and laid it at the feet of mabel ere ever his tackle was put to rights and everything else made ready at last he was at the very point of starting with his ever high spirits at their highest pitch when mabel scarcely a whit behind him in the excitement of this great matter ran in for the fiftieth time at least but this time wearing her evening frock that frock was of a delicate buff and she had a suspicion that it enhanced the clearness of her complexion and the kind and deep loveliness of her eyes you must be quite tired of seeing me i am as sure as sure can be but i am not come now to tie knots or untie and you quite understand all i know about trout and all that my dear brother charlie said ah mr lorraine you should see him gregory is a genius of course but charlie is not and that makes him so nice and his uniform when he went to church with usbut to understand such things you must see them still you can understand this now perhaps i can understand nothing when i look at you my intellect seems to be quite absorbed inini cant tell you in what then go and absorb it in catching trout though i dont believe you will ever catch one it requires the greatest skill and patience when the water is bright and the weather dry so charlie always said when he could not catch them unless you take to a worm at least or something a great deal nastier a worm i would sooner lime them almost now you know me better than that i am sure how should i know all the different degrees of cruelty men have established but i came to beg you just to take a little bit of food with you because you must be away some hours and you are sure to lose your way how wonderfully kind you are mabelyou must be mabel now well i suppose i have been mabel ever since they christened me but that has nothing at all to do with it only i came to make you put this half of cold duck into your basket and this pinch of salt and the barleycake and a drop of our ale in this stone bottle to drink it you must do like this do you know what i shall be wanting every bit of the time and for ever oh the mustardhow stupid of me but i hoped that the stuffing would do instead instead of the cold half duck i shall want every atom of the whole duck warm well there they are mr lorraine in the yard fourteen of them now coming up from the pond take one of them if you can eat it raw but my mother will make you pay for it i will pay for my duck he said lifting his hat if it costs me every farthing i have or shall ever have in this world or another and so he went fishing and she ran upstairs and softly cried as she watched him going and then lay down with her hand on her heart chapter xviii the key of the gate the trout knew nothing of all this they had not tasted a worm for a month except when a sod of the bank fell in through cracks of the sun and the way cold water has of licking upward and even the flies had no flavour at all when they fell on the water they fell flat and on the palate they tasted hot even in under the bushes hilary followed a path through the meadows with the calm bright sunset casting his shadow over the shorn grass or up in the hedgerow or on the brown banks where the drought had struck on his back he carried a fishingbasket containing his bits of refreshment and in his right hand a short springy rod the absent sailors favourite after long council with mabel he had made up his mind to walk up stream as far as the spot where two brooks met and formed body enough for a fly flipped in very carefully to sail downward here he began and the creak of his reel and the swish of his rod were music to him after the whirl of london life the brook was as bright as the best cut glass and the twinkles of its shifting facets only made it seem more clear it twisted about a little here and there and the brink was fringed now and then with something a clump of loosestrife a tuft of avens or a bed of flowering watercress or any other of the many plants that wash and look into the water but the trout the main object in view were most objectionably too much in view they scudded up the brook at the shadow of a hair or even the tremble of a blade of grass and no pacific assurance could make them even stop to be reasoned with this wont do said hilary who very often talked to himself in lack of a better comrade i call this very hard upon me the beggars wont rise till it is quite dark i must have the interdict off my tobacco if this sort of thing is to go on how i should enjoy a pipe just now i may just as well sit on a gate and think no hang it i hate thinking now there are troubles hanging over me as sure as the tail of that comet grows how i detest that comet no wonder the fish wont rise but if i have to strip and tickle them in the dark i wont go back without some for her he was lucky enough to escape the weight of such horrible poaching upon his conscience for suddenly to his ears was borne the most melodious of all sounds the flop of a heavy fish sweetly jumping after some excellent fly or grub ha my friend cried hilary so you are up for your supper are you i myself will awake right early still i behold the ring you made if my right hand forget not his cunning you shall form your next ring in the fryingpan he gave that fish a little time to think of the beauty of that mouthful and get ready for another the while he was putting a white moth on in lieu of his blueupright he kept the grizzled palmer still for tailfly and he tried his knots for he knew that this trout was a triton then with a delicate sidling and stooping known only to them that fish for trout in very bright water of the summertimecompared with which art the coarse work of the salmonfisher is as that of a scenepainter to mr holman huntswith or in and by a careful manner not to be described to those who have never studied it hilary won access of the water without any doubt in the mind of the fish concerning the prudence of appetite then he flipped his short collar in not with a cast but a spring of the rod and let his flies go quietly down a sharpish run into that good trouts hover the worthy trout looked at them both and thought for he had his own favourite spot for watching the world go by as the rest of us have so he let the grizzled palmer pass within an inch of his upper lip for it struck him that the tail turned up in a manner not wholly natural or at any rate unwholesome he looked at the white moth also and thought that he had never seen one at all like it so he drew back under his root again hugging himself upon his wisdom never moving a fin but oaring and helming his plump spotted sides with his tail upon my word it is too bad said hilary after three beautiful throws and exquisite management down stream everything kentish beats me hollow now if that had been one of our trout i would have laid my life upon catching him one more throw however how would it be if i sunk my flies that fellow is worth some patience while he was speaking his flies alit on the glassy ripple like gnats in their lovedance and then by a turn of the wrist he played them just below the surface and let them go gliding down the stickle into the shelfy nook of shadow where the big trout hovered under the surface floating thus with the check of ductile influence the two flies spread their wings and quivered like a centiplume moth in a spiders web still the old trout calmly oaring looked at them both suspiciously why should the same flies come so often and why should they have such crooked tails and could he be sure that he did not spy the shadow of a human hat about twelve yards up the water revolving these things he might have lived to a venerable agebut for that noble ambition to teach which is fatal to even the wisest a young fish an insolent whippersnapper jumped in his babyish way at the palmer and missed it through overeagerness ill show you the way to catch a fly said the big trout to him open your mouth like this my son with that he bolted the palmer and threw up his tail and turned to go home again alas his sweet home now shall know him no more for suddenly he was surprised by a most disagreeable sense of grittiness and then a keen stab in the roof of his mouth he jumped in his wrath a foot out of the water and then heavily plunged to the depths of his hole youve got it my friend cried hilary in a tingle of fine emotions i hope the sailors knots are tied with professional skill and care you are a big one and a clever one too it is much if i ever land you no net or gaff or anything i only hope there are no stakes here ah there you go now comes the tug away went the big trout down the stream at a pace very hard to exaggerate and after him rushed hilary knowing that his line was rather short and if it ran out all was over keeping his eyes on the water only and the headlong speed of the fugitive headlong over a stake he fell and took a deep wound from another stake scarcely feeling it up he jumped lifting his rod which had fallen flat and fearing to find no strain on it aha he is not gone yet he cried as the rod bowed like a springlebow he was now a good hundred yards down the brook from the corner where the fight began through his swiftness of foot and good management the fish had never been able to tighten the line beyond yield of endurance the bank had been free from bushes or haply no skill could have saved him but now they were come to a corner where a nutbush quite overhung the stream i am done for now said the fisherman the villain knows too well what he is about here ends this adventure full though he was of despair he jumped anyhow into the water lowered the point of his rod to pass reeled up a little as the fish felt weaker and just cleared the drop of the hazelboughs the water flapped into the pockets of his coat and he saw red streaks flow downward and then he plunged out to an open reach of shallow water and gravel slope i ought to have you now he cried though nobody knows what a rogue you are and a pretty dance you have led me doubting the strength of his tackle to lift even the dead weight of the fish and much more to meet his despairing rally he happily saw a little shallow gut or backwater where a small spring ran out into this by a dexterous turn he rather led than pulled the fish who was ready to rest for a minute or two then he stuck his rod into the bank ran down stream and with his hat in both hands appeared at the only exit from the gut it was all up now with the monarch of the brook as he skipped and jumped with his rich yellow belly and chaste silver sides in the green of the grass joy and glory of the highest merit and gratitude glowed in the heart of lorraine two and three quarters you must weigh and at your very best you are how small your head is and how bright your spots are he cried as he gave him the stroke of grace you really have been a brave and fine fellow i hope they will know how to fry you while he cut his fly out of this grand trouts mouth he felt for the first time a pain in his knee where the point of the stake had entered it under the buckle of his breeches blood was soaking away inside his gaiters and then he saw how he had dyed the water after washing the wound and binding it with dockleaves and a handkerchief he followed the stream through a few more meadows for the fish began to sport pretty well as the gloom of the evening deepened so that by the time the gables of the old farmhouse appeared by the light of a young moon and the comet lorraine had a dozen more trout in his basket silverysided and handsome fellows though none of them over a pound perhaps except his first and redoubtable captive herewith he resolved to be content for his knee was now very sore and stiff and the growing darkness baffled him while having forgotten his food as behoved him he was conscious of an agreeable fitness for the suppertable here of course he had to tell at least thrice over his fight with the triton who turned the scale at three pounds and a quarter and was recognized as an old friend and twice conqueror of the absent charlie mrs lovejoy as was to be expected made a great ado about the gash in the kneewhich really was no triflewhile mabel said nothing but blamed herself deeply for having equipped him to such misfortune for the next few days master hilary was compelled to keep his active frame in rest and quiet and cosseting even the grower a man of strong manhood accustomed to scythecuts and chopperhits and polesprings admitted that this was a case for broth and low feeding and things that the women do for if inflammation set up the boy might have only one leg left for life it was high time however for the son of the house to return to his beloved lawbooks so that he tore himself away from phyllis and started in the van about noon on friday having promised to send back by john shorne all that his fellowpupil wanted lorraine soon found that his kind and quick hostess loved few things better than a cheerful dutiful and wholesomeblooded patient and therefore he rejected with scorn all suggestions as to his need of a proper doctor and herein the grower backed him up adorn me if any one of them ever lays finger on me any more than on my good father before me they handle us when we are born of course and come to no manner of judgment but if we let them handle us afterwards we deserve to go out of the world before them this sound discretion combined with the plentiful use of cold water and healing herbs set hilary on his legs again in about eight or ten days time meanwhile he had seen very little of mabel whether through her fault or that of others he could not tellonly so it was whenever his hostess was out of the way phyllis catherow and the housemaid did their best to supply her place and very often the grower dropped in to enjoy his pipe and to cheer his guest by means of simple truth they showed him that he was no burden to them even at this busy time after all this it was only natural that hilary should become much attached as well as grateful to his entertainers common formality was dropped and caste entirely sunk in hearty liking and lovingkindness and young lorraine was delighted to find how many pleasant virtues flourished under the thatch of that old house uncoveted and undisturbed inasmuch as their absence was not felt in the mansions of great people this affection for virtue doubtless made him feel sadly depressed and lonely when the time at length arrived for quitting so much excellence in the van he came and in the van he would go he replied to all remonstrance and the grower liked him all the better for his loyalty to the fruitcoach so it was settled when crusty john was going up light for a thursday morning that hilary should have a mattress laid in the body of the vehicle and a horsecloth to throw over him if the night should prove a cold one for now a good drop of rain had fallen and the weather seemed on the change awhile i must catch you another dish of trout said hilary to mrs lovejoy when shall i have such a chance again the brook is in beautiful order now and thanks to your wonderful skill and kindness i can walk again quite grandly yes for a little way you can but you must be sure not to overdo it you may fish one meadow and one only let me see you may fish the long meadow hilary then you will have neither stile nor hedge the gate at this end unlatches mind and i will send phyllis to let you out at the lower end and to see that you dare not go one step further she shall be there at halfpast six the van goes at eight you know and we must sit down to supper at seven exactly upon this understanding he set forth about five oclock in the afternoon and meeting miss catherow in the lane he begged her as an especial favour to keep out of mrs lovejoys way for the next two hours only phyllis a goodnatured girl on the whole though a little too proud of her beauty perhaps readily promised what he asked and retired to a seat in the little ash coppice to read a poem and meditate upon the absent gregory lorraine was certainly in luck today for he caught a nice basket of fish down the meadow and towards the last stickle near the corner where silver threads of water crossed and the slanting sunshine cast a plaid of softest gold upon them light footsteps came by the side of the hedge and a pretty shadow fell near him miss lovejoy cried hilary how you amaze me why i thought it was phyllis who was coming to fetch me i may call her phyllisoh yes she allows me she is not so very ceremonious but some people are all dignity now you want to vex me the very last thing and they call you so sweettempered i am so sorry for your disappointment about your dear friend phyllis but i am sure i looked for her everywhere before i was obliged to come myself now i hope you have not found the poor little trout quite so hard to please as you are at any rate not so shy of me as somebody has been for a fortnight because i was in trouble i suppose and pain and supposed to be groaning how can you say such bitter things it shows how very little you careat least that is not what i mean at all then if you please what is it that you do mean i mean that here is the key of the gate and my father will expect you at seven oclock but surely you will have a look at my trout they cannot bite if i can he laid his fishingcreel down on the grass and mabel stooped over it to hide her eyes which in spite of all pride and prudence were not exactly as she could have wished but they happened to be exactly as hilary wished and catching a glimpse of them unawares he lost all ideas except of them and basely compelled them to look at him now mabel lovejoy he said slowly and with some dread of his own voice can you look me in the face and tell me you do not care twopence for me i am not in the habit of being rude she answered with a sly glance from under her hat that i leave for other people well do you like me or do you not you do ask the most extraordinary questions we are bound to like our visitors i will ask a still more extraordinary question do you love me mabel for a very long time he got no answer except a little smothered sob and two great tears that would have their way darling mabel look up and tell me why should you be ashamed to say i am very proud of loving you lovely mabel do you love me iii amverymuch afraidi almost do she shrank away from his arms and eyes and longed to be left to herself for a little and then she thought what a mean thing it was to be taking advantage of his bad leg with that she came back and to change his thoughts said show me a trout in the brook now hilary you deserve to see fifty for being so good there you must help me along you know now just stand here and let me hold you carefully and most steadily no not like that that will never do i must at least have one arm round you or in you go and i have to answer for your being drownded drowned you take advantage now to make me so ridiculous the water is scarcely six inches deep but where are the little troutsies there there do you see that white stone now look at it most steadfastly and then you are sure not to see them now turn your head like that a littlenot too much whatever you do now what do you see most clearly why i see nothing but you and me in the shadow of that oaktree standing over the water as if we had nothing better in the world to do we are standing together though dont you think so well even the water seems to think so and what can be more changeable now look at me and not at the water mabel you know what i am hilary i wish i did that is the very thing that takes such a long time to find out now did i treat you in such a spirit did i look at you and thinkhere is a rogue i must find out no of course you never did that is not in your nature at the same time perhaps it might not matter so long to you as it must to me she met his glad eyes with a look so wistful yet of such innocent trust to assuage the harm of words that hilary might be well excused for keeping the growers supper waiting as he did that evening chapter xix four young ladies the excellent people of coombe lorraine as yet were in happy ignorance of all these fine doings on hilarys part sir roland knew only too well of course that his son and heir was of a highly romantic chivalrous and adventurous turn at eton and oxford many little scrapes which seemed terrible at the time showed that he was sure to do his best to get into grand scrapes as the landscape of his youthful world enlarged happen what will i can always trust my boy to be a gentleman his father used to say to himself and to his only real counsellor old sir remnant chapman sir remnant always shook his head and then for fear of having meant too much said ah that is the one thing after all people begin to talk a great deal too much about christianity at any rate the last thing they thought of was the most likely thing of allthat hilary should fall in love with a good and sweet and simple girl who for his own sake would love him and grow to him with all the growth of love moralitywhereby we mean now truth and right and puritywas then despised in public even more than now in private life sir remnant thought it a question of shillings how many maids his son led astray and he pitied sir roland for having a son so much handsomer than his own little as now he meddled with it sir roland knew that the world was so and the more he saw of it the less he found such things go down well with him the broad low stories and practical jokes and babyish finesse of oaths invented for the ladiesmany of which still survive in the hypocrisy of our good tonguethese had a great deal to do with sir rolands love of his own quiet dinnertable and shelter of his pet child alice and nothing perhaps except old custom and the traditions of friendship could have induced him to bear as he did with sir remnants far lower standard let a man be what he will he must be moved one way or another by the folk he deals with even sir roland though so different from the people around him felt their thoughts around him rambling and very often touching him and he never could altogether help wanting to know what they thought about him so must the greatest man ever developed have desired a millionfold because he lived in each one of the million however there were but two to whom sir roland lorraine ever yielded a peep of his deeply treasured anxieties one was sir remnant and the other in virtue of his office and against the grain was the rev struan hales his own highly respected brotherinlaw struan hales was a man of mark all about that neighbourhood everybody knew him and almost everybody liked him because he was a genial openhearted and sometimes noisy man full of lifein his own form of that matterand full of the love of life whenever he found other people lively he hated every kind of humbug all revolutionary ideas methodism asceticism enthusiastic humanity and exceedingly fine language and though like everyone else he respected sir roland lorraine for his upright character lofty honour and clearness of mind while he liked him for his generosity kindness of heart and gentleness on the other hand he despised him a little for his shyness and quietude of life for the rector of west lorraine loved nothing better than a good day with the hounds and a roaring dinnerparty afterwards nothing in the way of sport ever came amiss to him even though it didas no true sport doesdepend for its joy upon cruelty here in his red house on the glebe under the battlement of the hills with trees and a garden of comfort and snug places to smoke a pipe in mr hales was well content to live and do his duty he liked to hunt twice in a week and he liked to preach twice every sunday still he could not do either always and no good people blamed him mrs hales was the sweetest creature ever seen almost anywhere she had plenty to say for herself and a great deal more to say for others and if perfection were to be found she would have been perfection to every mind except her own and perhaps her husbands the rector used to say that his wife was an angel if ever one there were and in his heart he felt that truth still he did not speak to her always as if he were fully aware of being in colloquy with an angel he had lived with her ever so long and he knew that she was a great deal better than himself but he had the wisdom not to let her know it and she often thought that he preached at her such a thing he never did no honest parson would ever do it of all mean acts it would be the meanest yet there are very few parsons wives who are not prepared for the chance of it and mrs hales knew that she had her faults and that mr hales was quite up to them at any rate here these good folk were and here they meant to live their lives out having a pretty old place to see to and kind old neighbours to see to them also they had a much better thingthree good children of their own enough to make work and pleasure for them but not to be a perpetual worry inasmuch as they all were girlsthree very good girls of their sortthinking as they were told to think and sure to make excellent women alice lorraine liked all these girls they were so kind and sweet and simple and when they had nothing whatever to say they always said it so prettily and they never pretended to interfere with any of her opinions or to come into competition with her or to talk to her father when she was present more than she well could put up with for she was a very jealous child and they were well aware of it and they might let their father be her mothers brother ten times over before she would hear of any halesy elementas she once had called itcoming into her family more than it had already entered and they knew right well while they thought it too bad that this young alice had sadly quenched any hopes any one of them might have cherished of being a lady lorraine some day she had made her poor brother laugh over their tricks when they were sure that they had no tricks and she always seemed to throw such a light upon any little harmless thing they did still they could afford to forget all that and they did forget it especially now when hilary would soon be at home again it was now july and no one had heard for weeks from that same hilary but this made no one anxious because it was the wellknown manner of the youth sometimes they would hear from him by every post although the post now came thrice in a week and then again for weeks together not a line would he vouchsafe and as a general rule he was getting on better when he kept strict silence therefore alice had no load on her mind at all worth speaking of while she worked in her sloping flowergarden early of a summer afternoon it was now getting on for st swithins day and the sun was beginning to curtail those brief attentions which he paid to coombe lorraine he still looked fairly at it as often as clouds allowed in the morning almost up to eight oclock and after that he could still see down it over the shoulder of the hill but he felt that his rays made no impression the land so fell away from him they seemed to do nothing but dance away downward like a lasher of glittering water therefore in this garden grew soft and gentlenatured plants and flowers of delicate tint that sink in the exhaustion of the sunglare the sun in almost every garden sucks the beauty out of all the flowers he stains the sweet violet even in march he spots the primrose and the periwinkle he takes the down off the heartsease blossom he browns the pure lilyofthevalley in may and after that he dims the tint of every rose that he opens and yet in spite of all his mischief which of them does not rejoice in him the bold chase cut in the body of the hill has rugged sides and a steep descent for a quarter of a mile below the housethe cleft of the chalk on either side growing deeper towards the mouth of the coombe the main road to the house goes up the coombe passing under the eastern scarp but winding away from it here and there to obtain a better footing the old house facing down the hill stands so close to the head of the coombe that there is not more than an acre or so of land behind and between it and the crest and this is partly laid out as a courtyard partly occupied by outbuildings stables and so on and the ruinous keep ingloriously used as a limekiln while the rest of the space is planted in and out with spruce and birchtrees and anything that will grow there among them winds a narrow outlet to the upper and open downsnot much of a road for carriagewheels but something in appearance betwixt a bridlepath and a timbertrack such as is known in those parts by the old english name a borstall as this led to no dwellinghouse for miles and miles away but only to the crown of the hills and the desolate tract of sheepwalks ninetynine visitors out of a hundred to the house came up the coombe so that alice from her flowergarden commanding the course of the drive from the plains could nearly always foresee the approach of any interruption here she had pretty seats under laburnums and even a bower of jessamine and a noble view all across the weald even to the range of the north downs so that it was a pleasant place for all who love soft sward and silence and have time to enjoy that rare romance of the seasonsa hot english summer only there was one sad drawback lady valerias windows straightly overlooked this pleasant spot and lady valeria never could see why she should not overlook everything beyond and above all other things she took it as her own special duty to watch her dear granddaughter alice and now in her eightysecond year she was proud of her eyesight and liked to prove its power here they come again cried alice talking to herself or her rake and trowel will they never be content i told them on monday that i knew nothing and they will not believe it i have a great mind to hide myself in my hole like that poor ragandbone boy it goes beyond my patience quite to be crossexamined and not believed those whom she saw coming up the steep road at struggling and panting intervals were her three good cousins from the rectorycaroline margaret and cecil hales rather nicelooking and active girls resembling their father in face and frame and their excellent mother in their spiritual parts the anglican period of young ladiesthe time of wearing great crosses and starving and sticking as a thorn in the flesh of mankind lay as yet in the happy future a parsons daughters were as yet content to leave the parish to their father helping him only in the sundayschool and for the rest of the week minding their own dresses or some delicate jobs of pastry or gossip though alice had talked so of running away she knew quite well that she never could do it unless it were for a childish joke and swiftly she was leaving now the pretty and petty world of childhood sinking into that distance whence the failing years recover it therefore instead of running away she ran down the hill to meet her cousins for truly she liked them decently oh you dear how are you how wonderfully good to come to meet us madge i shall be jealous in a moment if you kiss my alice so cecilwhat are you thinking of why you never kissed your cousin alice oh yes you have all done it very nicely what more could i wish said alice but what could have made you come up the hill so early in the day dears well you know what dear mamma is she really fancied that we might seem now there is so much going on really unkind and heartless unless we came up to see how you were papa would have come but he feels it so steep unless he is coming up to dinner and pony you knowoh she did such a thing the wicked little dear she got into the garden and devoured worth of the grand new flower just introduced by the duchessdallia or dellia i cant spell the name and mamma was so upset that both of them have been unwell ever since oh dahlias answered alice whose grapes were rather sour because her father had refused to buy any flaunty things in my opinion but caroline madge and cecil have you ever set eyes on my new rose of course they all ran to behold the new rose which was no other than the persian yellow a beautiful stranger not yet at home the countless petals of brilliant yellow folding inward full of light and the dimple in the centre shy of yielding inlet to its virgin gold and then the delicious fragrance too refined for random sniffersthese and other delights found entry into the careless beholders mind it makes one think of astrologers cried caroline hales i declare it does look at all the little stars it is quite like a celestial globe so it is i do declare said madge but cecil shook her head she was the youngest and much the prettiest and by many degrees the most elegant of the daughters of the rectory cecil had her own opinion about many things but waited till it should be valuable it is much more like a cowslipball alice answered carelessly come into my bower now and then we can all of us go to sleep the three girls were a little hot and thirsty after their climb of the chalky road and a bright spring ran through the bower as they knew ready to harmonize with sherbet sherrywine or even shrub itself as had once been proved by hilary how delicious this is how truly sweet cried the eldest and perhaps most loquacious miss hales and how nice of you always to keep a glass a spring is such a rarity on these hills papa says it comes from a different stratum what a stratum is i have no idea it ought to be straight one may safely say that but it always seems to be crooked now can you explain that darling alice you are so highly taught and so clever now we dont want a lecture said madge the blunt one the hill is too steep to have that at the top alice knows everything no doubt in the way of science and all that but what we are dying to know is what came of that grand old astrologers business this is the seventh or eighth time now alice answered hard at bay that you will keep on about some little thing that the servants are making mountains of my father best knows what it is let us go to his room and ask him oh no dear oh no dear how could we do that what would dear uncle say to us but come now tell us you do know something why are you so mysterious mystery is a thing altogether belonging to the dark ages now we have heard such beautiful stories that we cannot manage to sleep at night without knowing what they are all about now do tell us everything you may just as well tell us every single thing we are sure to find it all out you know and then we shall all be down on you among near relations dear mamma says there is nothing to compare with candour dont you see alice madge broke in we are sure to know sooner or later and how can it matter which it is to be sure answered alice it cannot matter and so you shall all know later this made the three sisters look a little at one another quietly and then as a desperate resource madge the rough one laid eyes upon alice and with a piercing look exclaimed you dont even understand what it means yourself of course i do not answered alice how many times have i told you so yet you always want further particulars dear cousins now you must be satisfied with a conclusion of your own i cannot at all see that said caroline really you are too bad cried margaret do you think that this is quite fair asked cecil you are too many for me all of you alice answered steadfastly suppose i came to your house and pried into some piece of gossip about you that i had picked up in the village would you think that i had a right to do it no dear of course not but nobody dares to gossip about us you know papa would very soon stop all that of course he would and because my father is too highminded to meddle with it am i to be questioned perpetually come in caroline come in margaret come in dear cecil i know where papa is and then you can ask him all about it i have three little girls at their first samplersuch little sweets said caroline i only left them for half an hour because we felt sure you must want us darling it now seems as if you could hold your own in a crossstitch we must not penetrate it is nothing to us what could it be only dont come for goodness sake dont come rushing down the hill dear creature to implore our confidence suddenly dear creature cried alice for the moment borne beyond her young selfpossessioni am not quite accustomed to old womens words nobody shall call me a dear creature except my father who knows better and poor old nanny stilgoe now dont be vexed with them cecil stopped to say in a quiet manner while the two other maidens tucked up their skirts and down the hill went rapidly they never meant to vex you alice only you yourself must feel how dreadfully tantalizing it is to hear such sweet things as really make us afraid of our own shadows and then to be told not to ask any questions i am sorry if i have been rude to your sisters the placable alice answered but it is so vexatious of them that they doubt my word so now tell me what you have heard it is wonderful how any foolish story spreads we heard on the very best authority that the old astrologer appeared to you descending from the comet in a fireballoon and warned you to prepare for the judgmentday because the blackdeath would destroy in one night every soul in coombe lorraine and as soon as you heard it you fainted away and sir roland ran up and found you lying as white as wax in a shroud made out of the ancient gentlemans long foreign cloak then beg cousin carolines pardon for me no wonder she wanted to hear more and i must not be touchy about my veracity after lying in my shroud so long but truly i cannot tell you a word to surpass what you have heard already nor even to come up to it there was not one single wonderful thingnot enough to keep up the interest i was bitterly disappointed and so of course was every one cousin alice cecil answered looking at her pleasantly you are different from us or at any rate from my sisters you scarcely seem to know the way to tell the very smallest of small white lies i am very sorry always still i must tell some of them no cecil no you need tell none if you only make up your mind not to do it you are but a very little older than i am and surely you might begin afresh suppose you say at your prayers in the morning lord let me tell no lie today now alice you know that i never could do it when i know that i mean to tell ever so many how could i hope to be answered no doubt i am a storytellerjust the same as the rest of us and to pray against it when i mean to do it would be a very doublefaced thing to be sure it would it never struck me in that particular way before but uncle struan must know best what ought to be done in your case we must not make a fuss of trifles cecil answered prudently papa can always speak for himself and he means to come up the hill to do it if mr gates pony is at home and now i must run after them or madge will call me a little traitor oh here papa comes i do declare goodbye darling and dont be vexed it does seem a little too bad thought alice as the portly form of the rector mounted on a borrowed pony came round the corner at the bottom of the coombe near poor bonnys hermitagea little too bad that nothing can be done without its being chattered about and i know how annoyed papa will be if uncle struan comes plaguing him again we cannot even tell what it means ourselves and whatever it means it concerns us only i do think curiosity is the worst though it may be the smallest vice he expects to catch me of course and get it all out of me as he declared he would but sharp as his eyes are i dont believe he can have managed to spy me yet i will off to my rockwork and hide myself till i see the heels of his pony going sedately down the hill again with these words she disappeared and when the good rector had mounted the hill alice alice resounded vainly from the drive among the shrubs and flowers and echoed from the ramparts of the coombe chapter xx a rector of the olden style one part of coombe lorraine is famous for a sevenfold echo connected by tradition with a tale of gloom and terror mr hales being proud of his voice put this echo through all its peals or chime of waning resonance it could not quite answer how do you do with very well pat and the same to youand its tone was rather melancholy than sprightly as some echoes are but of course a great deal depended on the weather as well as on the time of day echo for the most part sleeps by daylight and strikes her gong as the sun goes down failing of any satisfaction here the rev struan hales rode on ride on ride on was his motto always and he seldom found it fail nevertheless as he rang the bell which he was at last compelled to do he felt in the crannies of his heart some wavers as to the job he was come upon a coarse nature often despises a fine one and yet is most truly afraid of it mr hales believed that in knowledge of the world he was entitled to teach sir roland and yet could not help feeling how calmly any impertinence would be stopped the clergyman found his brotherinlaw sitting alone as he was too fond of doing in his little favourite bookroom walled off from the larger and less comfortable library sir roland was beginning to yield more and more to the gentle allurements of solitude some few months back he had lost the only friend with whom he had ever cared to interchange opinions a learned parson of the neighbourhood an antiquary and an elegant scholar and ever since that he had been sinking deeper and deeper into the slough of isolation and privacy for hours he now would sit alone with books before him yet seldom heeded while he mused and meditated or indulged in visions mingled of the world he read of and the world he had to deal with as no less an authority than dr johnson has itthis invisible riot of the mind this secret prodigality of being is secure from detection and fearless of reproach the dreamer retires to his apartment shuts out the cares and interruptions of mankind and abandons himself to his own fancy and againthis captivity it is necessary for every man to break who has any desire to be wise or useful to regain liberty he must find the means of flying from himself he must in opposition to the stoic precept teach his desires to fix upon external things he must adopt the joys and the pains of others and excite in his mind the want of social pleasures and amicable communication sir roland lorraine was not quite so bad as the gentleman above depicted still he was growing so like him that he was truly sorry to see the jovial face of his brotherinlaw for his mind was set out upon a track of thought which it might have pursued until dinnertime but of course he was much too courteous to show any token of interruption roland i must have you out of this my dear fellow what are you coming to books books books as if you did not know twice too much already even i find my flesh falling away from me the very next day after i begin to punish it with reading that very remark occurs in the book which i have just put down struan let me read it to you i thank you greatly but would rather not it is in latin or greek of course i could not do my duty as i do if i lost my way in those dead languages but i have the rarest treat for you and i borrowed a pony to come and fetch you such a badger you never saw sir remnant is coming to see it and so is old general jakes and a dozen more we allow an hour for that and then we have a late dinner at six oclock my daughters came up the hill to fetch your young alice to see the sport but they had some blazeup about some trifle as the chittish creatures are always doing and so pretty alice perhaps will lose it leave them to their own ways say i leave them to their own ways sir roland they are sure to cheat us either way and they may just as well cheat us pleasantly you take a sensible view of it according to what your daughters are sir roland answered more sharply than he either meant or could maintain and immediately he was ashamed of himself but mr hales was not thin of skin and he knew that his daughters were true to him well well he replied as i said before they are full of tricks at their age and sex it must be so but a better and kinder team of maids is not to be found in thirteen parishes speak to the contrary who will i know that they are very good girls sir roland answered kindly alice likes them very much and so does everybody that is enough to show what they are nobody ever likes anybody without a great deal of cause for it they must have their faults of course we know and they may not be quite butterlipped you knowstill i should like to see a better lot take them in and out and altogether now you must come and see fox draw that badger i have ten good guineas upon it with jakes sir remnant was too shy to stake and i want a thoroughly impartial judge you never would refuse me roland now yes struan yes you know well that i will you know that i hate and despise cruel sports and it is no compliment to invite me when you know that i will not come i wish i had stayed at the bottom of the hill where that young scamp of a boy lives when will you draw that badger sir roland the pest of the downs and of all the county struan the boy is not half so bad as might be expected of him i have thought once or twice that i ought to have him taught and fed and civilized send him to me and ill civilize him a born little poacher i have scared all the other poachers with the comet but the little thief never comes to church four pair of birds to my knowledge nested in john gates vetches and hatched well too for i spoke to johnwhere are they can you tell me where they are well struan i give you the shooting of course but i leave it to you to look after it but it does seem too cruel to kill the birds before they can fly for you to shoot them cruel i call it much worse than cruel such things would never be dreamed of upon a properly managed property you are going a little too far said sir roland with one of his very peculiar looks and his brotherinlaw drew back at once and changed the subject clumsily the shooting will do well enough sir roland i think however that you may be glad of my opinion upon other matters and that had something to do with my coming oh i thought that you came about the badger struan but what are these even more serious matters concerning your dealings with the devil roland of course i never listen to anything foolish still for the sake of my parish i am bound to know what your explanation is i have not much faith in witchcraft though in that perhaps i am heterodox but we are bound to have faith in the devil i hope your hope does you credit sir roland answered but for the moment i fail to see how i am concerned with this orthodoxy now my dear fellow my dear fellow you know as well as i do what i mean of course there is a great deal of exaggeration and knowing you so well i have taken on myself to deny a great part of what people say but you know the old proverb no smoke without fire and i could defend you so much better if i knew what really had occurred and besides all that you must feel i am sure that you are not treating me with that candour which our long friendship and close connection entitle me to expect from you your last argument is the only one requiring any answer those based on religious social and even parochial grounds do not apply to this case at all but i should be sorry to vex you struan or keep from you anything you claim to know in right of your dear sister this matter however is so entirely confined to those of our name only at the same time so likely to charm all the gossips who have made such wild guesses about it and after all it is such a trifle except to a superstitious mind that i may trust your good sense to be well content to hear no more about it until it comes into actionif it ever should do so very well sir roland of course you know best i am the last man in the world to intrude into family mysteries and my very worst enemy if i have one would never dream of charging me with the vice of curiosity of course not and therefore you will be well pleased that we should drop this subject will you take white wine or red wine struan your kind and good wife was quite ready to scold me for having forgotten my duty in that the last time you came up the hill ah then i walkedtoday i am riding i thank you i thank you sir roland but the general and sir remnant are waiting for me and most important of all the badger goodbye struan i shall see you soon i hardly know whether you will or not the rector answered testily this is the time when those cursed poachers scarcely allow me a good nights rest and to come up this hill and hear nothing at the top it is too bad at my time of life after two services every sunday to have to be gamekeeper all the week at your time of life said sir roland kindly why you are the youngest man in the parish so far as life and spirits go today you are not yourself at all struan you have not sworn one good round oath well what can you expect roland with these confounded secrets held over one i feel myself many pegs down today and that pony trips so abominably perhaps after all i might take one glass of red wine before i go down the hill it is a duty you owe to the parish now come and let me try to find alice to wait upon you alice is always so glad to see you and i am always so glad to see her how narrow your doors are in these old houses those normans must have been a skewershouldered lot now roland if i have said anything harsh you will make all allowance for me of course because you know the reason you mean that you are a little disappointed not a bit of it quite the contrary but after such weather as weve had and nothing but duty duty to doone is apt to get a little crotchety what kind of sport can be got anywhere the landrailshooting is over of course and the rabbits are running in families the fish are all sulky and the water low and the seatrout not come up yet there are no young hounds fit to handle yet and the ground cracks the heels of a decent hack ones mouth only waters at oiling a gun all the best of the cocks are beginning to mute and if one gets up a badgerbait to lead to a dinnerparty people will come and look on and make bets and then tell the women how cruel it was and with all the week thus i am always expected to say something new every sunday morning nay nay struan come now we have never expected that of you but here comes alice from her gardening work now she does look well dont you think she does not a rose in june but a rose in may the rector answered gallantly kissing his hand to his niece and then with his healthy bright lips saluting her you grow more and more like your mother darling ah when i think of the bygone days before i had any wife or daughters things occur to me that never go and bait your badger struan after one more glass of wine chapter xxi a notable lady nature appears to have sternly willed that no man shall keep a secret there is a monster here and there perhaps to be discovered who can sustain his boast of never whispering anything but he ought to expect to be put aside in our estimate of humanity and in compensation the powers above provide him for the most part with a wife of fecund loquacity a word is enough on such parlous themes and the least said the soonest mended what one of us is not exceeding wise in his own or his wifes opinion what one of us does not pretend to be as reticent as minervas owl and yet in his heart confess that a secret is apt to fly out of his bosom nature is full of rules and if the above should happen to be one of them it was illustrated in the third attack upon sir rolands secrecy for scarcely had he succeeded in baffling without offending his brotherinlaw when a servant brought him a summons from his mother lady valeria according to all modern writers whether of poetry or prose in our admirable language the daughter of an earl is always lovely graceful irresistible almost to as great an extent as she is unattainable this is but a natural homage on the part of nature to a power so far above her so that this daughter of an earl of thanet had been in every outward point whatever is delightful neither had she shown any slackness in turning to the best account these notable gifts in her favour in short she had been a very beautiful woman and had employed her beauty well in having her own will and way she had not married well it is true in the opinion of her compeers but she had pleased herself and none could say that she had lowered her family the ancestors of lord thanet had held in villeinage of the lorraines some three or four hundred years after the conquest until from being under so gentle a race they managed to get over them lady valeria knew all this and feeling as all women feel the ownership of her husband active or passive whichever it be she threw herself into the nest of lorraine and having no portion waived all past obligation to parental ties this was a noble act on her part as her husband always said he sir roger lorraine lay under her thumb as calmly as need be yet was pleased as the birth of children gave some distribution of pressure for the lady ruled the house and lands and all that was therein as if she had brought them under her settlement although sir roger had now been sleeping for a good many years with his fathers his widow lady valeria showed no sign of any preparation for sleeping with her mothers now in her eightysecond year this lady was as brisk and active at least in mind if not in body as half a century ago she had been many good stories and some even true were told concerning her doings and sayings in the time of her youth and beauty doings were always put first because for these she was more famous having the wit of ready action more than of rapid words perhaps and yet in the latter she was not slack when once she had taken up the quiver of the winged poison she had seen so much of the world and of the loftiest people that dwell thereinso far at least as they were to be found at the court of george the secondthat she sat in an upper stratum now over all she had to deal with and yet she was not of a narrow mind when unfolded out of her creases her set of rooms was the best in the house of all above the groundfloor at least and now she was waiting to receive her son with her usual little bit of state for the last five years she had ceased to appear at the table where once she ruled supreme and the servants who never had blessed her before blessed her and themselves for that happy change for she would have her due as firmly and fairly if not a trifle more so as and than she gave the same to others if undemanded in her upright seat she was now beginningnot to chafe for such a thing would have been below herbut rather to feel her sense of right and duty as owing to herself becoming more and more grievous to her the longer she was kept waiting she had learned long ago that she could not govern her son as absolutely as she was wont to rule his father and having a clearer perception of her own will than of large principles whenever she found him immovable she set the cause down as prejudice yet by feeling her way among these prejudices carefully and working filial duty hard and flying as a last resort to the stronghold of her many years she pretty nearly always managed to get her own way in everything but few of those who pride themselves on their knowledge of the human face would have perceived in this ladys features any shape of steadfast will perhaps the expression had passed away while the substance settled inwards but however that may have been her face was pleasant calm and gentle her manner also to all around her was courteous kind and unpretending and people believed her to have no fault until they began to deal with her her eyes not overhung with lid but delicately set and shaped were still bright and of a paleblue tint her forehead was not remarkably large but straight and of beautiful outline while the filaments of fine wrinkles took in some lights a cast of silver from snowy silkiness of hair for still she had abundant hair that crown of glory to old age and like a young girl she still took pleasure in having it drawn through the hands and done wisely and tired to the utmost vantage sir roland came into his mothers room with his usual care and diligence she with ancient courtesy rose from her straightbacked chair and offered him one little hand and smiled at him and from the manner of that smile he knew that she was not by any means pleased but thought it as well to conciliate him roland you know that i never pay heed she began with a voice that shook just a little to rumours that reach me through servants or even allow them to think of telling me dear mother of course you never do such a thing would be far beneath you well well you might wait till i have spoken before you begin to judge me if i listen to nothing i must be quite unlike all the other women in the world and so you are how well you express it at last you begin to perceive my dear mother what i perpetually urge in vainyour own superiority what mans mother can be expected to endure mild irony even half so well as his wife would roland this manner of speechi know not what to call it but i have heard of it among foreign people years agowhatever it is i beg you not to catch it from that boy hilary poetical justice sir roland exclaimed for his temper was always in good control by virtue of varied humour this is the selfsame whip wherewith i scourged little alice quite lately only i feel that i was far more just roland you are always just you may not be always wise of course but justice you have inherited from your dear father and from me and this is the reason why i wish to know what is the meaning of the strange reports which almost any one except myself would have been sure to go into or must have been told of long ago your thorough truthfulness i know and you have no chance to mislead me now i will imitate though perhaps i cannot equal your candour my dear mother by assuring you that i greatly prefer to keep my own counsel in this matter roland is that your answer you admit that there is something important and you refuse to let your own mother know it excuse me but i do not remember saying anything about importance i am not superstitious enough to suppose that the thing can have any importance then why should you make such a fuss about it really roland you are sometimes very hard to understand i was not aware that i had made a fuss sir roland answered gravely but if i have i will make no more now my dear mother what did you think of that extraordinary bill of bottlers bottler the pigman is a rogue said her ladyship peremptorily his father was a rogue before him and those things run in families but surely you cannot suppose that this is the proper way to treat the subject to my mind a most improper wayto condemn a mans bill on the ground that his father transmitted the right to overcharge now my dear son said lady valeria who never called him her son at all unless she was put out with him and her dear son only when she was at the extremity of endurancemy dear son these are sad attempts to disguise the real truth from me the truth i am entitled to know and the truth i am resolved to know and i think that you might have paid me the compliment of coming for my advice before finding her in this state of mind and being unable to deny the justice of her claim sir roland was fain at last to make a virtue of necessity while he marvelled as so many have done at the craft of people in spying things and espying them always wrongly is that all said lady valeria after listening carefully i thought there must have been something a little better than that to justify you in making it such a mystery nothing but a dusty old document and a strangelooking package or case like a cone however i do not blame you my dear roland for making so small a discovery the old astrologer appears to me to have grown a little childish now as i keep to the oldfashioned hours i will ask you to ring the bell for my tea and while it is being prepared you can fetch me the case itself and the document to examine to be sure my dear mother if you will only promise to obey the commands of the document roland i have lived too long ever to promise anything you shall read me these orders and then i can judge i will make no fuss about such a trifle he answered with a pleasant smile of course you will do what is honourable surely men although they deny so ferociously this impeachment are open at times to at least a little sideeddy of curiosity sir roland no doubt was desirous to know what were the contents of that old case which alice had taken for a dirty cushion as it lay at the back of the cupboard in the wall while his honour would not allow him comfortably to disobey the testators wish at the same time he felt every now and then that to treat such a matter in a serious light was a proof of superstition or even childishness on his part and now if his mother should so regard it he was not at all sure that he ought to take the unpleasant course of opposing her chapter xxii a malignant case sir roland smiled at his mothers position and air of stern attention as he came back from his bookroom with a small but heavy oaken box this he placed on a chair and without any mystery unlocked it but no sooner had he flung back the lid and shown the case above described than he was quite astonished at the expression of lady valerias face something more than fear a sudden terror as if at the sight of something fatal had taken the pale tint out of her cheeks and made her fine forehead quiver dear mother how foolish i am he said to worry you with these trifles i wish i had kept to my own opinion it is no trifle you would have been wrong to treat it as a trifle i have lived a long life and seen many strange things it takes more than a trifle to frighten me for a minute or two she lay back and was not fit to speak or be spoken to only she managed to stop her son from ringing for her maid or the housekeeper he had never beheld her so scared before and could scarcely make out her signs to him that she needed no attendance like most men who are at all good and just sir roland was prone to think softly and calmly instead of acting rapidly and now his mother so advanced in years showed less hesitation than he did recovering ere long from that sudden shock she managed to smile at herself and at his anxiety about her now roland i will not meddle with this formidable and clumsy thing it seems to be closed most jealously it has kept for two centuries and may keep for two more so far as i am concerned but if it will not be too troublesome to you i should like to hear what is said about it in this old document madam do you see how strangely it has been folded whoever did that knew a great deal more than now we know about folding the writing to me seems more strange than the folding what a cramped hand in what language is it written in greek the old greek character and the doric dialect he seems to have been proud of his classic descent and perhaps dorian lineage but he placed a great deal too much faith in the attainments of his descendants poor sedley would have read it straight off i daresay but the contractions and even some of the characters puzzled me dreadfully i have kept up as you know dear mother whatever little greek i was taught and perhaps have added to it but my old hedericus was needed a great many times i assure you before i got through this queer document and even now i am not quite certain of the meaning of one or two passages you see at the head a number of what i took at first to be hieroglyphics of some kind or other but i find that they are astral or sidereal signs for which i am none the wiser though perhaps an astronomer would be this for instance appears to mean the conjunction of some two planets and this never mind them roland read me what you have made out of the writing very well mother but if i am at fault you must have patience with me for i am not perfect in my lesson yet thus it begins behold ye men who shall be hereafter and pay heed to this matter a certain carian noble by birth and of noble character to whom is the not inglorious name agasicles syennesis hath lived not in the pursuit of wealth or power or reputation but in the unbroken study of the most excellent arts and philosophies especially in the heavenly stars and signs of the everlasting kosmos hath he disciplined his mind and surpassed all that went before him there is nothing like selfpraise is there now dear mother i have no doubt that he speaks the truth answered the lady valeria i did not marry into a family accustomed to exaggerate then what do you think of this not only in intellect and forethought but also in goodwill and philanthropy modesty and selfforgetfulness did this man win the prize of excellence and he it is who now speaks to you having lived much time in a barbarous island cold and blown over with vaporous air he is no longer of such a sort as he was in the land of the fair afternoons and there is when it is to his mind a manifest and established thing that the gates of hades are open for him and the time of being no longer but he holds this to be of the smallest difference if only the gods produce his time to the perfect end of all the things lying now before him how good and how truly pious of him roland such a mans daughter never could have had any right to run away from him my dear mother i disagree with you if he always praised himself in that style but let him speak for himself again as he seems to know very well how to do these things have not been said indeed for the sake of any boasting but rather to bring out thoroughly forward the truth in these things lying under as if it were a pavement of adamant now therefore know ye that agasicles carefully pondering everything has found so to say the word an end to accomplish and to abide in and this is no other thing than to save the generations descended from him from great evil fortunes about to fall by the illwill of some divinity at a destined time upon them for a man of birth so renowned and lofty has not been made to resemble a handworker or a runaway slave but has many stars regarding him from many generations and now he perceives that his skill and wisdom were not given to him to be a mere personal adornment but that he might protect his descendants to the remote futurity to him thenit having been revealed that in the seventh generation hence as has often come to pass with our house or haply in the tenth for the time is misty a great calamity is bound to happen to those born afar off from syennesisthe sage has laboured many labours though he cannot avert at least to make it milder and to lessen it he has not indeed been made to know at least up to the present time what this bane will be or whether after the second or after the third century from this period but knowing the swiftness of evil chance he expects it at the earlier time and whatever its manner or kind may be agasicles in all his discoveries has discovered no cure for human evils save that which he now has shut up in a box this box has been so constructed that nothing but dust will meet the greedy eyes of any who force it open in the manner of the tomb of nitocris but if be opened with the proper key and after the proper interval when the due need has arisenthere will be a fairer sight than ever broke upon mortal eyes before there mother now what do you think of all that i am quite out of breath with my long translation and i am not quite sure of all of it for instance where he says roland his mother answered quickly i am now much older than the prince according to tradition can have been but i make no pretence to his wisdom and i have reasons of my own for wondering what have you done with the key of that case i have never seen it it was not in the closet and i meant to have searched throughout his room until i found out the meaning of this very crabbed postscriptthat fool memel hath lost the key it will cost me months to make another my hands now tremble and my eyes are weak if there be no key found herewith let it be read that nature whom i have vanquished hath avenged herself whether or no have i laboured in vain be blest now and bless me my dear descendants that appears to me said the lady valeria being left in good manners by her son to express the first opinion to be of the whole of this strange affair the part that is least satisfactory my dear mother you have hit the mark what satisfaction can one find in having a case without a key and knowing that if we force it open there will be nothing but dust inside not a quarter so good as a snuffbox i must have a pinch my dear mother excuse me while you meditate on this subject you are far more indulgent in that respect than little alice ever is all gentlemen take snuff said the lady who is alice to lay down the law your father took a boxful three times a week roland you let that young girl take great liberties with you it is not so much that i let her take them i have no voice in the matter now she takes them without asking me possibly that is the great calamity foretold by the astrologer if not what other can it be do you think not so she answered with a serious air for all her experience of the witty world had left her old age quite dry of humour the trouble if any is coming will not be through alice but through hilary alice is certainly a flighty girl romantic and full of nonsense and not at all such as she might have been if left more in my society however she never has thought it worth while to associate much with her grandmother the result of which is that her manners are unformed and her mind is full of nonsense but she has plenty and if it were possible too much of that great preservativepride of birth alice may come to affliction herself but she never will involve her family any affliction of hers said sir roland will involve at least her father yes yes of course but what i mean is the honour and rank of the family it is my favourite hilary my dear brave handsome hilary who is likely to bring care on our heads or rather upon your head roland my time of course will be over then unless he is very quick about it he will not be so quick as that i hope sir roland answered with some little confusion of proper sentiments although in that hotbed of mischief london nobody knows when he may begin however he is not in london at present according to your friend lady de lampnor i think you said you had heard so from her to be sure mr malahide told her himself the dear boy has overworked himself so that he has gone to some healthy and quiet place to recruit his exhausted energies dear me said sir roland i could never believe it unless i knew from experience what a very little work is enough to upset him to write a letter to his father for instance is so severe an exertion that he requires a holiday the next day now roland dont be so hard upon him you would apprentice him to that vile law which is quite unfit for a gentleman i am not surprised at his being overcome by such odious labour you would not take my advice remember and put him into the only profession fit for one of his birththe army whatever happens the fault is your own it is clear however that he cannot get into much mischief where he is just nowa rural and quiet part of kent she says it shows the innocence of his heart to go there very likely but if he wanted change he might have asked leave to come home i think however we shall have him here soon enough how you speak roland quite as if you cared not a farthing for your only son it must be dreadfully galling to him to see how you prefer that alice if he is galled he never winces answered sir roland with a quiet smile he is the most careless fellow in the world and the most goodnatured and the most affectionate said lady valeria warmly nothing else could keep him from being jealous as nine out of ten would be however i am tired of talking now and on that subject i might talk for ever take away that case if you please and the writing on no account would i have them left here of course you will lock them away securely and not think of meddling with them what is that case made of i can scarcely make out something strong and heavy a mixture i think of shagreen and some metal but the oddest thing of all is the keyhole it is at the top of the cone you see and of the strangest shape an irregular heptagon with some rare complications of points inside it would be next to impossible to open this case without shattering it altogether i do not wish to examine the case i wish to have it taken away my son there there i am very glad not to see it although i am sure i am not superstitious we shall do very well i trust without it i think it is a most extraordinary thing that your father never consulted me about the writing handed down to you he must have been bound by some pledge not to do so there roland i am tired of the subject with these words the ancient lady waved her delicate hand and dismissed her son who kissed her white forehead according to usage and then departed with case and parchment locked in the oaken box again but the more he thought over her behaviour the more he was puzzled about it he had fully expected a command to open the case at whatever hazard and perhaps he had been disappointed at receiving no such order but above all he wanted to know why his mother should have been taken aback as she was by the sight of these little things for few people even in the prime of life possessed more selfcommand and courage than lady valeria now advancing into her eightysecond year chapter xxiii the baiter baited at the top of the hill these lofty themes were being handled worthily while at the bottom little cares had equal glance of the democrat sun but no stars allotted to regard them in plain englishbonny and jack were as busy as their betters they had taken their usual round that morning seeking the staff of lifeif that staff be applicable to a donkeyin village hamlet and farmhouse or among the lanes and hedges the sympathy and goodwill between them daily grew more intimate and their tastes more similar so that it scarcely seemed impossible that bonny in the end might learn to eat clover and jack to rejoice in money open air and roving life the ups and downs of want and weal the freedom of having nothing to lose and the joyful luck of finding thingsthese and perhaps a little spice of unknown sweetness in living at large on their fellowcreatures labours combined to make them as happy a pair as the day was long or the weather good in the winterah why should we think of such trouble perhaps there will never be winter again at any rate bonny was sitting in front of the door of his castle or rather in front of the doorway because he was happy enough not to have a door as proud and contented as if there could never be any more winter of discontent he had picked up a hat in a ditch that day lost by some man going home from his inn and knowing from his patron the pigman bottler that the surest token of a blameless life is to be found in the hat of a man the boy stirred by the first heave of ambition had put on this hat and was practising hatcraft having gone with his head as it was born hitherto to the utter surprise and with the puzzled protest of his beloved donkey it was a most steady churchgoing hat of the chimneypot order then newly imported into benighted regions but now of the essence of a godly life all over this free country neither was it such a shocking bad hat as a man would cast away if his wife were near for bonnys young head it was a world too wide but he had padded it with a blackbirds nest and though it seemed scarcely in harmony with his rakish waistcoat and bare red shanks spread on the grass for exhibition and starred with myriad furze and bramble still he was conscious of a distinguished air and nodded to the donkey to look at him while these were gazing at one another with free interchange of opinion the rector of the parish on his little pony turned the corner bluntly he was on his way home at the bottom of the coombe not in the very best temper perhaps in spite of the sport in prospect because sir roland had met so unkindly his kind desire to know things what have you got on your lap boy mr hales so strongly shouted that sulky echo pricked her ears and on your lap boy went all up the lonely coombe melodiously bonny knew well what was on his lapa cleverlyplaited harewire bottler had shown him how to do it and now he was practising diligently under the auspices of his first hat mr hales was a beak of course and the aquiline beak of the neighbourhood bonny had the honour of his acquaintance in that fierce aspect and in no other the little boy knew that there was a church and that great people went there once aweek for still greater people to blow them up but this only made him the more uneasy to clap his bright eyes on the parson hold there whoa called the rev struan as bonny for his life began to cut away boy i want to talk to you bonny was by no means touched with this very fine benevolence taking perhaps a low view of duty he made the ground hot to escape what we now call the sacerdotal office but struan hales unlike our parsons knew how to manage the laity he clapped himself and his pony in no time between master bonny and his hole and then in calm dignity called a halt with his ridingwhip ready at his buttonhole it isit isit is cried bonny coming back with his head on his chest and meaning in the idiom of the land that now he was beaten and would hold parley to be sure it is the rector answered keeping a good balance on his pony and well pleased with his own tactics he might have chased bonny for an hour in vain through the furze and heather and blackberries but here he had him at his mercy quite through his knowledge of human nature to put it coarselyas the rector did in his mental process haplythe bigger thief anybody is the more sacred to him is his property not that bonny was a thief at all still that was how mr hales looked at it in the flurry of conscience the boy forgot that a camel might go through the eye of a needle with less exertion than the parish incumbent must use to get into the bonnycastle oh hoo oh hoo oh hoo howled bonny having no faith in clerical honour and foreseeing the sack of his palace and home give me that wire said mr hales in a voice from the depth of his waistcoat now my boy would you like to be a good boy no sir no sir oh no plaize sir jack nor me couldnt bear it sir why not my boy it is such a fine thing your face shows that you are a sharp boy why do you go on living in a hole and poaching and picking and stealing plaize sir i never steals nothin without it is somethin as dont belong to me that may be but why should you steal even that shall i go in and steal your things now oh hoo oh hoo oh hoo plaize sir i hant got nothin for e to steal i am not at all sure of that said the rector looking at the hermits hole longingly a thiefs den is often as good as the bank now who taught you how to make this snare i thought i knew them all pretty well but this wire has a dodge quite new to me who taught you you young scamp this moment plaize sir i cant tell e sir nobody taught me as i knows on you young liar you couldnt teach yourself what you mean is that you dont choose to tell me know i must and know i will if i have to thrash it out of you he had seized him now by his gorgeous waistcoat and held the strong horsewhip over his back now will you tell or will you not i ont i ont if e kills me i ont the boy cried wriggling vainly and with great tears of anticipation rolling down his sunburnt cheeks the parson admired the pluck of the boy knowing his own great strength of course and feeling that if he began to smite the swing of his arm would increase his own wrath and carry him perhaps beyond reason therefore he offered him one chance more will you tell sir or will you not i ont tell that i ont screamed bonny and at the word the lash descended but only once for the smiter in a moment was made aware of a dusty rush a sharp roar of wrath and great teeth flashing under mighty jaws and perhaps he would never have walked again if he had not most suddenly wheeled his pony and just escaped a tremendous snap well aimed at his comely and gaitered calf ods bods cried the parson as he saw the jackass with a stretchedout neck and crest erect eyes flashing fire and a lashing tail and worst of all terrors those cavernous jaws gathering legs for a second charge like an attic trireme phormios own backing water for the diecplus may i be dashed the rector shouted if i deal any more with such animals if i had only got my huntingcrop but kuk kuk kuk pony quick for gods sake off with you with a whack of full power on the ponys flanks away went he at full gallop while jack tossed his white nose with high disdain and then started at a round trot in pursuit to scatter them more disgracefully and after them sent a fine flourish of trumpets to the grand old national air of heehaw while the rev struan hales was thus in sore discomfiture fleeing away as hard as his pony could be made to go and casting uneasy glances over one shoulder at his pursuer behold he almost rode over a traveller footing it lightly round a corner of the lane why uncle struan exclaimed the latter is the dragon of st leonards flying after you or is this the usual style of riding of the beneficed clergy hilary my dear boy answered the rector who would have thought of seeing you you are just come in time to defend your uncle from a ravenous beast of prey i was going home to bait a badger but i have had a pretty good bait myself ah you pagan you may well be ashamed of yourself to attack your clergyman for jack perceiving the reinforcement and eyeing the stout stick which hilary bore prudently turned on his tail and departed well satisfied with his exploit why hilary what has brought you home asked his uncle when a few words had passed concerning jacks behaviour nobody expects you that i know of your father is a mysterious man but alice would have been sure to tell me moreover you must have walked all the way from the stage by the look of your buckles or perhaps from brighton even no i took the short cut over the hills and across by way of beeding nobody expects me as you say i am come on important business and of course i am not to know what it is for mystery and for keeping secrets there never was such a family as if you did not belong to it uncle hilary answered goodnaturedly i never heard of any secrets that i can remember and good reason too replied the rector they would not long have been secrets my boy after they came to your ears i doubt then let me establish my reputation by keeping my own at any rate but after all it is no secret uncle only my father ought to know it first alas you rogue you rogue something about money no doubt you used to condescend to come to me when you were at school and college but now you are too grand for the purse of any poor sussex rector i could put off our badger for halfanhour if you think you could run down the hill again i should like you particularly to see young fox it will be something grand my boy he is the best pup i ever had in all my life i know him uncle i know what he is i chose him first out of the litter you know but you must not think of waiting for me if i come down the hill again it will only be about eight oclock for an hours rabbitshooting since he first met mabel lovejoy hilary had been changing much and in every way for the better her gentleness and soft regard and simple love of living things at a time when cruelty was the rule and kindness the rare exception together with her knowledge of a great deal more than he had ever noticed in the world around made him feel in his present vein of tender absence from her as if he never could bear to see the baiting of any badger therefore he went on his way to his father pitying all things that were tormented chapter xxiv a fatherly suggestion sir roland lorraine in his little bookroom after that long talk with his mother had fallen back into the chair of reflection now growing more and more dear to him he hoped for at least a good hour of peace to think of things and to compare them with affairs that he had read of it was all a trifle of course and not to be seriously dwelt upon no man could have less belief in star or comet or even sun as glancing out of their proper sphere or orbit at the dust of earth no man smiled more disdainfully at the hornbooks of seers and astrologers and no man kept his own firm doubtings to himself more carefully and yet he was touched as nobody now would be in a case of that sort perhaps by the real grandeur of that old man in devoting himself according to his lights to the stars that might come after him of these the brightest now broke in and the dreamers peace was done for what man has not his own queer little turns sir roland knew quite well the step at the doorfor hilarys walk was beyond mistake yet what did he do but spread hands on his forehead and to the utmost of all his abilitysleep hilary looked at his male parent with affectionate sagacity he had some little doubts about his being asleep or at any rate quite so heartily as so good a man had a right to repose therefore instead of withdrawing he spoke my dear father i hope you are well i am sorry to disturb you buthow do you do sir how do you do the schoolboys rude answer to this kind inquirynone the better for seeing youpassed through hilarys mind at least if it did not enter his fathers however they saluted each other as warmly as can be expected reasonably of a british father and a british son and then they gazed at one another as if it was the first time either had enjoyed that privilege hilary i think you are grown sir roland said to break the silence and save his lips from the curve of a yawn it is time for you to give up growing i gave it up sir two years ago if the standard measures of the realm are correct but perhaps you refer to something better than material increase if so sir i am pleased that you think so of course you are his father answered you would have grown out of yourself to have grown out of pleasant selfcomplacency how did you leave mr malahide very well ah i am glad to hear it the law is the healthiest of professions and that your countenance vouches but such a colour requires food after fifty miles of travelling we shall not dine for an hour and a half ring the bell and i will order something while you go and see your grandmother no thank you sir if you can spare the time i should like to have a little talk with you it is that which has brought me down from london in this rather unceremonious way spare me apologies hilary because i am so used to this it is a great pleasure to see you of course especially when you look so well quite as if there was no such thing as moneywhich happens to you continually and is your panacea for moneyed cares but would not the usual form have donea large sheet of paper with tenpence to pay and my dear father i have no ready cashyour dutiful son h l no my dear father said hilary laughing in recognition of his favourite form it is a much more important affair this time money of course i have none but still i look upon that as nothing you cannot say i ever show any doubt as to your liberality you are quite right i have never complained of such diffidence on your part but what is this matter far more important than money in your estimate well i scarcely seem to know said hilary gathering all his courage whether there is in all the world a thing so important as money that is quite a new view for you to take you have thrown all your money right and left may i hope that this view will be lasting yes i think sir that you may i am about to do a thing which will make money very scarce with me i can think of nothing his father answered with a little impatience at his prologues which can make money any scarcer than it always is with you i know that you are honourable and that you scorn low vices when that has been said of you hilary there is very little more to say there might have been something more to say my dear father but for you you have treated me always as a gentleman treats a younger gentleman dependent upon himand no more you have exchanged as you are doing now little snapshots with me as if i were a sharpshooter and upon a level with you i am not upon a level with you and if it is kind it is not fair play sir roland looked at him with great surprise this was not like hilary hilary perhaps had never been under fatherly control as he ought to be but still he had taken things easily as yet and held himself shy of conflict i scarcely understand you hilary sir roland answered quietly if you have any grievance surely there will be time to discuss it calmly during the long vacation which you are now beginning so early i fear sir that i shall not have the pleasure of spending my long vacation here i have done a thing which i am not sure that you will at all approve of that is to say you are quite sure that i shall disapprove of it no my dear father i hope not quite so bad at that at any rate i shall be quite resigned to leave you to think of it at your leisure it is simply thisi have made up my mind if i can obtain your consent to get married indeed exclaimed the father with a smile of some contempt i will not say that i am surprised for nothing you do surprises me but who has inspired this new whim and how long will it endure all my life the youth replied with fervour and some irritation for his father alone of living beings knew how to irritate him all my life sir as sure as i live can you never believe that i am in earnest she must be a true enchantress so to have improved your character may i venture to ask who she is to be sure sir she lives in kent and her name is mabel lovejoy the daughter of mr martin lovejoy lovejoy a danish name i believe and an old one in its proper form what is mr martin lovejoy by profession or otherwise by profession he is a very worthy and longestablished grower a grower i fail to remember that branch of the liberal professions a grower sir is a gentleman who grows the fruits of the earth for the good of others what we should call a spade husbandman perhaps a healthful and classic industryunder the towers of balia i beg to be excused all further discussion as i never use strong language perhaps you will go and enlist your grandmothers sympathy with this loyal attachment to the daughter of the grower but sir if you will only allow me of course if i would only allow you to describe her virtuesbut that is just what i have not the smallest intention of allowing spread the wings of imagination to a more favourable breeze this interview must close on my part with a suggestive but perhaps selfevident proposition hilary the door is open chapter xxv the well of the sibyl in the village of west lorraine which lies at the foot of the south down ridge there lived at this moment and had lived for three generations of common people an extraordinary old woman of the name of nanny stilgoe she may have been mentioned before because it was next to impossible to keep out of her whenever anybody whosoever wanted to speak of the neighbourhood for miles and miles around she was acknowledged to know everything and the only complaint about her was concerning her humility she would not pretend to be a witch while everybody felt that she ought to be and most people were sure that she was one alice lorraine was wellaccustomed to have many talks with nanny listening to her queer old sayings and with young eyes gazing at the wisdom or folly of the bygone days nanny of course was pleased with this still she was too old to make a favourite now of any one people going slowly upward towards a better region have a vested interest still in earth but in mankind a mere shifting remainder therefore all the grace of alice and her clever ways and sweetness and even half a pound of tea and an ounce and a half of tobacco could not tempt old nanny stilgoe to say what was not inside of her everybody made her much more positive in everything according as the months went on and she knew less and less what became of them by calling upon her at every new moon to declare to them something or other it was not in her nature to pretend to deceive anybody and she found it harder from day to day to be right in all their trifles but her best exertions were always forthcoming on behalf of coombe lorraine both as containing the most conspicuous people of the neighbourhood and also because in her early days she had been a trusty servant under lady valeria old nannys age had become by this time almost an unknown quantity several years being placed to her credit as is almost always done to which she was not entitled but at any rate she looked back upon her former mistress lady valeria as comparatively a chicken and felt some contempt for her judgment because it could not have grown ripe as yet therefore the venerable mrs stilgoe proclaimed by the public voice as having long since completed her century cannot have been much under ninety in the year of grace being of a rather stiff and decidednot to say crabbedturn of mind this old woman kept a small cottage to herself at the bend of the road beyond the blacksmiths close to the well of st hagydor this cottage was not only free of rent but her own for the term of her natural life by deed of gift from sir roger lorraine in gratitude for a brave thing she had done when roland was a baby having received this desirable cottage and finding it followed by no others she naturally felt that she had not been treated altogether well by the family and her pension of three halfcrowns aweek and her sunday dinner in a basin made an old woman of her before her time and only set people talking in spite of all this nanny was full of goodwill to the family forgiving them all their kindness to her and even her own dependence upon them foretelling their troubles plentifully and never failing to enhance them and now on the very day after young hilarys conflict with his father she had the good luck to meet alice lorraine on her way to the rectory to consult uncle struan or beg him to intercede for the young man had taken his father at his word concluding that the door not only of the room but also of the house was open for him in the inhospitable sense and casting off his native dust from his gaiters he had taken the evening stage to london after a talk with his favourite alice old nanny stilgoe had just been out to gather a few sticks to boil her kettle and was hobbling home with the fagot in one hand and in the other a stout staff chosen from it which she had taken to help her along she wore no bonnet or cap on her head but an old red kerchief tied round it from which a scanty irongrey lock escaped and fluttered now and then across the rugged features and haggard cheeks her eyes though sunken were bright and keen and few girls in the parish could thread a fine needle as quickly as she could but extreme old age was shown in the countless seams and puckers of her face in the knobby protuberance where bones met and above all in the dull wan surface of skin whence the life was retiring now nanny i hope you are well today alice said kindly though by no means eager to hold discourse with her just now you are working hard i see as usual ay ay working hard the same as us all be born to and goes out of the world with the sweat of our brow not the likes of you miss alice all the world be made to fit you the same as a pudding do to a basin now nanny you ought to know better than that there is nobody born to such luck and to keep it shall i carry your fagot for you how cleverly you do tie them ee may carr the fagot as far as ee wool ee wunt goo very far i count the skin of thee isnt thick enow there set un down now beside of the well what be all this news about haylery news about hilary nanny stilgoe why who has told you anything theres many a thing as comes to my knowledge without no need of telling he have broken with his father havent he ho ho ho nanny you never should talk like that as if you thought it a very fine thing after all you have had to do with us and all i owes you oh yes yes no need to be bringing it to my mind when i gets it in a basin every sunday now mrs stilgoe you must remember that it was your own wish to have it so you complained that the gravy was gone into grease and did we expect you to have a great fire and you came up and chose a brown basin yourself and the cloth it was to be tied in and you said that then you would be satisfied well well you know it all by heart i never pays heed to them little things i leaves all of that for the great folk howsever i have a good right to be told what doth not consarn no strangers you said that you knew it all without telling the story however is too true this time but i hope it may be for a short time only all along of a chield of a girlwarnt it all along of that boys thinks they be sugarplums always till they knows en better why nanny now how rude you are what am i but a child of a girl much better i hope than a sugarplum dont tell me now you see the water in that well clear and bright and not so deep as this here stick of mine is beautifully cool and sparkling even after the long hot weather how i wish we had such a well on the hill what a comfort it must be to you holy water they calls it dont em holy water tino but it do well enough to boil the kittle when there be no frogs in it my father told me that his grandfather or one of his forebears afore him seed this well in the middle of a great roaring torrent ten feet over top of this here top step it came all the way from your hill he said it fetched more water than adur river and the track of it can be followed now i have heard of it answered alice with a little shiver of superstition i have always longed to know more about it the less you knows of it the better for ee pray to the lord every night young woman that you may never see it oh that is all superstition nanny i should like to see it particularly i never could understand how it came though it seems to be clear that it does come it has only come twice in five hundred years according to what they say of it i have heard the old rhyme about it everoh ever since i can remember so have i heered but they never gets things right now they be so careless how have you heered of it miss alice like thisas near as i can remember when the woeburn brake the plain ill it boded for lorraine when the woeburn came again death and dearth it brought lorraine if it ever floweth more reign of the lorraines is oer did i say it right now nanny yes child near enough leastways but you havent said the last verse at all only this can save lorraine one must plunge to rescue twain why i never heard those two lines nanny like enough they never cares to finish anything nowadays but that there verse belongeth to it as sure as any of the psalms of david ive heerd my father say it scores of times and he had it from his grandfather sit you down on the stone child a minute while i go in and start the fire up scarcely a bit of wood fit to burn round any of the hedges now they thieving children goes everywhere makes my poor back stiff it doth to get enow to boil a cows foot or a rind of bakkon old nanny had her own good reasons for not wanting alice in her cottage just then because she was going to have for dinner a rind of bacon truly but also as companion thereto a nice young rabbit with onion sauce a rabbit feesimple whereof was legally vested in sir roland lorraine but bottler the pigman took seizin thereof vi et armis and conveyed it habendum coquendum et vorandum to mrs nanny stilgoe in payment for a pigcharm meanwhile alice thought sadly over the many uncomfortable legends concerning her ancient and dwindled race the first outbreak of the woeburn in the time of edward the third ad was said to have brought forth deadly poison from the hillside whence it sprang it ran for seven months according to the story to be found in one of their earliest records confirmed by an inscription in the church and the earl of lorraine and his seven children died of the black death within that time only a posthumous son was left to carry on the lineage the fatal water then subsided for a hundred and eleven years when it broke forth suddenly in greater volume and ran for three months only but in that short time the fortune of the family fell from its loftiest to its lowest and never thenceforth was it restored to the ancient eminence and wealth on towton field in as bloody a battle as ever was fought in england the lorraines though accustomed to driving snow perished like a snowdrift the bill of attainder passed with hot speed by a slavish parliament took away family rank and lands and left the last of them an outcast with the block prepared for him nanny having set that coney boiling and carefully latched the door hobbled at her best pace back to alice and resumed her subject holy water oh ho ho holy to old nick i reckon and that be why her boileth over so three wells there be in a row you know miss all from that same spring i count the well in parsons garden and this and the uppest one under the foot of your hill above where that gipsy boy harboureth that be where the woeburn breaketh ground you mean where the moss and the cottongrass is but you can scarcely call it a well there now it dothnt run much very like and i hant been up that way for a year or more but only you try to walk over it child and youd walk into your grave i hold the time is nigh up for it to come out according to what they tells of it very well nanny let it come out what a treat it would be this hot summer the adur is almost dry and the shepherdpits everywhere are empty then you pay no heed child what is to come of it if it ever comes out again worse than ever comed afore to such a lot as you be i cannot well see how it could be worse than death and dearth and slaughter nanny now that shows how young girls will talk without any thought of anything to us poor folk it be wise and right to put life afore anything according to natur and arter that the things as must go inside of us there let me think let me think a bit i forgets things now but i know there be someat as you great folks count more than life and victuals and natur and everythin but i forgets the word you uses for it honour nanny i suppose you meanthe honour of course of the family may be someat of that sort as you builds up your mind upon well that be running into danger now if the old words has any truth in em nonsense nanny ill not listen to you which of us is likely to disgrace our name pray i am tired of all these nursery stories goodbye mrs stilgoe itll not be you at any rate the old woman muttered wrathfully as alice with sparkling eyes and a quick firm step set off for the rectory if ever there was a proud piece of goodseven my bacco herll never think of in her tantrums now ah well ah well we lives and we learns to hold our tongues in the end no doubt the old ladys judgment of the world was a little too harsh in this case however for alice lorraine on her homeward way left the usual shillingsworth of tobacco on old nannys windowsill chapter xxvi an opportune envoy it is worse than useless to talk any more sir roland said to mr hales who by entreaty of alice had come to dine there that day and to soften things struan you know that i have not one atom of obstinacy about me i often doubt what is right and wonder at people who are so positive in this case there is no room for doubt were you pleased with your badger yesterday a capital brock a most wonderful brock his teeth were like a rattrap fox however was too much for him the dear little dog how he did go in i gave the ten guineas to my three girls good girls thoroughly good girls all they never fall in love with anybody and when have they had a new dressalthough they are getting now quite old enough i never notice those things much sir roland who had given them many dresses answered most inhumanly but they always look very good and pretty struan let us drink their healths and happy wedlock to them the rector looked at sir roland with a surprise of geniality his custom was always to help himself while his host enjoyed by proxy this went against his fine feelings sadly still it was better to have to help himself than be unhelped altogether but about that young fellow mr hales continued after the toast had been duly honoured it is possible to be too hard you know that sentiment is not new to me struan you like a capeling with your port better than any olive always and now there are no olives to be had wars everywhere wars universal the powers of hell gat hold of me antichrist in triumph roaring bloodshed weltering everywhere and i am too old myself and i have no son totoo fight for old england a melancholy thought but you were always pugnacious struan now roland roland you know me better to seek peace and to ensue it is my text and my tactic everywhere and with them that be of one household what saith st paul the apostle in his epistle to the ephesians you think that i know no theology roland because i can sit a horse and shoot nay nay struan be not thus hurt by imaginary lesions the great range of your powers is well known to me as it is to every one particularly to that boy whom you shot in the hedge last season no more of that an you love me i believe the little rascal peppered himself to get a guinea out of me but as to hilary will you allow me to say a few words without any offence i am his own mothers brother as you seem very often to forget and i cannot bear to see a fine young fellow condemned and turned out of house and home for what any young fellow is sure to do boys are sure to go falling in love until their whiskers are fully grown and the very way to turn fools into heroes in their own opinion is to be violent with them perhaps those truths are not new to me but i was not violenti never am at any rate you were harsh and stern and who are you to find fault with him i care not if i offend you roland until your better sense returns but did you marry exactly in your own rank of life yourself i married a lady struan halesyour sisterunless i am misinformed to be sure to be sure i know well enough what you mean by that though you have the most infernal way of keeping your temper and hinting things what you mean is that i am making little of my own sisters memory by saying that she was not your equal i meant nothing of the sort how very hot your temper is i showed my respect for your family struan and simply implied that it was not graceful at any rate on your part graceful be hanged sir roland i cannot express myself as you canand perhaps i ought to thank god for thatbut none the less for all that i know when i am in the right i feel when i am in the right sir and i snap my fingers at every one that is right you have an unequalled power of explosion in your thumbjointi heard it through three oaken doors the last time you were at all in a passion and now it will go through a wall at least nature has granted you this power to exhibit your contempt of wrong roland i have no power at all i do not pretend to be clever at words and i know that you laugh at my preaching i am but a peg in a hole i know compared with all your learning though my churchwarden gates wont hear of it what did he say last sunday something very good of course help yourself struan and out with it well it was nothing very wonderful and as he holds under you sir roland i will not turn him out for even the most brilliant flash of his bramblehook you never turn anybody out i wish to goodness you would sometimes you dont care about your rents but i do care about my tithes this is deeply disappointing after the wit you were laden with what was the epigram of churchwarden gates never you mind that will keeplike some of your own mysteries you want to know everything and tell nothing as the old fox did in the fable it is an ancient aphorism sir roland answered gently that knowledge is tenfold better than speech let us endeavour to know things struan and to satisfy ourselves with knowledge yes yes let us know things roland but you never want us to know anything that is just the point you see now as sure as i hold this glass in my hand you will grieve for what you are doing i am doing nothing struan only wondering at your excitement doing nothing do you call it nothing to drive your only son from your doors and to exasperate your brotherinlaw until he blames the lord for being the incumbent instead of a curate to swear more freely there there i will say no more none but my own people ever seem to know what is inside of me no more wine sir roland thank you not so much as a single drop more i will go while there is good light down the hill you will do nothing of the kind struan hales his host replied in that clear voice which is so certain to have its own clear way you will sit down and take another glass of port and talk with me in a friendly manner well well anything to please you you are marvellous hard to please of late you will find me most easy to please if only without any further reproaches or hinting at things which cannot concern you you will favour me with your calm opinion in this foolish affair of poor hilary the whole thing is one you so limit me said the parson delighted to give advice but loth to be too cheap with it you must perceive roland that all this matter is bound up so to speak altogether you shake your head well then let us suppose that poor hilary stands on his own floor only every tub on its own bottom then what i should do about him would be this i would not write him a single line but let him abide in his breaches or breecheswhichever the true version isand there he will soon have no halfpence to rattle and therefore must grow penitent meanwhile i should send into kent an envoy a man of penetration to see what manner of people it is that he is so taken up with and according to his report i should act and thus we might very soon break it off without any action for damages you know what those blessed attorneys are sir roland thought for a little while and then he answered pleasantly struan your advice is good i had thought of that course before you came the stupid boy soon will be brought to reason because he is frightened of credit now he was so singed at oxford and i can trust him to do nothing dishonourable or coldblooded but the difficulty of the whole plan is this whom have i that i can trust to go into kent and give a fair report about this mercenary grower and his crafty daughter could you trust me roland of course i could but struan you never would do such a thing why not i should like to know why not i could get to the place in two days time and the change would do me a world of good you laity can never understand what it is to be a parson a deacon would come for a guinea and take my sunday morning duty and the congregation for the afternoon would rejoice to be disappointed and when i come back they will dwell on my words because the other man will have preached so much worse times are hard with me roland just now if i go will you pay the piper not only that struan but i shall thank you to the uttermost stretch of gratitude there will be no gratitude on either side i am bound to look after my nephews affairs and i sadly want to get away from home i have heard that there is a nice trout stream there if hilary who knows all he knows from me could catch a fine fish as alice told mewhat am i likely to do after panting up in this redhot chalk so long roland i must have a pipe though you hate it i let you sneeze and you must let me blow well struan you can do what you like for this once this is so very kind of you i believe if you had let that boy hilary smoke said the rector warming unto his pipe you never would have had all this bother with him about this trumpery loveaffair cupid hates tobacco chapter xxvii a good parsons holiday on the second evening after the above discourse a solitary horseman might have been seen or to put it more indicatively a lonely ponyman was seen pricking gallantly over the plains and into the good town of tonbridge in the land of kent behind him and strapped to his saddle he bore what used to be called a vady that is to say a small leather cylinder containing change of raiment and other small comforts of the traveller the pony he bestrode was black with a white star on her forehead a sturdy trudger of a spirited nature and proud of the name of maggie she had now recovered entirely from her tenguinea feast of dahlias and was as pleased as the rector himself to whisk her tail in a change of air her pace was quite brisk and her ears well pricked especially when she smelled the smell which all country towns have of horses and of rubbing down hissing and bucketing and best of all of good oats jumping in a sieve among the chaff maggie was proud of her master and thought him the noblest man that ever cracked a whip having imbibed this opinion from the young smart hunter who was up to everything and it might have fared ill with jack the donkey if maggie had carried her master when that vile assault was perpetrated but if maggie was now in good spirits what lofty flight of words can rise to the elation of her rider the rector now week after week had been longing for a bit of sport his open and jovial nature had been shut up pinched and almost poisoned for want of proper outlet he hated books and he hated a pen and he hated doing nothing and he never would have horsewhipped bonny if he had been as he ought to be moreover he had been greatly bothered although he could not clearly put it by all these reports about coombe lorraine and sir rolands manner of scorning them but now here he was in a wayfaring dress free from the knowledge of any one able to turn to the right or the left as either side might predominate with a bagful of guineas to spend as his own and yet feel no remorse about them tush that does not express it at all with a bagful of guineas to spend as he chose and rejoice in the knowledge that he was spending another mans money for his own good and the benefit of humanity this is a fine feeling and a rare one to get the luck of therefore whosoever gets it let him lift up his heart and be joyful whether from that fine diffidence which so surely accompanies merit or from honourable economy in the distribution of trustfunds or from whatever other cause it wasin the face of all the town of tonbridge this desirable traveller turned his pony into the quiet yard of the oldfashioned inn the chequers all the other ostlers grunted disapprobation and chewed straws while the one ostler of the chequers rattled his pail with a swing of his elbow hissed in the most enticing attitude and made believe to expect it mr hales in the manner of a cattlejobber which was his presentment now lifted his right leg over the mane of the pony and so came downward everybody in the yard at once knew thoroughly well what his business was and nobody attempted to cheat him in the inn because it is known to be a hopeless thing to cheat a cattlejobber in any other way than by gambling so that with little to say or be said this unclerkly clerk had a good supper and smoked a wise pipe with his landlord of course he made earnest inquiries about all the farmers of the neighbourhood and led the conversation gently to the grower and his affairs and as this chanced to be master lovejoys own house of call at tonbridge the landlord gave him the highest character and even the title of esquire ah yes he exclaimed with his rummer in one hand and waving his pipe with the other there be few in these here parts to compare with squire lovejoy one of the true old kentish stock sir none of your comeandgo bagmen i have heered say that that land have been a thousand year in the family lord bless me cried mr hales why we get back to the time of the danes and saxons there now said the landlord giving him a poke of admiration with his pipe you knows all about it as well as if i had told ee and his family brought up so respectable none of your sitting on pillions a horse for his self and a horse for his son and a horse for his pretty darter ah if i were a young man againbut there she be above me altogether though the chequers to my thinking is more to the purpose than a bigger inn might be sir you are right i believe replied his guest how far may it be to old applewood farm well sir how far why let me see a matter of about five mile perhaps youve heered tell of the garden of eden perhaps to be sure dont i read about ithe was going to say every sunday but stopped in time to dissemble the parson and the finest ten mile of turnpike in england you turns off from it about four mile out and then you keeps on straight forrard thank you my good friend i shall ask the way tomorrow your excellent punch is as good as a nightcap but i want to combine a little pleasure with business if i can tomorrow i am a bit of a sportsman in a small way would mr lovejoy allow me to cast a fly in his water think you ay that he will if you only tell him that you be staying at the chequers inn the rector went to bed that night in a placid humour with himself and his landlord and all the country and sleeping well after change of air a long ride and a good supper he awoke in the morning as fresh as a lark in a good state of mind for his breakfast old applewood farm was just taking it easy in the betwixt and between of hard work the berry season was over now and the hay was stacked and the hops were dressed john shorne and his horses were resting freely and gathering strength for another campaignto cannonade london with apples and pears all things had the smell of summer passing rich and the smell of autumn without its weight leaning over the air the nights were as warm as the days almost yet soft with a mellow briskness and any young man who looked out of his window said it was a shame to go to bed some people have called this the saddest time of the whole sad twelvemonth the middle or end of july when all things droop with heavy leafiness but who be these to find fault with the richest and goodliest prime of natures strength peradventure the fault is in themselves all seasons of the year are good to those who bring their seasoning and now when field and wood and hedge stand up in flush of summering and every bird and bat and insect of our british island is as active as he ought to be and sometimes much too much so also when good people look at one another in hot weather and feel that they may have worked too hard or been too snappish when the frosts were on which they always are except in july and then begin to wonder whether their children would like to play with the children of one another because they cannot catch cold in such weather and after that begin to speak of a rubber in the bower and a great spread of delightfulnesswhen all this comes to pass what right have we to make the worst of it that is neither here nor there only one thing is certain that our good parson looking as unlike a parson as he couldand he had a good deal of capacity in that waysteered his pony maggie round the corner into the growers yard and looked about to see how the land lay the appearance of everything pleased him well for comfort simplicity and hospitality shared the good quarters between them even a captious man could hardly if he understood the matter find much fault with anything the parson was not a captious man and he knew what a good farmyard should be and so he said capital capital twice before he handed maggies bridle to paddy from cork who of course had run out with a sanguine sense of a shilling arrived is squire lovejoy at home asked the visitor being determined to spake the biggest as paddy described it afterwards for the moment however he only stared while the parson repeated the question is it the maisther ye mane said paddy faix then ill go and ax the missus but before there was time to do this the grower appeared with a spud on his shoulder he had been in the hopground and hearing a horse came up to know what was toward the two men looked at one another with mutual approval the parson tall and strong and lusty and with that straightforward aspect which is conferred or at least confirmed by life in the open air field sports good living and social gatherings his features too were clear and bold and his jaws just obstinate enough to manage a parish without that heavy squareness which sets church and parish by the ears the grower was of moderate height and sturdy and thoroughly useful his face told of many dealings with the world but his eyes were frank and his mouth was pleasant his custom was to let other people have their say before he spoke and now he saluted mr hales in silence and waited for him to begin i hope said his visitor you will excuse my freedom in coming to see you thus i am trying this part of the country for the first time for a holiday and the landlord of the chequers inn at tonbridge where i am staying for a day or two told me that you perhaps would allow me to try for a fish in your river sir in our little brook there be none left i think you are kindly welcome to try sir but i fear you will have a fools errand of it we have had a young gentleman from london here a wonderful angler sure enough and i do believe he hath caught every one well sir with your kind permission there can be no harm in trying said the rector laughing in his sleeve at hilarys crude art compared with his own the day is not very promising and the water of course is strange to me but have i your leave to do my best ay ay as long as you like my ground goes as far up as there is any water and down the brook to the turnpike road we will see to your nag and if you would like a bit to eat sir we dine at one and we sup at seven and there be always a bit in the larder tween whiles wilt come into house before starting i thank you for the kind offer but i think id better ask you the way and be off there is just a nice little coil of cloud now in an hour it may be gone and the brook of course is very low and clear whatever my sport is i shall call in and thank you when i come back for my pony my name is hales sir a clerk from sussex very much at your service and obliged to you the same to you master halls and i wish you more sport than you will get sir your best way is over that stile and then when you come to the water go where you will one more question which i always ask what size do you allow your fish to be taken what size why as big to be sure as ever you can catch them the bigger they are the less bones they have with a laugh at this answer the parson set off with his old flybook in his pocket and a rod in his hand which he had borrowed by grace of his landlord in tonbridge his step was brisk and his eyes were bright and he thought much more of the sport in prospect than of the business that brought him there aha he exclaimed as he hit on the brook where an elbow of bank jutted over it very fine tackle will be wanted here and one fly is quite enough for it it must be fished downward of course because it cannot be fished upward it will take all i know to tackle them so it did and a great deal more than he knew he changed his fly every quarter of an hour and he tried every dodge of experience he even tried dapping with the natural fly and then the bluebottle and grasshopper but not a trout could he get to rise or even to hesitate or show the very least sign of temptation so great was his annoyance from surety of his own skill and vain reliance upon it that after fishing for about ten hours and catching a newborn minnow the rector vehemently came to a halt and repented that he had exhausted already his whole stock of strong language when a good man has done this a kind of reaction either of the stomach or conscience arises and leads him astray from his usual signposts whether of speech or deed or thought the rev struan hales sate down marvelling if he were a clumsy oaf and gave hilary no small credit for catching such deeply sagacious and wary trout then he dwelled bitterly over his fate for having to go and fetch his pony and let every yokel look into his basket and grin at its beautiful emptiness moreover he found himself face to face with starvation of the saddest kind that which a man has challenged and superciliously talked about and then has to meet very quietly not to exaggerateif that were possiblemr hales found his inner man thus rashly exposed to new kentish air absolutely barking at him as he strongly expressed it to his wife as soon as he was truly at home again but here he was fifty miles from home with not a fishingbasket only but a much nearer and dearer receptacle full of the purest vacuity this is very sad he said and all his system echoed it chapter xxviii not to be resisted while the rector still was sitting on the mossy hump of an appletree weary and disconsolate listening to the murmuring brook with louder murmurings of his own he espied a light wellbalanced figure crossing the water on a narrow plank some hundred yards up the streamway a pretty girl said the parson i am sure of it by the way she carries herself plain girls never walk like that o that she were coming to my relief but the board looks rather dangerous i must go and help her ah here she comes what a quick light foot my stars if she hasnt got a basket nothing for me of course no such luck on this most luckless of all days meanwhile she was making the best of her way as straight as the winding stream allowed towards this ungrateful and sceptical grumbler and presently she turned full upon him and looked at him and he at her what a lovely creature thought mr hales and how wonderfully her dress becomes her why the mere sight of her hat is enough to drive a young fellow out of his mind almost now i should like to make her acquaintance if i were not starving so acrior illum cura domat as sir roland says if you please sir the maiden began with a bright and modestly playful glance are you mr halls who asked my father for leave to fish this morning hales fair mistress is my name a poor and unworthy clerk from sussex then mr hales you must not be angry with me for thinking that you might be hungry andand thirsty gasped the rector goodness me if you only knew my condition how you would pity me it occurred to me that you might be thirsty too she answered producing from her basket a napkin a plate a knife and fork half a loaf and something tied up in a cloth whose fragrance went to the bottom of the parsons heart and after that a stone pipkin and a halfpint horn and last of all a pinch of salt all these she spread on a natural table of grass which her clever eyes discovered over against a mossy seat i never was so thankful in all my lifei never was i never was my pretty dear what is your name that i may bless you every night my name is mabel lovejoy sir and i hope that you will excuse me for having nothing better to bring than this most fishermen prefer duck i know but we happened only to have in the larder this half or so of a young roast goose a goose an infinitely finer bird and so much more upon it thank god it wasnt a duck my dear half a duck would scarcely be large enough to set my poor mouth watering for goodness sake give me a drop to drink what is itwater no sir ale some of our own brewing but you must please to eat a mouthful first i have heard that it is bad to begin with a drink right speedily will i qualify said the parson with his mouth quite full of goose deliciousmost delicious you must be the good samaritan my dear or at any rate you ought to be his wife your very best health mistress mabel lovejoy may you never do a worse action than you have done this day and i never shall forget your kindness oh i am so glad to see you enjoy it but you must not talk till you have eaten every mouthful why you ought to be quite famishing in that respect i fulfil my duty nay more i am downright famished there is a little stuffing in here sir let me show you underneath the apron i put it there myself and so i know what most noble most glorious most transcendent stuffing whoever made that was born to benefit retrieve and exalt humanity you must not say that sir because i made it oh dea certe i recover my latin under such enchantment but how could you have found me out and what made you so generously think of me well sir i take the greatest interest in fishermen becauseoh because of my brother charlie and one of our men passed you this afternoon and he said he was sure that you had caught nothing because he heard youhe thought he heard you no no come now complaining mildlynot swearing dont say swearing i was not going to say swearing sir what made you think of such a thing i am sure you never could have done it could you and so when you did not even come to supper it came into my head that you must want refreshment especially if you had caught no fish to comfort you for so many hours and then i thought of a plan for that which i would tell you in case i should find you unlucky enough to deserve it i am unlucky enough to deserve it thoroughly only look here pretty mistress mabel with these words he lifted the flap of his basket and showed its piteous emptiness west lorraine she criedwest lorraine for his name and address were painted on the inside wicker of the lid oh i beg your pardon mr hales i had no right to notice it yes you had but you have no right to turn away your head so what harm has west lorraine done you that you wont even look at its rector oh please not oh please dont i never would have come if i could have only dreamed if you could have dreamed what pretty mistress mabel a parson has a right to an explanation when he makes a young lady blush so oh it was so cruel of you you said you were a clerk of the name of halls so i am a clerk in holy orders but not of the name of halls that was your fathers mistake i gave my true name and here you see me very much at your service maam the uncle of a fine young fellow whose name you never heard i daresay have you ever happened to hear of a youth called hilary lorraine oh now i know why you are come oh dear it was not for the fishing after all and perhaps you never fished before and everything must be going wrong and you are come to tell me what they think of me and very likely you would be glad if you could put me in prison that would be nice gratitude would it not you are wrong in almost every point it happens that i have fished before and that i did come for the fishing partly it happens that nothing is going wrong and i am not come to say what they think of you but to see what i think of youwhich is a very different thing and what do you think of me asked mabel casting down her eyes standing saucily and yet with such a demure expression that his first impulse was to kiss her i think that you are rogue enough to turn the head of anybody and i think that you are good enough to make him happy ever afterwards i am not at all sure of that she answered raising her sweet eyes and openly blushing i only know that i would try but every one is not like a clergyman to understand good stuffing but if i had only known who you were i would never have brought you any dinner sir what a disloyal thing to say please to tell me why i ought to starve for being hilarys uncle because you would think that i wanted to coax you toto be on my side at least to make a goose of me with your goose well you have me at your mercy mabel i shall congratulate hilary on having won the heart of the loveliest best and cleverest girl in the county of kent oh no sir you must not say that because i am nothing of the sort and you must not laugh at me like that and how do you know that he has done it and what will every one say when they hear that hethat he would like to marry the daughter of a grower what does his father say that is the point it matters very little what others say and i will not conceal from you pretty mabel that his father is bitterly set against it and turned him out of doors when he heard of it oh that is why he has never written he did not know how to break it to me i was sure there was something bad but of course i could expect nothing else poor poor sillies both of us i must give him up i see i must i felt all along that i should have to do it dont cry so dont cry my dear like that there is plenty of time to talk of it things will come right in the end no doubt but what does your father say to it i scarcely know whether he knows it yet hilary wanted to tell him but i persuaded him to leave it altogether to me and so i told my mother first and she thought we had better not disturb my father about it until we heard from hilary but i am almost sure sometimes that he knows it and is not at all pleased about it for he looks at me very strangely he is the best and kindest man living almost but he has very odd ways sometimes and it is most difficult to turn him so it is with most men who are worth their salt i despise a weathercock would you like me to come in and see him or shall i fish a little more first i am quite a new man since you fed me so well and i scarcely can put up with this disgrace if you would like to fish a little longer said mabel following the loving gaze which with true angling obstinacy lingered still on the coy fair stream there is plenty of time to spare my father rode off to maidstone as soon as he found that you were not coming in to supper and he will not be back till it is quite dark and i should have time for a talk with my mother while you are attempting to catch a trout now mabel mabel you are too disdainful because i am not my own nephew who learned what little he knows altogether from me and because i have been so unsuccessful you think that i know nothing women always judge by the event having taken the trick from their fathers perhaps but you were going to tell me something to make up for my want of skill yes but you must promise not to tell any one else upon any account my brother charlie found it out and i have not told even hilary of it because he could catch fish without it you most insulting of all pretty maidens if you despise my science thus i will tell sir roland that you are vain and haughty oh dear very illtempered no now you never could say that clumsy illdressed and slatternly well done well done mr hales yes and fearfully ugly oh aha i have taken your breath away with absolute amazement i wish hilary could see you now hed steal something very delightful and then knock his excellent uncle down but now make it up like a dear good girl and tell me this great secret it is the simplest thing in the world you just take a little bit of thissee here i have some in my basket and cut a little delicate strip and whip it on the lower part of your fly i have done it for charlie many a time i will do one for you if you like sir very well i will try it to please you and for the sake of an experiment goodbye goodbye till dark my dear we shall see whether a clerk can catch fish or no when mr hales returned at night to the hospitable old farmhouse he carried on his ample back between two and three dozen goodly trout for many of which he confessed himself indebted to mabels clever fingers mrs lovejoy had been prepared by her daughter to receive him but the grower was not yet come home from maidstone which on the whole was a fortunate thing for thus the rector had time enough to settle with his hostess what should be done on his part and on hers towards the removal or at any rate the gradual reduction of the many stumblingblocks that lay as usual upon true loves course for both foresaw that if the franklins pride should once be wounded he would be certain to bar the way more sternly than even the baronet himself and even without that he could hardly be expected to forego all in a moment his favourite scheme above described that mabels husband should carry on the ancestral farm and the growth of fruit in his blunt old fashion he cared very little for baronets or for norman blood and like a son of tuscan soil was well content to lead his life in cleaving paternal fields with the hoe and nourishing household gods and hearth chapter xxix absurd surds it is a fine thing to have quarters in an english countrytown where nobody knows who the sojourner is and nobody cares who he may be to begin at gentle leisure to feel interest in the place and quicken up to the vein of humour throbbing through the high street the third evening cannot go over ones head without a general sense being gained of the politics of the town and far more importantthe politicians and if there only is a corporation wisdom cries in the streets and nobody can get on with anybody however when the fights are over generally speaking all cool down but this is about the last thing that a stranger should exert his intellect to understand it would be pure waste of time unless he means to buy a house and settle down and try to be an alderman in two years time and mount ambitions ladder even to the giddy height of mayoralty till the hand of death comes between the rungs and vertically drags him downward and even then for three months shall he be our deeply lamented townsman but if this visitor firmly declines as for his health he is bound to do these mighty combats which always have the eyes of the nation fixed on themif he is satisfied to lounge about and say good morning here and there to ascertain public sentiment concerning the state of the weather and to lay out sixpence judiciously in cultivating good societythen speedily will he get draughts of knowledge enough to quench the most ardent thirst while the yawn of indolence merges in the quickening smile of interest then shall he get an insight into the commerce fashion religious feeling jealousies and literature of the town its just and pleasant selfesteem its tolerance and intolerance often equally inexplicable its quiet enjoyments and best of all its elegant flirtations these things enabled mr hales to pass an agreeable week at tonbridge and to form acquaintance with some of its leading inhabitants which in pursuit of his object he was resolved as far as he could to do and from all of these he obtained very excellent tidings of the lovejoys as being a quiet wellconducted and highly respectable family admitted whenever they cared to be so to the best society of the neighbourhood and forgiven for growing cherries and even for keeping a threehorsed van also as regarded his own impressions the more he saw of old applewood farm the more he was pleased with it and with its owners and calling upon his brother parson the incumbent of the parish he found in him a congenial soul who wanted to get a service out of him for this mr hales was too wide awake having taken good care to leave sermons at home because he had been long enough in holy orders to know what delight all parsons find in spoiling one anothers holidays moreover he had promised himself the pleasure of sitting in a pew for once repossessing the right to yawn ad libitum and even fall into a murmurous nap after exhausting the sweetness of the wellknown lucretian sentimentto gaze in safety at anothers labours or as the navvy more tersely put it when asked of his summum bonum to look on at tother beggars meanwhile however many little things were beginning to go crosswise for instance hilary walked down headlong being exceedingly short of cash to comfort mabel and to get good quarters and perhaps to go on about everything luckily his uncle struan met him in the street of sevenoaks whither he had ridden for a little change and amazed him with very strong language and begged him not to make a confounded fool of himself and so took him into a publichouse the young man of course was astonished to see his uncle carrying on so dressed as a layman and roving about without any wife or family but when he knew for whose sake it was done and how strongly his uncle was siding with him his gratitude and good emotions were such that he scarcely could finish his quart of beer my boy i am thoroughly ashamed of you said his uncle looking queerly at him you are most immature for married life if you give way to your feelings so but uncle when a man is down so much and turned out of doors by his own father when a man when a boy is what you mean i suppose a man would take it differently i am sure i take it very well said hilary trying to smile at it there i will drink up my beer for i know that sort of thing always vexes you now can you say that i have kicked up a row or done anything that i might have done no my boy no quite the opposite thing you have taken it most angelically angelically without an angelus uncle or even a stiver in my pocket only the cherub aloft you know i dont know anything about him and the allusion to my mind is profane now uncle you are hyperclerical because i have caught you dressed as a bagman i dont understand your big oxford words in my days they taught theology and hunting come now uncle struan didnt they teach you hunting well said the rector stroking his chin i was a poor young man of course and could not afford that sort of thing yes but you did you know uncle struan i have heard you boast of it fifty times what a plague you are hilary there may have been timeshowever you are going on quite as if we were sitting and having a cozy talk after dinner at west lorraine i wish to goodness we were my dear uncle i never shall have such a pleasure again my dear boy my dear boy to talk like that at your time of life what a thing love is to be sure however in that state a dinner is no matter well i shall be off now for london again a bit of bread and cheese after all is as good as anything goodbye my dear uncle i shall always thank you you shall thank me for two things before you start and you should not start except that i know it to be at present best for you you shall thank me for as good a dinner as can be got in a place like this and after that for five gold guineas just to go on for a bit with thus the rector had his way and fed his nephew beautifully and sent him back with a better heart in his breast to meet the future hilary of course was much aggrieved and inclined to be outrageous at having walked fourandtwenty miles with eager proceeding at every step and then being balked of a sight of his love however he saw that it was for the best and five guineas feel as you will are something his good uncle paid his fare back by the stage and saw him go off and kissed hands to him feeling greatly relieved as soon as ever he was round the corner for he must have spoiled everything at the farm therefore this excellent uncle returned to his snug little sanded parlour to smoke a fresh pipe and to think in its influence how to get on with these new affairs here were heaps of trouble rising as peaks of volcanoes come out of the sea and who was to know how to manage things so as to make them all subside again hilary might seem easy to deal with so long as he had no money but even he was apt to take strange whims into his head although he might feel that he could not pay for them and then there was the grower an obstinate factor in any calculation and then the growers wife who might appeal perhaps to the attorneygeneral also sir roland with his dry unaccountable manner of regarding things and last not least the rectors own superior part of his household if he could not manage them anybody at first sight would say that the fault must be altogether his ownthat a man who cannot lay down the law to his own wife and daughters really is no man and deserves to be treated accordingly yet this depends upon special gifts the rector could carry on very well when he understood the subject even with his wife and daughters till it came to crying still in the end as he knew in his heart he always got the worst of it now what would all these ladies say if the incumbent of the parish the rector of the rectory the very husband or father of all of themselvesas the case might bewere to depart from his sense of right and the principles he had laid down to them to such an extent as to cherish hilary in black rebellion against his own father suasion would be lost among them it is a thing that may be tried under favourable circumstances as against one lady when quite alone but with four ladies all taking different views of the matter in question yet ready in a moment to combine against any form of reasona bachelor must be quixotic a husband and father idiotic if he relies upon any other motive power than that of his legs but the rector was not the man to run away even from his own family so on the whole he resolved to let things follow their own course until something new should begin to rise except at least upon two little pointsone that hilary should be kept from visiting the farm just now and the other that the grower must be told of all this loveaffair mr hales as an owner of daughters felt that it was but a fathers due to know what his favourite child was about in such important matters and he thought it the surest way to set him bitterly against any moderation if he were left to find out by surprise what was going on at his own hearth it happened however that the grower had a shrewd suspicion of the whole of it and was laughing in his sleeve and winking in his own determined way at his good wifes manuvres i shall stop it all when i please he said to himself every night at bedtime let them have their little game and make up their minds to astonish me for he like almost every man who has attained the age of sixty looked back upon love as a brief excrescence of about as much importance as a wart ay ay no need to tell me he answered when mrs lovejoy under the parsons advice and at mabels entreaty broke the matter to him i dont go about with my eyes shut wife a man that knows every pear that grows can tell the colour on a maidens cheek i have settled to send her away tomorrow to her uncle catherow the old mare will be ready at ten oclock i meant to leave you to guess the reason you are so clever all of you ha ha you thought the old grower was as blind as a bat now didnt you well at any rate replied mrs lovejoy giving her pillow an angry thump i think you might have consulted me martin with half her clothes in the washtub and a frayed ribbon on her sunday hat men are so hot and inconsiderate all to be done in a moment of course the least you could have done i am sure would have been to tell me beforehand martin and not to pack her off like that to be sure just as you told me good wife your plan for packing her off for life now just go to sleep and dont beat about so when i say a thing i do it chapter xxx our lad steenie when the flaunting and the flouting of the summerprime are over when the leaves of tree and bush and even of unconsidered weeds hang on their stalks instead of standing upright as they used to do and very often a convex surface by the cares of life is worn into a small concavity a gradual change to a like effect may be expected in the human mind a man remembers that his own autumn is once more coming over him that the light is surely waning and the darkness gathering in that more of his plans are shed and scattered as the sun draws water among the clouds or as the gossamer floats idly over the sere and seeded grass therefore it is high time to work to strengthen the threads of the wavering plan to tighten the mesh of the woven web to cast about here and there for completionif the design shall be ever complete so now as the summer passed a certain gentleman of more repute perhaps than reputation began to be anxious about his plans sir remnant chapman owned large estates adjoining the dwindled but still fair acreage of the lorraines in the weald of sussex much as he differed from sir roland in tastes and habits and character he announced himself wherever he went as his most intimate friend and ally and certainly he was received more freely than any other neighbour at coombe lorraine and knew all the doings and ways of the family and was even consulted now and then warm friendship however can scarcely thrive without mutual respect and though sir remnant could never escape from a certain unwilling respect for sir roland the latter never could contrive to reciprocate the feeling because he knew that sir remnant was a gentleman of a type already even then departing although to be found at the present day in certain parts of england a man of fixed opinions and even what might be accounted principles at any rate by himself concerning honour and birth and betting and patriotism and some other matters included in a very small etcetera it is hard to despise a man who has so many points settled in his system but it is harder to respect him when he sees all things with one little eye and that eye a vicious one sir remnant chapman had no belief in the goodness of woman or the truth of manin the beautiful balance of nature or even the fatherly kindness that comforts us therefore nobody could love him and very few people paid much attention to his dull hatred of mankind contempt he always called it but he had not power to make it that neither had he any depth of root to throw up eminence a bitter weed many people called him and yet he was not altogether that for he liked to act against his nature perhaps from its own perversity and often did kind things to spite his own spitefulness by doing them as for sense of right and wrong he had none outside of his own wishes and he always expected the rest of the world to move on the same low system how could such a man get on even for an hour with one so differentand more than that so opposite to himas the good sir roland mr hales who was not as we know at all a tightlaced man himself and may perhaps have been a little jealous of sir remnant put that question to himself as well as to his wife and family and echo only answered how however soever there was the fact and how many facts can we call to mind ever so much stranger sir remnants only son stephen chapman was now over thirty years of age and everybody said that it was time for him to change his mode of life even his father admitted that he had made an unreasonably long job of sowing his wild oats and now must take to some better culture and nothing seemed more likely to lead to this desirable result than a speedy engagement to an accomplished sensible and attractive girl therefore after a long review and discussion of all the young ladies round it had been settled that the heir of all the chapmans should lay close siege to young alice lorraine captain chapmanas stephen was called by courtesy in that neighbourhood having held a commission in a fashionable regiment until it was ordered to the warthis man was better than his father in some ways and much worse in others he was better from weakness not having the strength to work out works of iniquity and also from having some touches of kindness whereof his father was intact he was worse because he had no sense of honour no rudiment of a principle not even a dubious preference for the truth at first sight against a lie captain chapman however could do one manly thing and only one he could drive having cultivated the art in the time when it meant something horses were broken then not trainedas nowadays they must beand skill and nerve were needed for the management of a fourinhand captain chapman was the first in those parts to drive like ericthonius and it took him a very long time to get his father to sit behind him for the roads were still very bad and perilous and better suited for postilions than for stephen chapmans team he durst not drive up coombe lorraine or at any rate he feared the descent as yet though he meant some day to venture it and now that he was come upon his wooing he left his gaudy equipage at the foot of the hill to be sent back to steyning and come for him at an appointed time then he and his father with mutual grumblings took to the steep ascent on foot sir roland had asked them a few days ago to drive over and dine with him either on thursday or any other day that might suit them they came on the thursday with their minds made up to be satisfied with anything but they certainly were not very well pleased to find that the fair mistress alice had managed to give them the slip entirely she was always ready to meet sir remnant and discharge the duties of a hostess to him but from some deep instinctive aversion she could not even bear to sit at table with the captain she knew not at all what his character was neither did sir roland know a tenth part of his ill repute otherwise he had never allowed him to approach the maiden he simply looked upon captain chapman as a fashionable man of the day who might have been a little wild perhaps but now meant to settle down in the country and attend to his fathers large estates however neither of the guests suspected that their visit had fixed the date of another little visit pending long at horsham and one girl being as good as another to men of the world of that stamp they were well content when the haunch went out to clink a glass with the rectors daughters instead of receiving a distant bow from a diffident and very shy young lady now lorraine began sir remnant after the ladies had left the room and the captain was gone out to look at something according to arrangement and had taken the rector with him we have known one another a good many years and i want a little sensible talk with you sir remnant i hope that our talk is always sensible so far at least as can be expected on my part there you are again lorraine using some back meaning such as no one else can enter into but let that pass it is your way now i want to say something to you i also am smitten with a strong desire to know what it is sir remnant well it is neither more nor less than this you know what dangerous times we live in with every evil power let loose and satan like a roaring lion rampant and triumphant thank you yes i will take a pinch your snuff is always so delicious with the archenemy prowling about with democracy nonconformity infidelity and rickburnings exactly so how well you express it i was greatly struck with it in the george and dragons report of your speech at the farmers dinner at billinghurst well well i may have said it before but that only makes it the more the truth can you deny it sir roland lorraine far be it from me to deny the truth i am listening with the greatest interest no you are not you never do you are always thinking of something to yourself but what i was going to say was this that it is high time to cement the union and draw close the bonds of amity between all good men all men of any principleby which i meancome now you know to be sure you mean all stanch tories yes yes all who hold by church and state land and the constitution i have educated my son carefully in the only right and true principles train up a childyou know what i mean and you of course have brought up your daughter upon the same right system nay rather i have left her to form her own political opinions and to the best of my belief she has formed none lorraine i am heartily glad to hear it that is how all the girls should be when i was in london they turned me sick with asking my opinion the less they know the better for them knowledge of anything makes a woman scarcely fit to speak to my poor dear wife could read and write and that was quite enough for her she did it on the jampots always and she could spell most of it ah she was a most wonderful woman she was i often found much pleasure in her conversation she knew so many things that never come by way of reading and so does stephen you should hear him he never reads any sort of book ah that is the true learning books always make stupid people now it struck me thatah you know i see a winks as good as a nod of course no catching a weasel asleep here sir remnant screwed up one eye and gave sir roland a poke in the ribs with the most waggish air imaginable again and again i assure you said his host that i have not the smallest idea what you mean your theory about books has in me the most thorough confirmation aha it is all very wellall very well to pretend lorraine another pinch of snuff and that settles it let them set up their horses together as soon as ever they pleaseeh who what horses why will you thus visit me with impenetrable enigmas visit you why you invited me yourself who indeed why of course our lad steenie and your girl lallie captain chapman and my alice such a thought never entered my mind do you know that poor alice is little more than seventeen years old and captain chapman must belet me see never mind what he is he is my son and heir and therell be fifty thousand to settle on his wife in hard cashnot so bad nowadays sir remnant chapman i beg you not to say another word on the subject your son must be twice my daughters age and he looks even more than that dash my wig then i am seventy i suppose what the dickens have his looks got to do with the matter i dont call him at all a badlooking fellow a chip of the old block thats what he is ah many a fine woman i can tell you now if you please sir roland said with a very clear and determined voiceif you please we will drop this subject your son may be a very good match and no doubt he is in external matters and if alice when old enough should become attached to him perhaps i might not oppose it there is nothing more to be said at present and above all things she must not hear of it i see i see answered the other baronet who was rather short of temper missy must be kept to her breadandmilk and good books and all that a little longer by the by lorraine what was it i heard about your son the other daythat he had been making a fool of himself with some grocers daughter i have not heard of any grocers daughter and as he will shortly leave england people perhaps will have less to say about him his commission is promised as perhaps you know and he is not likely to quit the army because there is fighting going on sir remnant felt all the sting of that hit his face which showed many signs of good living flushed to the tint of the claret in his hand and he was just about to make a very coarse reply when luckily the rector came back suddenly followed by the valiant captain sir roland knew that he had allowed himself to be goaded into bad manners for once and he strove to make up for it by unwonted attention to the warrior chapter xxxi in a marching regiment it was true that hilary had attained at last the great ambition of his life he had changed the pen for the sword the sand for powder and the ink for blood and in a few days he would be afloat on his way to join lord wellington his fathers obstinate objections had at last been overcome for there seemed to be no other way to cut the soft net of enchantment and throw him into a sterner world his uncle struan had done his best and tried to the utmost stretch the patience of sir roland with countless words until the latter exclaimed at last why you seem to be worse than the boy himself you went to spy out the nakedness of the land and you returned in a fortnight with grapes of eschol truly this danish lovejoy is more potent than the great canute he turns at his pleasure the tide of opinion roland now you go too far it is not the grower that i indite of but his charming daughter if you could but once be persuaded to see her of course exactly what hilary said in him i could laugh at it but in you well a great philosopher tells us that every jot of opinion even that of a babe i suppose is to be regarded as an equal item of the universal consensus and the universal consensus becomes or forms or fructifies or solidifies into the great homogeneous truth i may not quote him aright and i beg his pardon for so lamely rendering him however that is a rude sketch of his view a brick from his houseto mix metaphorsand perhaps you remember it better struan god forbid the only thing that i remember out of all my education is the storieswhat do you call themmythologies capital some of them are capital ah they do so much good to boysteach them manliness and selfrespect do they however to return to this lovely daughter of the kentish alcinousby the way if his ancestors were danes who took to gardening it suggests a rather startling analogy the old corycian is believed though without a particle of evidence to have been a pirate in early life and therefore have taken to potherbs let that pass i could never have believed it except for this instance of lovejoy and how if you please broke in the rector who was always jealous of norman blood because he had never heard that he had any how were the normans less piratical if you please than the danes their own grandfathers except that they were sick at seabig rogues all of them in my opinion the saxons were the only honest fellows ay and they would have thrashed those normans but for the slightest accident when i hear of those normans without any shouldersdont tell me they never would have built such a house as this is otherwisewhat do you think i feel ready to do sir why to get up and to lift my coat and come come struan we quite understand all your emotions without that this makes you a very bigoted ambassador in our case you meant to bring back all the truth of course but when you found the fishing good and the people roughly hospitable and above all a danish smack in their manners and figures and even their eyes which have turned on the kentish soil i am told to a deep and very brilliant brown yes roland you are right for once at any rate it is so with her very well then you being as you always are a sudden manwhat did you do but fall in love in an elderly fatherly manner of course with thiswhat is her name now again i never can recollect it you do you never forget anything her name is mabel and you may be glad to pronounce it pretty often in your old age sir roland well it is a pretty name and deserves a pretty bearer but struan you are a man of the world you know what hilary is and you know though we do not give ourselves airs and drive four horses in a hideous yellow coach and wear diamond rings worth a thousand pounds you know what the lorraines have always beena little particular in their ways and a little inclined to to perhaps to look down on the rest of the world without ever letting them know it or even knowing it yourselves perhaps have i hit it aright sir roland not quite that indeed nothing could be further from what i was thinking of sir roland lorraine sighed gently here and even his brotherinlaw had not the least idea why he did so it was that sir roland like all the more able lorraines for several centuries was at heart a fatalist and this family taint had perhaps been deepened by the infusion of eastern blood this was the bar so often fixed between them and the rest of the worlda barrier which must hold good while every man cares for his neighbours soul so much more than his own for ever is it anything in religion roland the rector whispered kindly i know that you are not orthodox and a good deal puffed up with carnal knowledge still if it is in my line at all i am not a very high authoritybut perhaps i might lift you over it they are saying all sorts of things now in the world and i have taken two hours aday several daysnow you need not laughin a library we have got up at horsham filled with the best divinity so as to know how to answer them my dear struan sir roland replied without so much as the gleam of a smile that was really good of you and you now have so many other things to attend to with young dogs and that and the st of september next week i believe what a relief that must be to you ay that it is you cannot imagine of course with all your many ways of frittering time away indoors what a wearing thing it is to have nothing better than rabbitshooting or teaching a dog to drop to shot but now about hilary you must relentindeed you must dear roland he is living on sixpence aday i believevirtuous fellow most rare young man why if that dirty steve chapman now had been treated as you have served hilarynote of hand billdrawing postobitsand you might even think yourself lucky if there were no big forgery to hush up ah his father may think what he likes but i look on hilary as a perfect wonder a bayard a crichton a pelican surely you mean a paragon struan what young can he have to feed from his own breast i meant what i said as i always do and how can you know what young he has when you never even let him come near you ah if i only had such a son here the rector who really did complain that he had no son to teach how to shoot managed to get his eyes a little touched with genial moisture this is grievous sir roland answered and a little more than i ever expected or can have enabled myself to deserve now struan will you cease from wailing if i promise one thing that must depend upon what it is it will take a good many things i am afraid to make me think well of you again to hear such a thing from the head of the parish now struan be not vindictive i ought to have let you get a good days shooting and then your terms would have been easier well roland you know that we can do nothing the estates are tied up in such a wonderful way by some lawyers trick or other through a whim of that blessed old ladyshe cant hear me can shethat hilary has his own sisters life between him and the inheritance so far as any of us can make out so that you need not have boasted answered sir roland with a quiet smile about his being a bayard in refraining from postobits well well you know what i meant quite well the jews are not yet banished from england and there is reason to fear they never will be there are plenty of them to discount his chance if he did what many other boys would do sir roland felt the truth of this and he feared in his heart that he might be pushing his only son a little too hard in reliance upon his honour will you come to the point for once he asked with a look of despair and a voice of the same this is my offerto get hilary a commission in a footregiment pack him off to the war in spain and if in three years after that he sticks to that danish nausicaa and i am alivewhy then he shall have her mr hales threw back his headfor he had a large deep head and when it wanted to think it would go backand then he answered warily it is a very poor offer sir roland at first sight it seems fair enough but you with your knowledge of youth and especially such a youth as hilary rely upon the effects of absence change adventures dangers spanish beauties and worst of all wider knowledge of the world and the company of coarse young men to make him jilt his love or perhaps take even a worse course than that you are wrong said sir roland with much contempt sir remnant chapman might so have meant it struan you ought to know me better but i think that i have a right at least to try the substance of such a whim before i yield to it and install as the future mistress awell what do you want me to call her struan let it be roland let it be i am a fair man if you are not and i can make every allowance for you but i think that your heir should at least be entitled to swing his legs over a horse sir roland i on the other hand think that it would be his final ruin to do so he would get among reckless fellows to whom he is already too much akin it has happened so with several of my truly respected ancestors they have gone into cavalry regiments and ridden full gallop through their estates i am not a penurious man as you know and few think less of money can you deny that even in your vitiated state of mind i cannot deny it the rector answered you never think twice about money rolandexcept of course when you are bound to do so very well then you can believe that i wish poor hilary to start afoot solely for his own benefit there is very hard fighting just now in spain or on the confines of portugal i hate all fighting as you are aware still it is a thing that must be done good lord cried the rector how you do talk as if it was so many partridges no it is better than thatcome struanbecause the partridges carry no guns you know i should be confoundedly sorry if they did the rector answered with a shudder fancy letting fly at a bird who might have a long barrel under his tail it is an appalling imagination struan i give you credit for it but here we are as usual wandering from the matter which we have in hand are you content or are you not with what i propose about hilary in this expressly alternative form there lurks a great deal of vigour if a man says are you satisfied you begin to cast about and wonder whether you might not win better terms many sideissues come in and disturb you and your way to say yes looks too positive but if he only clench his inquiry with the option of the strong negative the weakest of all things human nature that hates to say no is tampered with this being so uncle struan thought for a moment or so and then said yes i am chapter xxxii public and private opinion is it just or even honestfair of course it cannot beto deal so much with the heavy people the eldermost ones and the bittermost and leave altogether with nothing said of heror not even let her have her own sayas sweet a young maiden as ever lived and as true and brave and kind an one alice was of a different class altogether from mabel lovejoy mabel was a dearhearted girl loving pure unselfish warm and good enough to marry any man and be his own wife for ever but alice went far beyond all that her nature was cast in a different mould she had not only the depthwhich is the common property of womenbut she also had the height of loving such as a mother has for her children rather than a wife towards her husband and yet by no means an imperious or exacting affection but tender submissive and delicate inasmuch as her brother stood next to her father or in some points quite on a level with him in her true regard and love it was not possible that her kind heart could escape many pangs of late in the first place no loving sister is likely to be altogether elated by the discovery that her only brother has found some one who shall be henceforth more to him than herself is alice moreover had a very strong sense of the rank and dignity of the lorraines and disliked even more than her father did the importation of this vegetable product as she rather facetiously called poor mabel into their castle of lineage but now when hilary was going away to be drowned on the voyage perhaps or at least to be shot or sabred or ridden over by those who had horseswhile he had noneor even if he escaped all that to be starved or frozen or sunstruck for the sake of his countryas our best men are while their children survive to starve afterwardsit came upon alice as a heavy blow that she never might happen to see him again although her father had tried to keep her from the excitement of the times and the gasp of the public for dreadful news a gasp which is deeper and wider always the longer the time of waiting is still there were too many mouths of rumour for truth to stop one in ten of them although the old butler turned his cuffs upto show what an arm he still possessedand grumbled that all this was nothing and a bladder of wind in comparison with what he had known forty years agone and though mrs pipkins the housekeeper quite agreed with him and went further neither was the cook at all disposed to overdo the thing it was of no servicethey could not stay the torrent of public opinion trotman had been taken on rashly as may have been said before as upper footman in lieu of the oldestablished and trusty gentleman who had been compelled by fierce injustice to retire and take to a publichousewith a hundred pounds to begin uponbeing reft of the office of footman for no other reason that he could hear of except that he was apt to be towards nightfall not quite able to keep his feet to him succeeded the headlong trotman and one of the very first things he did wasas declared a long time ago with deep sympathy in this unvarnished taleto kick poor bonny like a hopping spider from the brow of the hill to the base thereof trotman may have had good motives for this rather forcible movement and it is not our place to condemn him still in more than one quarter it was believed that he had acted thus through no zeal whatever for virtue or justice but only because he so loved his perquisites and suspected that bonny got smell of them and the butler quite confirmed this view and was much surprised at trotmans conduct for bonny was accustomed to laugh at his jokes and had even sold some of his bottles for him in such a crisis scarcely any one would regard such a trivial matter and yet none of us ought to kick anybody without knowing what it may lead to violence is to be deprecated for it has to be paid for beyond its value in twelve cases out of every dozen and so it was now for if coombe lorraine had been before this as mrs pipkins declared having learned french from her cookerybook the most triestest place in the world it became even duller now that bonny was induced by personal considerations to terminate rather abruptly his overtures to the kitchenmaid for who brought the tidings of all great events and royal proceedings our bonny who knew the young man of every housemaid in the vales of both adur and arun our bonny who could be trusted to carry a scroll or in purer truth perhaps a scrawl that should be treasured through the lovelorn hours of waitingat tablein a zebra waistcoat solely and emphatically bonny therefore every tender domestic bosom rejoiced when the heartless trotman was compelled to tread the track of his violence lamely and painfully twice every week to fetch from steyning his george and the dragon which used to be delivered by bonny mr trotman however was a generous man and always ready to share as well as enjoy the delights of literature nothing pleased him better than to sit on the end of a table among the household ladies and gentlemen with mrs pipkins in the chair of honour and interpret from his beloved journal the chronicles of the county the country and the continent why ho he shouted out one day whats this can i believe my heyes our halary going to the wars next week no now never can be most shameful some of his audience exclaimed but mrs pipkins and the old butler shook their heads at one another as much as to say i knowed it mr trotman said the senior housemaid who entertained connubial views you are sure to be right in all you reads you are such a bootiful scholard will you obleege us by reading it out hem hem ladies all it is yours to command it is mine to obey the insatiable despot who sways the continent seems resolved to sacrifice to his baleful lust of empire all the best and purest and noblest of the blood of britain it was only last week that we had to mourn the loss sustained by all sussex in the most promising scion of a noble house and now we have it on the best authority that mr h l the only son of the wellknown and widelyrespected baronet residing not fifty miles from steyning has received orders to join his regiment at the seat of war under lord wellington the gallant young gentleman sails next week from portsmouth in the troopship sandylegsor some such blessed indian name the old scrimp exclaimed the cook a warm ally to poor hilary to send him out in a nasty sandy ship when his birth were to go on horseback the same as all the gentlefolks do to the wars but mrs merryjack you forget explained the accomplished trotman that great britain is a hisland maam and no one cant ride from a hisland on horseback at least it was so when i was a boy then it must be so now john trotman for what but a boy are you now i should like to know and a badmannered boy in my humble opinion to want to teach his helders their duty i know that i lives in a hisland of course the same as all the scotchmen does and goes round the sun like a joint on a spit and so does nearly all of us but perhaps john trotman doesnt with this withering sarcasm the ladycook turned away from poor trotman and then delivered these memorable words sir rowland will repent too late sir rowland will shed the briny tear the same as might any one of us even on ayear for sending his only son out in a ship when he ought to a sent un on horseback mrs pipkins nodded assent and so did the ancient butler and trotman felt that public opinion was wholly against him until such time as it should be further educated but such a discussion had been aroused that there was no chance of its stopping here and alice who loved to collect opinions had many laid before her she listened to all judiciously and pretended to do it judicially and after that she wondered whether she had done what she ought to do for she knew that she was only very young with nobody to advise her and the crushing weight of the world upon her if she tripped or forgot herself most girls of her age would have been at school and taken childish peeps at the world and burnished up their selfishness by conflict with one another but sir roland had kept to the family custom and taught and trained his daughter at home believing as he did that young women lose some of their best and most charming qualities by what he called gregarious education alice therefore had been under care of a good and a welltaught governessfor masters at that time were proper to boysuntil her mind was quite up to the mark and capable of taking care of itself for in those days it was not needful for any girl to know a great deal more than was good for her early one september evening when the day and year hung calmly in the balance of the sun when sensitive plants and clever beasts were beginning to look around them and much of the growth of the ground was ready to regret lost opportunities when the comet was gone for good at last and the earth was beginning to laugh at her terror having found him now clearly afraid of her and when a sense of great deliverance from the power of drought and heat throbbed in the breast of dewy nurture so that all took breath again and even man the last of all things to be pleased or thankful was ready to acknowledge that there might have been worse momentsat such a time fair alice sat in her garden thinking of hilary the work of the summer was over now and the fate of the flowers pronounced and settled for better or worse till another year no frost however had touched them yet while the heavy dews of autumnal night and the brisk air flowing from the open downs had gladdened refreshed and sweetened them among them and between the shrubs there spread and sloped a pleasant lawn for all who love soft sward and silence and the soothing sound of leaves from the form of the ground and bend of the hills as well as the northerly aspect a peculiar cast and tingle of the air might be found at different moments fluctuating differently most of all in a fine sunset of autumn though now the sun was behind the ridge from the fulness of the upper sky such gleam and glance fell here and there that nothing could be sure of looking as it looked only a minute ago at such times all the glen seemed thrilling like one vast lute of trees and air drawing fingered light along the chords of trembling shadow at such a time no southern slope could be compared with this for depth of beauty and impressive power for the charm of clear obscurity and suggestive murmuring mystery a time and scene that might recall the large romance of grander ages where wandering lovers might shrink and think of lovers whose love was over and even the sere man of the world might take a fresh breath of the boyish days when fear was a pleasant element suddenly alice became aware of something moving near her and almost before she had time to be frightened hilary leaped from behind a laurel he caught her in his arms and kissed her and then stepped back to leave plenty of room for contemplative admiration i was resolved to have one more look we sail tomorrow they are in such a hurry i have walked all the way from portsmouth at least i got a little lift on the road on the top of a waggonload of wheat how wonderfully good of you hilary dear she exclaimed with tears in her eyes and yet a strong inclination to smile as she watched him how tired you must be why when did you leave the dpt i thought they kept you at perpetual drill so they did but i soon got up to all that i can do it as well as the best of them now what a provoking child you are well dont you notice anything for alice with true sisterly feeling was trying his endurance to the utmost dissembling all her admiration of his fine fresh uniform of course this was not quite so grand as if he had been as he had right to be enrolled as an eques auratus still it looked very handsome on his fine straight figure and set off the brightness of his clear complexion moreover his two months of drilling at the dpt had given to his active and wellpoised form that vigorous firmness which alone was needed to make it perfect with the quickness of a girl his sister saw all this in a moment and yet for fear of crying she laughed at him why how did you come so spick and span have you got a sheaf of wheat inside your waistcoat it was too cruel to put such clothes on the top of a harvestwaggon i wonder you did not set it all on fire much you know about it exclaimed the young soldier with vast chagrin you dont deserve to see anything i brought my togs in a haversack and put them on in your bower here simply to oblige you and you dont think they are worth looking at i am looking with all my might and yet i cannot see anything of a sword i suppose they wont allow you one yet but surely you must have a sword in the end alice you are enough to wear one out could i carry my sword in a haversack however if you dont think i look well somebody else doesthat is one comfort you do not mean i hope replied alice missing his allusion carefully to go back to your ship without coming to see papa dear hilary that is exactly what i do mean and that is why i have watched for you so i have no intention of knocking under and so he will find out in the end and somebody else i hope as well everybody thinks i am such a fool because i am easytempered let them wait a bit they may be proud of that neverdowell silly hilary yet in the last few months i can assure you i have been through thingshowever i wont talk about them they never did understand me at home and i suppose they never will but it does not matter wait a bit darling hilary dont talk so it makes me ready to cry to hear you you will go into some battle and throw your life away to spite all of us no no i wont though it would serve you right for considering me such a nincompoop as if the best and sweetest and truesthearted girl in the universe was below contempt because her father happens to grow cabbages what do we grow corn and hay and stingnettles and couchgrass or at least our tenants grow them for us and so we get the money well how are they finer than cabbages come in and see father said alice straining her selfcontrol to shun argument do come and see him before you go i will not he answered amazing his sister by his newborn persistency he never has asked me and i will not do it no tears no sobs no coaxings moved him his troubles had given him strength of will and he went to the war without seeing his father chapter xxxiii rags and bones one man there is or was who ought to have been brought forward long ago everybody said the same thing of himhe wanted nothing more than the power of insisting upon his reputation and of checking his own bashfulness to make him one of the foremost men anywhere in or near steyning his name was bottler as everybody knew and through some hereditary veins of thought they always added the pigmanas if he were a porcine hybrid he was nothing of the sort he was only a man who stuck pigs when they wanted sticking and if at such times he showed humanity how could that identify him with the animal between his knees he was sensitive upon this point at times and had been known to say i am no pigman what i am is a master porkbutcher however he could not get over his name any more than anybody else can and if such a trifle hurt his feelings he scarcely insisted upon them until he was getting quite into his fifth quart of ale and discovering his true value a writer of the first eminence who used to be called tully but now is euphoniously cited as kikero has taught us that to neglect the worlds opinion of ones self is a proof not only of an arrogant but even of a dissolute mind bottler could prove himself not of an arrogant and still less of a dissolute mind he respected the opinion of the world and he showed his respect in the most convincing and flattering manner by his style of dress he never wore slops or an apron even unless it were at the decease or during the obsequies of a porker he made it a point of honour to maintain an unbroken succession of legitimate white stockingsa problem of deep and insatiable anxiety to every woman in steyning town in the first place why did he wear them it took several years to determine this point but at last it was known amid universal applause that he wore them in memory of his first love but then there arose a far more difficult and excruciating questionhow did he do it had he fifty pairs did he wash them himself or did he make his wife how could he kill pigs and keep his stockings perpetually unsullied emphatically and despairinglywhy had they never got a hole in them he however with an even mind trode the checkered path of life with fustian breeches and white stockings his coat was of west of england broadcloth and of a rich imperial blue except where the colour had yielded to time and all his buttons were of burnished brass his honest countenance was embellished with a fine candid smile whenever he spoke of the price of pigs or pork and no one had ever known him to tell a lieor at any rate he said so this good and remarkable man was open to public inspection every morning in his shop from eight to twelve oclock he then retired to his dinner and customers might thump and thump with a key or knife or even his own steel on the counter but neither mr nor mrs bottler would condescend to turn round for them nothing less than the chink of a guinea would stir them at this sacred time but if any one had a guinea to rattle on the board and did it cleverly the blind across the glass door was drawn back on its tape and out peeped bottler when dinner and subsequent facts had been dealt with this eminent pigman horsed his cart hoisted his favourite child in over the footboard and set forth in quest of pigs or as he put it more elegantly hanimals german to his profession that favourite child his daughter polly being of breadth and length almost equal and gifted with bowlegs as the public had ample means of ascertaining was now about four years old and possessed of remarkable gravity even for that age she would stand by the hour between her fathers knees while he guided the shambling horse and gaze most intently at nothing at all as if it were the first time she ever had enjoyed the privilege of inspecting it rags and bones being typical of the beginning and end of humanity have an inner meaning of their own and stimulate all who deal in them at least it often seems to be so though one must not be too sure of it years of observation lead us to begin to ask how to observe a little bonny had not waited for this perversity of certainty he had long been taking observations of polly bottleras he could get themand the more he saw her the more his finest feelings were drawn forth by her and the way she stood between her fathers legs some boys have been known to keep one virtue so enlarged and fattened up like the liver of a strasburg goose that the flavour of it has been enough to abideif they died before dissolutionin the rue of pious memory exactly so it was with that bonny he never feigned to be an honest boy because it would have been dishonest of him besides that he did not know how to do it and had his own reasons for waiting a bit yet nothing short of downright starvation could have driven him at any time to steal so much as one pigs trotter from his patrons cart or shop or yard now this deserves mention because it proves that there does or at any rate did exist a discoverable specimen of a virtue so rare that its existence escaped all suspicion till after the classic period of the latin tongue a grateful soul or a grateful spiritwe have no word to express animus though we often express it towards one anothersuch was the roman form for this virtue as a concrete rarity and a couple of thousand years have made it two thousand times more obsolete in one little breast it still abode purely original and native and growing underneath the soil shy of light and hard to find like the truffle of the south downs bonny was called in one breath every day a shameful and a shameless boy and he may have deserved but a middling estimate from a lofty point of view it must be admitted that he slipped sometimes over the border of right and wrong when a duck or a rabbit or a green goose haply hopped or waddled on the other side of it in the tempting twilight but even that he avoided doing until halfpence were scarce and the weather hungry now being as has been said before of distinguished countenance and costume he already had made a tender impression upon the heart of polly bottler and when she had been very good and conquered the alphabet up to p the pigat which point professional feeling always overcame the whole familythe reward of merit selected by herself would sometimes be a little visit to bonny as the cart came back from findon there is room for suspicion however that true love may not have been the only motive power or at least that poor bonny had a very formidable rival in jack the donkey inasmuch as the young lady always demanded as the firstfruit of hospitality a prolonged caracole on that quadruped which she always performed in cavalier fashion whereto the formation of her lower members afforded especial facility now one afternoon towards allhallows day when the air was brisk and the crisp leaves rustled some under foot and some overhead mr bottler upon his return from storrington with four pretty porkers in under his net received from his taciturn daughter that push on his right knee whose import he well understood it meantwe are going to see bonny today you must turn on this side and go over the fields all right little un the pigman answered with neverfailing smile daddy knows as well as you do amost though you cant expect him to come up to you polly gave a nod which was as much as any one ever expected of her all the time she was out of doors at home she could talk any number to the dozen when the mood was on her but directly she got into the open air the size of the world was too much for her all she could do was to stand and wonder and have the whole of it going through her without her feeling anything after much jolting and rattling and squeaking of pigs at the roughness of sod or fallow they won the entrance of coombe lorraine and the hermitage of bonny that exemplary boy had been all day pursuing his calling with his usual diligence and was very busy now blowing up his fire to have some hot savoury stew to warm him all his beggings and his buyings c were cast in together and none but the cook and consumer could tell how marvellously they always managed to agree among themselves and with him a sharp little turn of air had set in and made every rover of the land sharp set and the lid of the pot was beginning to lift charily and preciously when the stubble and bramble crackled much bonny ensconced in his kitchen corner on the right hand outside his main entrance kept stirring the fire and warming his hands and indulging in a preliminary smell bearing ever in mind the stern duty of promoting liberal sentiments he had felt while passing an old womans garden how thoroughly welcome he ought to be to a few sprigs of basil a handful of onions and a pinch of lemonthyme and how much more polite it was to dispense with the frigid ceremony of asking as the cart rattled up in the teeth of the wind polly bottler began to expand her frank ingenuous nostrils inhaled the breeze and thus spake with her mouth dad ise yerry hungy no wonder replied the paternal voice what a boy to be sure that is to cook at his time of life just to taste his stoos heve got a born knowledge what to put inay and what to keep out and how long to do it he deserveth that pot as i gived him out of the bilin house now dothnt he if moother wornt looking for us to home with chittlings and fried taties id as lief sit down and sup with him he maketh me in the humour that he doth as soon as he beheld his visitors bonny advanced in a graceful manner as if his supper was of no account he had long been aware from the comments of boys at steyning who were hostile to him that his chimneypot hat was not altogether in strict accord with his character this had mortified him as deeply as his lightsome heart could feel because he had trusted to that hat to achieve his restoration into the bosom of society the words of the incumbent of his parish ere ever the latter began to thrash him had sunk into his inner and deeper consciousness and conscience and therein had stirred up a nascent longing to have something to say to somebody whose forelegs were not employed for locomotion any longer alas that ghost of a definition has no leg to stand upon no two great authorities perfect as they are and complete in their own system can agree with one another concerning the order of a horses feet in walking ambling or trotting or even standing on all fours in stable the walk of a trueborn briton is surely almost as important a question which arm does he swing to keep time with which leg and bends he his elbows in time with his knees and do all four occupy the air or the ground or himself in a regulated sequence and if so what aberration must ensue from the use of a walkingstick dipus who knew all about feet from the tenderness of his own soles could scarcely be sure of all this before the time of the close of the market this is far too important a question to be treated hastily only while one is about it let bonnys hat be settled for wherever he thought to have made an impression with this really guineahat ridicule and execration followed on his naked heels till he sold it at last for tenpencehalfpenny and came back to his naked head society is not to be carried by storm even with a pickedup hat jack the donkey was always delighted to have polly bottler upon his back not perhaps from any vaticination of his future mistress but because she was sure to reward him with a cake or an apple or something good so that when he felt her sturdy little legs both hands in his mane and the heels begin to drum he would prick his long ears and toss his fine white nose and would even have arched his neck if nature had not strictly forbidden him on the present occasion however polly did not very long witch the world with noble donkeymanship although mr bottler sat patiently in his cart smiling as if he could never kill a pig and with paternal pride stamped on every wrinkle of his nose while the brieflived porkers poked their snouts through the net and watched with little sharp hairy eyes the very last drama perhaps in which they would be spectators only the lively creatures did not suspect that bonnys fire the night after next would be cooking some of their vital parts with a truly fine smell of sausages sausages were too dear for bonny as even the pigs at a glance were aware but he earned three quarters of a pound for nothing by noble hospitality to wit his angel of a polly had not made more than three or four parades while he with his head scarcely reaching up to the mark at the back of the donkeys ears where the perspiration powdered shouted and holloaed and madebelieve to be very bigas boys must do for practice towards their manhoodwhen by some concurrent goodwill of air and fire and finer elements the potlid arose to let out a bubble of goodness returning to its native heaven and the volatile virtue gently hovered to leave a fair memory behind the merest corner of this fragrance flipped into polly bottlers nose as a weaker emanation had done even before she began her ride and this time her mouth and her voice expressed cessation of hesitation et me down et me down she cried stretching her fat short arms to bonny i ants some ise so hungy stop a bit miss said bonny as being the pink of politeness to all the fair there your purty little toes is on the blessed ground again stop a bit miss while i runs into my house for to get the spoon for up to this time he had stirred his soup with a forked stick made of dogwood which helps to flavour everything but now as a host he was bound to show his more refined resources polly however was so rapt out of her usual immobility that she actually toddled into bonnys house to make him be quick about the spoon he in amazement turned round and stared to be sure of his eyes that such a thing could ever have happened to him the jealousy of the collector strove with the hospitality of the householder and the chivalry of the rover but the finer feelings conquered and he showed her round the corner mr bottler who could not get in cracked his whip and whistled at them polly with great eyes of wonder and fright at her own daring longed with one breath to go on and with the next to run back again but the boy caught hold of her hand and she stuck to him through the ins and outs of light until there was something well worth seeing what is the sweetest thing in life hope love gold fame pride revenge dangeror anything else according to the nature of the liver but with those who own very little and have come across all that little with risk and much uncertainty the sweetest thing in life is likely to be the sense of ownership the mightiest hoarder of gold and silver crsus rhampsinitus or solomon never thought half so much of his stores or at any rate never enjoyed them as much as this ragandbone collector his when he came to his room he held his breath and watched with the greatest anxiety for corresponding emotion of polly the room was perhaps about twelve feet long and eight feet wide at its utmost scooped from the chalk without any sharp corners but with a grand contempt of shape the floor went up and down and so did the roof according to circumstances the floor appearing inclined to rise and the roof to come down if called upon much excellent rubbish was here to be found but the window was the first thing to seize and hold any strangers attention it must have been built either by or for the old hermit who once had dwelt there at any rate no one could have designed it without a quaint ingenuity it was cut through a threefoot wall of chalk the embrasure being about five feet in span and three feet deep at the crown of the arch in the middle a narrow pier of chalk was left to keep the arch up and the lights on either side were made of horn stained glass and pigs bladder the last were of bonnys handiwork to keep out the wind when it blew too cold among the flaws of ages and now as the evening light fetched round the foot of the hills and gathered strongly into this western aspect the richness of colours was such that even pollys steadfast eyes were dazed without vouchsafing so much as a glance at bonnys hoarded glories the child ran across the narrow chamber and spread out her hands and opened her mouth wider even than her eyes at the tints now streaming in on her the glass had been brought perhaps from some ruined chapel of the hillside and glowed with a depth of colour infused by centuries of sunset not one pane of regular shape was to be found among them but all like veins of marble ran with sweetest harmony of hue to meet the horn and the pigs bladder from the outside it looked like a dusty slate traversed with bits of a crusted bottle it required to be seen from the inside like an ancient masters painting polly like the rest of those few children who do not overtalk themselves spent much of her time in observation storing the entries inwardly and young as she was there might be perhaps a doubt entertained by those who knew her whether she were not of a deeper and more solid cast of mind than bonny her father at any rate declared and her mother was of the same opinion that by the time she was ten years old she would buy and sell all steyning however they may have thought all this because all their other children were so stupid now be they right or be they wrongas may be shown hereafterpolly possessed at least the first and most essential of all the many endowments needful to approach success polly bottler stuck to her point and now even with those fine old colours like a century of rainbows puzzling her polly remembered the stew in the pot and pointed with her finger to the windowledge where something shone in a rich blue light heres a poon bonny she exclaimed heres a poon et me have it bonny no thats not a spoon miss and i cant make out for the life of me whatever it can be ive a seed a many queer things but i never seed the likes of that afore ah take care miss or youll cut your fingers for polly with a most resolute air had scrambled to the top of an old brown jar the salvage from some shipwreck which stood beneath the windowsill and thence with a gallant sprawl she reached and clutched the shining implement which she wanted to eat her stew with the boy was surprised to see her lift it with her fat brown fingers and hold it tightly without being cut or stung as he expected for he had a wholesome fear of this thing and had set it up as a kind of fetish his mind like every other requiring something to bow down to for the manner of his finding it first and then its presentment in the mouth of jack added to the interest which its unknown meaning won for it with a laugh of triumph the bowlegged maiden descended from her dangerous height and paying no heed to all bonnys treasures waddled away with her new toy either to show it to her father or to plunge it into the stewpot perhaps but her careful host with an iron spoon and a saucer in his hands ran after her and gently guided her to the crock whither also mr bottler sped this was as it should be and they found it so for when the boy bonny with a hospitable sweep lifted the cover of his cookery a sense of that void which all nature protests against rose in the forefront of all three and forebade them to seek any further bottler himself in the stress of the moment let the distant vision fadeof fried potatoes and combed chittlingsand lapsed into that lowest treason to lares and penatesa supper abroad when the supper at home is salted and peppered and browning but though polly opened her mouth so wide and smacked her lips and made every other gratifying demonstration not for one moment would she cede possession of the treasure she had found in bonnys window even while most absorbed in absorbing she nursed it jealously on her lap and even when her father had lit his pipe from bonnys bonfire and was ready to hoist her again over the footboard the child stuck fast to her new delight and set up a sturdy yell when the owner came to reclaim it from her now dont ee dont ee thats a dear began the gentle porkbutcher as the pigs in the cart caught up the strain and echo had enough to do for polly of course redoubled her wailings as all little dears must when coaxed to stop here bonny here lad ill gie thee sixpence for un though her aint worth a penny i doubt and thou mayst call tomorrow and the misses ll gie thee a clot of sassages bonny looked longingly at his fetish but gratitude and true love got the better of veneration polly moreover might well be trusted to preserve this idol until in the day when he made his own it should return into his bosom and so it came to pass that this palladium of the hermitage was set up at the head of polly bottlers little crib and installed in the post of her favourite doll chapter xxxiv under deadly fire though coombe lorraine was so old a mansion and so full of old customs the christmas of the comet year was as dull as a sunday in a warehouse hilary who had always been the life of the place was far away fed upon hardships and short rations alice though full sometimes of spirits at other times would run away and fret and blame herself as if the whole of the fault was on her side this was of course an absurd idea but sensitive girls in moods of dejection are not good judges of absurdity and alice at such times fully believed that if she had not intercepted so much of her fathers affection from her brother things would have been very different it might have been so but the answer was that she never had wittingly stood between them but on the contrary had laid herself out even at the risk of offending both to bring their widely different natures into kinder unity sir roland also was becoming more and more reserved and meditative he would sit for hours in his bookroom immersed in his favourite studies or rather absorbed in his misty abstractions and lady valeria did not add to the cheer of the household although perhaps she did increase its comfort by suddenly ceasing to interfere with mrs pipkins and everybody else and sending for the parson of the next parish because she had no faith in mr hales that worthys unprofessional visits and those of his wife and daughters were now almost the only pleasant incidents of the day or week for the country was more and more depressed by gloomy burden of endless war the scarcity of the fruits of the earth and the slaughter of good brave people so that as the time went on what with miserable expeditions pestilence long campaigns hard sieges furious battles and starvationthere was scarcely any decent family that was not gone into mourning even the rector as lucky a man as ever lived had lost a nephew or at least a nephew of his dear wifewhich he said was almost worse to himslain in battle fighting hard for his country and constitution mr hales preached a beautiful sermon as good as a book about it so that all the parish wept and three young men enlisted the sheep were down in the lowlands now standing up to their knees in litter and chewing very slowly or sidling up against one another in the joy of woolliness or lying down with their bare grave noses stretched for contemplations sake winking with their gentle eyes and thanking god for the roof above them and the troughs in front of them they never regarded themselves as mutton nor their fleeces as worsted yarn it was really sad to behold them and think that the future could not make them miserable no snow had fallen but all the downs were spread with that sombre brown which is the breath or the blast of the windfrost but alice lorraine took her daily walk for her father forbade her to ride on the hilltops in the bleak and bitter wind her thoughts were continually of her brother and as the cold breeze rattled her cloak or sprayed her soft hands through her gloves many a time she said to herself i suppose there is no frost in spain or not like this at any rate how could the poor fellow sleep in a tent in such dreadful weather as this is how little she dreamed that he had to sleep whenever he got such a blissful chance not in a tent but an open trench with a keener wind and a blacker frost preying on his shivering bones while cannonballs and fiery shells in a pitiless storm rushed over him it was no featherbed fight that was fought in front of ciudad rodrigo about the middle of january ad desperate work was going on for now there was no time to think of life within a certain number of days the fort must be taken or the army lost the defences were strong and the garrison brave and supplied with artillery far superior to that of the besiegers the season also and the bitter weather fought against the british and so did the indolence of their allies and so did british roguery the sappers could only work in the dark because of the grape from the ramparts and working thus the tools either bent beneath their feet or snapped off short the contractor had sent out falsegrained stuff instead of good english steel and iron and if in this world he earned his fortune he assured his fate in the other at length by stubborn perseverance most of these troubles were overcome and the english batteries opened roar answered roar and bullet bullet and the black air was striped with fire and smoke and men began to study the faces of the men that shot at them until after some days of hard pounding it was determined to rush in all who care to read of valour know what a desperate rush it washow strong men struggled and leaped and clomb hung and swung on the crest of the breach like stormy surges towering and then leaped down upon spluttering shells drawn swords and sparkling bayonets before the signal to storm was given and while men were talking of it hilary lorraine felt most uncomfortably nervous he did not possess that solid phlegm which is found more often in squarebuilt people neither had he any share of fatalism cold or hot he was nothing more than a spirited young englishman very fond of life hating cruelty and fearing to have any hand in it although he had been in the trenches and exposed to frequent dangers he had not been in handtohand conflict yet and he knew not how he might behave he knew that he was an officer now in the bravest and hardiest armies known on earth since the time of the samnitesalthough perhaps not the very best behaved as they proved that selfsame night and not only that but an officer of the famous light division and the fiercest regiment of that divisioneverywhere known as the fightingcocks and he was not sure that he could fight a frog he was sure that he never could kill anybody at least in his natural state of mind and worse than that he was not at all sure that he could endure to be killed himself however he made preparation for it he brought out the testament mabel had given him as a parting keepsake in the moment of true loves piety and he opened it at a passage marked with a woven tress of her long rich hairsoldiers do that is commanded of you and he wondered whether he could manage it and while he was trembling not with the fear of the enemy but of his own young heart the colonel of that regiment came and laid his one hand on hilarys shoulder and looked into his bright blue eyes in all the army there was no braver nobler or kinderhearted man than colonel c of that regiment hilary looked at this true veteran with all the reverence and even awe which a young subaltern if fit for anything feels for commanding experience never a word he spoke however but waited to be spoken to you will do lad you will do said the colonel who had little time to spare i would rather see you like that than uproarious or even as cool as a cucumber i was just like that before my first action lorraine you will not disgrace your family your country or your regiment the colonel had lost two sons in battle younger men than hilary otherwise he might not have stopped to enter into an ensigns mind but every word he spoke struck fire in the heart of this gentle youth true gratitude chokes common answers and hilary made none to him an hour afterwards he made it by saving the life of the colonel the light division kept close and low from the sight of the sharp french gunners were waiting in a hollow curve of the inner parallel where the ground gave way a little under san francisco there had been no time to do anything more than breach the stone of the ramparts all the outer defences were almost as sound as ever the light division had orders to carry the lesser breachcost what it mightand then sweep the ramparts as far as the main breach where the strong assault was and so well did they do their work that they turned the auxiliary into the main attack and bodily carried the fortress for sooth to say they expected but could not manage to wait for the signal to storm no sooner did they hear the firing on the right than they began to stamp and swear for the haybags they were to throw into the ditch were not at hand and not to be seen are we horses to wait for the hay cried an irishman of the fiftysecond and with that they all set off as fast as ever their legs could carry them hilary laughedfor his sense of humour was never very far to seekat the way in which these men set off as if it were a game of football and at the wonderful mixture of fun and fury in their faces also at this sudden burlesque of the tragedy he expectedwith heroes out at heels and elbows and smallclothes streaming upon the breeze for the british government as usual left coats shoes and breeches to last for ever run lad run said major malcolm in his quiet scottish way you are bound to be up with them as one might say and your legs are unco long i shal na hoory mysell but take the short cut over the open may i come with you asked hilary panting if you have na mither nor wife said the major na wife of course by the look of you lorraine had no sense what he was about for the grapeshot whistled through the air like hornets and cut off one of his loose fair locks as he crossed the open with major malcolm to head their hot men at the crest of the glacis now how things happened after that or even what things happened at all that headlong young officer never could tell as he said in his letter to gregory lovejoyfor he was not allowed to write to mabel and would not describe such a scene to alicethe chief thing i remember is a lot of rushing and stumbling and swearing and cheering and staggering and tumbling backward and i got a tremendous crack on the head from a cannon laid across the top of the breach but luckily not a loaded one and i believe there were none of our fellows in front of me but i cannot be certain because of the smoke and the row and the rush and confusion and i saw a crapaud with a dead level at colonel c i suppose i was too small game for himand i was just in time to slash his triggerhand off which i felt justified in doing and his musket went up in the air and went off and i just jumped aside from a fine bearded fellow who rushed at me with a bayonet and before he could have at me again he fell dead shot by his own friends from behind who were shooting at memore shame to themwhen our men charged with empty muskets and when the breach was our own we were formed on the top of the rampart and went off at doublequick to help at the main breach and so we did and that is about all i know of it but the more experienced warriors knew a great deal more of hilarys doings especially colonel c of his regiment and major malcolm and captain mleod all of these said that they never saw any young fellow behave so well for the first time of being under deadly fire that he might have been off his head for the moment but that would very soon wear offor if it did not all the better so long as he always did the right thing thus and unless he got shot he would be an honour to the country the army and the regiment chapter xxxv how to fry no pancakes having no love of bloodshed and having the luck to know nothing about it some of us might be glad to turn into the white gate across the lane leading into old applewood farmif only the franklin would unlock it for anybody in this wartime but now he has been getting sharper and sharper month after month and hearing so much about sieges and battles he never can be certain when the county of kent will be invaded for the last ten years he has expected something of the sort at least and being of a prudent mind keeps a duckgun heavily loaded moreover mabel is back again from exile with uncle catherow and though the grower only says that she is well enough for aught he knows when compliments are paid him about her good looks by the neighbourhood he knows well enough that she is more than that and he believes all the county to be after her it is utterly useless to denythough hot indignation would expand his horticultural breast at the thoughtthat he may have been just a little set up by that trifling affair about hilary it never were the cherries he says to himself as the author of a great discovery aha i seed it all along wife never guessed of it but i didshame upon thee grower for telling thyself such a dreadful caulkerand now we can see as plain as a pikestaff the very thing i seed when it was that big upon this he shows himself his thumbnail and feels that he has earned a glass of his ale mabel on the other hand is dreadfully worried by foreign affairs she wants to know why they must be always fighting and as nobody can give any other reason except that they suppose it is natteral she only can shake her head very sadly and ask how would you like to have to do it they turn up the udders of the cows to think out this great question and the spurting into the pail stops short and the cow looks round with great bountiful eyes and a flat broad nose and a spotted tongue desiring to know what they are at with her is her milk not worth the milking pray this leads to no satisfaction whatever upon behalf of any one and mabel after a shiver or two runs back to the broad old fireplace to sit in the light and the smell of the wood to spread her pointed fingers forth and see how clear they are and think for mabels hands are quite as pretty as if they were of true norman blood instead of the elder danish cast and she is very particular now not to have even a brown line under her nails and now in the month of february before the witching festival of st valentine was prepared for with cudgelling of brains and violent rhymes and criminal assaults upon grammar this flower of kentas the gallant hopgrowers in toasting moments entitled herwas sitting or standing or drooping her head or whatever suits best to their metaphor at or near the fireplace in the warm old simple hall love however warm and faithful is all the better for a good clear fire ere ever the snowdrops begin to spring also it loves to watch the dancing of the flames and the flickering light and even in the smoke discovers something to itself akin mabel was full of these beautiful dreams because she was left altogether to herself and because she remembered so well what had happened along every inch of the diningtable and above all because she was sleepy long anxiety and great worry and the sense of having no one fit to understand a girlbut everybody taking low and mercenary and fickle views and even the most trusty people giving base advice to one in those odious proverbial formsa bird in the hand is worth two in the bush fast find fast bind there is better fish in the sea c mabel thought there never had been such a selfish world to deal with has not every kind of fame however pure it may be and exalted its own special disadvantage lest poor mortals grow too proud at any rate mabel now reflected rather with sorrow than with triumph upon her fame for pancakesbecause it was shrovetuesday now and all her tender thrills and deep anxieties must be discarded for or at any rate distracted by the composition of batter her fathers sense of propriety was so strong and that of excellence so keen that pancakes he would have on shrovetuesday and pancakes only from mabels hand she had pleaded however for leave to make them here in the dininghall instead of frying at the kitchen fireplace because she knew what sally the cook and susan the maid would be at with her those two girls would never leave her the smallest chance of retiring into her deeper nature and meditating although they could understand nothing at all they would take advantage of her good temper to enjoy themselves with the most wornout jokes such trumpery was below mabel now and some day or other she would let them know it without thinking twice of such low matters the maiden was now in great trouble of the heart by reason of sundry rumours paddy from cork had brought home word from maidstone only yesterday that a desperate fight had been fought in spain and almost everybody had been blown up both armies had made up their minds to die so that with the drums beating and the colours flying they marched into a powdermagazine and tossed up a pin which should be the one to fire it and blow up the others and the english had lost the toss and no one survived to tell the story mabel doubted most of this though paddy vowed that he had known the like when wars was wars and the boys had spirit still she felt sure that there had been something and she longed most sadly to know all about it her brother gregory was in london keeping his hilary term and slaving at his wretched lawbooks and she had begged him if he loved her to send down all the latest news by john shorne every marketdayfor the post would not carry newspapers and now having mixed her batter she waited sleepy after sleepless nights unable to leave her post and go to meet the van as she longed to do the while the fire was clearing pensively sitting thus and longing for somebody to look at her she glanced at the face of the clock which was the only face regarding her and she won from it but the stern frown of timeshe must set to at her pancakes batter is all the better for standing readymade for an hour or so the weaker particles expire while the good stuff grows the more fit to be fried and to turn over in the pan properly with a gentle sigh the flower of kent put her fryingpan on just to warm the bottom no lard for her but the best freshbutterat any rate for the first halfdozen to be set aside for her father and mother after that she would be more frugal perhaps but just as the butter began to oose on the bottom of the pan she heard or thought that she heard a sweet distant tinkle coming through the frosty air and running to the window she caught beyond doubt the sound of the bells at the corner of the lane the bells that the horses always wore when the nights were dark and long and a throb of eager hope and fear went to her heart at every tinkle i cannot wait how can i wait she cried with flushing cheeks and eyes twiceladen between smiles and tears fathers pancakes can wait much better there go back she spoke to the fryingpan as with the prudent care of a fine young housewife she lifted it off and laid it on the hob for fear of the butter burning and then with quick steps out she went not even stopping to find a hat in her hurry to meet the van and know the best or the worst of the news of the war for crusty john who would go through fire and water to please miss mabel had orders not to come home without the very latest tidings there was nothing to go to market now but the van had been up with a load of straw to some mews where the grower had taken a contract and of course it came loaded back with litter while mabel was all impatience and fright john shorne in the most deliberate manner descended from the drivingbox and purposely shunning her eager glance began to unfasten the leaders traces and pass them through his horny hands and coil them into elegant spirals like horns of jupiter ammon mabels fear grew worse and worse because he would not look at her oh john you never could have the heart to keep me waiting like this unless what you there missie lor now what can have brought ee out this weather as if you did not see me john why you must have seen me all along this here be such a dreadful horse to smoke said john who always shunned

enough fourscore officers gone to glory besides all the others as was not worth counting oh john you give me such a dreadful pain here let me know the worst i do implore you he aint one of em now is that enough john shorne made so little of true love now and forgot his early situations so in the bosom of a hungry family that he looked upon mabels coorting as an agreeable playground for little jokes but now he was surprised and frightened at her way of taking them there dont ee cry now thats a dear he said as she leaned on the shaft of the waggon and sobbed so that the near wheeler began in pure sympathy to sniff at her lord bless ee there be nothing to cry about heve abeen and dooed wonders that a hath of course he has john he could not help it he was sure to do wonders dont you see if onlyif only they did not stop him he hathnt killed bonypart yet said john recovering his vein of humour as mabel began to smile through her tears but i blieve he wool if he gooeth on only half so well

witch miss mabel and heres the very corner i turned down when i read it to the folk at the pig and whistle glorious british victorycapture of shoedad rodleygoeighty british officers killed and forty great guns taken there there bless your bright eyes now will you be content with it oh give it me give it me how can i tell until i have read it ten times over crusty john blessed all the girls of the period becoming more and more too many for him as his masters daughter ran away to devour that greasy journal and by the time he had pulled his coat off and shouted for paddy and another man and stuck his own pitchfork into the litter as soon as they had backed the wheelers mabel was up in her own little room and down on her knees to thank the lord for the abstract herself had made of it somehow or other the natural impulse of all good girls at that time was to believe that they had a creator and father whom to thank for all mercies but that idea has been improved since then chapter xxxvi lady coke upon littleton at coombe lorraine these things had been known and entered into some time ago for sir roland had not left his son so wholly uncared for in a foreign land as hilary in his sore heart believed in his regiment there was a certain old major lame and addicted to violent language but dry and sensible according to his lights and truthful and upright and quarrelsome burning to be first as he always did in every desperate conflict major clumps saw the young fellows get in front of him and his temper exploded always come back come back you condemned offspring of canine lineage he used to shout let an honest man have a fair start with you because my feet arethere you go again no consideration any of you this major clumps was admirably connected being the nephew of lord de lampnor the husband of lady valerias friend so that by this means it was brought round that hilarys doings should be reported and lady valeria had received a letter in which her grandsons exploits at the storming of ciudad rodrigo were so recounted that alice wept and the ancient lady smiled with pride and even sir roland said well after all that boy can do something the following afternoon the master of coombe lorraine was sent for to have a long talk with his mother about matters of business now sir roland particularly hated business his income was enough for all his wants his ambition if ever he had any was a vague and vaporous element he left to his lawyers all matters of law and even the management of his land but for his mothers strong opposition he would gladly have left to a steward or agent although the extent of his property scarcely justified such an appointment so he entered his mothers room that day with a languid step and reluctant air the lady paid very little heed to that perhaps she even enjoyed it a little holding that every man is bound to attend to his own affairs she had little patience and no sympathy with such philosophic indifference on the other hand sir roland could not deny himself a little quiet smile when he saw his mothers great preparations to bring him both to book and deed lady valeria lorraine was sitting as upright as she had sat throughout her life and would sit until she lay down for ever on the table before her were several thick and portentously dirty documents arranged and docketed by her own sagacious hand and beyond these and opened at pages for reference lay certain old lawbooks of a most deterrent guise and attitude sheppards touchstone before prestons time littletons tenures viners abridgment comyns digest glanville plowden and other great authors were here prepared to cause delicious confusion in the keenest feminine intellect and lady valeria was quite sure now that they all contradicted one another after the formal salutation which she always insisted upon the venerable lady began to fuss about a little and pretend to be at a loss with things she was always dressed as if she expected a visit from the royal family and it was as good as a lecture for any slovenly young girls to see how cleverly she avoided soil of dirty book or dirtier parchment upon her white cuffs or flemish lace even her delicate pointed fingers shrunken as they were with age had a knack of flitting over grime without attracting it i daresay you are surprised she said with her usual soft and courteous smile at seeing me employed like this and turning lawyer in my old age sir roland said something complimentary knowing that it was expected of him the ancient lady had always taught himhowever erroneous the doctrinethat no man who is at a loss for the proper compliment to a lady deserves to be thought a gentleman she always had treated her son as a gentleman dearer to her than other gentlemen but still to be regarded in that light mainly and he perhaps by inheritance had been led to behave to his own son thusa line of behaviour warmly resented by the impetuous hilary now i beg you to attendyou must try to attend continued lady valeria rouse yourself up if you please dear roland this is not a question of astrologers or any queer thing of that sort but a commonsense matter and i might say a difficult point of law perhaps that being so sir roland answered with a smile of bright relief our course becomes very simple we have nothing that we need trouble ourselves to be puzzled with uncomfortably messrs crookson hack and clinkerthey know how to keep in arrear and to charge it is your own fault my dear roland if they overcharge you everybody will do so when they know that you mean to put up with it your dear father was under my guidance much more than you have ever been and he never let people overcharge himmore than he could help i mean i quite perceive the distinction mother you have put it very clearly but how does that bear upon the matter you have now to speak of in a great many ways this account of hilarys desperate behaviour as i must call it upon sound reflection leads me to consider the great probability of something happening to him there are many battles yet to be fought and some of them may be worse than this you remember what mr malahide said when your dear father would insist upon that resettlement of the entire property in the year sir roland knew quite well that it was not his dear father at all but his mother who had insisted upon that very stringent and illadvised proceeding in which he himself had joined reluctantly and only by dint of her persistence however he did not remind her of this to be sure he replied i remember it clearly and i have his very words somewhere he declined to draw it in accordance with the instructions of our solicitors until his own opinion upon it had been laid before the familya most unusual course he said for counsel in chambers to adopt but having some knowledge of the parties concerned he hoped they would pardon his interference and then his words were to this effectthe operation of such a settlement may be most injurious the parties will be tying their own hands most completely withoutas far as i can perceiveany adequate reason for doing so supposing for instance there should be occasion for raising money upon these estates during the joint lives of the grandson and granddaughter and before the granddaughter is of age there will be no means of doing it the limitation to her which is a most unusual one in such cases will preclude the possibility of representing the feesimple the young lady is now just five years old and if this extraordinary settlement is made no marketable title can be deduced for the next sixteen years except of course in the case of her decease and many other objections he made all of which however were overruled and after that protest he prepared the settlement the matter was hurried through your fathers state of health for at that very time he was on his deathbed but no harm whatever has come of it which shows that we were right and mr malahide quite wrong but i have been looking to see what would happen in case poor hilaryah it was his own fault that all these restrictions were introduced although he was scarcely twelve years old he had shown himself so thoroughly volatile so very easy to lead away and as it used to be called by vulgar people so happygolucky that your dear father wished while he had the power to disable him from lessening any further our lessened estates and but for that settlement where might we be you know my dear mother that i never liked that exceedingly complicated and most mistrustful settlement and if i had not been so sick of all business after the loss of my dear wife even your powers of persuasion would have failed to make me execute it at any rate it has had one good effect it has robbed poor hilary to a great extent of the charms that he must have possessed for the jews how can they discover such things with a firm of trusty and most respectable lawyersto me it is quite wonderful how many things are wondrous and nothing more wondrous than man himselfexcept of course a jew they do find out and they never let us find out how they managed it but do let me ask you my dear mother what particular turn of thought has compelled you to be so learned you mean these books well let me think i quite forget what it was that i wanted it is useless to flatter me roland now my memory is not as it was nor my sight nor any other gift however i ought to be very thankful and i often try to be so take a little time to think sir roland said in his most gentle tone and then if it does not occur to you we can talk of it some other time oh now i remember they told me something about the poor boy being smitten with some girl of inferior station of course even he would have a little more sense than ever to dream of marrying her but young men although they mean nothing are apt to say things that cost money and above all others hilary may have given some grounds for damageshe is so inconsiderate now if that should be so and they give a large verdict as a lowborn jury always does against a wellborn gentleman several delicate points arise in the first place has he any legal right to fall in love under this settlement and if not how can any judgment take effect on his interest and again if he should fall in battle would that stay proceedings and if all these points should be settled against us have we any power to raise the money for i know that you have no money roland except what you receive from land as under my advice every farthing of accumulation has been laid out in buying back field by field portions of our lost property yes my dear mother and worse than that every field so purchased has been declared or assuredor whatever they call itto follow the trusts of this settlement so that i verily believe if i wanted for any urgent family purposes i must raise itif at allupon mere personal security but surely dear mother you cannot find fault with the very efficient manner in which your own desires have been carried out well my son i have acted for the best and according to your dear fathers plans when i married your father the old lady continued with a soft quiet pride which was quite her own it was believed in the very best quarters that the duchess dowager of chalcorhin of whom perhaps you may have heard me speak truly yes mother every other day and my dear son i have a right to do so of my own godmother and greataunt the sneering spirit of the present day cannot rob us of all our advantages however your father as was right and natural on his part felt a convictionas those low methodists are always saying of themselvesthat there would be a hundred thousand pounds to help him in what he was thinking of but her grace was vexed at my marriage and so as you know my dear roland i brought the lorraines nothing yes my dear mother you brought yourself and your clear mind and clever management will you always think that of me roland dear whatever happens when i am gone will you always believe that i did my best sir roland was surprised at his mothers very unusual state of mind and he saw how her delicate face was softened from its calm composure and the like emotion moved himself for he was a man of strong feeling though he deigned so rarely to let it out and froze it so often with fatalism my dearest mother he answered bowing his silver hair over her snowy locks surely you know me well enough to make such a question needless a more active and devoted mind never worked for one especial purposethe welfare of those for whose sake you have abandoned show and grandeur ay mother and with as much success as our hereditary faults allowed since your labours began we must have picked up fifty acres is that all you know of it roland asked lady valeria with a short sigh all my efforts will be thrown away i greatly fear when i am gone one hundred and fiftysix acres and a half have been brought back into the lorraine rentroll without even counting the hedgerows and now there are two things to be done to carry on this great work well that interloper sir remnant chapman a man of comparatively modern race holds more than two thousand acres of the best and oldest lorraine land he wishes young alice to marry his son and proposes a very handsome settlement why roland you told me all about itthough not quite as soon as you should have done i do not perceive that i neglected my duty if i did so surprise must have knocked me out of time as our good struan expresses it mr hales mr hales the clergyman i cannot imagine what he could mean but it must have been something low of course either badgerbaiting or prizefightingthough people of really good position have a right to like such things but now we must let that poor stupid sir remnant who cannot even turn a compliment have his own way about silly alice for the sake of more important things my dear mother you sometimes try me what can be more important than alice and to what overpowering influence is she to be sacrificed it is useless to talk like that sir roland she must do her best like everybody else who is not of ignoble family the girl has plenty of pride and will be the first to perceive the necessity twill not be so much for the sake of the settlement for that of course will go with her but we must make it a stipulation and have it set down under hand and seal that sir remnant and after his time his son shall sell to us at a valuation any pieces of our own land which we may be able to repurchase now roland you never would have thought of that it is a most admirable plan is it not it is worthy of your ingenuity mother but will sir remnant agree to it he is fond of his acres like all landowners one acre is as good as another to a man of modern lineage some of that land passed from us at the time of the great confiscation and some was sold by that reckless man the last sir hilary but one the chapmans have held very little of it for even so much as two centuries how then can they be attached to it no no you must make that condition roland the first and the most essential point as for the settlement that is nothing though of course you will also insist upon it for a girl of alices birth and appearance we could easily get a larger settlement and a much higher position by sending her to london for one season under lady de lampnor but how would that help us towards getting back the land you look so learned said sir roland smiling with all those books which you seem to have mastered that surely we may employ you to draw the deed for signature by sir remnant i have little doubt that i could do it replied the ancient lady who took everything as in earnest but i am not so strong as i was and therefore i wish you to push things forward i have given up as you know my proper attention to many little matters which go on very badly without me simply that all my small abilities might be devoted to this great purpose i hope to have still a few years leftbut two things i must see accomplished before i can leave this world in peace alice must marry captain chapman upon the conditions which i have expressed and hilary must marry a fortune with special clauses enabling him to invest it in land upon proper trusts the boy is handsome enough for anything and his fame for courage and his martial bearing and above all his regimentals will make him irresistible but he must not stay at the wars too long it is too great a risk to run well my dear mother i must confess that your scheme is a very fine one supposing i mean that the object is worth it of which i am by no means sure i have not made it the purpose of my life to recover the lorraine estates i have not toiled and schemed for that end although he added with dry irony which quite escaped his mothers sense it is of course a far less exertion to sell ones children with that view but there are several hitches in your little plan for instance alice hates captain chapman and hilary loves a girl without a pennythough the grower must have had good markets lately according to the price of vegetables clever as sir roland was he made the mistake of the outer world there are no such things as good markets alice is a mere child replied her grandmother smiling placidly she cannot have the smallest idea yet as to what she likes or dislikes the captain is quite as well bred as his father and he can drive fourinhand i wonder that she has shown such presumption as either to like or dislike him it is your fault roland perpetual indulgence sets children up to such dreadful things of which they must be broken painfully having been encouraged so my dear mother sir roland answered keeping his own opinions to himself you clearly know how to manage young girls a great deal better than i do will you talk to alice in your own convincing and most eloquent manner if i send her up to you with the greatest pleasure said lady valeria having long expected this you may safely leave her to me i believe chits of girls must be taught their place but i mean to be very quiet with her let me see her tomorrow roland i am tired now and could not manage her without more talking than i am fit for therefore i will say good evening chapter xxxvii aches v acres alice had plenty of spirit of her own which of course she called sense of dignity but in spite of it all she was most unwilling to encounter her valiant grandmother and she knew that this encounter was announced the moment she was sent for is my hair right are my bows right has the old dog left any pawmarks on me she asked herself but would rather have diedas in her quick way she said to herselfthan have confessed her fright by asking any of the maids to tell her betwixt herself and her grandmother there was little love lost and still less kept for each looked down upon the other from the heights of impartial duty a flighty romantic unfledged girl with no deference towards her superiorsa coldblooded crafty plotting old woman without a bit of faith in any onethus each would have seen the others image if she had looked into her own mind and faced its impressions honestly the elder lady having cares of her own contrived for the most part to do very well without seeing much of her grandchild who on the other hand was quite resigned to the affliction of this absence but alice could never perceive the justice of the reproaches wherewith she was met whenever she came for not having come more often where she was not wanted now with all her courage ready and not a sign in eye face or bearing of the disquietude all the while fluttering in the shadow of her heart the young lady looked at the ancient lady respectfully and saluted her two fairer types of youth and age of innocence and experience of maiden grace and matron dignity scarcely need be sought for and the resemblance of their features heightened the contrast of age and character a sculptor might have been pleased to reckon the points of beauty inherited by the maiden from the matronthe slim round neck the graceful carriage of the wellshaped head the elliptic arch of brow the broad yet softlymoulded forehead as well as the straight nose and delicate china strong resemblance of details but in the expression of the whole an even stronger difference for alice besides the bright play of youth and all its glistening carelessness was gifted with a kinder and larger nature than her grandmother and as a kind largefruited tree to all who understand it showseven by its bark and foliage and the expression of its growththe vigour of the virtue in it and liberality of its juice so a fine sweet human nature breathes and shines in the outer aspect brightens the glance and enriches the smile and makes the whole creature charming but alice though blest with this very nice manner of contemplating humanity was quite unable to bring it to bear upon the countenance of her grandmother we all know how the very best benevolence perpetually is pulled up short and even the turn of a word or a look or a breath of air with a chill in it scatters fine ideas into corners out of harmony you may take a chair my dear if you please said lady valeria graciously you seem to be rather pale today i hope you have not taken anything likely to disagree with you if you have there is still a little drop left of my famous ginger cordial you make a face that is not becoming you must get over those childish tricks you arelet me see how old are you seventeen years and a half madam about last wednesday fortnight it is always good to be accurate alice about is a very loose word indeed it may have been either that day or another it must have been either that day or some other said alice gravely curtsying you inherit this catchword style from your father i pass it over as you are so young but the sooner you leave it off the better there are many things now that you must leave off for instance you must not pretend to be witty it is not in our family i did not suppose that it was grandmother there used to be some wit when i was young but none of it has descended there is nothing more fatal to a young girls prospects than a sad ambition for jesting and it is concerning your prospects now that i wish to advise you kindly i hear from your father a very sad thingthat you receive with ingratitude the plans which we have formed for you my father has not told me of any plans at all about me he may not have told you but you know them well consulting your own welfare and the interest of the family we have resolved that you should at once receive the addresses of captain chapman you cannot be so cruel i am sure or if you are my father cannot i would sooner die than so degrade myself young girls always talk like that when their fancy does not happen to be caught when however that is the case they care not how they degrade themselves this throws upon their elders the duty of judging and deciding for them as to what will conduce to their happiness to hear captain chapmans name alone conduces to my misery i beg you alice to explain what you mean your expressions are strong and i am not sure that they are altogether respectful i mean them to be quite respectful grandmother and i do not mean them to be too strong indeed i should despair of making them so you are very provoking will you kindly state your objections to captain chapman alice for the first time dropped her eyes under the old ladys steadfast gaze she felt that her intuition was right but she could not put it into words is it his appearance may i ask is he too short for your ideal are his eyes too small and his hair too thin does he slouch in walking and turn his toes in is it any trumpery of that sort asked lady valeria though in her heart such things were not scored as trumpery were such things trumpery when you were young her grandchild longed to ask but duty and good training checked her his appearance is bad enough she replied but i do not attach much importance to that as if i believed it thought lady valeria then what is it that proves fatal to him in your sagacious judgment i beg you as a favour not to ask me madam i cannoti cannot explain to you nonsense child said the old lady smiling you would not be so absurd if you had only seen a little good society if you are so bashful you may look away but at any rate you must tell me then it is this the maiden answered with her grey eyes full on her grandmothers face and a rich blush adding to their lustre captain chapman is not what i call a good man in what way how what have you heard against him if he is not perfect you can make him so never never he is a very bad man he despises all women and hehe lookshe stares quite insolentlyeven at me well this is a little too good i declare exclaimed her grandmother with as loud a laugh as good breeding ever indulges in my dear child you must go to london you must be presented at court you must learn a little of the ways of the world and see the first gentleman in europe how his royal highness will laugh to be sure i shall send him the story through lady de lampnor that a young lady hates and abhors her intended because he even ventures to look at her you cannot understand me madam and i will not pretend to argue with you i should hope not indeed if we spread this story at the beginning of the season and have you presented while it is fresh we may save you even yet from your monster perhaps there will be such eagerness to behold you simply because you must not be looked at that everybody will be at your feet all closing their eyes for your sake i should hope alice was a very sweettempered girl but all the contempt with which in her heart she unconsciously regarded her grandmother was scarcely enough to keep her from flashing forth at this common raillery large tears of pride and injured delicacy formed in her eyes but she held them in only asking with a curtsy may i go now if you please to be sure you may go you have done quite enough you have made me laugh so that i want my tea only remember one serious thingthe interest of the family requires that you should soon learn to be looked at you must begin to take lessons at once within six months you must be engaged and within twelve months you must be married to captain stephen chapman i trow not said alice to herself as with another curtsy and a shudder she retreated but she had not long been sitting by herself and feeling the bitterness of defeat before she determined with womanly wit to have a triumph somewhere so she ran at once to her fathers room and he of course was at home to her if you please dear papa you must shut your books and you must come into this great chair and you must not shut even one of your eyes but listen in the most respectful manner to all i have to say to you well my dear sir roland answered what must be must you are a thorough tyrant the days are certainly getting longer but they scarcely seem to be long enough for you to torment your father no candles papa if you please as yet what i have to say can be said in the dark and that will enable you to look at me papa which otherwise you could scarcely do is it true that you are plotting to marry me to that odious captain chapman sir roland began to think what to say for his better nature often told him to wash his hands of this loathsome scheme are you so tired of me already said the quick girl with sound of tears in her voice have i behaved so very badly and shown so little love for you that you want to kill me so very soon father alice come alice you know how i love you and that all that i care for is your own good and are we so utterly different papa in our tastes and perceptions and principles that you can ever dream that it is good for me to marry mr chapman well my dear he is a very nice man quiet and gentle and kind to every one and most attentive to his father he could place you in a very good position alice and you would still be near me also there are other reasons making it desirable what other reasons papa may i know something about land i suppose land

and hearth and home and heart then after all you do love me father i call nothing love that loves anything else and how much she asked with her arms round his neck and her red lips curving to a crafty whisperhow much should i be worth if i married a man i despise and dislike enough for my grave and no more papa just the size of your small booktable here she fell away lost in her fathers arms and for the moment could only sigh with her lips and eyelids quivering and sir roland watching her pale loving face was inclined to hate his own mother you shall marry no one my own child he whispered through her unbraided hair no one whom you do not love dearly and who is not thoroughly worthy of you then i will not marry any one papa she answered with a smile reviving for i do not love any one a bit papa except my own father and my own brother and uncle struan of course and so on in an outer and milder manner and as for being worthy of me i am not worth very much i know still if i am worth only half an acre i must be too good for that captain chapman chapter xxxviii in the deadly breach the stern and strong will of a single man is a very fine thing for weaker menand still more so for womento dwell upon but the stern strong will of a host of men set upon one purpose and resolved to win it or die for it is a power that conquers the powers of earth and of nature arrayed against them the british army was resolved to carry by storm badajos and their vigorous manner of setting about it and obstinate way of going on with it overcame at last the strength of all that tried to stand before them this was the more to their credit becausethe worst of all things for a man to get overeven the weather itself was against them nothing makes a deeper depression in the human system than long spite of weather does the sense of luck is still over us all in spite of philosophy and mathematics and of all the behaviour of fortune what comes home to our roofs and hats so impressively as the weather does now thoroughly as these british men were resolved to get within the wall with equal thoroughness very brave frenchmen were resolved to keep them out and these had the weather in their favour for it is an ill wind that blows no one any good and the rain that rains on the just and unjust seems to have a preference for the latter though it must be acknowledged in the present case that having a view to justice a man of equal mind might say there was not too much on either side at any rate the rain kept raining for fear of any mistake among them moreover the moon between the showers came out at night or the sun by dayaccording to the habits of each of themexactly when they were wanted by the frenchmen and not at all by the englishmen if an englishman wanted to work in the dark the moon would get up just behind his back and muskets rifles and cannon itself were trained on him as at a target and his only chance was to fall flat on his stomach and shrink back like a toad in a bed of strawberries and this made us eager to advance per contra and after being shot at for a length of time almost every man one can meet with desires to have his turn of shooting not for the sake of revenge or anything low at all in that way but simply from that love of fairness which lies hiddentoo deep sometimessomewhere or other in all of us we are anxious to do one to another as the others desire to do to us and till we come to a different condition men must shoot and be shot at all these peaceable distinctions and regards of right and wrong were utterly useless and out of place in front of the walls of badajos right or wrong the place must be taken and this was the third time of trying it fury frenzy rushing slaughter and death that lies still when the heat is over who can take and tell them truly and if he could who would like to do it or who would thank him to hear of it all the british army knew that the assault was to be made that night and the frenchmen as appeared byandby knew right well what was coming for when the april sun went down in the brightest azure of all blue skies a hush of wonder and of waiting fell and lay upon all the scene the english now were grown to be what they always grow to be with much fightingsolid in their ways and according to the nature of things hot or cool with discipline square in their manner of coming up and hard to be sent back again certain sure of their strength to conquer and ready to charge the devil himself if he had the courage to wait for them they were under a man who knew how to lead them and trusted them to follow him their blood was stirred without grand harangues or melodramatic eloquence every man in that solid army knew his own work and meant to do it shoulder to shoulder with rival hardihood and contagious scorn of death the walls were higher and the approach much harder than at ciudad rodrigo the garrison stronger and the captain a strenuous and ingenious warrior therefore on the th of april as the storming parties watched the sunset fading along the guadiana and the sudden fall of night which scarcely gives a bird time to twitter on his roost they wanted no prophet to tell them how different their number would be tomorrow but still as the proper and comforting law of human nature ordains it every man thought or at any rate hoped that his messmate rather than himself was the one to leave a widow and orphans by midnight hilary lorraine was now beginning to get used to fighting at first in spite of all his talk about his sword and so on blows and bloodshed went against the grain of his kind and gay nature he even thought in his fresh aversion at so many corpses that war was a worse institution than law that error however he was beginning to abjure through the power of custom aided by two sapient reflections the first of these was that without much slaughter there can be no real gloryan article which the young man had now made up his mind to attain and his other wise recollection was that a frenchman is the natural enemy of the human race and must at all hazards and at any sacrifice of pious lives be extirpated moreover he may have begun to share by virtue of his amiability the views of his brotherofficers which of course were duly professional so that this young fellow upon the whole was as full of fight as the best of them no man died that night with more gloryyet many died and there was much glory so writes the thucydides of this war not about hilary as goodluck willed it but one of his senior officers and that such a sentence should ever have been written is a thing to think about with all that dash of bright carnage fresh on the page of one who did his duty so grandly both with sword and pen peaceful writers knowing more of sandy commons and the farmhouse fagot than of fascines and gabions of capons than of caponnires and of shot grapes than of grapeshot wisely may stick to the gardeningknife or in fiercest moments the pruninghook and have nothing to say to the stark swordblade such duty becomes tenfold a pleasure when the swordblades not only swing overhead or glitter at the unarmed breast but bolted into great beams of wood at the most offensive angles are flashing in the dark at the stomach of a man like a vast electric porcupine while bursting shells and powderbarrels and blasts of grapeshot thick as hail drowning curses shrieks and wails sweep the craggy rampart clear or leave only corpses roasting such and worse by a thousandfold than words may render or mind conceive was the struggle of that awful night at the central breach of badajos and here was hilary lorraine wounded spent with fruitless efforts dashed backward on spikes and on bayonetpoints trampled under foot and singed by the beard of a smouldering comrade yet glad even to lie still for a minute in the breathless depths of exhaustion all up with me now he was faintly thinkingperhaps my father will be satisfied goodbye dear alice and darling mabeland good night to this poor hilary and here his careerof fame or of shamemust have been over and done with if he had not already won goodliking among the men of his company for one of them with his next step ready to be planted on the young officers breast caught a view of his face by the light of a fireball stopped short and stooped over him blow me he exclaimed while likely to be blown into a thousand pieces if this baint the very young chap as saved me when i wur a dropping upon the road one good turn desarves another here bob lend a hand my boy a hand i cant lend thee a hinch cried bob they be squazing me up like a squatting match for while all the front men were thus lying dead the men from the rear would not stop from shoving and bodily heaving the others before them as buffaloes rush when they lose their wits they thrust every man his front man on the chevaux de frise as if it were a joke with that bitter recklessness of life and readiness to take their own turn at death which drive in one solid mass all true britons and their cousins across the atlantic whenever the strong blood is churned within them and yet all this time they know what they are about and so did these two soldiers now neither time nor room had they to lift poor hilary out of the bed of shattered granite where he lay with wedged spikes sticking into him and the two men who wanted to do it were swept by the surge of living bodies upwards but first they did thiswhich saved his lifethey threw two muskets across him loaded or empty they knew not and of course it could not matter so long as the climbing men clambering hard to their death found it readier for their feet to tread on the bridge of these muskets piered with blocks of granite than on the ribs of poor hilary so the struggle went on and there he lay and began to peep under other peoples legs in this rather difficult position he failed to make out anything at all to satisfy or to please him listeners hear little good of themselves and lurking gazers have about the same luck not that hilary was to be blamed for lying in this groove inasmuch as he really had no chance or even time to get out of it a great hulking yorkshireman as he turned out had fallen obliquely upon hilarys bridge and was difficult to push aside and quite impossible to lift up he groaned a good deal but he was not deadif he had not been a yorkshireman the one fact might have implied the other but yorkshiremen do groan after death however he was not dead and he keeps a mill on the swale at this minute hilary under these disadvantages naturally tried to lessen them and though he was pretty safe where he layunless a shell came through the yorkshireman and that would have needed a very strong chargestill he became discontented what with the pain of his wound or wounds for he knew to his cost that he had several of them also the violent thirst which followed as well as the ache of his cramped position and a piece of spiked plank that worried him he began to grow more and more desirous of a little change of air now my dear sir he said with his usual courtesy to the yorkshireman you do not mean to be in my way of course but the fact is that i cant get out of this hole by reason of your incumbency if you could only without inconvenience give a little roll to the right or left you would be in quite as good a position yourself or if you have grown attached to this particular spot i would try to replace you afterwards grah was the yorkshiremans only reply a grunt of contempt and of surly temper which plainly meant go tohalifax this is uncivil of you answered hilary it is getting so hot in here that i shall be forced to retort i fear your discourtesy i beg your pardon a thousand times for making this sharp suggestion with these words he pricked the great son of the north in a sensitive part with a loose spike he had found by the light of a french fireball whereupon with a curse the fellow rolled over like one of his fathers millstones then hilary crawled from his hole of refuge and stiffly resting on his hand and knees surveyed the scene of carnage the moon had now risen and was shining gloomily under a stripe of heavy cloud over the bastion of the trinidad and into the channel of the fatal breach down which the sultry night wind sighed laden with groans whenever curses and roar of artillery left room for them the breach itself was still unstormed and looked more terrible than ever for the swordblades fixed at the top were drenched and reeking to the hilt with red and three had corpses impaled upon them with scarlet coats gay in the moonlight the rest like the jaws of a gorging crocodile presented their bloody jaggedness clogged here and there with limbs or heads or other parts of soldiers for the moment the british had fallen back to the other side of the ravelin and their bugles were sounding for the retreat while the triumphant french were shooting and shouting why enter you not all at badajos messieurs it is a good place for the english health why enter you not then badajos the sullen britons answered not but waited for orders to begin again recovering breath and heart and spirit and gathering closer to one another to be sure that anybody was alive for more than two thousand men lay dead or dying in a space of one hundred yards square of the survivors every man felt that every other man had done his bestbut how about himself could he be sure that he never had flinched nor even hung back for a foot or so nor pushed any other man on to the spikes to save himself from going there and was that cursed fortress never to be taken by any skill or strength was even lord wellington wrong for once in setting them to do it and was it to be said in every british churchyard that britons were not of the stuff of their fathers sadly thus thinking but after the manner of our nation not declaring it they were surprised by a burst of light and a flight of glittering streaks in it and almost before these came down again they saw that the murderous cheval de frise had a great gap in its centre with a true british cheer stirring every british heart out they rushed from their shelter and up the dark breach and into badajos one form however passed first into badajos with undisputed precedence because it happened to be close by when the swordblades rocketed away so and not only that but the act of that one had enabled the others to followan act of valour inspired by luck and incited by bodily anguish it was thus in the depth of that horrible pause and dejection of the assailants hilary getting relieved of his cramp rose slowly and stood in a sheltered spot to recover himself before running away everything seemed much against him so far as he could discover and no one with a social turn was there to discuss the position moreover his wounds were beginning at once to sting him and to stiffen hima clever arrangement made by nature to teach men not to fight so much nearly mad with painwhich is felt tenfold as much by quickborn normans as by slowborn dutchmenhe saw a shell fall and roll very kindly just between his dragging feet it carried a very long fusee sticking out of it at a handsome curve and steadily spluttering with fire like the tail of a rat when bad boys have ignited it for better for worse cried hilary talking to himself even in his agony by the power of habit go into that hole my friend and do your utmost there so much had he been knocked about that the shell although a light one was as much as he could stagger with till he dropped it into a shelfy hole which he had long been looking at under the baulk of sixinch beam into which the swords were rivetted then down he fellwhether from exhaustion or presence of mind he could never tell through the jags of the riven granite he heard the shell in a smothered way sputtering like a devil in a wasps nest and then with a thunderous roar and whiz and a rush through the air of wood stone and iron the frenchmans deadly bar was burst for a moment lorraine was so stunned and shaken that all he could do was to stay on the ground but the shock made one of his wounds bleed afresh and this perhaps revived him at any rate he arose and feebly tottered in over the crest of the breach the soldiers of the fortythird and fiftysecond regiments gave him a cheer as they ran up the steep while on the part of the enemy not a weapon was levelled at him this however was not from any admiration of his valourthough frenchmen are often most chivalrous foesbut because these heroic defenders at last were compelled to abandon the breaches being taken in the rear by the fifth division which had forced its way in at san vincente knowing also that the castle had fallen and seeing their main defence lie shattered they retired through the town and across the bridge of the guadiana and now it is an accursed truth that the men who had been such glorious heroes such good brethren to one another strong and grand and pitiful turned themselves within half an hour into something lower than the beasts that perish they proved that the worst of war is not bloodshed agony and slow death not even trampled freedom hatred tyranny and treachery on that same night of heroism patriotism and grand devotion the nicest and most amiable vice indulged by those very same heroes and devoted patriots was swinish and wallowing drunkenness rapine arson fury murder and outrages unspeakableeven their own allies the spaniards glad to be quit of the french and to welcome warmly these deliverers found bitter cause ere sunrise to lament the british victory so it came to pass that young lorraine weak and weary and vainly seeking a surgeon to bind up his wounds was compelled to fight once more that night before he could lay him down and rest chapter xxxix sherry sack there would seem to be times and scenes and cases in which human nature falls helpless under sudden contamination a mental outbreak of black murrain leprosy or plague a panic a superstitious fervour a patriotic or social rush a rebellion a revivalall of these drive men in masses like swine down a precipice but the sack of a large town bloodily stormed is more maddening than all the rest put together even good and steady soldiers caught the taint of villainy they confessed when their headaches began to get better how thoroughly ashamed they were of themselves for having been led into crime and debauch by the scamps and the scum of the regiment still at the moment they were as bad as or even worse than consistent blackguards because they had more strength to rush astray hilary knew mankind very little and only from a gentlemans point of view so that when he found or lost his way into the great square of the town he was quite amazed in his weak state of mind by the scene he was breaking into here by the light of a blazing bonfire made of costly furniture he descried major clumps of his regiment more neatly than pleasantly attached to the front door of a large mansion across his breast and arms a couple of musketstraps were tightly strained and pegged with bayonets into the timber so firmly that this active officer could not even put foot to the ground on his head was a very conspicuous fools cap made of a copy of a proclamation with that word in large type above his brows while a gigantic grenadier as tipsy as a fiddler was zealously conducting the exhibition by swinging him slowly to and fro to the tune of margery daw even as children swing each other on a farmyard gate the majors fury and the violence of his language may be imagined but must not be reported he had always been famous for powers of swearing but in this case he outdid himself renewing every moment and redoubling the grins of all spectators you shall swing for this he screamed to his showman just as hilary came up you shall swing for this you etc etc you shwing first old cock at any rate the grenadier answered with a graceful sweep of the door and the pendent major oh lorraine lorraine cried the latter as the arc of his revolution brought him face to face with hilary for heavens sake stop these miscreantsah you can do nothing i seeyou are hit badly my poor boy my friend said hilary to the grenadier with that persuasive grace which even the costermongers could not resist you are much too good a soldier to make a laughingstock of a brave british officer i cannot attempt to use force with you for you are lucky enough to be unwounded thank god for that and release your prisonerremember he is not a frenchman but a brave and good english major with these and perhaps some more solid persuasions he obtained the relief of his senior officer who for some moments could scarcely speak through excitement and exhaustion but he made signs to hilary that he had something to say of great importance and presently led him into a narrow archway there will be vile work done in that house he contrived at last to tell hilary the men were bad enough at rodrigo but they will be ten times worse tonight we are all so scattered about that no man has his own officer near him and he dont care a button for any others it was for trying to restrain some scoundrels of the fifth division that i was treated in that cursed way only think how we should feel lorraine if our own daughters were exposed so i havent got any daughters said hilary groaning with pain perhaps at the thought but id drive my sword through any mans heartthat is to say if i had got any sword or any arm to drive it with his sword had been carried away by a grapeshot and his right arm hung loose in a cluster of blood for he had nothing to bind it up with you are a man though a wounded man the major replied being touched a little by hilarys strength of expression inasmuch as he had two nice pretty daughters out of harms way in england it is most unlucky that you are hit so hard that is quite my own opinion however i can hold out a good bit major for any work that requires no strength do you know where to find any of our own fellows they would be quite ready to fight these blackguards they are very sore about the way those scoundrels stole into the town we have always been the foremost hitherto your legs are all right i suppose my boy all right except that i am a trifle lightheaded and that always flies to the legsor at least we used to say so at oxford never mind what you said at oxford only mind what you say in badajos collect every man you can find of ours tell him the fifth are murdering robbing cheating us again as they did by sneaking in at a corner and insulting our best officers drunk or sober bring them all the more our men drink the more sober they get it is likely enough that officers of the fifth division would have thought the same paradox of their own men i cannot get along at my usual pace said hilary but i will do my best but will not the mischief be done already i hope not i asked count zamora who seems to be the foremost man of the town which he thought most ofhis wine or his daughters and he answered of course as a gentleman must his cellars contain about butts it will take some time for our men to drink that and i spread a report of their quality and a rumour that all the ladies had escaped the night is hot all the men will plunge into those vast cellars first and when they come up any sober man will be a match for twenty what a pest that i am so knocked about cried hilary quite forgetting his pain in the chivalry of his nature major if only for halfanhour you can hold back the devilry i will answer for the safety of the household but beware of fire you need not tell me about that young man i have seen this work before you were born i shall pick up a cloak and berette and cork my eyebrows and be a spaniard majordomo or whatever they call it i can jabber the tongue a bit enough to go down with english ears i will be the steward of the cellars and show them where the best wine is and they dont know wine from brandy and they will not know me in their cups till i order them all into custody be quick there is no more time to lose hilary saw that major clumps was going to play a very dangerous part for many of the men had their muskets loaded and recked not at whom they fired them however there was nothing better for it and so he set out upon his own errand when he ought to have been in hospital at first he was very unfortunate meeting no men of his own regiment and few even of his own division for most of them doubtless were busy in the houses laying hold of everything but after turning many corners he luckily hit upon corporal white of his own company a very steady man who knew the importance of keeping sober at a time of noble plundering this man was a martinet in a humble way but popular in the ranks in spite of that and when he heard of the outrage to a major of his regiment and his present danger and knew that a rich dons family was threatened by rascals of the fifth divisionhe vowed that he would fetch a whole company to the rescue ere a man could say jack robinson and now sir he said you are not able to go much further or do any more round the corner there is a fountain of beautiful spring water worth all the wines and spirits these fellows are disgracing of themselves with ah i wish i had a glass of good english alebut that is neither here nor there and for want of that a thirsty man may be glad of a drop of this water sir and when you have drunk let it play on your arm you have a nasty place sir with these words he ran off and hilary following his directions enjoyed the greatest of all the mere bodily joys a man can be blessed withthe slaking of furious thirst with cold delicious crystal water he drank and drank and sighed with rapture and then began to laugh at himself and yet must have another drink and then for the moment he was so refreshed that his wounds were not worth heeding i will go and see what those villains are about he said to himself and the pretty saint isidore to whose pure statue bending over the gracious water he lifted hat as a gentleman ought to do i have drunk of your water and thank you saint though i have no idea what your name is our family was catholic for five hundred years and i dont know why we ever left it off rubadub dubbledy dullubydubwhat vowels and dissonants can set forth the sound of a very drunken drummer set upon his mettle to drum on a drum whose head he has been drinking from having no glasses and having no time to study the art of sloping a bottle between the teeth with drainage they truly had happened on a fine idea they cracked the bottles on the rim of the drum and put down their mouths and drank well of it the drum was not so much the worse for this proceeding as they were because they allowed no time for the liquor to soak into the greasy parchment but as many as could stand round were there and plenty of others came after them so that the drumhead never once brimmed over though so many dozens were cracked on it no wonder when such work was toward that many a musketshot rang along the firelit streets of badajos and many a brave man who had baffled the fury of the enemy fell dead in the midst of his frolicking hilary felt that he had been shot enough and to spare already and so while slowly and painfully plodding his way back to the great square of the town from corner to corner he worked a traverse in shelter wherever the shelter offered of porch or pier or any other shadowy folds of the ancient streets and thus without any more damage he returned to the house of the count of zamora here he found the main door closely fastenedby the fellows inside no doubt to keep their villainous work to themselvesand as the great bonfire was burning low he thought that he might have mistaken the house until with his left hand he felt the holes where the bayonets had pegged up the good major and while he did this a great roar from the cellars quickened his eagerness to get in this is a nice thing he said to himself the major inside and no getting at him such a choleric man in the power of those scamps and they cannot take him for a spaniard long for he is sure to use strong english and not only clumps but the whole of the household at their will and pleasure but even while calling in question his superior officers selfcontrol he did not show himself possessed of very wonderful coolness for hearing a rush as of many feet upward from the lower quarters hilary made the best of his way to the smouldering bonfire and seized with his left handfor his right was uselessa chunk of some fine wood too hard to burn perhaps of the african blackwood or the breadfruit tree or brown cassia and came back with it in a mighty fury and tried to beat the door in but the door was of ancient chestnutwood and at his best he could not have hurt it so now in his weakness he knocked and knocked and nobody even heard him this is enough to wear any one out he said to himself in his poor conditionfor the lower the state of a man is the more he relapses upon his nature and hilarys nature was to talk to himselfif i cannot get in like this i must do something or other and get in somehow this would have cost him little trouble in his usual strength and activity for the tipsy rascals had left wide open a window within easy reach from the street to a man sound of limb and vigorous but lorraine in his present condition had no small pain and difficulty in making his way through the opening this being done at last he found himself in a dark passage floored with polished timber upon which he slipped and fell what an evil omen he cried lightlylittle imagining how true his words would proveto fall upon entering a strange house even though it be by the window however i am shaken more than hurt goodness knows i cant afford to bleed again fastening again his loosened bandagefor he had bound his arm now with a handkerchiefhe listened and heard a great noise moving somewhere in the distance nothing can be less satisfactory than to hear a great noise and hearken very steadfastly for its meaning yet not learn what it can be about or even where it comes from hilary listened and the noise seemed now to come from one way and then from another for the old house was peopled with indolent echoes lazily answering one another from corner to corner of passages like the clapping of hands at a banquet wherefore lorraine being puzzled went onwards as behoves a young englishman and herein instinct served him wellat least as the luck of the moment seemedfor it led him into the main hall whence niches and arches seemed leading away anywhere and everywhere hilary here stopped short and wondered it was so different from an english house and he could not tell whether he liked it or not there was some light of wax and some of oil and some of spluttering torches stuck into anything that would hold them throwing a fugitive gleam on the floor where the polish of the marble answered it in other places there were breadths of shadow wavering jumping and flickering this is a queer sort of place said hilary what is the proper thing for me to do the proper thing for him to do became all at once quite manifest for a young girl suddenly sprang into the hall like a hunted butterfly darting they cannot catch me she exclaimed in spanishthey are too slow the intoxicated men i may always laugh at them here i will let them have another chase flitting in and out the shadows as softly as if she were one of them she stopped by the side of hilary lorraine in a dark place without seeing him and he without footfall leaned back in a niche and trembled at being so close to her for a gleam of faint light glanced upon her and suggested strange wild beauty for the moment hilary could only see glittering abundance of loosened hair a flash of dark eyes and raiment quivering from the quick turn of the form inside and then he heard short breath sudden sight and the soothing sound of a figure settling from a great rush into quietude this beats almost everything i ever knew said he to himself quite silently i cant help her and she seems to want no help so far as i can judge i wonder who she is and what she would be like by daylight before he could make up his mind what to do in a matter beyond experience a great shout arose in some upstair places and a shriek or two and a noise of trampling holy virgin they have caught camilla cried the young lady at hilarys side she ought to have a little more of wisdom must i peril myself to protect her without further halt to consider that questionswifter than the slow old lamps cast shadow she rushed betwixt pillars and up a stone stairway and young lorraine with more pain than prudence followed as fast as he could get along at the top of the stairs was a broad stone gallery leading to the right and left and lit as badly as a village street but hilary was not long in doubt for he heard on the right hand a clashing noise and soon descried broken shadows flitting and felt that roguery was going on so he made at his best pace towards it and here he had not far to seek for in a large room hung with pictures and likely to be too full of light the fate of the house was being settled in spite of all drunken stupidity and the time spent in the winecellars the plunderers had found out the inmates and meant to make prizes of war of them small wonder that british intervention was not considered a godsend when our allies were treated so but british soldiers however brutal in the times gone by especially after furious carnage had stirred the worst elements in a man and ardent liquor fired them still had one redeeming point the national love of fair play and sport they had stolen this spanish gentlemans wines burned his furniture in the square and done their best to set his house on fire as long as they thought that he skulked away but now that they touched his dearer honour and he came like a man to encounter them something moved their tipsy hearts to know what he was made of miguel de montalvan the count of zamora was made of good stuff as he ought to be according to his lineage he was fighting for his childrens honour and he knew how to use a rapier two wounded roysterers on the floor showed that though his hair was white his arm was not benumbed with age and now with his slender toledo blade he was holding his own against the bayonet of his third antagonist a man of twice his strength and weightthe very same tall grenadier who had pegged major clumps to the door of the house and swung him so despitefully at the further end of the room two young and beautiful ladies stood or knelt in horrible dread and anguish it was clear at a glance that they were sisters although they behaved very differently for one was kneeling in a helpless manner with streaming eyes and strained hands clasping the feet of a marble crucifix she had not the courage to look at the conflict but started convulsively from her prayers at clash of steel or stamp of foot the other stood firmly with her hair thrown back one hand laid on her sisters head and the other grasping a weapon her lips set hard and her pale cheeks rigid while her black eyes never left the face of the man who was striking at her father at the first glance hilary knew her to be the brave girl who had escaped to the hall and returned to share her sisters fate things cannot be always done chivalrously or in true heroic fashion from among the legs of the reeling britons who with pipes and bottles and shouts of applause were watching the central combat hilary snatched up with his left hand a goodsized winebag roughly rent at the neck but still containing a part of its precious charge the rogues had discovered it in the cellar and guessed that its contents were good and now as the owner of the house hard pressed and unable to reach his longarmed foe was forced to give way with the point of the bayonet almost entering his breast and bearing him back on his daughters lorraine with a sweep of his left arm brought the juicy bag down on the back of the head of the noble grenadier at the blow the rent opened and discharged a gallon of fine old crusted port and beeswing down the warriors locks and into his eyes and the nape of his neck blinded with wine and mad with passion he rushed at his new assailant but the count as he turned passed his rapier neatly between the tendons of his right arm down fell his musket and hilary seized it and pointed it at the owners breast and now the grenadier remembered what he had quite forgotten throughout his encounter with the spaniardhis musket was loaded and on the full cock so he dropped like a grebe or goosander diving having seen smart practice with skirmishers however it must have gone ill with hilary as well as the count and his household if succour had not come speedily for the wassailers who had shown wondrous tempermars being lulled on the lap of bacchussuddenly awoke with equal reason to wild fury with much reviling and condemnation of themselves and one another they formed front having discipline even in their cups and bore down the long room upon the enemy drunk as they were this charge possessed so much of their accustomed weight and power that the don looked on all as lost and could only stand in front of his daughters but hilary with much presence of mind faced them as if he were in command and cried halt as their officer with one accord they halted and some of them tumbled down in doing it and before they could form for another charge or mutiny against orders corporal white with half a company of his famous regiment took them in the rear and smote right and left and they fled with staggered consciences chapter xl beneath bright eyes as soon as the count and his daughters knew how much they owed to hilary and saw the weak and wounded plight in which he had laboured for their good without any loss of time they proved that spaniards are not an ungrateful race the count took the young man in his arms as well as he could without hurting him and kissed him upon either cheek and though the young ladies could not exactly follow their fathers example they made it clear that it was not want of emotion which deterred them they kissed the left hand of the wounded youth and bent over it and looked at him with eyes so charming and so full of exquisite admiration that major clumps who was lying on the floor cordedand far worse actually gaggedlonged to rap out a great oath but failed in his struggle to break the commandment oh he is so hurt my father cried the braver and if possible the lovelier of the two fair maidens you do not heed such things because you are so free yourself to wound but the cavalier must be taken to bed see he is not capable now of standing for hilary now that all danger was past grew faint while he scorned himself for doing so in the presence of the ladies it is to death it is to death exclaimed the timid damsel what shall we do oh holy saints to save us and to have slain himself be tranquil camilla said the spanish gentleman kindly and without contempt you have not shown the spirit of our house but we cannot help our natures claudia you are as brave as a man seek for the good woman teresina she has not run away like the rest she must be hiding somewhere camilla release that other brave senhor gentlemen all pray allow us to pass corporal white drew his men aside while the count concealing his own slight wounds led and supported young lorraine through a short passage and into a bedroom dark and cool and comfortable here he laid him to rest on a couch and brought cold water and sponged his face and presently old teresina came and moaned and invoked the virgin a little and then fell to and pulled all his clothes off as if he were her daughters baby and hilary laughed at her way of working and soothing him like some little pet so that he almost enjoyed the pain of the clotted places coming off for after all he had not receivedlike brigadier walker that hot eveningtwentyseven wounds of divers sorts but only five and two bad bruises enough to divert the attention if a man has only one place of his body to think about and to be full of he is scarcely better off than a gourmand or a guest at a lord mayors dinner but if he finds himself peppered all over his attention is not overconcentrated and he finds a new pleasure in backing one hole of his body against another in the time of the plague this thing was so and so it must be in the times of war from the crown and climax of human misery lorraine by the grace of the lord was spared no doctor was allowed to come near him that fatal step in the strongest mans life the step tempting up to the doctors bell happily in his case was not trodden for the british surgeons were doing their utmost at amputating dead mens legs while senhor gines de passamonte the only spanish graduate of medicine in good circles had been roasted at one of the bonfires to enable him to speak english this was a wellmeant operation and proved by no means a fatal measure the jack however revolved so well that he went on no medical rounds for three months senhor we can no doctor get said the anxious count to hilary having made up his mind to plunge into english of which he had tried some private practice senhor what is now to do i can no more speak to please you can speak to please most nobly i wish that i could speak the grand hispanic tongue at all sir senhor you shall so brave a gentleman never will find bad to teach the fine angles way of speaking is to me very strong and good in one year two year three year sir alas i behold you laughing count it was but a twinge of pain you possess a great knowledge of my native tongue but i fear that after such a night as this you will care to cultivate it no more from what cause i have intelligence of you but the thing has itself otherwise the angles are all very good they incend my goods and they intoxicate my wines they arewhat you callwell to come they make battle with me for the donnas but fairly very fairly and with your valiant assistance i victor them i have no complaint now i make adventure to say that you can speak the french tongue i can do the very same affair and so can my daughters two but in this house it must not be we will speak the angles until you have intelligence of the spanish with your good indulgence senhor does that recommend itself to you excellently count said hilary and then in spite of pain he added with his usual courtesy i have often longed to learn your magnificent language this opportunity is delightful i have at this time too prolonged don miguel answered with such a bow as only a spaniard can make and a spaniard only when highly pleased sleep sir now the good teresina will sit always on your head the good teresina could not speak a word of any tongue but her own and in that she could do without any answers if only she might make to herself as many as she pleased of them she saw that hilary had no bones broken nor even a bullet in his bodyso far as she could yet make outbut was sadly hacked about and worn and weak with drains of bleeding therefore what he wanted now was nourishment cold swathes and sleep and all of these he obtained abundantly under the care of that good nurse meanwhile poor major clumps to whom the count and his daughters owed quite as much as they did to young lorraine did not by any means become the object of overpowering gratitude he was neither wounded nor picturesque and his services great as they were had not been rendered in a striking manner so that although he did his bestas most old officers are inclined to doto get his deserts attended to his reward like theirs was the unselfish pleasure of seeing inferior merit preferred of course he cried after a preface too powerful to have justice done to itof course this is what one must always expect i get bruised and battered and laughed at and swung on a door and gagged and corded the moment i use a good english word and then the girls for whose sake i did it and turned myself into a filthy butler because i am not a smart young coxcomb and my wounds are black instead of being red begad sir they treat me as if i had been all my life their fathers butler the loss of his laurels was all the more bitter to the brave and choleric major not only because it was always happeningwhich multiplied it into itself at every single recurrencebut also because he had been rapidly even for his time of life subdued by the tender and timorous glances of the sweet young donna camilla the greater the fright this girl was in the better it suited her appearance and when she expected to be immolated as the least of impending horrors her face was as that of an angel the major although trussed tight with whipcord and full of an old stocking in his mouth had enjoyed the privilege of gazing at her while she clasped her crucifix and that picture would abide upon his retentive stubborn and honest brain as long as the brain itself abode he loved an angelical girl because his late wife had been slightly demoniac now by the time that our british soldiers had finished their sack of badajoswhich took them three days though they did their bestand were beginning to be all laid up in spite of their iron trim and training by their own excesses lorraine was able to turn in his bed and to pay a tender heed to things he began to want some sort of change from the neverwearying but sometimes wearisome tendence of old teresina whose rugged face and pointed cap would dwell in his dreams for ever of course he was most grateful to her and never would forget her kindness still he longed for a sight of somebody else ugly or beautiful he cared notonly let it be some other face and his wish was granted as generally happened and sometimes only too graciously our very noble public schools and ancient universities know and always have known how to educate young people from long experience they are well aware that all languages are full of mischief and a man who desires that element finds it almost wherever he pleases so that our authorities did well to restrict themselves to the grand old form and the distance of two thousand years hence as a matter of course poor hilary had not learned either at school or college even one irregular verb of the fine pervasive and persuasive language of all languages to put it more simply he could not speak french in print he could follow it off and on as most men with latin to lead them can but from live lips it was gibberish to him as even at this day it is to nine and a half out of ten good britons and now when suddenly a soft rich voice came over his shoulder just turned once more in great disgust from the dreary door and asked in very good french indeed how do you carry yourself sir hilary was at a pinch to answer most well a thousand thanks most well and after this anglogallic triumph he rolled on his bandages very politely in spite of all orders to the contrary to see who it was and to look at her even in the gloom of the shaded windows and of his own enfeebled sight he could not help receiving an impression of wondrous beautya beauty such as it is not good for any young man to gaze upon unless he is of a purely steadfast heart and of iron selfcontrol and hilary was not of either of these as himself and his best friends knew too well the count of zamoras younger daughter claudia de montalvan was of andalusian birth and more than andalusian beauty form and bloom and brilliant change and harmony and contrast with the charm of soft expression and the mysterious power of large black eyesto all of these in perfection add the subtle grace of high lineage and the warmth of southern nature and it must be confessed that the fairest english maid though present in all her beauty would find a very dangerous rival i quite forgot said the senhorita approaching the bed with most graceful movement and fixing her radiant eyes on poor hilarythere is one thing sir that i quite forgot my good father will not allow french to be spoken by any child of his he is so patriotic what a pity since you speak french so well hilary took some time to make out this then knowing how barbarous his accent was he weakly endeavoured with his languid eyes to pierce the depth of the spanish maidens and learn whether she were laughing at him neither then nor afterwards when his sight was as keen again as ever did he succeed in penetrating the dark profundity of those bright eyes how shall we manage it the young lady continued dropping her long curved lashes and slightly flushing under his steadfast gaze you cannot speak the spanish i fear not even so well as the droll old senhor who makes us laugh so much downstairs on the contrary i cannot speak the english but in spite of that we must hold converse otherwise how shall we ever thank you and nurse you and recover you one thing must be begun at oncecan i without pain lift your hand great part of this speech was dark to hilary but he understood the question about his hand and kept the disabled one out of sight and nodded and said oui senhora whereupon to his great surprise beautiful claudia fell on her knees by the side of the couch caught his left hand in both of hers and pressed it in the most rapturous manner ever so many times to her sweet cool lips and a large tear such as large eyes should shed gently trickled on each fair cheek but was cleverly kept from dripping on his hand because he might not have liked it and then with her face not far from his she looked at him with a long soft gaze and her hair with the gloss and the colour of a filbert over the guadiana fell from her snowy forehead forward and hilary was done for chapter xli donnas pray and practise a sad and sorry task it is to follow the lapse of a fine young fellow from the straight line of truth and honour into the crooked ways of shame hilary loved mabel still with all his better heart and soul her pure and kind and playful glance and the music of her true voice never wholly departed from him in the hot infatuation to which like many wiser and older men he could not help but yield himself from time to time a sudden pang of remorse and of good love seized him keenly alive to manly honour and to the goodness of womankind he found himself playing false to both and he hated himself when he thought of it but the worst of him was that he did not think habitually and steadfastly he talked to himself and he thought of himself but he very seldom examined himself he felt that he was a very good fellow in the main and meant no harm and if he set up for a solid character who would ever believe him the world had always insisted upon it that he was only a trifler and the worlds opinion is very apt to create what it anticipates he offered excuses enough to himself as soon as he saw what a wrong he was doing but the only excuse a good man can accept is the bitterness of his punishment the british army having exhausted havock to the lees and dregs marched upon its glorious way in quest of other towns of our allies no less combustible but many wounded champions were left behind in badajos quartered on the grateful townsmen to recover if they could and rejoin as soon as possible lieutenant lorraine was one of these from the necessity of his case and major clumps managed to be another from his own necessities but heavily wounded as he was by one of don miguels daughters the fighting major would never have got himself certified on the sicklist unless he had known from the course of the war that no battle now was imminent regardless of his horace and too regardful of cruel glycera more than too much pined major clumps and would have chanted mournful ditties in a minor key if nature had only gifted him with any other note but d because his junior shone beyond him with breach of loyal discipline he might console himself however with the solace offered by the sprightly bardthe endless chain of love revolving with links on the wrong cog for ever major clumps was in love with camilla the saintly camilla declined from him with a tender slope towards hilary hilary went downhill too fast with violent pangs towards claudia and claudia rose at the back of the wheel with her eyes on the distant mountains of all lorraines pure bodily wounds the worst though not the most painful as yet was a gash in his left side made by pike or sword or bayonet or something of a nasty poignancy hilary could give no account of it when he took it or where or how he regretted deeply to have it there but beyond that he knew nothing it seemed to have been suggested cleverly instead of coarsely slashing down so far as a woman who had not spent her youth in dissectingrooms could judge but major clumps too old a warrior to lose his head to anything less perturbing than a cannonball strenuously refused to believe in hilarys ignorance about it he had a bad opinion of young men and believed that hilary had fallen into some scrape of which he was now ashamed at the same time he took care to spread it abroad for the honour of the regiment that their young lieutenant had been the first to leap on the swordblades of the breach even as afterwards he was first to totter through the gap he made but now it seemed likely that either claim would drop into abeyance until raked up as a question of history for the wound in hilarys side began to show very ugly tokens it had seemed to be going on very nicely for about a fortnight and teresina praised and thanked the saints and promised them ten days wages in the form of candles but before her vow was due or her money getting ready the saints whether making too sure of their candles or having no faith in her promises suddenly struck work and left this good woman rags bottles and bones in a miserable way for violent inflammation began to kindle beneath the bandages and smiles were succeeded by sighs and moaning and happy sleep by weary tossings and lightheaded wakefulness by way of encouraging the patient major clumps came in one day with a pair of convalescent britons and a sheet of paper and pressed upon him the urgent necessity for making his will to leave the world with comfort and composure hilary smiled through all his pain at the thought of his having in the world anything but itself to leave and then he contrived to say pretty clearly major i dont mean to leave the world and if i must i have nothing but my blessing to leave behind me then you do more harm than good by going and none need wish to hurry you sergeant williams you may go and so may private bodkin you will get no beer in this house i know and you have both had wine enough already be off what are you spying for the two poor soldiers who had looked forward to getting a trifle for their marks glanced at one another sadly and knowing what the major was made off for ever since the tricks played with him by drunken fellows who knew him not major clumps had been dreadful towards every sober man of his own regiment the course of justice never does run smooth this was a thing such as hilary would have rejoiced to behold and enter into if he had been free from pain but gnawing wearing worrying pain sadly dulls the sense of humour and power of observation yet even pain and the fear of the grave with nothing to leave behind him could not rob him of all perception of a sudden brightness shed softly over all around two lovely maidens were come to pray for him and to scatter his enemies claudia de montalvan led her gentle and beautiful sister camilla to thank once for all and perhaps to say farewell to their preserver camilla with her sad heart beating tremulously yet controlled by maiden dignity and shame followed shyly fearing deeply that her eyes would tell their tale and thus even through the more brilliant beauty of her braver sister the depth of love and pity made her for the time more beautiful between the two sisters there was but little even for the most careful modeller to perceive of difference each had the purely moulded forehead and the perfect arch of eyebrow and the large expressive eyes well set and clearly cut and shaded also the other features shaped to the best of all natures experience this made it very nice to notice how distinct their faces were by inner difference of mind and will senhor said claudia to major clumps who could manage to make out spanish we have heard that he is very ill we are come to do the best for him camilla will prayit is so goodand i will do anything that may need but it is not right to detain you longer the gentlemen cannot pray at all till they are in the holy orders the major bowed and grimly smiled at this polite dismissal and then with a lingering glance at camilla stumped away in silence to a proper swearing distance his glance might have lingered till dark night fell before that young donna returned it all her power of thought or feeling fearing hoping or despairing was gathered into one sad gaze at her guest her saviour and her love carefully as she had watched him through the time when there was no danger she had not been allowed by the ancient nurse to come near him for the last three days and even now she had been content to obey teresinas orders and to trust in the saints with her calm sweet faiththe saints who had sent this youth to save herbut for her stronger sisters will disturb him not sister but let him rest said claudia whose fair bosom never was a prey to gratitude see you not how well he lies if we should happen to cause disturbance he might roll over and break into bleeding and then you could pray for his soul alone sister mine you do not speak well camilla answered gently he has shed so much blood for us that he is not likely to bleed more it is now the want of the blood and the fever that will make us mourn for ever cavalier brave cavalier can you not look up and muse hilary being thus invoked though he had no idea what was meantthe language being pure castiliancertainly did look up and try with very bad success to muse his eyes met kind camillas first because she was leaning over him but in spite of close resemblance found not what they wanted in them and wandered on and met the eyes of claudia and rested there camilla with the speed of love outwinging all the wings of thought felt like a stab this absence from her and this presence elsewhere and having plenty of inborn pride as behoved her and became her well she turned away to go and leave her sister who could not pray at all to pray for what seemed to be more her own and her heart was bitter as she turned away claudia who cared not one halfreal for hilary or what became of him and who never prayed for herself or told her beads or did any religious thing was also ready to go with a mind relieved of a noxious duty when her softer and therefore nobler sister came back with her small pride conquered it is not a time to dispute she said nor even to give ones self to pray when violent pain is tearing one my sister i have prayed for days and twice as much by night and yet everything grows much worse alas last night i dreamed a dream of great strangeness it may have come from my birthday saint the good teresina is having her dinner and she always occupies one large hour in that consummation do a thing of courage sister you always are so rich in courage what do you mean asked claudia smiling you seem to have all the courage now alas i have no courage claudia you are laughing at me but if you would only raise the bandagei dare not touch the poor cavalierwhere the sad inflammation is that makes him look at you soit is possible that i could or perhaps that you could could what asked claudia who was not of a longenduring temper i have no fear to touch him and he seems to be all bandages there now is that what you require camilla shuddered as her sister firmly as if she were unswathing a mummy of four thousand years untied teresinas knots and laid bare the angry wound which was eating hilarys life away then a livid virulent gash appeared banked with proud flesh upon either side and claudia could not look at it but camilla gathered the courage often latent in true gentleness and heeded only in her heart how the poor young fellow fell away and fainted from the bold exposure and falling back thus made his wound open and gape wider i see it i see it i shall save him yet she cried in feminine ecstasy and while claudia thought her mad she snatched from the chain at her zone a little steel implement often carried by spanish girls for beautys sake with dainty skimmings and the lightest touch she contrived to get this well inside all the mere outward mischief and drew out a splinter of rusty iron and held it up to the light in triumph and then she went down on her knees and sobbed but still held fast her trophy what is it let me see cried claudia being accustomed to take the lead saint plague what is a mere shred like that to cause so much emotion it may be something the old nurse put there and so you have done more harm than good do nurses put pieces of jagged iron into a wound to heal it it is part of a cruel frenchmans sword behold the fangs of it and the venomous rust what agony to the poor cavalier now sponge his forehead with the vinegar for you are the best and most welcome nurse and when he revives show him this and his courage will soon be renewed to him i can stay here no longer i feel so faint i will go to my saint and thank her when old teresina returned and found her patient looking up at claudia with his wound laid bare she began to scold and wring her hands and order her visitor out of the room but the proud young lady would have none of that a pretty nurse you are she cried to leave this in your patients wound is this your healing instrument pray what will the count of zamora say when i show him this specimen of your skill how long will he keep you in this house oh blind demented gorging wallowing and most despicable nurse that last word she pronounced with such a bitterness of irony that poor teresinas portly form and wellfed cheeks shook violently for the love of all the saints sweet donna do not let my lord know this the marvellous power of your bright eyes has cast their light on everything that poor old i with these poor members might have gazed and gazed for ever when lo the most beautiful and highborn lady under heaven appears and saves the life of the handsome lord that loves her we will speak no more upon this matter claudia answered magnanimously and the nurse thenceforth was ready to vow and hilary only too glad to believe that the sorely wounded soldier owed his life to a beautiful maiden and so he did but not to claudia chapter xlii an unwelcome escort along the northern brow and bend of the sussex hills the winter lingers and the spring wakes slowly the children of the southern slope towards worthing and west tarring have made their cowslip balls and pranked their hats and hair with bluebells before their little northern cousins have begun to nurse and talk to and then pull to pieces their cuckoopint and potentilla deadnettle and meadow crowfoot the daffodil that comes and takes the winds of march with beauty here reserves that charming capture for the early breeze of may for still the blackthorn winter buffets the folds of chilly aprils cloak and the hailfringed mantle of wan sunlight this is the time when a man may say hurrah here is summer come at last i verily do believe for goodness sake wife give us air and take those hot things from the childrens necks if you want me i shall be in the bower having a jolly pipe at last and then by the time all the windows are open and the little ones are proud to show their necks and the scratches of their pins in rushes papa with his coat buttoned over and his pipe put out by hail none the less for all that the people who like to see things movingthough it be but slowlyhave opportunity now of watching small delights that do them good how trees and shrubs and plants and even earth and stone begin to feel the difference coming over them how little points all black one day and as hard as the tip of a rooks bill the next time of looking at them show a little veiny shining and then as the people come home from church and are in their most observant humour after long confinement a little child finds a real leaf most likely of an eldertree and many young faces crowd around it while the old men having seen too many springs plod on and doubt this for a bad one much of this had been done with slow advance from sunday to sunday and the hedges began to be feathered with green and the meadows to tuft where the good stuff lay and the corn in the gloss of the sun to glisten when everybody came out of church one sunday before pentecost the church was that which belonged to the rev struan hales in his own opinion and so did the congregation and so did everything except the sermon and now the rector remained in the vestry with his favourite daughter cecil to help him off with his academicals and to put away his comb i hope your mother will be quick my dear said the parson stooping his broad shoulders as his daughter tugged at him she cannot walk as she used you know and for the last halfhour i have been shuddering and trembling about our first forequarter i saw that you were uncomfortable papa just as you were giving out your text you seemed to smell something burning didnt you exactly said the rector gazing with surprise at his clever and queer cecil now how could you tell i am sure i hope none of the congregation were up to it but d a pound is no joke for the father of three hungry daughters and with a good appetite of his own papa well ill tell you how i knew it you have a peculiar way of lifting your nose when the meat is too near the fire as it always is with our new cook and then you looked out of that roundarched window as if you expected to see some smoke lift my nose indeed answered the rector i shall lift something else i shall lift your lips if you laugh at your poor old father so and i never shaved this morning because of sir remnants dinnerparty tomorrow there what do you think of that miss impudence oh papa what a shameful beard you preached about the stubble being all burned up perhaps because you were thinking of our lamb but i do declare you have got as much left as farmer gates very largest field but talking about sir remnant did you see who skulked into church in the middle of the anthem and sate behind the gallery pillar in one of the labourers free seats no i did not you ought to be ashamed of looking about in church so cecil nothing escapes you except the practical application of my doctrine well papa now you must have been stupid or had your whole mind upon our new cook if you didnt see captain chapman captain chapman cried the rector with something which in any other place would have been profane why what in the world could he want here he never came to hear me thats certain no papa nor to hear anything at all he came to stare at poor alice all the time and to plague her with his escort home i fear the poor child with that ungodly scamp who were in the servants pew i know pretty well but you are sure to know better oh not even one of the trusty people neither the old butler nor mrs pipkins nor even mrs merryjack only that conceited mister trotman as he calls himself and his underfootman as he calls the lad and three or four flirty housemaids a guinea will send them all round the other way and then he will pester alice all the way back run home thats a dear you are very quick of foot and put the lamb back yourself nine inches and tell jem to saddle maggie quick as lightning and put my huntingcrop at the green gate and have maggie there and let your mother know that sudden business calls me away to coombe lorraine why papa you quite frighten me as if alice could not take care of herself i have seen more of the world than you have child do as i order you and dont argue stop take the meadow way to save making any stir in the village i shall walk slowly and be at the gate by the time you have the pony there cecil hales without another word went out of the vestry door to a stile leading from the churchyard into a meadow and thence by an easy gap in a hedge she got into the rectory shrubbery just my luck said the rector to himself as he took to the rambling villagestreet to show himself as usual the two things i hate most are a row and the ruin of a good dinner hashes and cold meat ever since wednesday and now when a real good joint is browningoh confound it alli quite forgot the asparagusthe first i have cut and as thick as my thumb now if i only had mabel lovejoy here i do hope theyll have the sense not to put it on but i cant very well tell jem about it it will look so mollyish can i send a note in yes i can the fellow cant read that is one great comfort no sooner said than done he tore out the flyleaf of his sermon and under his text inculcating the duty of christian vigilance wrote in pencil whatever you do dont put on the asparagus this he committed to the care of jem and then grasping his huntingwhip steadfastly he rode up the lane with maggie neighing at this unaccustomed excursion for horses know sunday as well as men do and a great deal better struan hales was a somewhat headlong man as most men of kind heart and quick but not very large understanding are apt to be like most people of strong prejudices he was also of strong impulses for the lowest form of prejudice is not commonthe abstract one and the negative his common sense and his knowledge of the world might have assured him that captain chapman would do nothing to hurt or even to offend young alice and yet because he regarded stephen with inveterate dislike he really did for the moment believe it his duty thus to ride after him meanwhile the gallant and elegant captain had done at least one thing according to the rectors anticipation by laying a guinea in trotmans palm he had sent all the servants home over the hill and thus secured for himself a private walk with his charmer along the lane that winds so prettily under the high land now his dress was enough to win the heart of any rustic damsel and as he passed the cottagedoors all the children said oh my this pleased him greatly and could not have added less than an inch to his stature and less than a pound to the weight of his heel at each strut this proves that he was not a thorough villain for thorough villains attach no importance to the opinion of children unaware of the enemy in advance alice walked through the little village with her aunt and two cousins as usual and she said goodbye to them at the rectory gate knowing that they wanted to please her uncle with his early sunday dinner country parsons unless they are of a highly distinguished order like to dine at halfpast one very punctually on a sunday throughout the week when they shoot or fish or ride to hounds etc they manage to retard their hunger to five or even six oclock on sunday it is healthily otherwise a sinking feeling begins to set in about halfway through the sermon and why in an eloquent period the parson looks round to infect his congregation he forgets for the moment that he is but a unit while his hearers are an hundredfold what happens all humanity is at eloquent moments contagious sensitive impressible a hundred people in the church have got their dinner coming on at one oclock they are thinking of it they are dwelling on the subject and the hundred and first the parson himself without knowing it very likely and even while seven heavens above it receives the recoil of his own emotions in epidemic appetite that may be all wrong of course even unsacerdotal or unscientific until the subject is tabulated but facts have large bones and the fact stands thus alice lorraine was aware of it though without scent of the reason so she kissed her aunt and cousins twocecil being as hath been seen in clerical attendanceand lightly went her homeward way she stopped for a minute at nanny stilgoes to receive the usual grumbling sauced with the inevitable ingratitude and then supposing the servants to be no very great distance before her she took to the lonely ashwood lane with a quick light step as usual presently she came to a place where the lane dipped suddenly into the hollow of a dry old watercoursethe course of the woeburn according to tradition if anybody could believe it there was now not a thread of open water but a little dampness and a crust of mud as if some underground duct were anxious to maintain use of its right of way by the side of the lane an old oaktrunk stretched high above the dip and furnished with a broken handrail showed that there must have been something to cross though nobody now could remember it in this hollow lurked the captain placid and selfcontented and regarding with much apparent zest a little tuft of forgetmenot alice though startled for a moment by this unexpected encounter could not help smiling at the illmatched brilliance of her suitors apparel he looked like a smaller but far more costly edition of mr bottler except that his waistcoat was of crimson taffety with a rolling collar of lace and instead of white stockings he displayed goldbuttoned vamplets of orange velvet being loth to afford him the encouragement of a smile the young lady turned away her face as she bowed and with no other salutation continued her homeward course at a pace which certainly was not slower but stephen chapman came forth and met her with that peculiar gaze which would have been insolent from a more powerful man but as proceeding from a little dandy bore rather the impress of impudence miss lorraine you will not refuse me the honour of escorting you to your home this road is lonely there still are highway men one was on the brighton road last week i took the liberty of thinking or rather perhaps i should say of hoping that you might not altogether object to a military escort thank you said alice you are very kind but i have not the least fear and our servants are not very far away i know they have orders to keep near me they must have mistaken your route i think i am rather famous for long sight and i saw the lorraine livery just now going up the footpath that crosses the hill alice was much perplexed at this she by no means enjoyed the prospect of a long and secluded walk in the company of this gallant officer and yet her courage would not allow her to retrace her steps and cross the hill neither could she well affront him so for much as she disliked this man she must treat him as any other lady would i am much obliged to you captain chapman she answered as graciously as she could but really no kind of escort is wanted either military or civilian in a quiet country road like this where everybody knows me and perhaps it will be more convenient for you to call on my father in the afternoon he is always glad when you can stay to dinner no thank you i must dine at home today i wish to see sir roland this morning if i may and surely i may accompany you on your way home now may i not oh yes she answered with a little sigh as there seemed to be no help for it but she determined to make the captain walk at a speed which should be quite a novelty to him dear me miss lorraine i had no idea that you were such a walker why this must be what we call in the army doublequick march almost too fast almost to keep the ranks unbroken when we charge the enemy how very dreadful cried alice with a little grimace which greatly charmed the captain may i ask you one particular favour you can ask none he replied with his hand laid on his crimson waistcoat or to put it more clearly to ask a favour is to confer a greater one how very kind you are you know that my dear brother hilary is in the thick of very very sad fighting and i thought that perhaps you would not mind as a military escort describing exactly how you felt when first you charged the enemy the deuce must be in the girl thought the captain and yet she looks so innocent it can be only an accident but she is too sharp to be romanced with miss lorraine he answered i belonged to the guards whose duty lies principally at home i have never been in action oh i understand then you do not know what a sad thing real fighting is poor hilary we are most anxious about him we have seen his name in the despatches and we know that he was wounded but neither he nor major clumps a brave officer in his regiment has sent us a line since it happened he was first through the breach at badajos he has covered himself with glory we know it said alice with tears in her eyes and for a moment she liked the captain but if he has covered himself with wounds what is the good of the glory a most sensible question chapman answered and fell once more to zero in the opinion of his charmer with all the contempt that can be expressed by silence when speech is expected she kept on so briskly towards bonnys castle that her suitor who in spite of all martial bearing walked in the manner of a pigeon became hard set to keep up with her the view from this spot is so lovely he said i must really beg you to sit down a little surely we need not be in such a hurry the air is chilly and i must not loiter my father has a bad headache today that was the reason he was not at church then surely he can be in no hurry for his luncheon i have so many things to say to you and you really give me quite a pain in my side oh i am so sorry i beg your pardon i never could have thought that i was doing that rest a little and you will be better the complaint would have been as a joke passed over if it had come from anybody else but she knew that the captain was not strong in his lungs or his heart or anything therefore she allowed him to sit down while she stood and gazed back through the ashwood lane fringed and arched and dappled by the fluttering approach of spring the beautiful gazing at the beautiful said chapman with his eyes so fixed as to receive his view of the landscape if at all by deputy and truly his judgment was correct for alice now in perfect health with all the grace of young vigour and the charm of natural quickness and a lovely face and calm eyes beaming not with the bright uncertain blue that flashing charm of poor hilary but the grand ashcoloured greythe tint that deepens with the depth of life and holds more love than any otheralice in a word was something for a man to look at the greatest man that ever was born of a woman and knew what women are as well as what a man is the only one who ever combined the knowledge of both sexes the one true poet of all ages compared with whom all other poets are but shallow surfacers natures most loving and bestloved childeven he would have looked at alice with those large sad loving eyes and found her good to dwell upon the captain though he bore the name of a great and grosslyneglected poet had not in him so much as half a pennyweight of poetry he looked upon alice as a handsome girl of good birth and good abilities who might redeem him from his evil ways and foster him and make much of him he knew that she was far above him in mind and views and all that sort of thing and he liked her all the more for that because it would save him trouble do let me say a few words to you he began with his most seductive and insinuating glance for he really had fine eyes as many weak and wanton people have you are apt to be hard on me miss lorraine while all the time my first desire is to please and serve and gratify you you are very kind i am sure captain chapman i dont know what i have done to deserve it alas he answered with a sigh which relieved him because he was much pinched in as well as a good deal out of breath for his stays were tighter than the maidens alas is it possible that you have not seen the misery you have caused me yes i know that i have been very rude i have walked too fast for you i beg your pardon captain chapman i will not do so any more i did not mean that i assure you i didnt i would climb the andes or the himalayas only to win one smile from you i fear that i should smile many times said alice now smiling wickedly if i could only have a telescopestill i should be so sorry for you they are much worse than the southdown hills there you are laughing at me again you are so clever miss lorraine you give me no chance to say anything i am not clever i am very stupid and you always say more than i do well of courseof course i do until you come to know me after that i always listen because the ladies have more to say and they say it so much better is that so said alice thinking while the captain showed his waist as he arose and shook himself it may be so he may be right he seems to have some very good ideas he saw that she thought more kindly of him and that his proper course with her was to play humility he had never known what pure love was he had lessened his small capacity for it by his loose and wicked life but in spite of all that for the first time alice began to inspire him with it this is a grand revolution in the mind or the heart of a man of pleasure the result may save him even yet if a purer nature master him from that deadliest foe himself and the best or the worst of it is that if a kind and fresh and warm and loftyminded girl believes herself to have gained any power of doing good in the body of some low reprobate sweet interest christian hankerings and the feminine love of paradoxes succeed the legitimate disgust alice however was not of a weak impulsive and slavish nature and she wholly disdained this stephen chapman now i hope that you will not hurry yourself she said to the pensive captain the real hill begins as soon as we are round the corner i must walk fast because my father will be looking out for me perhaps if you kindly are coming to our house you would like to come more at your leisure sir stephen chapman looked at hernot as he used to look as if she were only a pretty girl to himbut with some new feeling quite as if he were afraid to answer her his dull besotted and dissolute manner of regarding women lay for the moment under a shock and he wondered what he was about and none of his stock speeches came to help himor to hurt himuntil alice was round the corner holloa chapman what are you about why you look like one of bottlers pigs when they run about with their throats cut where is my niece what have you been doing the rector drew up his pony sharply and was ready to seize poor stephen by the throat you need not be in such a hurry parson said captain chapman recovering himself miss lorraine is going up the hill a great deal faster than i can go i know what a dissolute dog you are cried the parson smoking with indignation at having spoiled his sunday dinner and made a scene for nothing you forced me to ride after you sir what do you mean by this sort of thing mr hales i have no idea what you mean you seem to be much excited pray oblige me with the reason the reason indeed when i know what you are two nice good girls as ever lived you have stolen out of my gallery sir and covered my parish with shame sir and are you fit to come near my niece i have not told sir roland of it only for your fathers sake but now i will tell him and quiet as he is how long do you suppose he will be in kicking you down the coombe sir come now said stephen having long been proof against righteous indignation you must be well aware rector that the whole of that ancient scandal was scattered to the winds and i emerged quite blameless indeed i know nothing of the sort you did what money could dohowever it is some time back and perhaps i had better have let an old storycamerinaeh what is it on the other hand if only rector you always mean aright though you may be sometimes ungenerous in your magnificent sermon today what did you say why you said distinctly in a voice that came all round the pillarsthere is mercy for him that repenteth to be sure i did and i meant it too but i meant mercy up above not in my own parish stephen i cant have any mercy in my own parish let us say no more about it sir i am not a very young man now and my great desire is to settle down i now have the honour of loving your niece as i never loved any one before and i put it to you in a manly way and as one of my fathers most valued friends whether you have anything to say against it you mean to say that you really want to settle down with alice a girl of half your age and ten times your power of life come stephen well sir i know that i am not in as vigorous health as you are you will walk me down no doubt when we come to shoot together on my fathers land but still all i want is a little repose and country life and hunting a little less of the clubs and high play and the company of the pr who makes us pay so hard for his friendship i wish to leave all these bad thingsonce for all to shake them offand to get a good wife to keep me straight until my dear father drops off at last and the moment i marry i shall start a new hunt and cut out poor lord unicorn who does not know a foxhound from a beagle this country is most shamefully hunted now it is my dear stephen it is indeed it puts me to the blush every time i go out really there is good sense in what you say there is plenty of room for another pack and i think i could give you some sound advice i should act entirely sir by your opinion horses i understand pretty well but as to hounds i should never pretend to hold a candle to my uncle hales ah my dear boy i could soon show you the proper way to go to work the stamp of dog we want is something of this kind the rector leaned over maggies neck and took the captain by the buttonhole and fondly inditing of so good a matter he delivered a discourse which was too learned and confidential to be reported rashly and stephen hearkened so well and wisely that mr hales formed a better opinion than he ever before had held of him and began to doubt whether it might not be a sensible plan in such times as these to close the ranks of the sober thinkers and knit together all wellaffected stanch and loyal interests by an alliance between the two chief houses of the neighbourhoodthe one of long lineage and the other of broad lands and this would be all the more needful now if hilary was to make a mere lovematch but in spite of all wisdom mr hales was full of strong warm feelings and loving his niece as he did and despising in his true heart stephen chapman and having small faith in converted rakes he resolved to be neutral for the present and so rode home to his dinner chapter xliii in among the bigwigs if any man has any people who ought to care about him and is not sure how far they exert their minds in his direction to bring the matter to the mark let him keep deep silence when he is known to be in danger the test as human nature goes is perhaps a trifle hazardous at any rate when tried against that existence of the wiry order which is called the masculine but against the softer and better portion of the human racethe kinder halfwhose beauty is the absence of stern reason this bitter test if strongly urged is sure to fetch out something at least of course if no suspicion arises of a touchstone wherefore now there were three persons all of the better sex in much discomfort about hilary of these the first was his excellent grandmother lady valeria lorraine whose mind though fortified with plowden and even the strong fortescue was much amiss about his being dead and perhaps incremated leaving for evidence not even circumstantial ashes proof of this however invalid would have caused her great distressfor she really loved and was proud of the youth but the absence of proof and the probability of its perpetual absence for to prove a man dead is to prove a negative according to recent philosophers as well as the prospect of complications after the simplest solution kept this admirable ladys ever active mind in more activity than was good for it the second of the three who fretted with anxiety and fear was hilarys young sister alice proud as she was of birth and position and spotless honour and all good things her brothers life was more precious to her than any of those worldly matters she knew that he was rash and headlong too goodnatured and even childish when compared with men of the world but she loved him all the more for that and being herself of a stronger will had grown without any sense thereof into a needful championship and vigilance for his good repute and this of course endeared him more and made her regard him as a martyr sinned against but sinless but of all these three the third was the saddest and most hard to deal with faith in providence supports the sister or even the mother of a manwhenever there is fair play for itbut it seems to have no locus standi in the heart of his sweetheart that delicate young apparatus always moving up and down and as variable as the dewpoint is ever ready to do its best and tells itself so and consoles itself and then from reason quoted wholesale breaks into petty unassorted samples of absurdity in this condition without a dream of jealousy or disloyalty mabel lovejoy waited long and wondered hoped despaired and fretted and then worked hard and hoped again she had no one to trust her troubles to no cheerful and consoling voice to argue and grow angry with and prove against it how absurd it was to speak of comfort and yet to be imbibing comfort even while resenting it her mother would not say a word although she often longed to speak because she thought it wise and kind to let the matter die away while hilary was present or at any rate in england mrs lovejoy had yielded to the romance of these young doings but now that he was far away and likely in every weekly journal to be returned as killed and buried the kentish dame as a sensible woman preferred the charm of a bird in hand of these there were at least halfadozen ensnared and ready to be caged for life if mabel would only have them and two of them could not be persuaded that her nay meant anything for one possessed the mothers yea and the other that of the father the suitor favoured by mrs lovejoy was a young physician at maidstone dr daniel calvert a man of good birth and connections and having prospects of good fortune the grower on the other hand had now found out the very soninlaw he wantedelias jenkins a steady young fellow the son of a maltster at sevenoaks who had bought all the barley of old applewood farm for forty years and upwards elias was terribly smitten with mabel and suddenly found quite a vigorous joy in the planting and pruning of fruittrees and rode over almost every day throughout both march and april to take lessons as he said in grafting and training pears and planting cherries and various other branches of the gentle craft of gardening of course the grower could do no less than offer him dinner at every visit in spite of mrs lovejoys frowns and elias with a smiling face and blushing cheeks would bring his chair as close as he could to mabels and do his best in a hearty way to make himself agreeable and in this he succeeded so far that his angel did not in the least dislike him but to think of him twice after hilary was such an insult to all intelligence the maiden would have liked the maltster a great deal better than she did if only he would have dropped his practice of popping the question before he left every saturday afternoon but he knew that sunday is a dangerous day and as he could not well come grafting then he thought it safer to keep a place in her thoughts until the monday try her again lad the grower used to say odds bobs my boy dont run away from her young gals must be watched for and caught on the hop if they wont say yes before dinner have at them again in the afternoon and get them into the meadows and then go on again after suppertime some take the courting kindest of a morning and some at mealtime and some by the moonlight well sir i have tried her in all sorts of ways and she wont say yes to one of them i begin to be tired of saturdays now i have a great mind to try of a friday ay cried the grower looking at him as the author of a great discovery sure enough now try on fridaysmarketday as i am a man well now to think of that said elias what a fool i must have been to keep on so with saturday the mistress goes against me i know and that always tells up with the maidens but i must have something settled squire before next malting season you shall you shall indeed my lad you may take my word for it that only stands to reason shillyshally is a game i hate and no daughter of mine shall play at it but i blame you more than her my boy you dont know how to manage them take them by the horns there is nothing like taking them by the horns you know yes to be sure if one only knew the proper way to do it sir but missie slips away so quick like i never can get hold of her and then the mistress has that fellow calvert over here almost every sunday aha cried the grower with a knowing wink that is her little game is it now that is why she has aches and pains and such a very sad want of tone and failure of power in her leaders leave it to me ladthat you mayill soon put a stop to that a pillgrinder at applewood farm indeed but i did not know you was jealous jealous no no sir i scorn the action but when there are two you know why it makes it not half so nice for one you know squire lovejoy however soon discovered that he had been a little too confident in pledging himself to keep the maltsters rival off the premises for mrs lovejoy being a very resolute woman in a little way at once began to ache all over and so effectually to groan that instead of having the doctor once aweek she was obliged to have him at least three times and it was not very long before the young physicians advice was sought for a still more interesting patient for the daughter and prime delight of the house the bright sweettempered mabel instead of freshening with the spring and budding with new roses began to get pale and thin and listless and to want continually to go to church and not to care about her dinner her eagerness for divine service however could only be gratified on sundays for the practice of reading the prayers to the pillars twelve times aweek was not yet in vogue the novelty therefore of mabels desire made the symptom all the more alarming and her father perceived that so strange a case called peremptorily for medical advice but she for a long time did nothing but quote against himself his own opinion of the professors of the healing art while she stoutly denied the existence on her part of any kind of malady and so for a while she escaped the doctor meanwhile she was fighting very bravely with deep anxiety and long suspense and the struggle was the more forlorn and wearisome and lowhearted because she must battle it out in silence with none to sympathize and worse than that with everybody condemning her mutely for the conflict her father had a true and hearty liking for young lorraine preferring him greatlyso far as mere feeling wentto the maltster but his views for his daughter were different and he thought it high time that her folly should pass her mother on the other hand would have rejoiced to see her the wife of hilary but had long made up her mind that he would never return alive from spain and that mabel might lose the best years of her life in waiting for a doomed soldier gregory lovejoy alone was likely to side with his sister for the sake of lorraine the friend whom he admired so much and gregory had transmitted to her sweet little messages and loving words till the date of the capture of badajos but this one consoler and loyal friend was far away from her all this time having steadfastly eaten his way to the bar and received his lofty vocation thereupon lovejoy paid five guineas for his wig and a guinea for the box thereof gave a frugal but pleasant call party and being no way ashamed of his native county or his fathers place therein sturdily shouldered the ungrateful duties of junior on the homecircuit of course he did not expect a brief until his round was trodden well but he never failed to be in court and his pleasant temper and obliging ways soon began to win him friends his mother was delighted with all this but the franklin grumbled heavily at the bags he had to fill with money to be scattered as he verily believed among the senior lawyers now the summer assizes were held at maidstone about the beginning of july and gregory had sent word from london by john shorne that he must be there and would spend one night at home if his father would send a horse for him by the time when his duties were over his duties of the day consisted mainly in catering for the barmess and attending diligently thereto and now he saw the wisdom of the rule which makes a due course of feeding essential to the legal aspirant a hundred examinations would never have qualified him for the barmess whereas a long series of temple dinners had taught him most thoroughly what to avoid the grower was filled with vast delight at the idea of marching into court and saying to all the best people of the town pray allow me to pass sir my son is here somewhere i believe a freshcoloured barrister if you please maam with curly hair below his wig ah yes there he is but his lordship is whispering to him i see i must not interrupt them and therefore although his time might be worth a crown an hour ere his sons fetched a penny he strove in vain against the temptation to go over and look at gregory before breakfast he fidgeted over his fields and was up for being down upon every onejust to let them know that this sort of talent is hereditary his workmen winked at one another and said as soon as he was gone by that he must have got out the wrong side of the bed or else the old lady had been rating of him he in the greatness of his thoughts strode on and from time to time worked his lips and cast sharp glances at every gatepost in the glow of imaginary speech he could not feel that his son on the whole was a cleverer fellow than himself had been and he played the traitor to knife and spade by hankering after gown and wig if my father he said had only given me the chance i am giving gregory what might i be now one of these same barons as terrify us with their javelins and gallows and sit down with white tippits on or if my manners wasnt good enough for that who could ever keep me from standing up and defying all the villains for to put me down so long as i spoke justice and yet that might happen to be altogether wrong im a great mind not to go over at all my father was an honest man before me in this state of mind he sat down to breakfast bright with reflections of gregorys glory yet dashed irregularly with doubts of the honesty of its origin till in quite his old manner he made up his mind to keep his own council about the thing and ride over to the county town leaving applewood none the wiser for john shorne had orders the night before to keep his message quiet which an old markethand could be trusted to do and as for the ladies the grower was sure that they knew much less and cared much less about the assizes than about the washingday so he went to his stables about nine oclock with enough of his sunday raiment on to look well but awake no excitement and taking a good horse he trotted away with no other token behind him except that he might not be home at dinnertime but might bring a stranger to supper perhaps and they ought to have something roasted pride as a general rule of course goeth before a fall but the fathers pride in the present instance was so kindly and simple that nature waived her favourite law and stopped fortune from upsetting him although when he entered the court he did not find his son in confidential chat with the lord chief justice nor even in grave deliberation with a grand solicitor but getting the worst of a conflict with an exorbitant fishmonger and though the townspeople were not scared as much as they should have been by the wisdom of gregorys collected front neither did the latter look a quarter so wise as his father yet a turn of luck put all things right and even did substantial good for the grower at sight of his son was not to be stopped by any doorkeeper but pushed his way into the circle of forensic dignity and there saluted gregory with a kiss on the band of his horsehair and patted him loudly on the back and challenging with a quick proud glance the opinions of the bar and bench exclaimed in a good round kentish tone well done my boy hurrah for greg gentlemen all ill be dashed if my son doth not look about the wisest of all of ee loud titters ran the horsehair round and more solid laughter stirred the crowd while the officers of the court cried hush and the lord chief justice and his learned brother looked at the audacious grower while he with one hand on each shoulder of his son gazed around and nodded graciously who is this personthis gentleman i mean asked the lord chief justice correcting himself through courtesy to young lovejoy my father my lord answered gregory like a man though blushing like his sister mabel he has not seen me for a long time my lord and he is pleased to see me in this position ay that i am my lord said the grower making his bow with dignity i could not abide it at first but his motherah what would she say to see him now martin lovejoy my lord of old applewood farm very much at your lordships service the judge was well pleased with this little scene and kindly glanced at gregory of whom he had heard as a diligent pupil from his intimate friend mr malahide and being a man who missed no opportunityas his present position pretty clearly showedhe said to the gratified franklin mr lovejoy i shall be glad to see you if you can spare me half an hour after the court has risen these few words procured two briefs for gregory at the next assizes and thus set him forth on his legal course though the judge of course wantedas the bar knew wellrather to receive than to give advice for his lordship was building a mansion in kent and laying out large fruitgardens which he meant to stock with best sorts in the autumn and it struck him that a professional grower such as he knew mr lovejoy to be would be far more likely to advise him well than the nurserymen who commend most abundantly whatever they have in most abundance when the grower had laid down the law to the judge upon the subject of fruittrees and invited him to come and see them in bearing as soon as time allowed of it he set off in high spirits with his son who had discharged his duties but did not dine with his brethren of the wig to do the thing in proper style a horse was hired for gregory and they trotted gently enjoying the evening along the fairest road in england mr lovejoy was not very quick of perception and yet it struck him once or twice that his son was not very gay and did not show much pleasure at coming home and at last he asked him suddenly what are you thinking of greg my boy all this learning is as lead on the brain as your poor grandfather used to say a penny for your thoughts my lord chief justice well father i was not thinking of lawbooks nor even ofwell i was thinking of nothing except poor little mabel ay ay john has told you i suppose how little she eats and how pale she gets no wonder either with all the young fellows plaguing and pothering after her so between you and me master gregory i hope to see her married by the maltingtime now mind she will pay a deal of heed to you now that you are a fullblown counsellor young jenkins is the man remember no more about that young dashing lorraine no father no more about him said gregory sadly and submissively i wish i had never brought him here no harm my son no harm whatever that little fancy must be quite worn out elias is not over bright as we know but he is a steady and worthy young fellow and will make her a capital husband well that is the main point after alla steadfast man who will stick to her but you must not hurry her father now that would be the very way to spoil it hark to him hark to him cried the grower a counsellor with a vengeance the first thing he does is to counsel his father how to manage his own household gregory did his best to smile but the sunset in his eyes showed something more like the sparkle of a tear and then they rode on in silence chapter xliv how to take bad tidings after sunset mabel lovejoy went a little way up the lane leading towards the maidstone road on the chance of meeting her father the glow of the west glanced back from the trees and twinkled in the hedgerows and clustered in the travellers joy and here and there lay calmly waning on patches of mould that suited it good birds were looking for their usual roost to hop in and out and to talk about it and to flap their wings and tails until they should get sleepy but the thrush the latest songster now since the riot of the nightingale was cleaning his beak for his evensong and a cockrobin proud on the top of a pole was clearing his throat after feeding his youngthe third family of the season the bats were waiting for better light but a great stagbeetle came out of the ivy treading the air perpendicularly with heavy antlers balanced all these things fluttered in mabels heart and made her sad yet taught her not to dwell too much in sadness here were all things large and good and going on for a thousand ages with very little difference when the cockrobin died and the thrush was shot there would be quite enough to come after them when the leaf that glanced the sunset dropped the bud for next year would be up in its place even if the trees went down before the storms of winter fine young saplings grew between them and would be glad of their light and air therefore mabel weary not the everchanging world with woe she did not reason thus nor even think at all about it from time to time she looked and listened for her fathers galloway and the heavy content of the summer night shed gentle patience round her as yet she had no sense of wrong no thought of love betrayed nor even any dream of fickleness hilary was still to her the hero of all chivalry the champion of the blameless shield the bayard of her lifes romance but now he lay wounded in a barbarous land perhaps dead with no lover to bury him the pointed leaves of an old oak rustled a rabbit ran away with his scut laid down a weasel from under a root peered out and the delicate throat of the sensitive girl quivered with bad omensfor she had not the courage of alice lorraine through the slur of the night wind such as it makes in july only and the random lifting of outer leavestoo thick to be dealt with properlyand the quivering loops of dependent danglerswho really hoped that they might sleep at lastand then the fallaway of all things from their interruption to the sweetest of all sweet relapse and the deepest depth of quietude mabel heard through all of these the lively sound of horses feet briskly ringing on a rise of ground for the moment some folly of fancy took her so that she leaned against a gate and would have been glad to get over it she knew how unfit she was to meet him at last he was coming with her father to her she had not a thing on fit to look at and he must have seen such girls in spain oh how cruel of him to come and take her by surprise so but perhaps after all it was herself and not her clothes he would care for however let him go on to the houseif she kept well into the gatepostand then she might slip in and put on her dressthe buff frock he admired so and if it was much too large in the neck he would know for whose sake it became so what mabel mab all out here alone and trying to hide from her own brother gregory jumped from his horse and caught her and even in the waning light was frightened as she looked at him then she fell on his neck and kissed and kissed him bitter as her disappointment was it was something to have so dear a brother and she had not seen him for so long and he must have some news of hilary he felt her face all wet with tears turned up to him over and over again and he felt how she trembled and how slim she was and he knew in a moment what it meant and in his steadfast heart arose something that must have been a deep oath but for much deeper sorrow and then like a man he controlled it all i will walk with you darling and lead my horse or father perhaps you will take the bridle and tell mother to be ready for us mab is so glad to see me that she must not be hurried over it bless my heart said the grower what a heap of gossip you chits of children always have and nothing pleases you better than keeping your valued parents in the dark with this little grumble he rode on leading gregorys horse and shouting back at the corner of the lane now dont be long with your confab children i have scarcely had a bit to eat today and i wont have my supper spoiled for you gregory thought it a very bad sign that mabel sent no little joke after her father as she used to do then he threw his firm arm around her waist and led her homeward silently but even by his touch and step she knew that there was no good news for her oh gregory what is it all about she cried with one hand on his shoulder and soft eyes deeply imploring him you must have some message for me at last it is so long since i had any he is so kind he would never leave me without any message all this time unlessunless he is wounded you know how can he write asked gregory with some irony until he was wounded how many times did i bring you fifty thousand kisses oh it is not that i was thinking of though i am sure that was very nice of him ah you need not be laughing gregory dear as if you would not do the same to phyllis but do tell me what you have heard dear brother i can put up with anything better than doubt are you quite sure of that darling mab can you make up your mind for some very bad news i have not been used to it gregory ii have always been so happy is he dead only say that he is not dead no he is not dead sit down a moment under this old willow while i fetch some water for you i cannot sit down till i know the worst if he is not dead he is dying of his wounds oh my darling hilary he is not dying he is much better and will soon rejoin his regiment then why did you frighten me so for nothing oh how cruel it was of you i really thought i was going to fainta thing i have never done in my life you bring me the best news in the world and you spoil it by your way of telling it dont be in such a hurry darling i wish that was all i have to tell you but you have plenty of pride now havent you ii dont know at all i am sure but i suppose i am the same as other girls if you thought that lorraine was unworthy of you you could make up your mind to forget him i hope i never could do such a thing because i never dream it of hilary he is my better in every way from feeling myself unworthy of him i might perhaps try to do without him but as to forgetting himnever not even if he forgot you mabel he cannot do it she answered proudly he has promised never to forget me and no gentleman ever breaks a promise then hilary lorraine is no gentleman he has forgotten you and is deeply in love with a spanish lady kind and good brother as he was he had told his bad news too abruptly in his indignation mabel looked up faintly at him and was struck in the heart so that she could not speak but the first of the tide of a sea of tears just moved beneath her eyelids now come in to supper thats a dear whispered gregory frightened by the silent springs of sorrow if you are not at the table poor darling everything will be upside down and everybody uncomfortable he spoke like a fool confounding coarsely her essence and her instincts and perhaps some little turn of contrast broke the seals of anguish she looked up and she smiled to show her proper sense of duty and then without knowledge of what she did she pressed her right hand to her heart and leaned on a rail and fell forward into a torrent of shameless weeping she was as a little child once more whose soul is overwhelmed with woe and all along the hollow hedges went the voice of sobbing now do shut up said gregory when he had borne it as long as a man can bear what is the good of it mabel now i thought you had more sense than this after all it may be false you know it is not false it is what i have felt you would not have told me if it had been false it has come from some dreadfully low mean person who spies him only too accurately now mabel you are quite out of yourself you never did say nasty things there is nobody spying lorraine at all i should doubt if he were worth it only it is well known in the regiment and i had it on the best authority that hethat he that he does what and is that all your authority i am beginning to laugh at the whole of it then laugh my dear mabel i wish that you would it is the true way of regarding such things i dare say it may be for you great men and you think that poor women can do the same when indeed there is nothing to laugh at i scarcely think that you ought to suggest the idea of laughing gregory the best authority you said is that a thing to laugh at well perhapsperhaps it was not the best authority after all it was only two officers of his regiment who know my friend capper who lives in chambers a gentleman living in chambers indeed to revile poor hilary who has been through the wall and two officers of his regiment greg i did think that you had a little more sense well it seems to me pretty good evidence mabel would you rather have them of another regiment certainly not i am very glad that they were of poor hilarys regiment because that proves they were storytellers there is not an officer in his own regiment that can help being jealous of him after the noble things he has done how dull you must be not to see it all i must come to the assizes instead of you well what a cry i have had for nothing mabel you are a noble girl i am sure you deserve the noblest sweetheart and i have got him said mabel smiling and i wont let him go and i wont believe a single word against him until he tells me that it is true himself do you think that he would not have written to me even with the stump of his left hand and said mabel i am tired of you mabel i have seen prettier girls and more of my own rank in life mabel you must try to forget me when he does that i shall cry in real earnest and there will be no more mabel come in to supper my pet said gregory and she came in to supper with her sweet eyes shining chapter xlv innocence in no sense near the head of a pass of the sierra morena but out of the dusty track of war there stood a noble mansion steadfast from and to unknown ages the moorish origin here and there was boldly manifest among spanish french and italian handiwork both of repair and enlargement the building must have looked queer at times with new and incongruous elements but the summer sun and the storms of winter had enforced among them harmony so that now this ancient castle of the counts of zamora was a grand and stately pile in tone as well as height and amplitude the position also had been chosen well for it stood near the line of the watershed commanding northward the beautiful valley of the guadiana and southward the plains of the guadalquivir so that as the morning mists rolled off the towers of merida might be seen and the high ground above badajos while far on the opposite skyline flashed the gilt crosses of cordova and sometimes when the distance lifted a glimpse was afforded of the sunbeams quivering over seville and here towards the latter end of august hilary lorraine was a guest and all his wishes lawsave one the summer had been unusually hot even for the south of spain and a fifth part of the british army was said to be in hospital this may have been caused in some degree by their habits of drinking and plundering which even lord wellington declared himself unfit to cope with to every division of his army he appointed twenty provostmarshals whereas two hundred would not have been enough to hang these heroes punctually the patriotic spaniards also could not see why they should not have some comfort from their native land therefore they overran it well with bands of fine fellows of a warlike cast and having strong tendencies towards good things and these were of much use to the british not only by stopping the frenchmens letters but also by living at large and gratis so that the british who sometimes paid became white sheep by the side of them one of the fiercest of these guerillasor partidas as they called themselveswas the notorious mina and for lieutenant he had a man of lofty birth and once good position a certain don alcides dalcar a nephew of the count of zamora this man had run through every real of a large inheritance and had slain many gentlemen in private brawls and his country was growing too hot to hold him when the french invasion came the anarchy that ensued was just the very thing to suit him and he raised a small band of uncertain young fellows and took to wild life in the mountains at first they were content to rob weak foreigners without escort but thriving thus and growing stronger very soon they enlarged their views and so they improved from year to year in every style of plunder and being authorized by the juntas and favoured by british generals did harm on a large scale to their country and on a much smaller scale to the french hilary had heard from camilla much about alcides dalcar but claudia had never spoken of himonly blushing proudly when the patriots name was mentioned camilla said that he was a man of extraordinary size and valour enough to frighten anybody and much too large to please her and here she glanced at hilary softly and dropped her eyes in a way to show that he was of the proper size to please herif he cared to know it he did not care a piastre to know it but was eager about alcides oh then you had better ask claudia camilla replied with a sisterly look of very subtle import and claudia with her proud walk passed and glanced at them both disdainfully now the victory of salamanca and his sorry absence thence and after that the triumphant entry of the british into madrid although they were soon turned out again began to work in hilarys mind and make him eager to rejoin three weeks ago he had been reported almost fit to do so and had been ready to set forth but spanish ladies are full of subtlety and camilla stopped him a cock of two lustres had been slain in some of the outer premises and old teresina stole down in the night and behold in the morning the patients wound had most evidently burst forth again hilary was surprised but could not doubt the testimony of his eyes neither could the licentiate of medicine now attending him but now in the breath of the evening breeze setting inland from the atlantic lorraine was roving for the last time in the grounds of monte argento at three in the morning he must set forth with horses provided by his host on his journey to headquarters the count was known as a patriotic wise and wealthy noble both of whose sons were fighting bravely in the spanish army and through his influence lorraine had been left to hospitality instead of hospitals which in truth had long been overworked but major clumps had returned to his duty long ago with a very sore heart when he found from the donna camilla that she liked him very much indeed but could never induce herself to love him with the sharp eye of jealousy that brave major spied in hilary the cause of this and could not be brought to set down his name any more in his letters homeward or at any rate not for a very long time lorraine in the calm of this summer evening with the heatclouds moving eastward and the ripple of refreshment softly wooing the burdened air came to a little bower or rather a natural cove of rock and leaf wherein as he knew the two fair sisters loved to watch the eventide weaving hill and glen with shadow before the rapid twilight waned there was something here that often brought his native southdowns to his mind though the foliage was so different instead of the rich deep gloss of the beech the silvery stir of the aspentree and the feathery droop of the graceful birch here was the round monotony of the olive and the lemontree the sombre depth of the ilex and the rugged lines of the corktree relieved it is true just here and there by the symmetry of the silver fir and the elegant fan of the palm but what struck lorraine and always irked him under these southern trees and skies was the way in which the foliage cut its outline over sharply there was none of that hovering softness and sweetly fluctuating margin by which a tree inspires affection as well as admiration unluckily now lorraine had neither affection nor admiration left for the innocent beauty of natures works his passion for claudia was become an overwhelming and noxious powera power that crushed for the time and scattered all his better elements he had ceased to be lighthearted and to make the best of everything to love the smiles of children and to catch a little joke and return it he had even ceased to talk to himself as if his conscience had let him know that he was not fit to be talked to all the waking hours he passed in the absence of his charmer were devoted to the study of spanish and he began to despise his own english tongue there is no melody in it no rhythm no grand sonorous majesty he used to complain it is like its owners harsh uncouth and countrified after this what can any one do but pity him for his state of mind whether claudia returned his passionfor such it was rather than true affectionwas still a very doubtful point though the most important in all the world generally she seemed to treat him with a pleased contempt as if he were a pleasant boy though several years older than herself her clear dark eyes were of such a depth that though she was by no means chary of their precious glances he had never been able to reach that inmost light which comes from the very heart how different from somebodysof whom he now thought less and less and vainly strove to think no more because of the shame that pierced him but if this spanish maiden really did not care about him why did she try as she clearly did to conquer and subdue him why did she shoot such glances at him as spanish eyes alone can shoot why bend her graceful neck so sweetly slope her delicate head so gently showing the ripe firm curve of cheek and with careless dancings let her raven hair fall into his hilary could not imagine why but poor camilla knew too well if ever camilla felt for a moment the desirability of any one claudia with her bolder manners and more suddenly striking beauty and less dignified love of conquest might be relied upon to rush in and attract the whole attention hilary found these lovely sisters in their little cove of rock where the hot wind seldom entered through the fringe of hanging frond they had a clever device of their own for welcoming the atlantic breeze by means of a silken rope which lifted all the screen of fern and creeper and of grey rockivy now the screen was up and the breeze flowed in meeting a bright rill bubbling out whose fountain was in the living rock and the clear obscurity was lit with forms as bright as poetry camillas comely head had been laid on the bosom of her sister as if she had made some soft appeal for mercy or indulgence there and claudia had been moved a little as the glistening of her eyelids showed and a tender gleam in her expressionthe one and the only thing required to enrich her brilliant beauty and thus without stopping to think she came up to hilary with a long kind glance and gave a little sigh worth more than even that sweet glance to him alas dear captain she said in spanish which hilary was quite pat with now we have been lamenting your brief departure how shall we live when you are lost what cruelty of yourselves to think the matter of your inquiry should be the chance of my survival well said she exclaimed you english are not so very stupid after all why do you not clap your hands camilla camilla being commanded thus made a weak attempt with her little palms but her heart was down too low for any brisk concussion of flesh or air i believe master captain said claudia throwing herself gracefully on a white bulls hideshaped as a chair on the slopes of mossthat you are most happy to make your escape from this long and dull imprisonment behold how little we have done for you after all the brave things you have done for us ah no said camilla gazing sadly at the captain who would not gaze at her it is true that we have done but little yet senhor we meant our best your kindness to me has been wonderful magnificent answered hilary the days i have passed under your benevolence have been the happiest of my life hereupon camilla turned away to hide her tenderness of tears but claudia had no exhibition except a little smile to hide and will you come again she asked will you ever think of us any more in the scenes of your grand combats and the fierce delight of glory is it possible for me to forgetbegan hilary in his noblest spanishyour constant care of a poor stranger your neverfatigued attention to him and thythy saving of his life to thee i owe my life and will at any moment render it this was a little too much for camilla who really had saved him and being too young to know how rarely the proper person gets the praise she gathered up her things to go darling claudia she exclaimed i can do nothing at all without my little silver spinetta this steel thing is so rusty that it fills my work with canker you know the danger of rusty iron claudia is it not so she is cross said claudia as her sister with gentle dignity left the cove what can have made her so cross today the saints are good to me hilary answered little suspecting the truth of the case they grant me the chance of saying what i have long desired to say to you to me senhor cried the maiden displaying a tremulous glow in her long black eyes and managing to blush divinely and then in the frankness of her nature caring not to conceal a sigh it cannot be to me senhor to youto you of all the worlds of all the heavens and all the angels the fervent youth fell upon his knees before his lovely idol and seized the hand she began to press to her evidently bounding heart and drew her towards him and thought for the moment that she was glad to come to him then in his rapture he stroked aside her loose and deliciously fragrant hair and waited with all his heart intent for the priceless glanceto tell him all but strongly moved as she was no doubt by his impassioned words and touch and the sympathy of youthful love she kept her oval eyelids down as if she feared to let him see the completion of his conquest then as he fain would have had her nearer and folded in his eager arms she gently withdrew and turned away but allowed him to hear one little sob and to see tears irrepressible you loveliest of all lovely beings began lorraine in very decent spanish such as herself had taught him and at the same time you best and dearest stop senhor she whispered gazing sadly and then playfully at this prize of her eyes and slave of her lips i must not allow you to say so much you will leave us tomorrow and forget it all what is the use of this fugitive dream hereupon the young soldier went through the usual protestations of truth fidelity devotion and eternal memory so thoroughly hurried and carried away that he used in another tongue the words poured forth scarcely a year ago to a purer truer and nobler love alas the young donna now mimicked in voice and attitude some deserted one to how many beautiful english maidens have these very noble words been used you cavaliers are all alike i will say no more to you now brave captain the proof of truth is not in words but in true and devoted actions you know our proverbthe cork is noisiest when it leaves the bottle if you would have me bear you in mind you must show that you remember me at the cost of my life of my good repute of all that i have in the world or shall have of everything but my hope of you i shall remember these words my captain and perhaps i shall put them to the test some day she gave him her soft and trembling hand and he pressed it to his lips and sought to impress a still more loving seal but she said not yet not yet oh beloved one or whether she said oh enamoured one he could not be quite certain and before he could do or say anything more she had passed from his reach and was gliding swiftly under the leafy curtain of that eversacred bower she is mine she is mine cried young lorraine as he caught up the velvet band of her hair and covered it with kisses and then bestowed the same attentions on the white bullskin where her form had lain the loveliest creature ever seen is mine what can i have done to deserve her while he lay in the ecstasy of his triumph the loveliest creature ever seen stole swiftly up a rocky path beset with myrtle and cornelwood and canopied with climbers after some intricate turns and often watching that no one followed her she came to the door of a little hut embosomed in towering chestnuttrees the door was open and a man of great stature was lounging on a couch too short for his legs and smoking a cigar of proportions more judiciously adapted to his own near one of his elbows stood a very heavy carbine and a sword threequarters of a fathom long and by his other hand lay a great pitcher empty and rolled over as the young donnas footfall struck his ears he leaped from his couch and cocked his gun then recognizing the sound replaced it and stood indolently at his door at last you are come then he said with an accent decidedly of the northern provinces not inborn however but caught from comrades i thought that you meant to let me die of thirst you forget that i have lost the habit of this execrable heat claudia looked up at her cousin don alcides dalcaror as he loved to be called the great brigadierwith a very different gaze from any poor hilary could win of her to this man alone the entire treasures of her heart were open for him alone her glorious eyes no longer sparkled flashed or played with insincere allurements but beamed and shone with depths of light and profusion of profoundest love darling she said as she stood on tiptoe and sweetly pacified him i have laboured in vain to come sooner to you your commands took a long time to execute you men can scarcely understand such things and that tiresome camilla hung about me i thought my occasion would never arrive but all has gone well he is my slave for ever you did not allow him to embrace you i trust before he could finish his scowl she stopped his mouth and reassured him is it to be imagined a miserable shaveling briton but though she looked so indignant she knew how near she had been to that ignominy you are as clever as you are lovely answered the brigadier well pleased but i die of thirst my beloved one fly swiftly to teresinas store for i dare not venture till the night has fallen would that you could manage your father as you wind those striplings round your spindle for the count of zamora had given orders that his precious nephew should be shot if ever found upon land of his so claudia took the empty pitcher to fetch another halfskin of wine as well as some food for the great brigadier and having performed this duty met the infatuated hilary for the last time at her fathers board she wished him good night and goodbye with a glance of deep meaning and kind encouragement while the fair camilla bent over his hand and then departed to her chamber with full eyes and an empty heart chapter xlvi hard riding and hard reading in those old times of heavy pounding scanty food and great hardihood when war was not accounted yet as one of the exact sciences and soldiers slept in all sorts of weather without so much as a blanket round them much less a snug tent overhead the duties of the different branches of the service were not quite so distinct as they are now lieutenant lorrainefor the ladies had given overrapid promotion when they called him their brave captainhad not rejoined his regiment long before he obtained acknowledgment of his good and gallant actions having proved that he could sit a horse see distinctly at long distance and speak the spanish language fairlythanks to the two young donnasand possessed some other accomplishments which would now be tested by paper work he received an appointment upon the staff not of the light division but at headquarters under the very keen eyes of the hero of a hundred fights if the brief estimate of his compeers is of any importance to a man of powerful geniusas no doubt it must be by its effect on his opportunitiesthen the iron duke though crowned with good luck as everybody called each triumph of his skill and care certainly seems to have been unlucky as to the date of his birth and work providence in its infinite wisdomto use a phrase of the wesleyans who claim the great general as of kin to their own courageous founderproduced him at a time no doubt when he was uncommonly needful but when let him push his fame as he would by victory after victory there always was a more gigantic because a more voracious glory marching far in front of him our great hero never had the chance of terrifying the world by lopping it limb by limb and devouring it and as noble glory is the child of terror begotten upon it by violence the fame of wellington could never vie with napoleons glory to him however this mattered little except that it often impaired his means of discharging his duty thoroughly his present duty was to clear the peninsula of frenchmen and this he would perhaps have done in a quarter of the time it cost if his own country had only shown due faith in his abilities but the grandeur of his name grew slowly as the fame of marcellus grew like a tree in the hidden lapse of time and perhaps no other general ever won so many victories before his country began to dream that he could be victorious now this great man was little if at all inferior to his mighty rival in that prime necessity of a commanderinsight into his material he made a point of learning exactly what each of his officers was fit for and he seldom failed in all his warfare to put the right man in the right place he saw at a glance that lieutenant lorraine was a gallant and chivalrous young fellow active and clever in his way and likely to be very useful on the staff after a little training and so many young aids had fallen lately or were upon the sicklist that the quartermastergeneral was delighted with a recruit so quick and zealous as hilary soon proved himself and after a few lessons in his duties he set him to work with might and main to improve his knowledge of colloquial french with this lorraine having gift of tongues began to grow duly familiar and the more so perhaps because his knowledge of epistolary english afforded him very little pleasure just now for all his good principles and kind feelings must have felt rude shock and shame when he read three letters from england which reached him on the very same day at valladolid the first was from his uncle struan and after making every allowance for the rectors want of exercise in the month of august hilary having perhaps a little too much exercise himself could not help feeling that the tone was scarcely so hearty as usual the letter was mainly as follows west lorraine th august my dear nephew your father and myself have not been favoured with any letters from you for a period of several months it appears to me that this is neither dutiful nor affectionate although we know that you have been wounded which increased our anxiety you may have been too bad to write and i wish to make all allowance for you but where there is a will there is a way when i was at oxford few men perhaps in all the university felt more distaste than i did for original latin composition yet every saturday when we went to the hall to get our battelbillsthere was my essay neatly written and of sound latinitycome come cried lorraine this is a little too cool my dear uncle how many times have i heard you boast what you used to pay your scouts son per line i cannot expect any young man of course continued the worthy parson to make such efforts for conscience sake as in my young days were made cheerfully but this indolence and dislike of the pen furc expellendum estmust be expelled with a knife and fork perhaps you will scarcely care to hear that your aunt and cousins are doing well after your exploits your memory seems to have grown very short of poor folk in old england your birthday falling on a sunday this year i took occasion to allude in the course of my sermon to a mural crown of which i remember to have heard at school nobody knew what i meant but many were more affected than if they did but after all it requires to my mind quite as much courage and more skill to take a dry wall properly when nobody has been over it than to scramble into badajos alice will write to you by this post and tell you all the gossip of the sad old house if there is any there seems to be nobody now with life enough to make much gossip and all that we hear is about captain chapman who means to have alice and about yourself about you it is said though i cannot believe it and must be ashamed of you when i do so that you are making a fool of yourself with a spanish lady of birth and position but a rank idolatrous bigoted papist the lorraines have been always sadly heterodox in religious matters from age to age receiving every whim they came across of they have taken to astrology mahomet destiny and the gods of greece and they never seem to know when to stop the only true church the church of england never has any hold of them and if you should marry a papist hilary it would be a judgment your father perhaps would be very glad of any looseness of mind and sense that might have the power to lead you astray from my ideas of honour i have had a little explanation with him in the course of which as he used stronger language than i at all approve of i ventured to remind him that from the very outset i had charged him with what i call this low intention this design of working upon your fickle and capricious temper to make you act dishonourably your poor father was much annoyed at this hometruth and became so violent and used such unbecoming language that i thought it the most clerical course to leave him to reflect upon it on the following sunday i discoursed upon the third chapter of the epistle of st james but there was only alice in the coombe pew i saw however that she more than once turned away her face with shame although i certainly did not discover any tears it is to be hoped that she gave sir roland an accurate summary of my discourse none of which as i explained to your dear aunt after the service was intended for my own domestic hearth since that time i have not had the pleasure of meeting sir roland lorraine in private life and now a few words as to your own conduct your memory is now so bad that you may have forgotten what i did for you at a time when my parish and family were in much need of my attention and two large coveys of quite young birds were lying every night in the corner of the hays i left my home in extremely hot weather simply to be of use to you my services may have been trifling but at that time you did not think so it was not my place to interfere in a matter which was for your fathers decision but i so far committed myself that if you are fool enough and knave enoughfor i never mince language as your father doesto repudiate your engagement with a charming and sensible girl for the sake of highflying but lowminded papists much of the disgrace will fall on me and what are those spanish families descended perhaps from don quixote or even sancho panza to compare with kentish landowners who derive their title from the good old danes and what are their women when they get yellowas they always do before twentyfivecompared with an englishwoman who generally looks her best at forty and not only that for after all that is a secondary question as a man grows wise but is a southern foreigner likely to make an englishman happy even if she becomes converted from her imageworship about which they are very obstinate can she keep his house for him can she manage an english servant can she order a dinner does she even know when a bed is aired can a gentleman dine and sleep at her house after a days hunting without having rheumatism gout and a bilious attack in the morning all this you will think can be managed by deputy and in very large places it must be so but i have been a guest in very large placesvery much finer than coombe lorraine however your father may have scoffed at me and i can only say that i would rather be the guest of an english countrysquire or even a parson with a clever and active wife at the head of his table than of a duke with a grand french cook and a duchess who never saw a dustpan and if you should marry a spaniard where are you to get your grand establishment your father never saves a farthing and you are even less likely to do so and as for the lady she of course will have nothing my blood is blue because i have no breeches says one of their poets feelingly and that is the case with all of them whereas i have received a little hint it does not matter how or where that mabel lovejoy who is much too good for any fickle jackanapes is down for a nice round sum in the will of a bachelor banker at tonbridge her father and mother do not know it neither do any of her family but i did not pass my very pleasant holiday in that town for nothing every one seemed to understand me and i was thoroughly pleased with all of them but i shall not be pleased at all with you and in good truth you never shall darken my door if you yield yourself bound hand and foot to any of those dulcineas or rather delilahs i have known a good many spaniards when nelson was obliged to take them prisoners they are a dirty lazy lot unfit to ride anything but mules and they poison the air with garlic your aunt and cousins who have read this letter say that i have been too hard upon you the more they argue the more i am convinced that i have been far too lenient so that i will only add their loves and remain my dear nephew your affectionate uncle struan hales pswe expect a very grand shooting season last year through the drought and heat there was not a good turnipfield in the parish birds were very numerous as they always are in hot seasons but there was no getting near them this season the turnips are up to my knees how i wish that you were here instead of popping at the red legs through the great kindness of young steenie chapman i am to have free warren of all sir remnants vast estates but i like the homeshooting best and no doubt your father will come to a proper state of mind before the first do not take amiss my dear boy whatever i may have said for your good scribe cito responde cras your loving uncle s h all this long epistle was read by hilary in the saddle for he had two horses allowed him nowwhenever he could get themand now he was cantering with an order to an outpost of the advancedguard tracking the rear of clausel they knew not yet what clausel wasone of the few men who ever defied and yet escaped from wellington the british staff was weak just now though freshly recruited with hilary or haply the frenchman might not have succeeded in his brilliant movement he must be terribly put out said young lorraine meaning neither clausel nor wellington nor napoleon even but his uncle struan there is not a word of any paragon dog nor the horses he has bought or chopped nor even little cecil he must have had a great row with my father and he visits it on this generation how can he have heard of angelic claudia and then talk of garlic my darling i know what you are though heavyseated britons fail to soar to such perfection now for alice i suppose she will know how to behave i should hope why how she begins as if i were her thirtysecond cousin ten times removed and how precious short it is but what a beautifully clear firm hand my dear hilary my father not having any time to spare just now and having received no letter from you which he might desire to answer has asked me to say that we are quite well and that we are very glad to hear that you seem to have greatly distinguished yourself to hear this must always be as you will feel a pleasure and true pride to us at the same time we have been very anxious because you have been returned in the gazette as heavily wounded we hope however that it is not so for we have been favoured with a very long letter from major clumps of your regiment to my grandmothers dear friend lady de lampnor in which you were spoken of most highly and since that he has not spoken of you as he must have done if you were wounded pray let us hear at once what the truth is uncle struan was very rude to my father about you the other day and used the most violent language and preached such a sermon against himself on sunday but he has not been up to apologize yet and i hear from dear cecil that he means to tell you all about it he is most thoroughly good poor dear but allowances must be made for him he will tell you of course all the gossip of the place which is mainly as usual about himself he seems to attach so much importance to what we consider trifles and he does the most wonderful things sometimes he has taken a boy from the bottom of our hillthe boy that stole the donkey and lived upon rags and bottlesand he has him at the rectory every day except sunday to clean knives and boots the whole of the village is quite astonished the boy used to run for his life at the sight of dear uncle struan and we cannot help thinking that it is done just because we could never encourage the boy papa thinks that you are very likely to require a little cash just now for he knows that young officers are poorly paid even when they can get their money which is said to be scarce with your brave army now therefore he has placed to your credit with messrs shotman for which you can draw as required and the money will be replaced at christmas and grandmamma begs me to add that she is so pleased with your success in the only profession fit for a gentleman that she sends from her own purse twenty guineas through the hands of messrs shotman and she trusts that you will now begin to cultivate frugality with these words i must now conclude prolonging only to convey the kind love of us all and best desires for your welfare with which i now subscribe myself your affectionate sister alice lorraine psdarling brotherthe above has been chiefly from that grandmamma i have leave to write to you now myself and the rest of this piece of paper will hold not a hundredth part of what i want to say i am most unhappy about dear papa and about you and uncle struan and captain chapman and everybody nothing goes well and if you fight in spain we fight much worse in england father is always thinking and dwelling upon his thoughts in the library he knows that he has been hard upon you and the better you go on the more he worries himself about it because he is so thoroughly set upon being just to everyone and even concerning a certain young ladyit is not as uncle struan fancies you know how headlong he is and he cannot at all understand our father my father has a justice such as my uncle cannot dream of but dear papa doubts your knowledge of your own mind darling hilary what a low idea of uncle struan that you were sent to spain to be tempted i did not like what happened to you in kent last summer any more than other people did but i think that papa would despise youand i am quite sure that i shouldif you deceived anybody after leading them to trust you but of course you could not do it darling any more than i could now do write home a nice cheerful letter with every word of all you do and everything you can think of papa pretends to be very quietbut i am sure that is always thinking of you and he seems to grow so much older i wish all his books were at hanover i would take him for a good ride every day goodbye darling if you make out this you will deserve a crown of crosses uncle struan thought that he was very learned and he confounded the mural with the civic crown having earned the one earn the other by saving us all and your own lallie hilary read this letter twice and then put it by to be read again for some of it touched him sadly then he delivered the orders he bore and made a rough sketch of the valley and returning by another track drew forth his third epistle this he had feared to confront because his conscience went against him so for he knew that the hand was gregorys however it must be met sooner or later it was no good putting off the evil day and so he read as follows mid temple aug nd my dear lorraine it is now many months since i heard from you and knowing that you had been wounded i have been very anxious about you and wrote three several times to inquire under date may rd june th and july nd of course none of these may have come to hand as they were addressed to your regiment and i do not at all understand how you manage without having any posttown but i have heard through my friend capper who knows two officers of your regiment that you were expected to return to duty in july since which i have vainly expected to hear from you by every arrival no one therefore can charge me with haste or impatience in asking at last for some explanation of your conduct and this i do with a heavy heart in consequence of some reports which have reached me from good authority confound the fellow cried the conscious hilary how he beats about the bush will he never have it out and be done with it what an abominably legal and coldblooded style ah now for it you must be aware that you have won the warmest regard and indeed i must say the whole heart of my sister mabel this was much against the wishes and intentions of her friends she was not thrown in your way to catch the heir to a title and a rich mans son we knew that there would be many obstacles and we all desired to prevent it even i though carried away by my great regard for you never approved it if you have a particle of your old candour left you will confess that from first to last the engagement was of your own seeking i knew and my sister also knew that your father could not be expected to like it or allow it for a very long time to come but we also knew that he was a man of honour and integrity and that if he broke it off it would be done by fair means and not by foul everything depended upon yourself you were not a boy but a man at least five years older than my sister and you formed this attachment with your eyes open and did your utmost to make it mutual to be sure i did exclaimed the young officer giving a swish to his innocent horse because himself deserved it how could i help it she was such a dear how i wish i had never seen claudia but really gregory come now you are almost too hard upon me and not only this continued that inexorable young barrister but lest there should be any doubt about your serious intentions you induced or at any rate you permitted your uncle the rev struan hales to visit mabel and encourage her and assure her that all opposition would fail if she remained true and steadfast mabel has remained true and steadfast even to the extent of disbelieving that you can be otherwise from day to day and from week to week she has been looking for a message from you if it were only one kind word she has felt your wound i make bold to say a great deal more than you have done she has taken more pride than you can have taken in what she calls your glory she watches every morning for the man who goes for the letters and every evening she waits and listens for a step that never comes if she could only make up her mind that you had quite forgotten her i hope that she would try to think that you were not worth grieving for but the worst of it is that she cannot bring herself to think any ill of you and until she has it under your own hand that you are cruel and false to her she only smiles at and despises those who think it possible we must put a stop to this state of things it is not fair that any girl should be kept in the dark and deluded so least of all such a girl as mabel so gentle and true and tenderhearted therefore i must beg you at once to write to my sister or to me and to state honestly your intentions if your intention is to desert my sister i ask you as a last favour to do it as rudely and roughly as possible so that her pride may be aroused and help her to overget the blow but if you can give any honourable explanation of your conduct no one will be more delighted and beg your pardon more heartily and humbly than your former friend gregory lovejoy chapter xlvii try to think the best of me lorraine set spurs to his horse as soon as he got to the end of this letter it was high time for him to gallop away from the one ideathe bitter knowledge that out of this he could not come with the conscience of a gentleman he was right in fleeing from himself as hard as ever he could go for no lorraine had been known ever to behave so shabbily in the former days of rather low morality and high feudalism many lorraines might have taken fancies to pretty girls and jilted thembut never as he had done never approaching a pure maid as an equal and pledging honour to her and then dishonourably deserting her i am sure i know not what to do he cried in a cold sweat while his nag was in a very hot one heaven knows who my true love is i am almost sure that it must be mabel because when i think of her i get hot and when i think of claudia i get cold there may have been some sense in this at any rate it is a question for a meteorologist though people who explainas they always manage to doeverything might without difficulty declare that they understood the whole of it that a young man in magnetic attitude towards two maidens widely distinct one positive and one negative should hop up and down like elderpith would of course be accounted for by the strange phenomena of electricity but little was known of such things then and every man had to confront his own acts without any fine phraseology and hilarys acts had left him now in such a positionor fix as it is forcibly termed nowadaysthat even that most inventive arab the sheikh of the subterfuges could scarcely have delivered him but after all the griefs of the body where there is perpetual work knock at the door of the constitution louder than those of the mind do and not only hilary now but all the british army found it hard to get anything to eat as for moneythere was none or next to none among them but this was a trifling matter to men who knew so well how to help themselves but shoes and clothing and meat for dinner and yellow soap for horny soles and a dram of something strong at night before lying down in the hole of their hipsthey felt the want of these comforts now after spending a fortnight in madrid and now they were bound to march every day fifteen to twenty english miles over very hard ground and in scorching weather after an enemy offering more than affording chance of fighting these things made every british bosom ready to explode with anger and the staff was blamed as usual for negligence ignorance clumsiness inability and all the rest of it these reproaches entered deeply into the bruised heart of lorraine and made him so zealous that his chief very often laughed while praising him and thus in the valley of the arlanzan on the march towards burgos he became a gallant captain with the goodwill of all who knew him lorraine was royally proud of this for his nature was not selfcontained he contemplated many letters beginning captain lorraine presents his compliments to soandso and he even thought at one time of thus defying his uncle struan however a little reflection showed him that the wisest plan was to let the rector abide a while in silence it was out of all reasonthough not perhaps entirely beyond precedentthat he the least injured of all the parties should be the loudest in complaint and it would serve him right to learn from the hostile source of coombe lorraine the withering fact that his recreant nephew was now a british captain bold to alice therefore the captain wrote at the very first opportunity to set forth his promotion and to thank his father and grandmother for cash but he made no allusion to homeaffairs except to wish everybody well this letter he despatched on the th of september and then being thoroughly stiff and weary from a week spent in the saddle he shunned the campfires and the cooking and slept in a tuffet of plantaingrass to the melody of the arlanzan on the following day our army being entirely robbed of fighting by a dancing frenchman who kept snapping his fingers at lord wellington entered in no pleasant humour into a burning city the sun was hot enough in all conscience roasting all wholesome britons into a dirty moorish colour without a poor halt and maimed soldier having to march between burning houses a house on fire is full of interest and has become proverbial now as an illustration of bright success but the metaphorwhether derived or not from military privilegesproceeds on the supposition that the proper people have applied the torch in the present case this was otherwise the frenchmen had fired the houses and taken excellent care to rob them first finding the heat of the town of burgos almost past endurance although the fire had now been quenched hilary strolled forth towards sunset for a little change of air his duties which had been so incessant were cut short for a day or two but to move his legs with no horse between them seemed at first unnatural he passed through narrow reeking streets where filthy people sprawled about under overlapping eaves and coignes and then he came to the scorched rough land and looked back at the citadel the garrison now that the smoke was clearing from the houses below the steep which they had fired for safetys sake might be seen in the western light training their guns upon the city which swarmed with spanish guerillas these sons of the soil were plundering with as good a grace as if themselves had taken a hostile city and in the enthusiasm of the moment or from force of habit perhaps some of them gladly lent a hand in robbing their own houses but the british soldiers grounded arms and looked on very grimly for they had not carried the town by storm and their sense of honesty prevailed all this amused lorraine who watched it through his fieldglass as he sat on a rocky mound outside the city resting himself for his legs were stiff and feeling quite out of his element at being his own master but presently he saw that the french who were very busy in the castle were about to treat both spaniards and britons to a warm salute of shells and he rose at once to give them warning but found his legs too stiff for speed so he threw a halfdollar to a portuguese soldier who was sauntering on the road below and bade him run at his very best pace and give notice of their danger but before his messenger had passed the gate hilary saw a spanish chief as in the distance he seemed to be come swiftly out of a side street and by rapid signals recall and place quite out of the line of fire all the plundering spaniards this man as hilarys spyglass showed him was of very great breadth and stature and wore a slouchhat with a short black feather a green leather jerkin and a broad white sash his mighty legs were encased above midthigh in boots of undressed hide and he was armed with a long straight sword and dagger having some experience of plunderers hilary was surprised at the prompt obedience yielded to this guerilla chief until he was gratified by observing a sample of his discipline for two of his men demurring a little to the abandonment of their prey he knocked them down as scientifically as an english pugilist handed their booty to others and had them dragged by the heels round the corner then having his men all under cover he stood in a calm and reflective attitude with an immense cigar in his mouth to see a fine group of thirsty britons who were drinking in the middle of the square shot or shelled as the case might be and when hilarys messenger ran up in breathless haste to give the alarm and earn his halfdollar honestly what did that ruthless fellow do but thrust forth a long leg trip him up and hand him over with a grin to some brigands who rifled his pockets and stopped his mouth then came what hilary had expected a roar a plunge a wreath of smoke and nine or ten brave englishmen lay shattered round the fountain that spaniard is a very queer ally said hilary with a shudder he knew what was coming and he took good care that it should not be prevented let me try to see his face if my good glass will show it i call him a bandit and nothing else partidas indeed i call them cutthroats at that very moment the great guerilla turned round to indulge in a hearty laugh and having a panel of pitched wall behind him presented his face like a portrait in an ebony frame towards hilary the collar of the jerkin was rolled back and the great bull throat and neck left bare except where a short black beard stood forth like a spur of jet to the heavy jaws the mouth was covered with a thick moustache but haughty nostrils and a roman nose as well as deep lines of face and fierce eyes hung with sullen eyebrows made hilary cry what an ugly fellow as he turned his glass upon something else yet this was a face such as many women dote upon and almost adore power is the first thing they look for in the face of a man or at least it is the very first thing that strikes them and power of that sort is headstrong will with no regard for others from mental power it so diverges that very few men have embodied both as nature has kindly provided for the happiness of the rest of us but captain lorraine while he watched that spaniard knew that he must be a man of mark though he little dreamed that his wild love claudia utterly scorned his own comely self in comparison with that ugly fellow but for the moment the sight of that brigand and slaughter of good english soldiers set hilary who with all his faults was vigorously patriotic against the whole race of spaniards male or female or whatever they might be moreover his long absence now from claudia and her neglect to write as she had promised to do to him as well as an anecdote which he had heard on good authority about her had combined to weaken the spell of her dazzling and impassioned beautya power which above all others must have its victim within reach and even as regarded mere personal charms the more he had to deal with the spanish race the more he acknowledged the truth of the words of his good uncle struan mabel at thirty would be in full beauty claudia would be rapidly falling into the sere and yellow leaf the more he thought of the matter the more his heart glowed back towards the one who loved him and cooled towards the selfish foreigner while he was in this state of mind a mounted orderly dashed up and placed a small parcel in his hand from home sir he said and saluted and dashed off hilary opened it and found a most lovely miniature of mabel there was the good bright clever face the calm clear forehead and the rich brown eyes the rosy lips ready for a charming smile the soft glossy hair in natural curls to fit caressing fingers above all there was what there never could be in the face of claudia the happy expression of lovingkindness faith and truth and constancy who sent that portrait was for years unknown to any one but the sender it proved in the end to be uncle struan hilary gazed at it most intently and for some moments sadly but the more he gazed the better and brighter became his own expression the goodness of his truelove seemed to breathe from her face into his and fill him with a likeness to her and chasten enlarge and ennoble him hesitation was thenceforth banished and being driven by nature as usual rather with a spur than bridle he made a strong dash at a desperate fence which for months had been puzzling him horses unluckily do not write although they talk and laugh and think and tell with their eyes a great deal more than most of us who ride them therefore this metaphor must be dropped for lorraine pulled out his roll of paper pen and ink which he was bound to carry and put up his knees all stiff and creaking and on that desk did what he ought to have done at least three months ago he wrote to his loving mabel surely better late than never my darling mabel i know that i have not behaved to you kindly or even as a gentleman although i was not allowed to write to you i ought to have written to your brother gregory long ago and i am ashamed of myself but i am much more ashamed of the reason and i will make no sham excuses it is difficult to say what i want to say but my only amends is to tell the whole truth and i hope that you will try to allow for me and the truth is this i fell in love not as i did with you my darling just because i loved you but becausewell i cannot tell why although i am trying for the very truth i cannot tell why i did it she saved my life and nursed me long she was not badlooking but young and brave i hope that it is all over now i trust in the lord that it is so i see that these spaniards are cruel people and i work night and day to forget them all when i get any sleep it is you that come and look upon me beautifully and when i kick up with those plaguesome insects the face that i see is a spanish one this alone shows where my heart is fixed but you have none of those things at old applewood and now i can say no more i write in the midst of roaring cannon and perhaps you will say when you see my words that i had better have died of my wounds than live to disgrace as i have done your hilary pstry to think the best of me darling if anybody needs it i do gregory wrote me such a letter that i am afraid to send you anyanythings chapter xlviii something worth kissing pessimists who love to dwell on the darker side of human nature and find or at any rate colour that perpetually changing object to the tone of their own dull thoughts making our whole world no better than the chameleon of themselves who trace every act and word and thought either to very mean selfishness or exceedingly grand destinyaccording to their own pet theorylet those gloomy spirits migrate in as cheerful a manner as they can manage to the back side of the moon the side that neither shines on earth nor gathers any earthshine but even if they will not thus oblige inferior mortals let them not come near a scene where true love dwells and simple faith and pleasant hours are spent in helping nature to be kind to us where the rich recesses of the bosomed earth brim over with variety where every step of man discloses some new goodness over him and every hour of the day shows different veins of happiness the light in sloping glances looking richer as the sun goes down and showing with a deeper love its own good works and parentage the children of the light presenting all their varied joy to it some revolving many bending all with one accord inclining softly sweetly and thankfullycan any man even of a churlish nature wander about at a time like this with the power of the sunset over him and walk down the alleys of trees and spend a leisure hour among them without admitting into his heart a calm unconscious kindliness if any man could be so ungrateful to the giver of all good things he was not to be found in the land of kent but must be sought in some northern county where they grow sour gooseberries master martin lovejoy had in the month of october as fine a crop of pears as ever made a fountain of a tree for the growers did not understand the pruning of trees as we do now they were a benighted lot altogether proceeding only by rule of thumb and the practice of their grandfathers never lopping the roots of a tree nor summer pinching nor wiring it nor dislocating its joints and yet they grew as good fruit as we do they had no right to do so but the thing is beyond denial therefore one might see a peartree rising in its natural form tall and straight and goodly hanging its taper branches like a chandelier with lustrous weight tier upon tier the rich fruit glistening with the ruddy sunstreaks or with russet veinage mellowing hard thereby the golden noble globular and stainless or the conical king pippin pencilled on its orange fulness with a crimson glow or the great bulk of dutch codlin oblong ribbed and overbearing here was the place and time for a man to sit in the midst of his garden and feel that the year was not gone in vain nor his date of life lessened fruitlessly and looking round with right good will thank the lord and remember his father in such goodly mood and tenor master martin lovejoy sat early of an october afternoon to smoke his pipe and enjoy himself he had finished his dinnera plain but good one his teeth were sound and digestion stanch he paid his tithes and went to church he had not an enemy in the world to the utmost of his knowledge and his name was good for a thousand pounds from canterbury to reigate his wheat had been fine and his hops pretty good his barley by no means below the mark the cherry and strawberry season fair and his apples and pears as you see them such a man would be guilty of a great mistake if he kept on the tramp perpetually fortune encouraged him to sit down and set an armchair and a cushion for him and mixed him a glass of schiedam and water with a slice of lemon and gave him a wife to ask how his feet were as well as a daughter to see to his slippers now you dont get on at all he said as he mixed mrs lovejoy the least little drop because of the wind going round to the north you are so abstemious my dear soul byandby you will pay out for it i must be a disciplinarian martin mrs lovejoy replied with a sad sweet smile how ever the ladies can manage to take beer wine gin bitters and brandy in the way they do all of an afternoon is beyond my comprehension they get used to it answered the grower calmly and their constitution requires it at the same time i am not saying mind you that some of them may not overdo it moderation is the golden rule but you carry it too far my dear better too little than too much said mrs lovejoy sententiously whatever i take i like just to know that there is something in it and no more no martin noif you please not more than the thickness of my thumbnail well now for what we were talking about we can never go on like this you know wife i will tell you what it ishere martin lovejoy tried to look both melancholy and stern but failed we do not use our duties right we do not work up in the position to which it has pleased god to call us we dont make our children see that they arebless my heart what is the word obligated is the word you mean obligated they all of them are no no bounden is the word i mean bounden says the catechism they are bounden to obey whether they like it or no and that is the words expression now is there one of them as does it i cant say there is his wife replied after thinking of all three of them martin no they do their best but you cant have them quite tied hand and foot and i doubt whether we should love them better if we had them always to order likely not i cannot tell they have given me no chance of trying they do what seems best in their own eyes and the fault of it lies with you mother do they ever do anything wrong martin lovejoy do they ever disgrace you anywhere do they ever go about and borrow money or trade on their name or anything surely you want to provoke me martin when you begin to revile my children well said the grower blowing smoke in the manner of a matrimonial man let us go to something else here is this affair of mabels now how do you mean to settle it i think you should rather tell me martin how you mean to settle it she might have been settled long ago in a good position and comfortable if my advice had been heeded but you are the most obstinate man in the world well well my dear i dont think that you should be hard upon any one in that respect you have set your heart upon one thing and i upon another and we have to deal with some one perhaps more obstinate than both of us she takes after her good mother there after her father more likely martin but she has given her promise and she will keep it and the time is very nearly up you know the battle of trafalgar yes the st of october seven years ago as i am a man lord bless me it seems but yesterday how all the country up and wept and how it sent our boy to sea there never can be such a thing again and no one would look at a drumhead savoy plague upon the market martin i do believe you think much more of your growings than your gainings but she fixed the day herself because it was a battle didnt she yes wife yes but after all i see not so much to come of it supposing she gets no letter by tomorrownight what comes of it why a very great deal you men never know she puts all her foolish ideas aside and she does her best to be sensible by the spread of my measure oh deary me i thought she was bound to much more than that she gives up him at any rate yes poor dear she gives him up and a precious cry she will make of it why martin when you and i were young we carried on so differently what use to talk about that said the grower they all must have their romances now like tapping a cask of beer it is you must let them spit out at the top a little all that of course needs no discussion i do not remember that in our lovetime you expected to see me spit out at the top you grow so coarse in your ideas martin the more you go growing the coarser you get now is there nothing to be said but that she gives him up and she tries to be sensible the malting season is on and how can elias come and do anything martin may i say one word you keep so perpetually talking that i scarcely have a chance to breathe we do not want that low jenkins here how many quarters he soaks in a week is nothing and cannot be anything to me a tanner is more to my taste a great deal if one must come down to the dressers and there one might get some good oxtails i believe that you want to sell your daughter to get your malt for nothing the growers indignation at this despicable charge was such that he rolled in his chair like a man in a boat and spread his sturdy legs and said nothing for fear of further mischief then he turned out his elbows in a manner of his own and mrs lovejoy saw that she had gone too far well well she resumed perhaps not quite that mr jenkins no doubt is very well in his way and he shall have fair play so far as i am concerned but mind dr calvert must have the same that was our bargain martin all the days of the week to be open to both and no difference in the dinner very well very well the franklin murmured being still a little wounded about the malt i am sure i put up with anything calvert may have her if he can cure her i cant bear to see the poor maid so pining it makes my heart ache many a time but i have more faith in barleycorn than jalap though i dont want neither of them for nothing we shall see my dear how she will come round the doctor prescribes carriage exercise for her well how is she to get it except in his carriage and she cannot well have his carriage i suppose before she marries him carriage exercise riding on wheels i suppose is what they mean by it if riding on wheels will do her any good she can have our yellow gig five times aweek and i want to go round the neighbourhood too theres some little bits of money owing me ill take her for a drive tomorrow your yellow gig to call that a carriage a rough sort of exercise i doubt why it jerks up like a jackinabox at every stone you come to if that is your idea of a carriage martin pray take us all out in the dungcart the old gig was good enough for my mother and why should my daughter be above it they doctors and women are turning her head worse than poor young lorraine did oh if i had elias to prune my treesafter all i have taught himand lorraine to get up in the van again i might keep out of the bankrupt court after all i do believe i might here the grower fetched a long sigh through his pipe he was going to be bankrupt every season but never achieved that glory im tired of that mrs lovejoy said you used to frighten me with it at first whenever there came any sort of weathera storm or a frost or too much sun or too much rain or too little of it the lord knows that if you have had any fruit you have got it out of him by grumbling and now you are longing in a heathenish manner to marry your daughter to two men at once one for the nightwork and one for the day now will you for once speak your mind out truly well wife there is no one that tries a man so badly as his own wife does i am pretty well known for speaking my mind too plainly more than too doubtfully i cant say the same to you as i should have to say to anybody else because you are my wife you see and have a good right to be down upon me and so i am forced to get away from things that ought to be argued but about my daughter i have a right to think my own opinion while i leave your own to you as a father has a right with a mother and all i say is commonsense our mabel belongs to a time of life when the girls are always dreaming and then you may say what you like to them mainly and it makes no difference now she looks very pale and she feels very queer all through that young sort of mischief but let her get a letter from master hilaryand you would see what would come over her i have got it i have got it cried a young voice as if in answer although too sudden of approach for that father here it is mother here it is long expected come at last there what do you think of that now her face was lit with a smile of delight and her eyes with tears of gladness as she stood between her astonished parents and waved in the air an open letter fluttering less though a breeze was blowing than her true heart fluttered then she pressed the paper to her lips and kissed it with a good smack every time and then she laid it against her bosom and bowed to her father and mother as much as to sayyou may think what you like of mei am not ashamed of it the grower pushed two grey curls aside and looked up with a grand amazement here was a girl who at dinnertime even would scarcely say more than yes or no who started when suddenly spoken to and was obliged to clear her mind to think who smiled now and then when a smile was expected and not because she had a smilein a word who had become a dull careless unnatural cloudy depressed and abominably inconsistent mabela cause of anxiety to her father and of recklessness to herselfwhen lo at a touch of the magic wand here she was as brave as ever the father and the mother also knew the old expression settled on the darling face again the many family modes of thinking and of looking and of loving and of feeling out for love which only a father and a mother dearly know in a dear childs face and then they looked at one another and in spite of all small variance the husband and the wife were one in the matter of rejoicing it was not according to their schemes and they both might still be obstinate but by a stroke their hearts were openedwise or foolish right or wrongwhat they might say outside reason they really could not stop to think they only saw that their sweet good child for many long months a stranger to them was come home to their hearts again and they could have no clearer proof than this she took up her fathers pipe and sniffed with a lofty contempt at the sealingwax which was of the very lowest order and then she snapped it off and scraped him with a tortoiseshell handled knife of her own a proper place to suck at and while she was doing that and most busy with one of her fingers to make a draught she turned to her mother with her other side as only a very quick girl could do and tucked up some hair which was slipping from the string with a palpable breach of the unities and gave her two tugs in the very right place to make her of the latest fashion and then let her know with lips alone what store she set on her opinion and the whole of this business was done in less time than two lovers would take for their kissing you have beaten me popsy said mrs lovejoy fetching up an old name of the days when she was nursing this one dash me cried the grower you shall marry old harry if you choose to set your heart on him chapter xlix a dangerous commission peradventure the eyes and the heart as well as the boundless charity of true love were needed to descry what mabel at a glance discovered the grand nobility of hilarys conduct and the pathetic beauty of his selfreproach perhaps at first sight the justice of the latter would be a more apparent thing but love when it deserves the name is a generous as well as a jealous power especially in the tender gush of renewal and reunion and lorraine meant every word as he wrote it and indeed for a good while afterwards so that heart took pen to heart which is sometimes better than the wings of speech giving comfort thus he also received the same from his own conscience and pure resolutions and he felt that his good angel was for the present at least come back to him how long she would stop was another question and he needed her now in matters even more stirring than the hottest loveaffairs for though he had no chance of coming to the front in any of the desperate assaults on the castle of burgos being far away then with despatches he was back with his chief when the retreat began a retreat which must have become a rout under any but the finest management for the british army was at its worst towards the month of november partly from intercourse with partidas partly perhaps from the joys of madrid but mainly no doubt from want of cash the britons were not as they had been even the officers dared to be most thoroughly disobedient and to follow the route which they thought best instead of that laid down for them but wellington put up with insolent ignorance as a weaker man could not have deigned to do he had to endure it from those above him and he knew how to bear it with all around him and yet to be the master his manifold dealings with everybody and everything at this time with nobody caring to understand him and his own people set against him with the whole world making little of him because he hated flashwork and perhaps his own mind in some doubt of its powers because they were not recognisedthese and the wearisome uphill struggle to be honest without any money were beginning to streak with grey the hair that had all the hard brain under it here again was a chance for hilary and without thinking he worked it well in his quick and perhaps too sudden way of taking impression of every one he had stamped on his mind the abiding image of his great commander the general knew this as all men feel the impression they are making as sharply almost as a butterstamp and of course he felt goodwill towards the youth who so looked up to him it was quite a new thing for this great captain after all his years of conquest to be accounted of any value because he was not a frenchman being however of rigid justice although he was no frenchman lord wellington did not lift captain lorraine over the heads of his compeers he only marked him in his own clear and most tenacious mind as one who might be trusted for a dashing job and deserved to have the chance of it and so they went into winter quarters on the douro and aguada after a great deal of fighting far in the rear of their storms and sieges and their many victories because the british government paid whole millions right and left to rogues and left its own army to live without money and to be hanged if it stole an onion and the only satisfaction our men hadand even in that they were generouswas to hear of the frenchmen in russia freezing as fast as could well be expected now while this return to the frontier and ebb of success created disgust in england and depression among our soldiers they also bore most disastrously on the fortunes of a certain gallant and very zealous staff officer for they brought him again into those soft meshes whence he had wellnigh made good his escape without any serious damage but now there was no such deliverance for him and this was a very hard case and he really did deserve some pity now for he did not return of his own accord and fall at the feet of the charmer but in the strictest course of duty became an unwilling victim and it happened altogether in this wise in the month of may when the british commander had all things ready for that glorious campaign which drove the french over the pyrenees and when the british army freshened strengthened and sternly redisciplined was eager to bound forwarda sudden and sad check arose by no means however a new form of hindrance but one only too familiar at all times and in all countriesthe sinews of war were not forthcoming the military chest was empty the pay of the british troops was far in arrear and so was their bountymoney but that they were pretty well used to by this time and grumble as they might they were ready to march not so however the portuguese who were now an important element and even the spanish regulars in andalusia would do nothing until they had handled dollars this need of money had been well foreseen by the ubiquitous mind of wellington but what he had not allowed for and what no one else would have taken into thought so soon after nelsons time was the sluggishness of the british navy whether it were the fault of our government or of our admiral on the station certain it is that the mouth of the tagus which was the mouth of the whole british army was stopped for days and even weeks together by a few american privateers and ships containing supplies for our army whether of food or clothing or the even more needful british gold if they escaped at all could do it only by running for the dangerous bar of the douro or for cadiz in this state of matters the generalissimo sent for captain lorraine one day and despatched him on special duty you know count zamora said lord wellington in his clear voice of precision and his castle in the sierra morena hilary bowed without a word knowing well what his chief was pleased with you also know the country well and the passes of the morena colonel langham has orders to furnish you with the five best horses at hand and the two most trusty men he knows of you will go direct to count zamoras house and deliver to him this letter he will tell you what next to do i believe that the ship containing the specie which will be under your charge was unable to make either lisbon or the port of cadiz and ran through the straits for malaga but the count will know better than i do remember that you are placed at his disposal in all except one pointand that is the money he will provide you with spanish escort and the spaniards are liable for the money through andalusia and the mountains until you cross the zujar where a detachment from general hill will meet you they begged me not to send british convoy beyond what might be needful to authorize the delivery to them because their own troops are in occupation never mind that be as wide awake as if every farthing was your own or rather was part of your honour i seldom place so young a man in a position of so much trust but the case is peculiar and i trust you there will be in english gold to take care of the spaniards will furnish the transport and count zamora will receive half of the specie on behalf of the junta of seville for the pay of the spanish forces and give you his receipt for it the remainder you will place under the care of general hills detachment and rejoin us as soon as possible i have no time more colonel langham will give you your passes and smaller directions but remember that you are in a place of trust unusual for so young an officer goodbye and keep a sharp lookout lord wellington gave his hand with a bow of the fine old type to hilary and he from his proper salute recovered and took it as one gentleman takes the courtesy of another but as he felt that firm and cool and muscular hand for a moment he knew that he was treated with extraordinary confidence and that his future as an officer and perhaps as a gentleman hung on the manner in which he should acquit himself of so rare a trust in the courtyard he found colonel langham who gave him some written instructions and his passes and credentials as well as a good deal of sound advice which the general had no time to give and in another hour hilary lorraine was riding away in the highest spirits thinking of mabel and of all his luck and little dreaming that he was galloping into the ditch of his fortunes behind him rode two welltried troopers as thoroughly trained to their work as the best hereditary butler gamekeeper or even pointer there could be found no steadier men in all the world of steadiness one was sergeantmajor bones and the other was corporal nickles each of them led a spare horse by the soft brown twist of willowbark steeped in tan and fishoil so as to make a horse think much of it and thus they rode through the brilliant night upon a fine old roman road with beautiful change and lovely air and nobody to challenge them for the french army lay to the east and north the portuguese were far in their rear and the spanish forces away to the south except a few guerillas who could take nothing by meddling with them but the next day was hot and the road grew rough and their horses fell weary and haste as they might they did not arrive at monte argento till after sunset of the second day the count of zamora felt some affection as well as much gratitude towards lorraine and showed it through the lofty courtesy with which he received him and hilary on his part could not help admiring the valour and patriotism and almost poetic dignity of this chieftain of a time gone by for being of a simple mind and highly valuing eloquence the count nearly always began with a flourish as to what he might have done for the liberation of his country if he had been younger having exhausted this reflection he was wont to proceed at leisure to the military virtues of his sons then if anybody showed impatience he always stopped with a lofty bow otherwise on he went and the further he went the more he enjoyed himself hilary a very polite young man and really a kindhearted one had grown into the counts good gracessetting aside all gratitudeby truly believing all his exploits and those of his fathers and grandfathers and best of all those of his two sonsand never so much as yawning you are at my orders said the count with a dry smile on his fine old face it is well my son it is glorious our great commander has so commanded my first order is that you come to the supper and rest and wear slippers for the three days to follow shall i take those instructions in writing asked hilary and under the seal of the junta the junta is an old woman said his host she chatters and she scolds and she locks up the money but enter my son enter i pray you you are at the very right moment arrivedas is your habit or i should not be here we have a young boar of the first nobility and truffles are in him from the banks which you know you shall carve him for us you are so strong and you englishmen so understand sharp steel my sons are still at the war but my daughtershow will they be pleased to see you at the smell of the innocent young roasterfor such he was in veritylight curtains rose and light figures entered for all spanish ladies know well what is good camilla and claudia greeted hilary as if they had been with him all the morning and turned their whole minds to the table at once and hilary thoroughly knowing their manners only said to himself how well they looked in this he was right the delicate grace and soft charm of camilla set off the more brilliant and defiant beauty of young claudia neither of them seemed to care in the least what anybody thought of her or whether any thought at all occurred to anybody upon a subject so indifferent distant and purely abstract captain lorraine was no more to them than a friar or pilgrim or hermit they were very much obliged to him for cutting up the pig and they showed that they thought it a good pig now as it happened these were not the tactics fitted for the moment in an ordinary mood lorraine might have fallen to these fair parthians but knowing what danger he was running intowithout any chance of avoiding ithe had made up his mind all along the road to be severely critical mabels true affection as shown by a letter in answer to his had moved him she had not hinted at any rival or lapse of love on his part but had told with all her dear warm heart the pleasure the pride and the love she felt hilary had this letter in his pocket and it made him inclined to be critical now it may without any lesemajesty of the grand female race be asserted that good and kind and beautiful and purely superior as they are they are therewith so magnanimous to men that they abstain for the most part from exhibiting too much cruel perfection no specimen of them seems ever to occur that is entirely blameless if submitted to rigid criticism which of course they would never submit to therefore it was wrong of hilary and showed him in a despicable light that because the young ladies would not look at him much he looked at them with judicial eyes and the result of his observation over the backbone of the pig was this in physiquea word which ought to be worse than physic to an englishmanthere was no fault of any sort to be found with either of these young ladies they were noble examples of the best spanish type tall and pure yet rich of tint with most bewitching eyes and classic flexure of luxuriant hair grace in every turn and gesture and melody in every tone yet even in the most expressive glance and most enchanting smile was there any of that simple goodness loyalty and comfort which were to be found in an equally lovely but less superb young woman herewith the young captain began to think of his uncle struans advice and even his sisters words on the matter which from so haughty a girlas he called her although he knew that she was not thathad caused him at first no small surprise and at the same time produced no small effect and the end of it was that he gave a little squeeze to mabels portrait and loving letter and said to himself that one english girl was worth a dozen spanish ones on the following day the fair young donnas changed their mode of action they vied with each other in attention to hilary led him through the wellknown places chattered spanish most musically and sang melting lovesongs lavished smiles and glances on him and nothing was too good for him he was greatly delighted of course and was bound in gratitude to flirt a little but still on the whole he behaved very well for instance he gave no invidious preference to either of his lovely charmers but paid as much heed to poor camilla whose heart was bounding with love and happiness as he did to claudia who began to be in earnest now that her sister might not conquer him this was a dangerous turn of events for hilary and it was lucky for him that he was promptly called away for his host got despatches which compelled him to cut short hospitality and captain lorraine with great relief set forth the next morning for malaga sergeant bones and corporal nickles had carried on handsomely downstairs and were most loth to come away but duty is always the guidingstar of the noble british corporal nickles and bones at the call of their country cast off all domestic ties and buckled up their bellybands merrily thus they all rode on for their horses were fresh and frolicsome to the spanish headquarters near cordova and forward thence to malaga chapter l sterling and striking affection at this particular time there was nothing so thoroughly appreciated loved admired and begged borrowed or stolen in every corner of the continent as the good old english guinea his fine old face and his jovial colour made him welcome everywhere one look at him was enough to show his purity substance and sterling virtue and prove him sure to outlast in the end the flashy and upstart napoleon happily for the world that poor weakcoloured and adulterated coin now called the sovereign was not the representative of english worth at that time otherwise europe might have been either france or russia for a century and though we are now in the mire so lowthrough timeservers hucksters and demagoguesthat the voice of england is become no more than the squeak of a halfpenny shoeblack we might be glad to think of all our fathers did at our expense so grandly and heroically if nations trampled on for years and but for england swept away would only take it as not a mortal injury that through us they live at any rate many noble spaniards in and round about malaga condescended to come and see the unloading of the british corvette cleopatracumantonio she was the nimblest little craft either on or off a wind of all ever captured from the french and her name had been reefed into clipater first and then into clipper which still holds way and thus in spite of all her money she had run the gauntlet of americans and frenchmen and lay on her keel discharging lorraine regarded this process with his usual keen interest the scene was so new and the people so strange and their views of the world so original that he could not have tried to step into anything nobler and more refreshing there was no such babel of gesticulation as in a french harbour must have been but there was plenty of little sideplay in and out among the natives such as a visitor loves to watch and the dignity with which the spaniards took the money into their charge was truly gratifying to the british mind they might have said thank you at any rate thought hilary signing the bill of delivery under three or four spanish signatures but that was no concern of his one hundred thousand british guineas even when they are given away are not to be made light of their weight without heeding the iron chests wherein they were packed in threadneedle street perhaps was not very much under a ton and with the chests must have been nearly two tons there were ten chests thoroughly secured and sealed each containing ten thousand guineas and weighing about cwt all these were delivered by the english agent to the deputy of count zamora who was accompanied by two members of the junta of seville and the alcaide of cordova and these great people after no small parley and with the aid of spanish officers packed all the consignment into four mulecarts and sent them under strong escort to headquarters near cordova here the count met them and gave a receipt to hilary for the spanish subsidy which very soon went the way of all money among the spanish soldiers and the next day the five less lucky mules who were dragging the pay of the british army went on with the five remaining cheststhree in one cart and two in the otherstill under spanish escort towards the slopes of the sierra morena hilary as usual adapted himself to the tone and the humour around him the spanish officers took to him kindly and so did the soldiers and even the mules he was in great spirits once more and kindly and cordially satisfied with himself his conscience had pricked him for many months concerning that affair with claudia but now it praised him for behaving well and returning to due allegiance he still had some little misgiving about his vows to the spanish maiden but really he did not believe that she would desire to enforce them he was almost sure in his heart that the lovely young donna did not care for him but had only been carried away for the moment by her own warmth and his stupid fervour tush he now found himself a little too wide awake and experienced in the ways of women to be led astray by any of them claudia was a most beautiful girl most fascinating and seductive but now if he only kept out of her way as he meant most religiously to do the brave and renowned young captain said the count of zamora riding up in the fork of the valley where the mountainroad divided and one branch led to his house will not of course disdain our humble hospitality for the night i fear that it cannot be dear senhor answered lorraine with a lift of his hat in the spanish manner which he had caught to perfection my orders are to make all speed with the treasure until i meet our detachment we are responsible for the treasure the count replied with a smile of goodhumour and the slightest touch of haughtiness until you have crossed the river upon the other side of our mountains senhor is not that enough we have travelled far and the mules are weary even if the young captain prefers to bivouac in the open air it is a proverb that the noble english think more of their beasts than of themselves and behold even now the sun is low and there are clouds impending the escort is under my orders as yet if you refuse i must exercise the authority of the junta what could hilary do but yield he was ordered to be at the counts disposal and thus the count disposed of him nevertheless he stipulated that the convoy should pursue its course as soon as the moon had risen for the night is better than the day for travelling in this prime of the southern year so the carts were brought into a walled quadrangle of the monte argento and heavy gates were barred upon them while the mules came out of harness and stood happily round a heap of rye the spanish officers still in charge were ready to be most convivial and hilary fell into their mood with native compliance well cultivated in a word they all enjoyed themselves one alone the star of all the radiant brilliant lustrous one the admired of all admirers that young claudia was sorrowful hilary in the gush of youthful spirits and promotion in the glow of duty done and lofty standard satisfied through all the pride of money paid by the nation he belonged to and even the glory of saying good things in a language slightly known to himhilary caught from time to time those grand reproachful eyes and felt that they quite spoiled his dinner and he was not even to get off like this for when he was going in the calmest manner to order forth his carts and march with the full moon risen among the hillsthe daintiest little note ever seen came into his hand as softly as if it were dropped by a dove too young to coo he knew that it came from a lady of course and in the romantic place and time his quick heart beat more quickly the writing was too fine for even his keen eyes by moonlight but he managed to get to a quiet lamp and there he read as follows you have forgotten your vows to me i must have an explanation there is no chance of it in this house my nurse has a daughter at the bridge of echoes you know it and you will have to cross it within a league of your journey if i can escape i shall be on that bridge in two hours time you will wait for me there if you are an english gentleman this letter was unsigned but of course it could only come from claudia of all those conceited young spanish officers who had been contradicting lorraine and even daring to argue with him was there one who would not have given his right hand his gilt spurs or even his beard to receive such a letter and such an appointment from the daughter of the count of zamora hilary fancied as he said farewell in the cumbrous mass of shadows and the foliage of the moonlight that donna camilla who came forth with a white mantilla fluttering made signs as if she longed with all her heart to speak to him but the count stood by and the guests of the evening and two or three muledrivers cracking whips and hilarys horse turned on his tail till the company kissed their hands to him and thus he began to descend through trees and rocks and freaks of shadowland enjoying the freshness of summer night and the tranquil beauty of moonlit hills nickles and bones the two english troopers rode a little in advance of him each of them leading a spare horse and keeping his eyes fixed stubbornly on the treasurecarts still in the custody of the spanish horsemen for the englishmen had but little faith in the honesty of them palavering dons and regarded it as an affront and a folly that the treasure should be in their charge at all in this order they came to the river zujar quite a small stream here at the foot of the mountains and forming the boundary of the counts estates according to the compact with the spaniards and advices that day received the convoy was here to be met by a squadron of horse from hills division who at once would assume the charge of it and be guided as to their line of return by captain lorraines suggestions at the ford however there was no sign of any british detachment and the trumpeters sounded a flourish in vain hilary felt rather puzzled by this but his own duty could not be in doubt he must on no account allow the treasurecarts to pass the ford and so quit spanish custody until placed distinctly under british protection and this he said clearly to the spanish colonel who quite agreed with him on that point and promised to halt until he got word from lorraine to move into the water then bones and nickles were despatched to meet and hurry the expected squadron for the spanish troopers were growing impatient and their discipline was but fortuitous under these circumstances young lorraine was sure that he might without any neglect spare just a few minutes to do his duty elsewhere as a gentleman he felt that he might have appeared perhaps to play fast and loose with claudia although in his heart he was pretty certain that she was doing that same with him and now he intended to tell her the truth and beg to be quit of a vow whose recall was more likely to gall than to grieve her the bridge of echoes was about a furlong above the ford where the convoy halted it was an exceedingly ancient bridge supposed to be even of gothic date and patched with moorish workmanship it stood like a packsaddle over the torrent which roared from the mountains under it and it must have been of importance once as commanding approach to the passes for besides two deep embrasures wherein defenders might take shelter it had at the south or morena end a heavy fortalice beetling over with a dangerous portcullis and the whole of it now was in bad repair so that every flood or tempest worked it away at the top or bottom and capable as it was of light carts or of heavy people the officers were quite right in choosing to send the treasure by the ford below hilary proved that his sword was free to leap at a touch from its scabbard ere ever he set foot on that timeworn shadowy venerable and cutthroat bridge the precaution perhaps was a wise one but it certainly did not at first sight exhibit any proof of true loves confidence in the maiden he was come to meet it showed the difference between a wise love and a wild one and hilary smiled as he asked himself whether he need have touched his sword in coming to meet mabel then half ashamed of himself for such very low mistrust of claudia he boldly walked through the crumbling gateway and up the steep rise of the bridge on the peaked crown of the old arch he stood and looked both up and down the river towards the mountains there was nothing but loneliness and rugged shadow scarred with clefts of moonlight and at further distance fringed with mist and down the water and the quiet sloping of the lowlands everything was feeding on the comfort of the summer night the broad delicious calm of lying under natures womanhood when the rage of the masculine sun is gone and fair hesitation comes after it hilary looked at all these things but did not truly see them he took a general idea that the view was beautiful and he might have been glad at another time to stand and think about it for the present however his time was short and he must make the most of it the british detachment might appear at the ford at any moment and his duty would be to haste thither at once and see to the transfer of convoy and to make sure of this he had begged that the spanish trumpets might be sounded while he kept his own horse waiting for him and grazing kindly where the grass was cold the shadow of the old keep and the ivymantled buttress fell along the roadway of the bridge and lay in scollops there beyond it every stone was clear of facing or of parapet and the age of each could be guessed almost and its story and its character even a beetle or an earwig must have had his doings traced if an enemy were after him but under the eaves of the lamp of night and within all the marge of the glittering there lay such darkness as never lies in the world where the noon is less brilliant hilary stood in the broad light waiting and out of the shadow came claudia i doubted whether you would even do me the honour to meet me here she said oh hilary how you are changed to me i have changed in no way senhorita except that i know when i am loved and you do not knowthen you do not knowit does not become me to say it perhaps your ways are so different from ours that you would despise me if i told it all i will not weep no i will not weep with violent selfcontrol she raised her magnificent eyes to prove her words but the effort was too much for her the great tears came and glistened in the brilliance of the moonlight but she would not show them only turned away and wished that nobody in the world should know the power of her emotions come come said hilary for an englishman always says come come when he is taken aback you cannot mean half of this of course come claudia what can have made you take such a turn you never used to do it ah i may have been fickle in the days gone by but absenceabsence is the power that proves hark i hear a sound down the river horses feet and wheels and clashing no it is only the dashing of the water i know it well that is why this bridge is called the bridge of echoes the water makes all sorts of sounds look here and i will show you she took his hand as she spoke and led him away from the parapet facing the ford to the one on the upper side of the bridge when suddenly such a faintness seized her that she was obliged to cling to him as she hung over the low and crumbling wall and how lovely she looked in the moonlight so pale and pure and perfect and at the same time so intensely feminine and helpless let me fall she murmured what does it matter with no one in the world to care for me hilary let me fall i implore you that would be nice gratitude to the one who nursed me and saved my life senhorita sit down i pray you allow me to hold you you are in great danger oh no oh no she answered faintly as he was obliged to support her exquisite but alas too sensitive figure oh i must not be embraced oh hilary how can you do such a thing to me how can i help such a thing you mean how beautiful you are claudia what is the use of it alas what is the use of it if i am when the only one in all the world ah there i heard that noise again it is impossible that it can be the waterand i see horses and the flash of arms oh do not leave me i shall fall into the torrent for the sake of all the saints stay one moment how can i be found here what infamyat least at least swear one thing anythinganything but i must be gone i may be ruined in a moment and so may i in the name of the saviour swear not to tell that i met you here my father would kill me you cannot even dream i swear that no power on earth shall make me say a word about you oh i faint i faint lay me there in the shadow no one will see me it is the last time o how cruel how cold how false how bitterly cruel you are to me is it true in a breath he whisperedfor now he was in great stir and hurry and heard the spanish trumpets sound as he carried her towards the shadow of the keep and there for an instant leaned over her is it true that you love me claudia with my wholeoh what do i say and as if she could not trust the echoes she glanced at the corner timidly oh do not go for one moment darlingwith every atom of my poor heart she was going to say no doubt but was spared the trouble for down fell hilary stunned by a crashing blow from that dark corner and in a moment alcides dalcar had him by the throat with gigantic hands and planted one great knee on his breast did i do it well asked claudia recovering bright activity oh dont let him see me he never must know it neither that nor anything else shall he know the brigand muttered with a furious grasp until poor hilarys blue eyes started forth their sockets you did it too well my fair actress so warmly indeed that i am quite jealous the bottom of the zujar is his marriagecouch loosen his throat or i scream for his comrades you promised me not to hurt him he shall not be hurt more than we can help although he has been so faithless to me ha ha laughed the great brigand there is no understanding the delicate views of the females but you shall be obeyed beloved one he will come to himself in about ten minutes these englishmen have such a thickness of head search him be quick let me have his despatchbook you know where your lovers keep their things senseless though hilary lay the fair maiden kept herself out of the range of his eyes as her nimble fingers probed him in a moment she drew from an inner breastpocket his private despatchbook and mabels letter and portrait those last she stowed away for her own revenge after glancing with great contempt at them but the book she spread open to her lover it is noble he cried as the brilliant moonlight shone upon the pages what could be more fortunate here are the blank forms with the heading and the flourish prepared for his signature there is his metal pencil now write as i tell you in spanish but with one or two little barbarisms such as you know him given to the detachment is here i am holding them back they are not to cross the water send the two carts through but do not come yourselves goodnight and many thanks to you may we soon meet again signed hilary lorraine you know how very polite he is it is written and in his own hand most clearly he has been my pupil and i have been his poor youth i am very sorry for him now let me go have i contented you i will tell you at the chapel tomorrow night i shall have the cleverest and most beautiful bride in all iberia how can i part with you till then you will promise me not to hurt him she whispered through his beard as he clasped her warmly while hilary lay at their feet still senseless by all the saints that ever were or will be multiplied into all the angels one kiss more and then adieu if it must be the active young claudia glided away while the great brigand proceeded with his usual composure to arrange things to his liking he lifted poor hilary as if he were a doll and bound him completely with broad leather straps which he buckled to their very tightest and then he fixed over his mouth a scarf of the delicate wool of the mountains and then he laid him in the shade for he really was a most honourable man when honour came into bearing and though as far as his own feelings went he would gladly have pitched this captain lorraine into the rush of the zujar he had pledged his honour to claudia therefore he only gagged and bound him and laid him out of the moonlight which at the time of year might have maddened him after this don alcides dalcar struck flint upon punk and lit a long cigar the whole of that country is full of fleas the natives may say what they like but they only damage their credit by denying it or prove to a charitable mind their own insensibility the older the deposit or the stratum is the greater is the number of these active insects and this old bridge whether moorish or gothic or even roman as some contended had an antiquarian stock of them therefore poor hilary coming to himselfas he was bound to do byandbygrew very uneasy but obtained no relief through the natural solace of scratching he was strapped so tightly that he could only roll and if he should be induced to roll a little injudiciously through a gap of the parapet he must go to the bottom of the lashing water considering these things he lay and listened and though he heard many things which he disliked and which bore a ruinous meaning to him for the rest of his young life and all who loved him he called his high courage to his help and being unable to talk to himself from the thickness of the wool between his teeth which was a most dreadful denial to him he thought in his inner partsnow if i die there will be no harm to say of me he laid this to his conscience and in contempt of all insects rolled off to sleep the uncontrollable outbreak of day in the land where the sun is paramount came like a cataract over the mountains and scattered all darkness with leaps of light the winding valley and the wooded slope the white track of water and the sombre cliffs all sprang out of their vaporous mantle and even the bridge of echoes looked a cheerful place to lounge on a bad job surely said corporal nickles marching with his footsteps counted as if he were a pedometer bones us havent searched this here ramshackle thing of a spanish bridge wherever young capen can be the lord knows at the bottom of the river i dessay better if he never was born replied bones or leastwise now to be a dead one fifty thousand guineas in a sweep all cometh of trusting them beggarly dons corporal what did i say to you like a horacle you had foreseen it sergeant but wem all right howsomever it be in our favour we has the hallerby hilary waking heard all this and he managed to sputter so through the wool that the faithful noncommissioned officers ran to look for a wild sheep coughing is it all gone he asked pretty calmly when they had cut him free at last but he could not stand from stiffness do you mean to say that the whole is gone captain said bones with a solemn salute which nickles repeated as junior every guinea are gone as clean as a whistle and the lord knows where em be gone to yes your honour every blessed guinea said nickles in confirmation to my mind it goes against the will of the lord to have such a damned lot of money you are a philosopher answered lorraine it is pleasing to find such a view of the case but as for me i am a ruined man no captain nor even your honour any more your honour must keep your spirits up it maynt be so bad as your honour thinks they answered very kindly well knowing that he was a ruined man but saluting him all the more for it chapter li empty lockers it may perhaps be said without any painful exaggeration that throughout the whole course of this grand war struggle of great captains and heroic business everywhere few things made a deeper sadder and more sinister impression than the sudden disappearance of those fifty thousand guineas on the other hand it must not be supposed that the disappearance of guineas was rare far otherwiseas many people still alive can testify and some of them perhaps with gratitude for their reappearance in the right quarter but these particular fifty thousand were looked out for in so many places and had so long been the subject of hope as a really solid instalment of a shilling in the pound for heroes that the most philosophical of these latter were inclined to use a short strong word of distinctive nationality poor hilary felt that for this bad verb his own name must be the receptive case and he vainly looked about for any remedy or rescue stiff as he was in the limbs by reason of the straps of don alcides and giddy of head from the staff of that most patriotic spaniard he found it for some time a little hard to reflect as calmly as he should have done indeed it was as much as he could do to mount his horsewho unlike his master had stuck to his post very steadfastlyand with sadness alike with soul and body to ride down to the fatal ford sergeantmajor bones and corporal nickles also remounted and followed the bewildered captain keeping behind him at a proper distance for quiet interchange of opinion corporal now said the sergeantmajor sliding his voice from behind one hand what may be your sentiments as consarns this very pecooliar and most misfortunate haxident sergeant it would be misbehooving replied nickles who was a westcountry man as well as an onceremonious thing for me to spake first in the matter to you it belongeth being the one as foretold it like a book likewise senior hofficer corporal you are a credit to the army your discretion at your age is wonderful there be so few young men as remember when a man has spoken right i am the last man in the world to desire to be overpraised or to take to myself any sense of it and now i wants no credit for it to me it seems to come natteral to discern things in a sort of way that i find in nobody else amost you doos you doos answered corporal nickles manys the time as ive said to myselfwhur can i goo to find sergeantmajor in this here trick of the henemy and now sergeant what do ee think of this no fear to tell truth in spaking long of me corporal i have been thinking strongly ever since us untied him and i have been brought up in the world so much that i means to think again of it why sergeant you never means to say nickles i means just what i means i may be right and yet again i may be altogether wrong as is the way of every man let me alone is all i say but if i was sure as you could hold your tongue i might have something to say to you not of any account you know but still something now sergeant after all the thumps us has seen and been through together you never would behave onhandsome to me corporal nickles if you put it upon that footing i cannot deny you and mind you now my opinion is that this is a very queer case indeed now now to think of that why sergeant you ought to be a general nickles no flattery i am above it not but what i might have done so well as other people if the will of the lord had been so consarning however of this todo and a precious rumpus it will be my opinion is that we dont know half speaking thus the sergeant nodded to the corporal impressively and jerked his thumb towards the captain in front and winked and then began again you see corporal my place is to keep both eyes wide open there was a many things as struck me up at the old dons yonder a carrying on in corners and a going to lamps to read things and a winking out of young ladies eyes to my mind most unmilitary but i might a thought that was all young people and a handsome young chap going on as they will only for what one of they dirty devils as drives them mules have said to me no now sergeant never now as true as i sit this here hoss when us come back with the sun getting up what did that pagan say to me you seed him corporal arunning up and you might have saved me the trouble only you was nodding forward senhor captain he said to me and the whites of his eyes was full of truth the young cavalier has been too soft that was how i made out his country gibberish the stuff they poor beggars are born to it gooeth again the grain of my skin corporal nickles answered to harken them fellows chattering but sergeant what did he say next well they may chatter or hold their tongues to them as cannot understand them requireth a gift which is a denial to most folk to understand them and what he said corporal nickles was thisthat he was coming up the river while the carts was waiting and afore the robbery mind you and he seed a young woman come on to the bridgeyou knows how they goes corporal when they expects you to look after them sergeant i should think so well she come on the bridge for all the world like that us have seen it fifty times and she had a white handkercher on her head or an ishmaelitish mantle and she were looking out for some young chap and our young capen come after her and who do you think she were why one of the daughters of the old don up yonner good heart alaive now sergeant bones i cant amost belave it nickles i tell you what was told meword for word and i say no more but knowing what the ways of the women is as us dragoons is so forced to do even after a marriage and family ah sergeant sergeant we tries in vain to keep inside the strick line of dooty i does whatever a man can do and my father were a butcher corporal it is one of the trials which the lord has ordered they do look up at one so and they puts the middle of their lips up and then with their bodies they turns away as if there was nothing to look at but nickles they gives you no sort of a chance to come to the bottom of them and this is what young capen will find out the good females always is found out at last the same as my poor wife was but here us are we have relaxed the bonds of discipline with conversation corporal eyes right and wait orders while these two trusty and veteran fellows had been discussing a subject far too deep for a whole brigade of them and still were full of tender recollections dashed with good escape poor hilary had been vainly spurring here and there and all about himself not come to his clear mind yet only hoping to know where the money was gone hope however upon that point was disappointed as usual the track of the heavy carts was clear in the gravel of the river and up the rocky bank and on the old roman road towards merida and then at the distance of about a furlong from the zujar the rut of the wooden wheels turned sharply into an elbow of a mountainroad here on the hump of a difficult rise were marks as if many kicks and pricks and even stabs had been ministered to good mules labouring heavily there was blood on the road and the blue shine of friction where hard rock encountered hard iron and the scraping of holes in gravelly spots and the nicks of big stones laid behind wheels to ease the tugging and afford the short relief of panting these traces were plain and becoming plainer as the road grew worse for nearly a mile of the mountainside and then the track turned suddenly into a thicket of dark ilex where out of british sight and ken the spoil had been divided the treasurecarts had been upset and two of the sturdy mules at last foundered with hard labour lay in their blood contented that their work was over and that man a greater brute than themselves had taken all he wanted out of them the rest had been driven or ridden on being useful for further torment and here on the ground were five stout coffers of good british iron but alas the good british gold was flown at this sight hilary stared a little and the five chests in the morning sun glanced back at him with such a ludicrously sad expression of emptiness that in spite of all his trouble the poor young captain broke into a hearty laugh then his horse walked up and sniffed at them being reminded perhaps of his manger and hilary dismounting found a solitary guinea lying in the dust the last of fifty thousand the trail of coarse esparto bags into which the gold had been poured from the coffers for the sake of easier transport was very distinct in the parts untrampled by horses mules or brigands but of all the marks there was none more conspicuous than the impressions of some mans boots larger and heavier than the rest and appearing over and over again here there and everywhere for a few yards up the rugged mountain these and other footprints might be traced without much trouble till suddenly they dispersed grew fainter and then wholly disappeared in trackless hopeless and to a stranger impenetrable forest thou honest guinea that would not be stolen cried poor lorraine as he returned and picked up the one remaining coin haply i shall never own another honest guinea fortynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine prefer the ownership of rogues last of guineas we will not part till gold outlives humanity now sir is there anything us can do cried bones and nickles or one of them we has followed all the way up this here long hill for want of better orders no my good fellows there is nothing to be done we cannot follow any further i must go with all speed to report myself follow me if you can keep up the sergeant nodded to the corporalfor loyal and steadfast as they were suspicion was at work with them that ugly worm which once set going wriggles into the stoutest heart surely it was a queer thing of the captain not even to let them examine the spot but order was order and without a word they followed the young officer back to the high road and then for some hours in the heat of the day on the way towards estremadura at noontide they came to a bright broad stream known to them as the guadalmez a confluent of the guadiana and here they were challenged to their great surprise by a strong detachment of british hussars what is your duty here asked lorraine as his uniform and face were acknowledged and saluted by sentries posted across the ford to receive cried an officer riding through the river for all of these people were wide awake captain lorraine and his spanish convoy i have no convoy said hilary dropping his voice into very sad music all is lost it is partly your fault you were ordered to meet me at the zujar ford this is the zujar ford the cavalry major answered sternly and hilarys heart fell from its last hope of recovering anything we have been here these three days waiting for you continued the major with vehemence we have lost all our chance of a glorious brush we sent you advice that we were waiting for you and now you appear without your convoy captain lorraine what does all this mean major my explanation is due at headquarters rather than to you and a deuced hard job youll have to give it or my names not mrustie the senior officer muttered with more terseness and truth than courtesy im blessed if id stand in your shoes before old beaky for a trifle poor hilary tried in vain to look as if he took it lightly even his bright and buoyant nature could not lift head against the sea of troubles all in front of him i have done no harm he kept saying to himself when after the few words that duty demanded he urged his stout horse forward and the faithful sergeant and corporal who had shunned all inquisitive hussars spurred vigorously after him feeling themselves as a briton loves to feel himself pregnant with mighty evidence what harm have i done asked hilary i saw to everything i worked hard i never quitted my post except through duty towards a lady any gentleman must have done what i did to be an officer is an accident to be a gentleman is a necessity have you felt altogether said conscience to him the necessity of that necessity have you found it impossible to depart from a gentlemans first dutygood faith to those who trust in him when you found yourself bewitched with a foreign lady did you even let your first love know it for months you have been playing fast and loose not caring what misery you caused and now you are fast in the trap of your looseness whatever happens serves you right whatever happens serves me right cried hilary lorraine aloud as he lifted his sword just a little way forth for the last time to admire it and into the sheath dropped a quick hot tear i have done my duty as an officer badly and as a gentleman far worse but mabel if you could see me now i think that you would forgive me he felt his heart grow warm again with the thought of his own mabel and in the courage of that thought he stood before lord wellington chapter lii be no more officer of mine the hero of a hundred fights otherwise called old beaky had just scraped through a choking trouble on the score of money with the grasping portuguese regency and now in the year he was busier than even he had ever found himself before he had to combine in most delicate manner and with exquisite nicety of time the movements of columns whose number scarcely even to himself was clear for the force of rivers unusually strong and the doubt of bridges successively broken and the hardship of the tras os montes and the scattering of soldiers who for want of money had to subsist themselveswhich means to hunt far afield after cows sheep and hensalso the shifty and unpronounced tactics of the enemy and a great many other disturbing elements enough to make calculation seasicka senior wrangler or even herr steinitz the wellington of the chessboard each in his province might go astray and trust at last to luck itself to cut the tangled knot for him it was a very grand movement and triumphantly successful opening up as fine a march as can be found in history sweeping onward in victory and closing with conquest of the frenchmen in their own france and nothing left to stop the advance on paris was all this luck or was it skill the historian asks in wonder and the answer perhaps may be found in the proverbluck has a mothers love for skill be that as it may it is quite certain that hilary though he had shown no skill had some little luck in the present case for the commanderinchief was a great deal too busy and had all his officers too hard at work to order without fatal loss of time a general courtmartial now moreover he had his own reasons for keeping the matter as quiet as possible for at least another fortnight every soldier by that time would be in march and unable to turn his back on brown bess whereas now there were some who might lawfully cast away the knapsack if they knew that their bounty was again no better than a cloudy hope and again there were some ugly pothooks of english questions to be dealt with all these things passed through the rapid mind of the general as he reined his horse and listened calmly to poor lorraines overtrue report and then he fixed his keen grey eyes upon hilary and said shortly what were you doing upon that bridge that is a question replied lorraine while marvelling at his own audacity which i am pledged by my honour as a gentleman not to answer by your duty as an officer in a place of special trust you are bound to answer it general i cannot my lord as i rather must call you now i wish i could answer but i cannot you have no suspicion who it was that stole the money with so much care i have a suspicion but nothing more and it makes me feel treacherous to suspect it never mind that we have rogues to deal with what is your suspicion my lord i am sorry to say that again i cannot in honour answer you captain lorraine i have no time to spare lord wellington had been more than once interrupted by despatches once and for all do you mean to give any or no explanation of your conduct in losing general all my life and the honour of my family depend upon what i do now then go and seek advice lorraine the general answered kindly for his heart was kind and he had taken a liking for this young fellow and knew a little of his family i have no one to go to for advice my lord what is your advice to me with these words hilary looked so wretched and yet so proud from his wellbred face and beautifullyshaped blue eyes that his general stopped from his hurry to pity him and then he looked gently at the poor young fellow this is the most irregular state of things i have ever had to deal with you have lost a months pay of our army and enough to last them half a year and you seem to think that you have done great things and refuse all explanation is there any chance of recovering the money there might be my lord if we were not likely to advance too rapidly there might be if we threw away our campaign you have two courses before you at least if i choose to offer them will you take my advice if i offer the choice i am only too glad to have any choice and anything chosen for me by you then this is just how you stand lorraineif we allow the alternative you may demand a courtmartial or you may resign your commission on the other hand as you know a courtmartial should at once be held upon you what answer are you prepared to make when asked why you left your convoy i should be more stubborn to them than even your lordship has let me be to you then captain lorraine resign your commission with my approval it can be done resign my commission lorraine exclaimed reeling as if he had received a shot and catching at the mane of the generals horse without knowing what he was doing oh no i never could do that very well i have given you my advice you prefer your own decision and i have other things to attend to captain money will receive your sword you are under arrest till we can form a court my lord it would break my fathers heart if he were to hear of such a thing i suppose i had better resign my commission if i may put that in writing and send it to me i will forward it to the horse guards with a memorandum from myself i am sorry to lose you captain lorraine you might have done well if you had only proved as sensible as you are active and gallant but one word morewhat made you stop short at the ford of a little mountainstream i chose you as knowing the country well you must have known that the zujar ford was twenty miles further on your road i know all that country too well my lord we halted at the real zujar ford general hills detachment stopped at the ford of the guadalmez that is wrongly called the zujar there the zujar has taken a great sweep to the east and fallen into the guadalmez and guadalemar major mrustie must have been misled and no doubt it was done on purpose i have my information on the very best authority may i ask upon what authority are you pledged in honour to conceal even that no i may tell that i do believe said hilary after one moments thought and with his old bright simple smile i had it my lord from the two young ladiesthe daughters of the count of zamora aha cried lord wellington being almost as fond of young ladies as they of him and touched perhaps for a moment by the magic of a sweet young smile i begin to understand the bridge affair but i fear that young ladies can hardly be cited as authorities on geography otherwise we might make out a case against the spanish authorities for sending our escort to the wrong place and the spanish escort as you say took the other for the proper place certainly my lord they did and so did the count and everybody is there any hope now that i may be acquitted at a moments notice from hope that she would like to come back to her lodgings hilary opened his eyes so wide and his heart so wide and every other place that hope is generally partial to that the great commander who trusted as little as possible of his work to hope could not help smiling a quick dry smile and he felt some pain as word by word he demolished hope in hilary the point of the thing is the money lorraine and that we never could recover from the spaniards even if it was lost through them for the very good reason that they have not got it and even supposing the mistake to be theirs and our escort to have been sent astray you were a party to that mistake and more than that you were bound to see that the treasure did not cross the river until our men were there did you do so oh if i only had done that i should not be so miserable exactly so you neglected your duty take more care of your own money than you have taken of the public cash lorraine do as i told you and now goodbye the general who had long been chafing at so much discourse just now offered his hand to lorraine as one who was now a mere civilian is there no hope asked hilary dropping a tear into the mane of the restive horse can i never be restored my lord never unless the money is made good before we go into quarters again a heavy price for a captains commission if it is made good my lord will you restore me from this deep disgrace the question will be for his royal highness but i think that in such an extraordinary case you may relyat any rate you may rely upon my good word lorraine i thank you my lord the money shall be paid not for the sake of my commission but for the honour of our family chapter liii farewell all you spanish ladies the british army now set forth on its grand career of victory with an entirely new set of breeches interception of convoys and other adverse circumstances had kept our heroes from having any money although they had new pockets and the british government with keen insight into nature had insisted upon it in the last contract that the pockets should be all four inches wide with this the soldiers were delightedfor all the very bravest men are boysand they put their knuckles into their pockets and felt what a lot of money they would hold and though the money did not come there was the delightful readiness for it it might come any day for all they knew and what fools they must have looked if their pockets would not hold it in short these men laid on their legs to march with empty pockets and march they did as history shows all the better for not having sixpence though hilary was so heartily liked both in his own regiment and by the staff time which had failed for his trial also failed for pity of the issue the general had desired that as little as possible should be said and even if any one had wished to argue the hurry and bustle would have stopped his mouth lorraines old comrades were far in advance and the staff like a shuttle was darting about and the hills and the valleys were clapping their hands to the happy accompaniment of the drum casting by every outward sign that he ever had been a soldier hilary lorraine set forth on his sad retreat from this fine advance afoot and bearing on his shoulder a canvas bag on a truncheon of olive he would not accept any knapsack pouch or soldiers usage of any kind he had lost all right to that being now but a shattered young gentleman on his way home however in one way he showed good sense by losing such a heap of the public money he had learned to look a little better after his own so he drew every farthing that he could get of his fathers cash and his grandmothers but scorned to accept the arrears of his pay because he could not get them to a man of old or of middle age it has become or it ought to become a matter of very small account that he has thrown away his life he has seen so many who have done the like through indolence pride bad temper reserve timidity or fools confidenceinto which the most timid men generally rush that he knows himself now to be a fine example instead of standing forth as a very unpleasant exception to the rule and now if he takes it altogether he finds many fellows who have done much worse and seem all the better for it has he missed an appointment they cut down the salary did he bang his backdoor on a rising man well the man since he rose has forgotten his hosts has he married a shrew she looks after his kitchen remembering and reflecting thus almost any good man must refuse to be called without something to show for it a bigger fool than his neighbours but a young man is not yet late enough to know what human life is he is sure that he sees by foresight all the things which as they pass us leave so little time for insight and of which the only true view is calm and pleasant retrospect and then like some highstepping colt brought suddenly on his knees to a sense of longworn granite he flounders about in amazement so that if the fatal damage is not done to him he does it lorraine was not one of those who cry as the poets of all present ages dolet the world stand still until i get on nevertheless he was greatly downcast to find his own little world so early brought to a sudden standstill and it seems to be sadly true that the more of versatile quickness a man has in him the less there remains to expect of him in the way of pith and substance but hilary now was in no condition to go into any philosophies he made up his mind to walk down to the sea and take ship at some good seaport and having been pleased at malaga by the kind quiet ways of the people and knowing the port to be unobserved by french and american cruisers he thought that he might as well try his luck once more in that direction swift of foot as he was and lightsome when his heart was toward he did not get along very fast on his penitential journey so that it was the ninth day or the tenth from his being turned out of the army when he came once more to the bridge of echoes henceforth his bridge of sighs for ever here he stopped and ate his supper for his appetite was good again and then he looked up and down the zujar and said to himself what a fool he was for lo where claudia had clung to him trembling over a fearful abyss of torrent as it seemed by moonlight there now was no more than nine inches of water gliding along very pleasantly these spanish waters were out of his knowledge as much as the spanish ladies were but though the springs might have been much higher a fortnight ago than they were now hilary could not help thinking that claudia instead of fainting on the verge might have jumped over at any moment without spraining her very neat ankles and then he remembered that it was this same beautiful and romantic girl who had proved to the satisfaction of the spanish colonel that this was the only zujar ford for that river merged its name where it joined the longer and larger guadalmez upon this question there long had arisen a hopeful dilemma in hilarys mind which stated itself in this form if this were the true zujar ford then surely the spaniards the natives of the country were bound to apprise general hill thereof if this were not the zujar ford then the spaniards were liable for the treasure beyond this place and as far as the true one the latter was of course the stronger horn of the dilemma but unluckily there arose against it a mighty monster of fact quite strong enough to take even the minotaur by the horns suppose the brave spaniards to owe the money it was impossible to suppose that they could pay it this reflection gave hilary such a pain in his side that he straightway dropped it and beholding the vivid summer sky beginning to darken into deeper blue and the juts of the mountainous places preparing to throw light and shadow lengthwise and the simmering of the sunheat sinking into white mists of the vales he made up his mind to put best foot foremost and sleep at monte argento for he felt quite sure of the goodwill and sympathy of that pure hidalgo the noble count of zamora and from the young donnas he might learn something about his misadventure he could not bring himself to believe that claudia had been privy to the dastardly outrage upon himself his nature was too frank and open to foster such mean ideas young ladies were the best and sweetest the kindest and the largesthearted of created beings so they were and so they are but all rules have exceptions hilary as he walked up the hill down which he had ridden so gallantly scarcely more than a fortnight since was touched with many thinkings the fall of the sun which falls and rises over us so magnanimously had that power upon his body which it has on all things the sun was going he had done his work and was tired of looking at people mount as you might the sun was sinking and disdained all shadows and oblation of memorial through the growth of darkness thus and the urgency of froward trees that could not fold their arms and go to sleep without some rustling and all the many quiet sounds that nurse the repose of evening lorraine came to the heavy gates that had once secured the money the porter knew him and was glad to let in the young british officer whose dollars leaping right and left had made him many household friends but in the hall the old steward met him and with many grave inclinations of his head and body mourned that he could not receive the illustrious senhor there is in the castle no one now but my noble mistress the donna camilla his excellence the count is away far from home at the wars and the young lady claudia where is she i beg your pardon steward if i ought not to ask the question for the ancient steward had turned away at the sound of donna claudias name and pretending to be very deaf began to trim a lamp or two will the donna camilla permit me to see her for one minute or two perhaps her father is from home but you senhor steward know what is correct and thus will act hilary had not been so frightened at his own temerity in the deadly breach of badajos as now when he felt himself softly slipping a brace of humble english guineas into this lofty spaniards palm the steward without knowing what he was about except that he was trimming a very stubborn lamp felt with his thumb that there must be a brace and with contemptuous indignation let them slide into his pocket senhor i will do only what is right i am of fifty years almost in this noble family i am trusted as i deserve what i do is what the count himself would do but a very sad thing has happened we are obliged now to be most careful the senhor knows what the ladies are senhor steward that is the very thing that i never do know you know them well but alas i do not alas i do said the steward panting and longing to pour forth experience but he saw some women peeping down stairs and took the upper hand of them senhor it is not worth the knowing our affairs are loftier go back all you women and prepare for bed have you not had your supper now senhor in here for a minute if you please patience passeth all things but hilarys patience itself was passed as he waited in this little anteroom ere the steward returned with the donna camilla and with a low bow showed her in and posted himself in a corner she was dressed in pure white which hilary knew to be the mourning costume of the family the hand which the young andalusian lady offered was cold and trembling and her aspect and manner were timid and abashed begone she cried to the worthy steward with a sudden indignation which perhaps relieved her what now shall i do said the steward to himself with one hand spread upon his silver beard is this one also to run away begone said camilla to him once more looking so grand that he could only go and then quietly bolting the old gentleman out after which she returned to hilary senhor captain i am very sorry to offer you any scenes of force you have had too many from our family i do not understand you senhorita from your family i have received nothing but kindness hospitality and love alas senhor and heavy blows our proverb is love leads to blows and this was our return to you but she is of our family no more i am at a loss it is my stupidity i do not know at all what is meant in sincerity the cavalier has no suspicion who smote down and robbed him in sincerity the cavalier knows not although he would be very glad to know is it possible oh the dark treachery it was my cousin who struck you down my sister who betrayed you ah well said lorraine in a moment seeing how she trembled for his words and how terribly she felt the shame if it be so i am still in her debt she saved my life once and she spared it again now as you see i am none the worse the only loser is the british government which can well afford to pay it is not so the loss is ours of honour faith and gratitude i pray you not to take it so everybody knows that the fault was mine and whatever has happened only served me right it served you right for trusting us it is too true it is a bitter saying my father mourns and i mourn she never more will be his daughter and never more my sister i pray you said hilary taking her hand as she turned away to control herselfi pray you donna camilla to look at this little matter sensibly i now understand the whole of it your sister is of very warm and strong patriotic sentiments she felt that this money would do more good as the property of the partidas than as the pay of the british troops and so she exerted herself to get it all good spaniards would have thought the same she exerted herself to disgrace herself and to disgrace her family the money is not among the partidas but all in the bags of her cousin alcides whom she has married without dispensation and with her fathers sanction forged can you make the best of that senhor hilary certainly could not make anything very good out of this and cheerful though his nature was and tolerably magnanimous he could not be expected to enjoy the treatment he had met with to be knocked down and robbed was bad enough to be disgraced was a great deal worse but to be cut out by a rival betrayed into his power and made to pay for his wedding with trustmoney belonging to poor soldiersall this was enough to embitter even the sweet and kind nature of young lorraine therefore his face was unlike itself as he turned it away from the young spanish lady being much taken up with his own troubles and not yet ready to make light of them will you not speak to me senhor i am not in any way guilty of this i would have surrendered the whole of my life i pray you to pardon me hilary answered i am not accustomed to this sort of thing where are they now can i follow them even a spaniard could not find them my brothers would not attempt it alcides knows every in and out he has hidden his prize in the mountains of the north if that is so i can only hasten to say farewell to the spanish land to go away and to never come back is it possible that you could do that it may be a bitter thing but i must try i am now on my way to malaga being discharged from the british army i have only to find my own way home it cannot be it never can be our officers lose a mulesload of money or spend it at cards and we keep them still senhor captain you must have made some mistake they never could discharge you if there has been any mistake said hilary regaining his sweet smile with his sense of humour it is on their part not on mine discharged i am and the british army as well as the spanish cause must do their best to get on without me saints of heaven and you will go and never come back any more with the help of the saints that is my hope what other hope is left to me camilla de montalvan did not answer this question with her lips but more than answered it with her eyes she fell back suddenly as if with terror into a great blue velvet chair and her black tresses lay on her snowy arms although her shapely neck reclined then with a gentle sigh as if recovering from a troubled dream she raised her eyes to hilarys and let them dwell there long enough to make him wonder where he was and he saw that he had but to speak the word to become the owner of grace and beauty wealth and rank in the spanish army and at least for a time true love but alas a burned child dreads the fire there still was a bump on lorraines head from the staff of don alcides and camillas eyes were too like claudias to be trusted all at once moreover hilary thought of mabel of all her goodness and proven trust and spanish ladies though they might be queens had no temptation for him now and perhaps he thoughtas quick men think of little things unpleasantlyi do not want a wife whose eyes will always be deeper than my own and so he resolved to be off as soon as it could be done politely camilla having been disappointed more than once of loves reply clearly saw what was going on and called her pride to the rescue the cavalier should not say farewell to her she would say it to the cavalier also she would let him know one thing if you must leave us captain lorraine and return to your native land you will at least permit me to do what my father would have done if he were at hometo send you with escort to malaga the roads are dangerous you must not go alone i thank you i am scarcely worth robbing now i can sing in the presence of the bandit you will grant me this last favour i am sure if i tell you one thing it was not that wicked claudia who drew the iron from your wound it was not the donna claudia to whom then do i owe my life can you not by any means endeavour to conjecture how glad i am he answered as he kissed her cold and trembling handthe lady to whom i owe my life is gentle good and truthful there is no debt of life senhor but would it have grieved you now if claudia had done it then be assured she did not do it her manner never was to do anything good to anyone and yethow wonderful are thingseverybody loved her it is no good to be good i fear pedro you are at the door then are you you have taken care to hear everything go order a repast for the cavalier of the best we have and men and horses to conduct him to malaga be quick i say and show no hesitation at her urgent words the steward went yet grumbling and reluctant and glancing over his shoulder all the way along the passage how that old man amuses me she continued to the wondering hilary who had never dreamed that she could speak sharply ever since my sisters disgrace he thinks that his duty is to watch me ah what am i to be watched for because said hilary there is no spaniard who would not long to steal the beautiful young donna no spaniard shall ever do that but haste you are in such hurry for the sunny land of anglia i do not understand the senhorita why should i hurry to my great disgrace i shall never hear the last of the money i have lost tis all money money money in the noble england but the friends of the captain need not mourn for the money was not his nor theirs this grandly philosophical and most truly spanish view of the case destroyed poor hilarys last fond hope of any sense of a debt of honour on the part of the montalvans if the money lost had been hilarys own the count of zamora all compact of chivalry and rectitude might have discovered that he was bound to redeem his daughters robbery but as it stood there was no such chance private honour is a mountain rill that does not always lead to any lake of public honesty all spaniards would bow to the will of the lord that british guineas should slip into spanish hands so providentially we do not take things just so said young lorraine quite sadly i must go home and restore the money donna camilla i must say farewell you will come again when you are restored when you have proved that you did not take the money for yourself senhor you will remember your spanish friends i never shall forget my spanish friends to you i owe my life and hold it as long as i hold it at your command it is generously said senhor generosity always makes me weep and so farewell chapter liv going up the tree in all the british armythen a walking wood of british oak without a yard of saplingthere was no bit of better stuff than the five feet and a quarter allowing for his good game leg of major by this time colonel clumps this officer knew what he had to do and he made a point of doing it being short of imagination he despised that foolish gift and marvelled over and over again at others for laughing so at nothing that whimsical tickling of the veins of thought which some people give so and some receive with equal delight on either side humour or wit or whatever it is to colonel clumps was a vicious thing everything must be either true or false if it were true who could laugh at the truth if it were false who should laugh at a falsehood many a good man has reasoned thus reducing laughter under law and himself thenceforth abandoned by that lawless element colonel clumps had always taken solid views of everything and the longer he lived in the world the less he felt inclined to laugh at it but that laughter might not be robbed of all its dues and royalties just nature had provided that as the colonel would not laugh at the world the world should laugh at the colonel he had been the subject of more bad jokes onesided pleasantries and heartless hoaxes than any other man in the army with the usual result that now he scarcely ever believed the truth while he still retained for the pleasure of his friends a tempting stock of his native confidence in error so it came to pass that when colonel clumps after the battle of vittoria in which he had shown conspicuous valour was told of poor hilarys sad disgrace he was a great deal too clever and astute to believe a single word of it it is ludicrous perfectly ludicrous he said that being the strongest adjective he knew to express pure impossibility a gallant young fellow to be cashiered without even a courtmartial how dare you tell me such a thing sir i am not a man to be roughridden nobody ever has imposed on me and the boy is almost a sort of cousin of my own the first family in the kingdom sir the colonel flew into so great a rage twisting his white hair and stamping his lame heel that the officer who had brought the news being one of his own subalterns wisely retired into doubts about it and hinted that nobody knew the reason and therefore that it could not be true if i mention that absurd report about young lorraine thought colonel clumps when writing to lady de lampnor i may do harm and i can do no good but only get myself laughed at as the victim of a stupid hoax so i will say no more about him except that i have not seen him lately being so far from headquarters and knowing how old beaky is driving the staff about and before the brave colonel found opportunity of taking the pen in hand again he was heavily wounded in a skirmish with the french rearguard and ordered home as hereafter will appear it also happened that mr cappers friends those two officers who had earned so little of mabels gratitude by news of hilary were harassed and knocked about too much to find any time for writing letters and as the gazette in those days neglected the smaller concerns of the army and became so hurried by the march of events and the rapid sequence of battles that the doings of junior officers slipped through its fingers until long afterwards the result was that neither coombe lorraine nor old applewood farm received for months any news of the young staff officer neither did he yet present himself at either of those homesteads for as the ancient saying runs misfortunes never come alone the ship in which hilary sailed for england from the port of cadizfor he found no transport at malagathe flower of kent as she was called which appeared to him an excellent omen was nipped in the bud of her homeward voyage she met with a nasty french privateer to the southward of cape finisterre in vain she crowded sail and tried every known resource of seamanship the frenchman had the heels of her and laid her on board at sundown lorraine and two or three old soldiers battered and going to hospital had no idea of striking except in the british way of doing it but the master and mate knew better and stopped the hopeless conflict so the frenchman sacked and scuttled the ship in the most scientific manner and wanting no prisoners landed the crew on a desolate strand of gallicia without any money to save them this being their condition it is the proper thing to leave them so for nothing is more unwise than to ask or rather to institute inquiries as to the doings of people who are much too likely to require a loan therefore return we to the south down hills the wet ungenial and stormy summer of was passing into a wetter more cheerless and most tempestuous autumn on the northern slopes of the lightearthed hills the moss had come over the herbage and the sweet nibble of the sheep was souring the huddled trees which here and there rise just to the level of the ridge and then seem polled by the sweep of the windrush the bushes also and the gorse itself stood or rather stooped beneath the burden of perpetual wet the leaves hung down in a heavy drizzle unable to detach themselves from the welting of the unripe stalks the husk of the beech and the key of the ash were shrivelled for want of kernels and the clusters of the hazelnut had no sunvarnish on them the weakness of the summer sun whether his face was spotted overmuch or too immaculate and the humour of clouds and the tenor of winds and even the tendency of the earth itself to devolve into eccentricitythese and a hundred other causes for the present state of the weather were found according to where they were looked for on one point only there was no contradictionthings were not as they ought to be even the rector of west lorraine a man of most cheerful mind and not to be put down by any one laying to the will of the lord his failures and to his own merits all good successeven the rev struan hales was scarcely a match for the weather sportsmen in those days did not walk in sevenfold armour for fear of a thorn or a shower or a cowdab nor skulked they two or three hours in a rick awaiting the joy of one butchering minute fair play for man and dog and gun and fur and feather was then the rule and a day of sport meant a day of work and healthful change and fine exercise therefore mr hales went forth with his long and heavilyloaded gun to comfort himself and refresh his mind whatever the weather might be about upon six days out of every seven the hounds had not begun to meet the rivers were all in flood of course the air was so full of rheumatism that no man could crook his arm to write a sermon or work a concordance two sick old women had taken a fancy for pheasant boiled with artichokewillynilly the parson found it a momentous duty now to shoot and who went with him there is no such thing as consistency of the human mind yet well as this glorious truth was known and bemoaned by every one for his neighbours sakenot they not all the parish nor even we of the enlarged philosophy could or can ever be brought to believe our own eyes that it was bonny but in spite of all impossibility it was and the explanation requires relapse is it within recollection that the rector once shot a boy in a hedge the boy had clomb up into an ivied stump for purposes of his own combining espial with criticism all critics deserve to be shot if they dare to cross the grand aims of true enterprise they pepper and are peppered but they generally get the best of it and so did this boy that was shot in the hedge being of a crafty order he dropped and howled and rolled so piteously that poor mr hales although he had fired at a distance of more than fourscore yards from the latent vagabond cast down his gun in the horror of having slain a fellowcreature but when he ran up and turned him over to search for the fatal injury the boy so vigorously kicked and roared that the parson had great hopes of him after some more rolling a balance was struck the boy had some blue spots under his skin and a broad gold guinea to plaster them now this boy was not our bonny nor fit in any way to compare with him but uncivilized minds are very jealous and next to our bonny this boy that was shot was the furthest from civilization of all the boys of the neighbourhood therefore of course bitter jealousy raged betwixt him and the real outsider now the boy that was shot got a new pair of boots from the balance of his guinea and a new pair of legs to his nether garments under his mothers guidance and to show what he was and remove all doubts of the genuine expenditure his father and mother combined and pricked him with a pin in a stick to the sundayschool here madge hales the second and strongest daughter of the church laid hold of him and converted him into right views of theology hanging upon sound pothooks but a far greater mind than bill harkles could own was watching this noble experiment bonny had always hankered kindly after a knowledge of picturbooks the gifts of nature were hatching inside him and chipped at the shell of his chickenhood he had thrashed bill harkles in two fair fights without any aid from his donkey and he felt that bills mind had no right whatever to be brought up to look down on him this boy therefore being sneered at by erudite bill harkles knew that his fists would be no fair answer and retired to his cave here he looked over his many pickings and proudly confessing inferior learning refreshed himself with superior wealth and this meditation having sound foundation satisfied him till the next marketdaythe marketday at steyning bonny had not much business here but he always liked to look at things and sometimes he got a good pannier of victuals and sometimes he got nothing for the farmers of the better sort put off their dinner till two oclock when the prime of the market was over and then sat down to boiled beef and carrots in the yard of the white horse inn and often did their best in that way of this great ordinarygreat at any rate as regards consumptionfarmer gates the churchwarden was by ancestral right the chairman but for several marketdays the vicepresidency had been vacant a hot competition had raged and all steyning had thrilled with high commotion about the succession to the knife and fork at the bottom of the table until it was announced amid general applause that bottler was elected it was a proud day for this good pigman and perhaps a still prouder one for bonny when the new vicepresident was inducted into the windsor chair at the foot of the long and ancient table and it marked the turningpoint in the life of more than one then present the vicepresidents cart was in the shed close by and on the front lade sat bonny sniffing the beauty of the silverside and the luscious suggestions of the marrowbone polly longed fiercely to be up there with him but her mothers stern sense of decorum forbade the pretty miss bottlers would be toasted after dinnerand was one to be spied in a pigcart no sooner was the cloth removed than the chairman proposed in most feeling and eloquent language the health of his new colleague and now it was bottlers reply which created a grand revolution in steyning with graceful modesty he ascribed his present proud position the realization of his fondest hopes neither to his wellknown integrity industry strict attention to business nor even the quality of his bacon all these things of course contributed but what was the grand element of his unparalleled success in life a cry of white stockings from the bramber pigsticker was sternly suppressed and the man kicked out the grand element of his success in life was his classical education nobody knowing what was meant by this thunders of applause ensued until it was whispered from cup to cup that bottler when he was six years old had been three months at the grammar school he might have forgotten every word he had learned but any one might see that it was dung dug in so a dozen of the farmers resolved at once to have their children latined and bonny in his inmost heart aspired to some education what was the first step to golden knowledge he put this question to himself obscurely as he rode home on his faithful jack with all the marrowbones of the great feast rattling in a bag behind him from the case of bill harkles he reasoned soundly that the first thing to do was to go and get shot on the following daythe month being august or something very near it in the year a year behind the time we got on tomr hales to keep his hand in took his favourite flintgun down and patted it and reprimed it he had finished his dinner it had been a good one and his partner in life had been lamenting the terrible price of butchers meat she did not see how it could end in anything short of a wicked rebellion when the price of bread was put with it and the rector had answered with a wink to cecil order no meat for tomorrow my dear nor even for the next day we shall see what we shall see with this power of promise he got on his legs and stopped all who were fain to come after him he knew every coney and coneys hole on the glebe and on the clerks land and they all would now be out at grass and must be treated gingerly he was going to shoot for the pot as sportsmen generally did in those days with visions of milky onions about to be poured on a broad and wellboiled back the rector after sneaking through a furzy gate peeped down a brown trench of the steep hillside here he spied three little sandy juts of recent excavation and on each of them sat a hunchbacked coney proud of the labours of the day and happily curling his whiskers the rector peering downward saw the bulging over their large black eyes and the prick of their delicate ears and their gentle chewing of the grassblade there was no chance of a running shot for they would pop into earth in a moment so he tried to get two of them into a line and then he pulled his trigger the nearest rabbit fell dead as a stone but the rector could scarcely believe his eyes when through the curls of the smoke he beheld instead of the other rabbit a ragged boy rolling and kicking and holloaing am i never to shoot without shooting a boy cried the parson rushing forward another guinea a likely thing i vow i will only pay a shilling this time the sport would ruin a bishop but mr hales found to his great delight that the boy was not touched by a shot nor even made pretence to be so he had craftily crept through the bushes from below and quietly lurked near the rabbits hole and after the shot had darted forth and thrown himself cleverly on the wounded rabbit who otherwise must have got away to die a lingering death in his burrow the quickness and skill of the boy and the luck of thus bagging both rabbits so pleased the rector that he gave him sixpence and bade him follow to carry the game and to see more sport bonny had a natural turn for sport which never could be beaten out of him and to get it encouraged by the rector of the parish was indeed a godsend and in his excitement at every shot he poured forth his heart about rabbits and hares and woodqueests and partridges and even pheasants why you know more than i do said the rector kindly laying his hand on the shoulder of the boy after loading for his tenth successful shot how ever have you picked up all these things the very worst poacher of the coming age or else the best gamekeeper i looks about or we does me and jack together answered bonny with one of his broadest and most genuine grins and the gleam of his teeth and the twinkle of his eyes enforced the explanation come to my house in the morning bonny said the rector and that was the making of him for the boy that cleaned the knives and boots had never conscientiously filled that sphere though he was captain of the bibleclass and now he had taken the measles so long that they had put him to earth the celery here was an opening and bonny seized it and though he made very queer work at first his native ability carried him on till he put a fine polish on everything from eighteenpence a week he rose to two and threepence within nine months and to this he soon added the empty bottles and a commission upon the greasepot even now all has not been told for by bringing the cook good news of her sweetheart and the parlourmaid dry sticks to light her fire and by showing a tender interest in the chilblains of even the scullerymaid he became such a favourite in the kitchen that the captain of the bibleclass defied him to a battle in the washhouse the battle was fought and victory though long doubtful perched at last upon the banner of brave bonny and with mutual esteem and four black eyes the heroes parted after this all ran smooth the rector who had enjoyed the conflict from his studywindow without looking off more than he could help from a sermon upon seek peace and ensue it as soon as he had satisfied himself which of the two boys hit the straighter went to an ancient wardrobe and examined his bygone hunting clothes here he found an old scarlet coat made for him thirty years ago at oxford but now a world too small and he sighed that he had no son to inherit it also a pair of old buckskin breeches fitter for his arms than his legs just now the moths were in both they were growing scurfy sentiment must give way to sense so bonny got coat and breeches and the maids with merry pinches and screams of laughter and consolatory kisses adapted them he showed all his grandeur to his donkey jack and jack was in two minds about snapping at it this matter being cleared and the time brought up here we are at west lorraine in earnest in the month of october long after hilarys shocking disgrace but before any of his own people knew it chapter lv the woeburn what a lazy loon that steenie chapman is said the rector for about the twentieth time one fine october morning he knows what dreadful weather we get now and yet he cant be here by nine oclock too bad i call it too bad a great deal send away the teapot caroline but my dear answered mrs hales who always made the best of every one you forget how very bad the roads must be after all the rain we have had and i am sure he will want a cup of tea after riding through such flooded roads tea indeed the parson muttered as he strode in and out of the room with his shotbelt dancing on his velveteen shootingcoat and snapped his powderflask impatiently steenies tea comes from the case not the caddy and the first gleam of sunshine ive seen for a week after that heavy gale last night it will rain before twelve oclock for a guinea cecil run and see if you can find that boy bonny i shall start by myself and send bonny down the road with a message for captain chapman the huntsman came out of the backkitchen cecil about two minutes ago said madge who never missed a chance of a cut at bonny because he had thrashed her pet biblescholar he was routing about with his red coat on for scraps of yellow soap and candleends what a story cried cecil who was bonnys champion being his schoolmistress i wish your dick was half as good a boy he gets honester every day almost ill send him to you papa in two seconds i suppose youll speak to him at the sidedoor at a nod from her father away she ran while madge followed slowly to help in the search and finding that the boy had left the house they took different paths in the garden to seek him or overtake him on his homeward way in a few moments cecil as she passed some laurels held up her hand to recall her sister and crossed the grass towards her very softly with finger on lip and a mysterious look hush and come here very quietly she whispered ill show you something as good as a play then the two girls peeped through the laurelbush and watched with great interest what was going on in an alley of the kitchengarden sat bonny upon an old seakale pot clad in his red coat and white breeches and deeply meditating before him upon an espalier tree hung a tempting and beautiful apple a scarlet pearmain with its sleek sides glistening in the slant of the sunbeams ill lay you a shilling he steals it madge whispered into the ear of her sister done replied cecil with her hand before her mouth meanwhile bonny was giving them the benefit of his train of reasoning his mouth was wide open and his eyes very bright and his forehead a field of perplexity theys all agrubbing in the house he reflected and they aint been and offered me a bit today theres ever so many more on the tree and they locked up the scullery cupboard and one on em called me a little warmint and they tuck the key out of the beertap with all these wrongs upward he stretched forth his hand and pretty cecil trembled for her shilling shillings being very scarce with her but the boy without quite having touched the apple drew back his hand and that withdrawal perhaps was the turningpoint of his life he gived me all this he said looking at his sleeve and all on em stitched it up for me and they lets me go in and out without watching and twice ise been out with him shutting i ont i ont and them coorse red apples seldom be worth ating of sturdily he arose and gave a kick at one of the posts of the appletree and set off for the gate as hard as he could go while the virtuous vein should be uppermost what a darling of honour cried cecil hales jumping after him a bayard a cato an aristides he shall have his apple and he shall have sixpence and unlimited faith for ever bonny come back heres your apple for you and sixpence and what would you like to have best in all the world now to go out shutting with the master miss you shall do it i will speak to papa myself if you please miss madge pay up your shilling now come back bonny your master wants you you are a little too late for your errand i fear answered margaret pulling her purse out while you were pursuing this boy i heard the sound of a grand arrival so much the better cried cecil who like her mother always made the best of things papa has been teasing his gun for an hour bonny run back and keep old shot quiet he will break his chain by the noise he makes you are as bad as he is and you both shall go the rectorof all men the most hospitable though himself so sober in the morningrevived captain chapman or at least refreshed him with brandy and bitters after that long ride and keenly heeding all hindrance in his own hurry to be starting he thought it a very bad sign for poor alice that stephen received no comfort from one nor two nor even three large glasses at length they set forth with a sickly sun shrinking back from the promise of the morning and a vaporous glisten in the white southeast looking as watery as the sea i told you so steenie said the parson who knew every sign of the weather among these hills we ought to have started two hours sooner if ever we had wet jackets in our life we shall have them today bold captain it will bring in the snipes said the captain bravely we are not the sort of men i take it to heed a little sprinkle tom have you got my bladdercoat all right your honour his keeper replied and seeho cried bonny while the dogs were ranging where where where asked the captain dancing in a breathless flurry round a tuft of heath i cant see him where is he boy poke her up boy said the rector surely you would not shoot the poor thing on her form let him sit till i see him cried the captain cocking both his barrels now i am ready where the devil is he she cant run away answered bonny because your honours heel be on her whiskers ah there her gooth quick your honour and go she did in spite of his honour and both the loads he sent after her while the rector laughed so at the captains plight that it was quite impossible for him to shoot the keeper also put on an experienced grin while bonny flung open all the cavern of his mouth run after him boy look alive cried the captain i defy him to go more than fifty yards you must all have seen how i peppered him ay and salted her too i believe said the parson look along the barrel of my gun and you will see the salt still on her tail steenie as he pointed they all saw the gallant hare at a leisurely canter crossing the valley some quarter of a mile below them what cried the rector did you see that jump what can there be to jump over there for puss had made a long bound from bank to bank at a place where they could not see the bottom water if e plaize sir answered bonny a girt strame of water comed down that hollow all of a sudden this mornint and it hath been growing stronger ever since good god exclaimed mr hales dropping his gun what is the water like boy i never seed no water like it afore as black as what i does your boots with sir but as clearyou can see every stone in it then the lord have mercy on this poor parish and especially to the old house of lorraine for the woeburn has broken out again why rector you seem in a very great fright said captain chapman recovering slowly from his sad discomfiture what is the matter about this water some absurd old superstitionis not it superstition or not mr hales answered shortly i must leave you to shoot by yourself captain chapman i could not fire another shot today it is more than three hundred and fifty years since this water of death was seen in my church you may read what happened then and not only that but according to tradition its course runs directly through our village and even through my garden my people know nothing about it yet it may burst upon them quite suddenly there are many obstructions no doubt in its course and many hollow places to fill up but before many hours it will reach us as a question of prudence i must hasten home shot come to heel this moment you are right said the captain i shall do the same your hospitable board will excuse me tonight i would much rather not leap the woeburn in the dark with the instinct of a man of the world he perceived that the rector under this depression would prefer to have no guest moreover the clouds were gathering with dark menace over the hilltops and he was not the manif such man there beto find pleasure in a wet days shooting no horse has ever yet crossed the woeburn mr hales replied as they all turned homeward across the shoulder of the hill at least if the legends about that are true though a hare may have leaped it today tomorrow no horse will either swim or leap it bless my heart does it rise like that the sooner we get out of its way the better what a pest it will be to you rector why you never will be able to come to the meet and our opening day is next tuesday steenie cried the rector imbibing hope it has not struck me in that light before but it scarcely could ever be the will of the lord to cut off a parson from his own pack oh dont walk so fast shouted captain chapman ones neck might be broken down a hill like this tom let me lean on your shoulder boy ill give you sixpence to carry my gun tom take the flints out that he maynt shoot me here uncle struan just sit down a minute a minute cant make any difference you know that is true said the rector who was also out of breath bonny how far was the black water come you seem to know all about it plaize sir it seem to be coming down a hill and the longer i looked the more water was acoming you little nincompoop had it passed your own door yetyour hole or your cave or whatever you call it plaize sir it wornt a runnin towards i at all it wor makin a hole in the ground and kickin a splash up in a fuzzy corner my poor boy its course is not far from your door it may be in among your goods and have drowned your jackass and all by this time like an arrow from a bow away went bonny down the headlong hill having cast down the captains gun and pulled off his red coat to run the faster the three men left behind clapped their hands to their sides and roared with laughter at such a pace went the white buckskin breeches through bramble gorse heather over rock sod and chalk what a grand flying shot cried the keeper where the treasure is there will the heart be said the rector as soon as he could speak i would give a months tithes for a good days rout among that boys accumulations he has got the most wonderful things they say and he keeps them on shelves like a temple of idols what will he do when he gets too big to go in at his own doorway i am feeding him up with a view to that and so are my three daughters he must be a thorough young thief said the captain in any other parish he would be in prison i scarcely know which is the softer beakas we are calledyou or sir roland tom cried the rector run on before us you are young and active inquire where old nanny stilgoe lives at the head of the village and tell her that the flood is coming upon her and help her to move her things poor old soul if she will let you help her tell her i sent you and perhaps she will although she is very hard to deal with she has long been foretelling this break of the bourne but the prophets are always the last to set their own affairs in order the keeper touched his hat and set off he always attended to the parsons orders more than his own masters and mr hales saw from the captains face that he had ordered things too freely steenie i beg your pardon he said i forgot for the moment that i should have asked you before i despatched your man like that but i did it for your own good because we need no longer hurry rector i am infinitely obleeged to you to order those men is so fatiguing i always want some one to do it for me and now we may go down the hill i suppose without snapping all our kneecaps to go up a hill fast is a very bad thing but to go down fast is a great deal worse because you think you can do it my dear fellow you may take your time i will not walk you off your legs as that wicked niece of mine did how are you getting on there now well that is a delicate question rector you know what ladies are you know but i do not see any reason to despair of calling you uncle in earnest have you brought the old lady over to your side you are sure to be right when that is done she has been on my side all along for the sake of the land ah how good it is and nobody else in the field that we know of then lallie cant hold out so very much longer lord bless me do you see that black line yonder to be sure why it seems to be moving onward like a great snake crawling and it has a white head what a wonderful thing it is our first view of the woeburn would to heaven that it were our last one the black is the water and the white i suppose is the chalky scum swept before it it is following the old track as lava does it will cross the coombe road in about five minutes if you want to get home you must be quick to horse never mind the rain let us run down the hillor just stop one halfminute they were sitting in the shelter of a chalky rock with the sullen storm rising from the south behind them and the drops already pattering on the right hand and on the left brown ridges furzy rises and heathery scollops overhanging slidden rubble and the steep zigzags of the sheep and the rounding away into nothing of the hilltopsall of these were fading into the slaty blue of the raincloud before them spread for leagues and leagues clear and soft and smiling still the autumnal beauty of the wealdland tufting hamlets here and there with darker foliage round them elbows of some distant lane unconsciously prominent swathes of colour laid on broadly where the crops were all alike some bold tree of many ages standing on its right to stand and grey churchtowers far asunder landmarks of a longer view in the fading distance many things we cannot yet make out but hope them to be good and beauteous calm and large with human life this noble view expanded always the great heart of the rector and he never failed to point out clearly the boundaryline of his parish he could scarcely make up his mind to miss that opportunity even now and was just beginning with a distant furzerick far to the westward under chancton ring when chapman having heard it at least seven times cut him short rather briskly you are forgetting one thing my dear sir your parish is being cut in two while you are dwelling on the boundaries steenie you are right i had no idea that you had so much sense my boy you see how the ditches stand all full of water so as to confuse me a guinea for the first at the rectory gate you ought to be handicapped you call yourself twenty years younger dont you heres the guinea cried chapman as the parson set off two if you like only let me come down this confounded hill considerately mr hales found nothing yet amiss with his own premises some people had come to borrow shovels and wheelingplanks and such like but the garden looked so fair and dry with its pleasant slope to the east that the master laughed at his own terrors until he looked into the covered well the neverfailing blackdiamond water down below the toolhouse here a great cone rose in the middle of the well like a plume of black ostrich and the place was alive with hollow noises dig the celery cried the rector every man and boy come here i wont have my celery washed away nor my drumhead savoys nor my ragged jack girls come out every one of you there is not a moment to lose i tell you i never had finer stuff in all my life and i wont have it washed away i tell you here you heavybreeched dick what the dickens are you gaping at i shant get a thing done before dark at this rate out of my way every one of you if ye cant stir you stumps i can with less avail like consternation seized every family in west lorraine a river of miraculous birth and power was sweeping down upon all of them there would never be any dry land any more all the wise old women had said so everybody expected to see black water bubbling up under his bed that night meanwhile this beautiful and grand issue of the gathered hillsprings moved on its way majestically obeying the laws it was born of the gale of the previous night had unsealed the chamber of great waters forcing the needful air into the duct and opening vaults that stored the rainfall of a hundred hills and vales through such a bower of stalactite such limpid realms and lakes enlockd in caves cyrene led her weeping son where all the rivers of the world he found in separate channels gliding underground and now as this cold resistless flood calmly reclaimed its ancient channel swallowed up nanny stilgoes well and cut off the rector from his own church as if to encounter its legendary bane a poor young fellow depressed and shattered feeble and wan and heavyhearted was dragging his reluctant steps up the valley of the adur left on the naked rocks of spain conquered plundered and halfstarved hilary lorraine had fallen with the usual reaction of a sanguine temperament into low spirits and disordered health so that when he at last made his way to corunna and found no british agent there nor any one to draw supplies from nothing but the pride of his family kept him from writing to the count of zamora of writing to england there was no chance all communication ran through the channels of the distant and victorious army so that he thought himself very lucky in the present state of his health and fortunes when the captain of an oilship bound for london having lost three hands on the outward voyage allowed him to work his passage the fare of a landsman in feeble health was worth perhaps more than his services but the captain was a kindhearted man and perceived though he knew not who hilary was that he had that very common thing in those days a gent under a cloud to deal with and the gale which had opened the woeburn shortened hilarys track towards it by forcing his ship to run for refuge into shoreham harbour how shall i go home what shall i say disgraced degraded and broken down a stain upon my name and race i am not fit to enter our old doors what will my father say to me and proud alicewhat will her thoughts be with steps growing slower at each weary drag he crossed the bridge of bramber and passed beneath the ivied towers of the rivals of his ancestors and then avoiding steyning town he turned up the valley of west lorraine and the rain which had come on at middleday and soaked his sailors slops long ago now took him on the flank judiciously and his heart was so low that he received it all without talking either to himself or it i will go to the rectory first he thought uncle struan is violent but he is warm and though he has three children of his own he loves me much more than my father does with this resolution he turned on the right down a lane that came out by the rectory the lane broke out suddenly into black water and a tall robust man stood in the twilight with a heavy spade over his shoulder and hilary lorraine went up to him no no my man not a penny to spare said the rector in anticipation we have a great deal too much to do with our own poor and with this new trouble especially the times are hardyes they always are i never knew them otherwise but an honest man always can get good work or go and fight for your country like a man but we cant have any vagrants in my parish i have fought for my country like a man uncle struan and this is all that has come of it good god hilary cried the rector and for a long time he found nothing better to say yes uncle struan dont you understand every one must have his ups and downs i am having a long spell of downs just now my dear boy my dear boy whatever have you done do you mean to throw me over uncle struan as the rest of the world has beautifully done everything seems to be upset what is the meaning of this broad black stream come into my study and tell me all i can let you in without sight of your aunt the shock would be too great for her hilary followed without a word mr hales led him in at the window and warmed him and covered him with his own dressinggown and watched him slowly recovering never mind the tar on your hands it is an honest smell he said my poor boy my poor boy what you must have been through whatever has happened to me answered hilary spreading his thin hands to the fire has been all of my own doing uncle struan you shall have a cordial and you shall tell me all there i have bolted the door i am your parson as well as your uncle all you say will be sacred with me and i am sure you have done no great harm after all we shall see what your dear aunt thinks of it then hilary sipping a little rumandwater wandered through his story not telling it brightly as once he might have done but hiding nothing consciously do you mean to tell me there is nothing worse than that asked the rector with a sigh of great relief there is nothing worse uncle how could it be worse and they turned you out of the army for that how thankful i am for belonging to the church you are simply a martyred hero yes they turned me out of the army for that how could they help it reasoning thus he met his uncles look of pity and it was too much for him he did what many a far greater man and braver hero has done and will do when the soul is moving he burst into a hot flood of tears chapter lvi going down the hill sir roland lorraine was almost as free from superstition as need be to be wholly quit of that romantic element is a disadvantage still and excepts a neighbour even now from the general neighbourly sympathy threescore years ago of course that prejudice was threefold the swing of british judgment mainly takes magnetic repulse from whatever the french are rushing after when they are republican all of us rally for throne and constitution when they have a parliament we want none when they are pressed under empire we are apt to be glad that it serves them right we know them to be brave and good lovers of honour and sensitive but we cannot get over the line between us and themand the rest of the world perhaps whatever might be said or reasoned for or against the whole of such things sir roland had long made up his mind to be moderate and neutral he liked everybody to speak his best according to selfopinion and he liked to keep out of the way of them all and relapse into the wiser ages he claimed his own power to think for himself as well as the mere right of doing so and therefore he long had been heterodox to earnest rightminded people never the more however could he shake himself free from the inborn might of hereditary impress the traditions of his house and race had still some power over him a power increased by long seclusion and the love of hearth and home therefore when trotman was cut off on his way for his weekly paper by a great black gliding flood and aghast ran up the coombe to tell itsir roland while he smiled felt strange misgivings creeping coldly alice a sweet and noble maiden on the tender verge of womanhood came to her fathers side and led him back to his favourite bookroom she saw that he was at the point of trembling although he could still command his nerves unless he began to think of them dissembling her sense of all this she sat by the fire and waited for him my darling we have had a very happy time he began at last to say to her you and i for many years suiting one another to be sure we have father and i mean to go on suiting you for many more years yet her father saw by the firelight the sadness in her eyes and he put some gaiety into his own or tried lallie you have brighter things before youa house of your own and society and the grand world and great shining excellent things no doubt my father but not to be compared with you and home have i done anything to vex you that you talk like this to me let me see come here and show me there are few things i enjoy so much as being vexed by you there papa you are in a hurry to have your usual laugh at me you shall have no material now i knows what is right and i means to do itas the man said to me at the turnpikegate when he made me pay twice over consider yourself my darling father saddled for all your life with me sir roland loved his daughters quick bright turns of love and filial passion when her heart was really moved a thousand complex moods and longings played around or pierced her then yet all controlled or at least concealed by an english ladys quietude alice was so like himself that he always knew what she would think and he tried his best to follow the zigzag flash of feminine feeling my dear child he said at last something has been too much for you perhaps that foolish fellows story of this mysterious water a gross exaggeration doubtless the finny tribe fast sticking by the gills in the nest of the woodpigeon marry come up let us see these wonders the moon is at the full tonight and i hear no rain on the windows now go and fetch my crabstick darling oh may i come with you papa do say yes i shall lie awake all night unless i go the moon is sure to clear the storm off and i will wrap up so thoroughly but you cannot wrap up your feet dear child and the roads are continually flooded now not on the chalk papa never on the chalk except in the very hollow places besides i will put on my new french clogs they cant be much less than six inches thick i shall stand among the deluge high enough for the fish to build their nests on me daughter of folly and no child of mine go and put your clogs on we will go out at the eastern door to arouse no curiosity as the master and his daughter passed beneath the astrologers tower and left the house by his private entrance they could not help thinking of the good old prince and his kind anxiety about them to the best of their knowledge the wise agasicles had never heard of the woeburn or perhaps his mind had been so much engrossed with the comet that he took no heed of it and even in his time this strange river was legendary as the hydaspes after the heavy and tempestuous rain the night was fair as it generally is even in the worst of weather when the full moon rises the longchained hill with its level outline stretching towards the south of east afforded play for the glancing light of a watery and laborious moon long shadows laid in dusky bars or cast in heavy masses where the hollow land prevailed for them and misty columns hovering and harbouring over treeclumps and gleams of quiet light pursuing avenues of openingall of these at every step of deep descent appeared to flicker like a great flag waving what a very lovely night how beautifully the clouds lie cried alice being apt to kindle rashly into poetry they softly put themselves in rows and then they float towards the moon and catch the silver of her smileoh why do they do that papa because the wind is west my dear take care you are on a great flint i fear you are always cutting your boots out no papa no i have got you this time that shows how much you attend to me i have got my great french clogs on then how very unsafe to be looking at the moon lean on me steadily if you must do that the hill is slippery with slime on the chalk you will skate away to the bottom and leave me mourning oh how i should love to skate if ladies ever could do such a thing i can slide very nicely as you know papa dont you think after all this rain we are sure to have a nice cold winter who can tell lallie i only hope not you children with your quick circulation active limbs and vigorous lungs are always longing for frost and snow but when they come you get tired of them within a week at the utmost but in your selfish spring of life you forget all the miseries of the poor and old or even young folk who are poor and the children starving everywhere and the price of all food is now most alarming i am sure i meant no harm said alice one cannot always think of everything papa do you know that you have lately taken to be very hard on me well now everybody says that of me sir roland answered thoughtfully i scarcely dreamed that my fault was that but out of many mouths i am convicted struan hales says it and so does my mother hilary seemed to imply it also at the time when he last was heard of mine own household trotman mrs pipkins and that charitable mrs merryjack have combined to take the same view of me there must be truth in it i cannot make head against such a cloud of witnesses and now alice joins them what more do i want i must revise my opinion of myself and confess that i am a hardhearted man this question sir roland debated with himself in a manner which had long been growing upon him in the gathering love of solitude being by nature a man with a most extraordinary love of justice he found it hard as such rare men do to be perfectly sure about anything he always desired to look at a subject from every imaginable outside view receding like a lark in the clouds from groundling consideration yet frankly open like a woodcock roasting to anything good put under him nobody knew him but he did his best when he thought of that matter to know himself now his daughter allowed him to follow out his meditation quietly and then she said as they went down the hill warily heeding each others steps papa i beg you particularly to pay no attention whatever to your own opinion or any other opinion in the world except perhaps at least perhaps perhaps that of alice quite so papa about my own affairs my opinion is of no value but about yours and the family in general it is reallysomething wisest of our race and bravest you are rushing into the water darlingstop you have forgotten what we came for we came to see the woeburn and here it is is this it and yesterday i walked across this very place oh what a strange black river as alice drew suddenly back and shuddered sir roland lorraine threw his left arm round her without a word and looked at her the light of the full moon fell on her face through a cleft of jagged margins and the shadow of a branch that had lost its leaves lay on her breast and darkened it why lallie you seem to be quite frightened her father said after waiting long look up at me and tell me dear no i am not at all frightened papa but perhaps i am a little out of spirits why asked sir roland you surely do not pay heed to old rhymes and silly legends i call this a fine and very lively water i only wish it were always here oh papa dont say that i implore you and i felt you shiver when you saw it first you know what it means for our familyloss of life once loss of property twice and the third time the loss of honourand with that of course our extinction you little goose none can lose their honour without dishonourable acts come miss cassandra of the present lorrainesa very narrow residuewho is to be distinguished thus father you know so much more than i do but i thought that many people were disgraced without having ever deserved it disgraced my darling but not dishonoured what could disgrace ever be to usa thing that comes and goes according to the fickle seasona result of the petty human weather as this melancholy water is of the larger influence papa then you own that it is melancholy that was just what i wanted you to do you always take things so differently from everybody else that i began to think you would look upon this as a happy outburst of a desirable wateringwater well done lallie the command of language is an admirable gift but the want of it leads to still finer issues this wateringwater seems inclined to go on for a long time watering of course it must go flowing flowing until its time is over lallie you have among many other gifts a decided turn for epigram you scarcely could have described more tersely the tendencies of water i firmly believe that this stream will go on flowing and flowing until it quite stops papa you are a great deal too bad you must perceive that you are so even by the moonlight i say the most sensible things ever thought of and out of them you make nonsense now let me have my turn so please you have you thought of bridges how is our butcher to come or our miller our letters or even our worthy beggars we are shut off in front without building a boat can i ever hear even uncle struan preach hark i hear something like him you frivolous lallie you are too bad i cannot permit such views of things of course papa i never meant that only please to listen the dark and deep stream which now had grown to a width of some twelve yards perhaps was gliding swiftly but without a murmur towards the broad and watery moon on the righthand side steep scars of chalk shedding gleams of white rays made the hollow places darker while on the other side furzy tummocks patches of briar and tufted fallows spread the manypointed light among their shadows justly please to listen again said alice shrinking from her father lest she might be felt to tremble what a plaintive thrilling sound it must be a good banshee i am sure a banshee that knows how good we are and protests against our extinction there it is againand there seems to be another wail inside of it a chinese puzzle of noises lallie and none of them very musical your ears are keener than mine of course but being extinct of romance i should say that i heard a donkey braying papa now papa if it comes to thatand i said it was like uncle struans voice but i beg his pardon quite down on my knees if you think that it can be a donkey i am saved all the trouble of thinking about it there he is looking hard at us oh no papa he is not looking hard at us he is looking most softly and sadly what a darling donkey and his nose is like a snowdrop clearly in the moonlight shone on the opposite bank of the woeburn the nose of jack the donkey his wailings had been coming long and his supplications rising he was cut off from his home and fodder and wholly beloved bonny and the wail inside a wailas alice had described itwas the sound of the poor boys woe responsive to the forlorn appeal of jack on the brink of the cruel dividing water they must have been for a long time striding up and down over against each other stretching fond noses vainly forward and outvying one another in the luxury of poetic woe dont say a word papa whispered alice the boy cannot see us here behind this bush and we can see him beautifully in the moonlight i want to know what he will do so much i dont see what he can do except howl sir roland answered quietly and certainly he seems to possess remarkable powers in that way bohoo hoo hoo hoo wept bonny in confirmation of this opinion and ekehaw ekehaw from a nose of copious pathos formed the elegiac refrain then having exhausted the well of weeping the boy became fitter for reasoning he wiped his eyes with his scarlet sleeves and stretched forth his arms reproachfully oh jack jack jack whatever have i done to you all the crumb of the loaf you had and the half of the very last orchard i run and the prime of old nannys shorthorns and if you wasnt pleased you might a said so all the morning jack theres none in all the world as knoweth what you and i be but one another and there is none as careth for either on us only you and me jack dont ee jack dont ee go and run away if ee do ill give the thieves all as weve collected and the rogues as calls us two waggabones my poor boy said sir roland lorraine suddenly parting the bush between them in fear of another sad boohoofor bonny had stirred his own depths so that he was quite ready to start againmy poor boy you seem to be very unhappy about your donkey bonny made answer to never a word this woe belonged only to jack and himself they could never think of being meddled with bonny said alice in her soft sweet voice and kindly touching him as he turned away do you wish to know how to recover your jack would you go a long way to get him back again to the outermost end of the world miss if the whole of the way wor fuzzbush miles and miles us have gone aready you need not go quite to the end of the world instead of going up and down these banks keep steadily up the water in about a mile you will come to its head if what i have heard of it is true then keep well above it and round the hill and you will meet the whitenosed donkey heehaw said jack from the opposite bank not without a whisk of tail then the boy without a word of thanks by reason of incredulity whistled a quick reply and set off to test this doubtful theory observe now the bliss of possessing a donkey sir roland began to meditate i am not at all skilful in asses whether golden or leaden or wooden or even as described by lian but the contempt to which they are born proves to my mind that they do not deserve it or otherwise how would they get it my sentence is clumsy my ideaif there be onehas not managed to express itself i hear the whitenosed donkey in the distance braying at me with an overpowering echo of contempt i am unequal to this contest let me withdraw to my bookroom indeed papa you will do nothing of the sort you are always withdrawing to your bookroom and even i must not come in and what good ever comes of it you must if you please make up your mind to meet things very differently and only think how long it is since we have heard of poor hilary there are troubles coming overwhelming troubles on all with the name or love of lorraine as sure as i stand my dear father before you then i pray you to stand behind me alice what an impulsive child it is and the moonlight my darling has had some effect as it always has wonderfully on such girls you have worked yourself up lallie i can see it my pet i must watch you carefully what a mistake you make papa i never do anything of the sort you seem to regard me as anybodys child to be reasoned with out of a window i may be supposed to say foolish things and to imagine all sorts of nonsense and of course i cannot reason because it is not born with us and then when i try i have no chance whatever though perfect justice is my aim andwho comes lingering after me your excellent father sir roland answered kissing away his childs excitement your loving father does all this my pet and brings you quite home to stern reason and now he will take you home to your home you have caught the sad spirit of the donkey petling you long to go up and down this water with some one to bewail you on the other side yes papa so i do you are so clever but i think i should go down and up papa if the quadruped you are thinking of went up and down now lallie he said and he said no more for he knew that she hinted at stephen chapman and wanted to fight her own battle against him now that she was in the humour the father was ready to put off the conflictas all good fathers must beand he led his dear child up the hill or let her lead him peacefully chapter lvii the pledge of a life three days of gloom and storm ensued upon the outbreak of the water while the old house at the head of the coombe in happy ignorance looked down upon its hereditary foe but dark foreboding and fine old stories agitated the loyal hearts of the domestics of the upper conclavethat ancient butler onesimus binns mrs pipkins and mrs merryjack with such uneasy feelings prevalent in the higher circle nothing short of terror or even panic could be expected among the inferior dignitaries now headed by john trotman this young man had long shown himself so ambitious and aggressive even cockroaching as mrs merryjack said on the most sacred rights of his betters that the latter had really but one course leftto withdraw to their upper room and exclude all as didnt know how to behave theirselves of these unhappily there were too many and they seemed to enjoy themselves more freely after their degradation for trotman though rapid of temper perhaps and given to prompt movements of the foot was not at all bad when allowed his own way and never kicked anybody who offered to be kicked so with his dictatorship firmly established in the lesser lower regions he became the most affable of mankind and read all the crimes of the county to the maids and drew forth long sighs of delicious horror that his own brave self might console them and now when they heard of the sombre woeburn with its dismal legend enhanced by ghastly utterances of ancient nanny stilgoe and tidings brought through wailing winds of most appalling spectres the stoutest heart was agitated with mysterious terror at the creak of a door or the flit of a shadow the rustle of a dry leaf or the waving of a windowblind the hoot of an owl or even the silent creep of gloomy eveningmy goodness mary ann what was that or polly come closer i hear something or jane do ee look behind the platescreen and then with one voice john john john come down thats a dear man john such was the state of the general nerve as proved by many a special appeal from kitchen backkitchen and scullery pantry terrible cellar or lonesome washhouse and the best of everything was kept for john even in the world of finer feebler and more foreign english in diningroom drawingroom parlour and bookroom and my ladys chamber a mild uneasiness prevailed and a sense of evil auspices lady valeria most of all who carried conservatism into relapse felt that troublous days were coming and almost longed to depart in peace or at any rate she said so but with her keen mind and legal insight she was bound to perceive that the authorized version of the other world is democratic as might be that of this world if christianity made christians therefore her ladyship preferred to wait things might get better and they could scarcely get worse she had a good deal to see to and settle among things strictly visible and she threatened everybody with her decease but did not prepare to make it sir roland lorraine on the other hand paid little heed of his own accord to superstitious vanities he found a good many instances in classic persian and italian literature of the outbreak of underground waters and there it was always a god who caused iteither by chasing rivernymphs or by showing the power of a horses heels or from benevolent motives and a desire to water gardens therefore sir roland gathered hope he had not invested his mind as yet in implicit faith in anything but rather was inclined to be tolerant and tentative and diffident of his own opinions and these not being particularly strong selfassertive or selfimportant and not being founded on any rock but held on the briefest buildinglease their owner leaseholder or tenantatwill was a very pleasant man to talk with that means of course when he could be got to talk and less and less could he be got to talk as the few people who had the key to his liking dropped off and no others came never even in his brightest days had he been wont to sparkle flash or even glow in converse he simply had a soft large way of listening and a small dry knack of so diverting serious thought that genial minds went roving but now his own mind had grown more and more accustomed to go aroving and though having never paid any attention to questions of science or even to the weather now gradually becoming one of them he could not satisfy himself about the menacing appearance in a very few hours he buried the portent in a still more portentous pile of books but alice though fond of reading and of meditating in her little way was too full of youth and of healthy life to retire into the classic ages of even our english language her delight was rather in the writers of the day so many of whom were making themselves the writers of all future dayscoleridge wordsworth campbell and above all others the wizard of the north whose lays of romance and legend were a spur that raised the clear spirit of alice on the third day from the woeburns rise she sat in her garden bower absorbed in her favourite lady of the lake her bower though damp and mossy and dishevelled by the storms of autumn was still a pleasant place to rest in when the view was clear and bright the fairest view however now and the most attractive study were not of flower and tree and landscape but of face and figurethe face of alice lorraine so gentle pure and rapt with poetic thought and the perfect maiden form inspired by the roused nobility of the mind the hair in lines of flowing softness fallen back disclosed the clear tranquillity of forehead in contrast with the quick tremor of lip and the warmth that tinted now and then the delicate moulding of bright young cheeks and as the sweet face more and more lit up with sequent thought and bowed with the flitting homage of a reader genial tears for dead and buried love and grief and gallantry arose and glistened in dark grey eyes and hung like the gem that quivers in the lashes of the sundew plaize miss halice my leddy desireth to see you at wonst if you plaize miss thus spake the practical and in appearance most unpoetical trotman glancing at alice and then at her book with more curiosity than he durst convey please to say that i will be with her as soon as i can finish some important work she answered speedily quenching trotmans hope of finding out what she was reading so as to melt the housemaids therewith at night well she always were a rum un he muttered in his disappointment as he returned to his own little room which he always called his study the captain will have to stand on his head to please her or im mistaken why a body scarce dare look at her sooner him than me say i although she is such a booty but the old un will give her her change i hope meanwhile the young lady unloved of trotman because she held fast by old mr binns put aside with a sigh both the poem and her own poetic dreamings and proved that her temper however strong was sweet and large and well controlled by bridling her now closed lips from any peevish exclamation she waited a little time until the glow of her cheeks abated and the sparkle of her eyes was tranquil and then she put her pretty hat on deep brown trimmed with plumes of puce and thinking no more of herself than that set forth to encounter her grandmother by this time alice lorraine had grown from a sensitive spirited girl into a sensitive spirited woman the things which she used to think and feel to be right she was growing to know to be right and the fleeting of doubt from her face was beginning to form the soft expression that is to sayif it can be described and happily it never can begoodwill largeness of heart rich mercy sympathy and quick tenderness combined with grace and refinement towards the perfection of womanly countenance so whatever there was to be done this alice was always quite ready to do it she had not those outlets for her active moods which young ladies have at the present day who find or form an unknown quantity of most pressing duties oh no i have no time to marry anybody they exclaim in a breathless manner if i did i must either neglect my district or my natural history poor alice had neither district duckweed net nor even microscope and what was even worse she had no holy priest to guide her thoughts no texts to work in moss and sago nor even any croquet whatever she did she had to do without any rush of the feminine mind into masculine channels prepared for it and even without any partnership of dear and good companions so that the fight before her was to be fought out by herself alone this was the last quiet day of her life the last day for thinking of little things the last day of properly feeding her pets her poultry and tame hares and pigeons selfimportant robins perched upon their own impudence and sweetly trustful turtledoves that have no dream of evil she fed them all and if it were not her last day of feeding them it was the last time she could feed them happily and without envying their minds this was that important work which she was bound to attend to before she could hurry to the side of her grandmother that fine old lady always made a point of sending for alice whenever she knew her needor rather without knowing needed the relief of a little explosion her dignity strictly barred this outlet towards those creatures of a lower creation who had the bliss of serving her to all such people she was most forbearing in a large and liberal style because it must be so impossible for them at all to understand her and for this courteous manner every woman in the place disliked her the men however having slower perceptions thought that her ladyship was quite right they could make allowances for herthat they could and after all if you come to think of it the femmel race was most aggravating so they listened to what the women had to tell and without contradiction wisely let female opinion waste itself lady valeria lorraine though harassed and weakened by rheumatism and pain of the nerves which she sternly attributed to the will of god and the weather still sat as firmly erect as ever and still exacted by a glance alone all those little attentions which she looked so worthy to receive the further she became removed from the rising generation the greater was the height of contempt from which she deigned to look down upon it so that alice used to say to her father sometimes i wonder whether i have any right to exist grandmamma seems to think it so impertinent of me one thing is certain sir roland answered with a quiet smile at his favourite and that is that you cannot exist without impertinence my dear this fine old lady was dressed with her usual taste and elaboration no clumsy chits would she have to help her during the three hours occupied by what she termed most truly her devotions she wore a marooncoloured velvet gown of the softest and richest fabric trimmed not too profusely with exquisite pointlace while her cap of the same lace with dovecoloured ribbon at the same time set off and was surpassed by the beauty of her snowwhite hair among many other small crotchets she held that brilliants did not suit a very old lady and she wore no jewels except a hoop of magnificent pearls with a turquoise setting to preserve her ancient weddingring and now as her grandchild entered quietly she was a little displeased at delay and feigned to hear no entrance here i am grandmamma if you please said alice after three most graceful curtseys which she was always commanded to make and made with much private amusement will you please to look round grandmamma and tell me what you want of me i could scarcely have dreamed answered lady valeria slowly turning towards her grandchild and smiling with superior dignity that any member of our family would use the very words of the clown in the ring but perhaps as i always try to think you are more to be pitied than condemned partly through your own fault and partly through peculiar circumstances you have lost those advantages which a young lady of our house is entitled to you have never been at court you have seen no society you have never even been in london alas it is all too true grandmamma but how often have you told me that i never must hope in this degenerate age to find any good model to imitate and you have always discouraged me by presenting yourself as the only one for me to follow you are quite right said the ancient lady failing to observe the turn of thought as alice was certain that she would do else scarcely would she have ventured it but you do not make the most of even that advantage you can read and write perhaps better than you ought or better than used to be thought at all needful but you cannot come into a room or make a tolerable curtsey and you spend all your time with dogs and poets and barrows of manure and little birds now really madam you are too hard upon me i may have had a barrowload of poets but more than a month ago you gave orders that i was not to have one bit more of manure certainly i did and high time it was a young gentlewoman to dabble in worms and stablestuff and filthiness however i did not send for you to speak about such little matters what i have to say is for your own good and i will trouble you not to be playing with your hands but just listen to me i beg your pardon said alice gently i did not know i was moving my hands i will listen without doing that any more now my dear child began lady valeria being softened by the dutiful manner and sweet submission of the girl whatever we do is for your own good you are not yet old enough to judge what things may profit and what may hurt you even i who had been brought up in a wholly superior manner could not at your age have thought of anything i was ready to be led by wiser people although i had seen a good deal of the world and you who have seen nothing must be only too glad to do the same you know quite well what has long been settled between your dear father and myself about what is to be done with you to be done with me exclaimed poor alice despite her resolve to hold her tongue to be done with me as if i were just a bundle of rags to be got rid of prouder and handsomer girls than you answered lady valeria quietlyfor she loved to provoke her grandchild partly because it was so hard to dohave become bundles of rags by indulging just such a temper as yours is you will now have the goodness to listen to me without any vulgar excitement your marriage with captain chapman has for a very long time been agreed upon it is high time now to appoint the day sir remnant chapman has done me the honour of a visit upon that subject he is certainly a man of the true old kind though his birth is comparatively recent i was pleased with him and i have pledged myself to the marriage within three months from this day it cannot be it shall not be you may bury me but not marry me who gave you the right to sell me and who made me to be sold you selfish coldheartedno i beg your pardon i know not what i am saying you may well fall away child and cower like that when you have dared to use such dreadful words no you may come to yourself as you please i am not going to give you any volatile salts or ring and make a scene of it that is just what you would like and to be petted afterwards i hope you have not hurt yourself so much as you have hurt me perhaps by your violent want of selfcontrol i am not an old womanas you were going to call mebut an elderly lady and i have lived indeed to be too old when any one descended from me has so little good blood in her as to call her grandmother an old woman i am very very sorry said alice with catches of breath as she spoke and afraid to trust herself yet to rise from the chair into which she had fallen i used no such words that i can remember but i spoke very rudely i must confess i scarcely know what i am to do when i hear such dreadful things unless i bite my tongue off i quite agree with you and i believe it is the very best thing all young people can do but i strive to make every allowance for you because you have been so very badly brought up now come to this window child and look out tut tuttears indeed what are young girls made of now white sugar in a wet teacup now if the result of your violence allows you to see anything at all perhaps you will tell me what that black line is among the rough ground at the bottom of the hill to me it is perfectly clear although i am such a very old woman why of course it is the woeburn madam it has been there for three days you know what it means and you calmly tell me that i know that it means harm of course but i really could not help its coming and it has not done any harm as yet no alice it waits its due time of course three months is its time i believe for running before it destroys the family your marriage affords the only chance of retrieving the fortunes of this house so as to defy disasters three months therefore is the longest time to which we can possibly defer it how many times have we weakly allowed you to slip out of any certain day but now we have settled that you must be mrs chapman by the th of january at the latest oh grandmamma to think that i ever should live to be called mrs chapman the name is a very good one alice though it may not sound very romantic but poor sir remnant i fear is unlikely to last for a great time longer he seemed so bent and his sight so bad and requiring so much refreshment and then of course you would be lady chapman if you care about such trifles it is a piteous prospect madam and i think captain chapman must be older than his father you know the old picture the downhill of life the excellent and affectionate couple descending so nicely handinhand well i should illustrate that at once i should have to lead myno i wont call him husbandbut my tottering partner down the hill whenever we came to see you and papa oh that would be so interesting you silly child you might do much worse than that lady de lampnor has promised most kindly to see to your outfit in london but i cannot talk of that at present there now you may go i have told you all thank you grandmamma but if you please i have not told you all nor half it need not however take very long it is just this no power on earth shall ever compel me to marry stephen chapman unless indeed it were so to happen you disobedient and defiant creatureunless what should happen unless the existence and even the honour of the lorraines required it but of that i see no possibility at all at present it seems to be nothing more than a small and ignominious scheme more and more i despise and dislike that heroic officer i will not be sacrificed for nothing and i have not the smallest intention of being the purchasemoney for old acres after that i shall leave you to your father answered lady valeria growing tired it may amuse you to talk so largely and perhaps for the moment relieves you but your small selfwill and your childish fancies cannot be always gratified however i will ask you one thing if the honour and even the life of lorraine can be shown to you to require it will you sacrifice your noble self i will answered alice with brave eyes flashing and looking tall and noble if the honour of the lorraines depends upon me i will give myself and my life for it chapter lviii a heros return hilary was so weak and weary and so seriously ill when at last he reached the rectory that his uncle and aunt would not hear of his coming downstairs for a couple of days at least they saw that his best chance of escaping some long and perhaps fatal malady was to be found in rest and quietude nursing and kindly feeding and the worst of it was that whatever they did they could not bring him to feed a quarter so kindly as he ought to do the rector said confound the fellow and mrs hales shook her head and cried poor dear as dish after dish and dainty little plate came out of his room untasted and now on the morning of that same day on which alice thus had pledged herself being the third from her brothers arrival of which she was wholly ignorant the rector of west lorraine arose and girded himself and ate his breakfast with no small excitement he had received a new clerical vestment of the loftiest symbolism and he hoped to exhibit it at the head of a very long procession about poor hilary what am i to do asked mrs hales coming into the lobby to see her good husband array himself all sorts of things may happen while you are away now caroline how can you ask such a question feed feed feed thats the line of treatment and above all things lock up your medicinechest he wants no squills or scammony or even your patent electuaryof all things the most abominable though i am most ungrateful to call it sofor i owe to it half my burialfees he wants no murderous doctors stuff he wants a good breakfastthats what he wants but my dear you forget answered good mrs hales who kept a small wardrobe of bottles and pills gallipots powders and little square scales you are quite overlooking the state of his tongue he has not eaten the size of my little finger why why because of the fur on his tongue bless the boys tongue and yours too cried the rector i should not care twopence about his tongue if he only used his teeth properly ah struan struan those who have never known what ache or pain is cannot hope to understand the system i know exactly how to treat hima course of gentle drastics first and then three days of my electuary and then cardamomum exhibited with liquor potassy doctoring has always been in my dear mothers family and when your time comes to be ill and weak how often you will thank providence i thank the lord for all things said the parson who was often of a religious turn but i must be brought very low indeed ere i thank him for your electuary put on your new huntingcoat my dear there it hangs and i know that you are dying to exhibit it the vanity of men surpasses even the love of women there there you never will learn how to put a coat on just come to the hallchair for me to pull it up you are so unreasonably tall that you never can get your coat up at the neck now will you have it done or will you go as you are and look a regular figure in the saddle you call it a bottlegreen i call it a green without the bottle caroline sometimes you are most provoking it is not your nature but you try to do it the cloth is of quite an invisible green as the man in london told memanufactured on purpose for ecclesiastics though hundreds of parsons god knows go after the hounds in the good old scarlet if you say any more i will order a scarlet and keep west grinstead in countenance they always do it in the west of england in invisible green i am a hypocrite now dont excite yourself struan or you wont enjoy your opening day at all and i am sure that the green is as bright as can be and you look very wellvery well indeed though i dont quite see how you can button it perhaps it is meant for a buttonhook or a leather thong over your stomach dear it is meant to fit me mrs hales and it fits me to a nicety it could not fit better and it will be too easy when we have had a few hard runs where are my daughters they know a good fit and they know how to put a thing on my shoulders carry madge and cecil come to the rescue of your father your father is baited worse than any badger come all of you dont stop a minute or get perverted by your mother now in simple truth what do you say to this my dears each speak her own opinion it suits you most beautifully papa papa i think that i never saw you look a quarter so well before my dear father if there are any ladies mamma will have reason to be jealous but i fear that i see the backseam starting you clever little cecil i am afraid that it is i feel a relief in myahemi mean an uncomfortable looseness in the chest i told the fellow fortyeight inches at least he has scamped the cloth the london rascal however we can spare it from round the waist as soon as our poor cobble can see to it but for todayah yes well thought of my darling go and get some of your green pursesilk you can herringbone it so as to last for the day at least your mother will show you how to do it madge tell bonny to run and tell robert not to bring the mare yet for a quarter of an hour now ladies i am at your mercy now papa dear asked cecil as she stitched away at the seam of her fathers burly back if poor cousin hilary should get up and want to go out what are we to do how can you even put such a question even on our opening day i would not dream of leaving the house if i thought that you could be so stupid as to let that poor boy out i would not have him seen in the parish and i would not have his own people see him even for the brush of the foxcoombe fox who is older than the hills they say and no hound dare go near him one of you must be always handy and if he gets restless turn the key on him nothing can be simpler with his bottlegreen coat now warranted to last unless he overbuttoned it the rector kissed his dear wife and daughters and then universal good wishes applauses and kissings of hand set him forth on his way with a bright smile spread upon his healthy face now mind we are left in charge said madge you are his doctor of course mamma but we are to be his constables i hope to goodness that he will eat byandby it makes me so miserable to see him and the trouble we have had to keep the servants from knowing who he is mamma my dear your father has ordered it so for my part i cannot see why there should be so much mystery about it but he always knows better than we do of course surely mamma suggested cecil it would be a dreadful shock to the family to receive poor hilary in such a condition just after the appearance of that horrid water they would put the two things together and believe it the beginning of great calamities now my dear child answered mrs hales who loved to speak a word in season let not us who are christians hearken to such superstitious vanities trust in the lord and all will be well he holdeth in the hollow of his hands the earth and all that therein is yea and the waters that be under the earth now run up and see whether your poor cousin has eaten that morsel of anchovy toast and tell him that i am going to prepare his draught but he must not take the pills until halfpast eleven oh mamma dear youll drive him out of the house poor fellow how i do pity him now hilary certainly deserved this pitynot for his bodily ailments only and the cruel fate which had placed him at the mercy of the medicinechest but more especially for the low and feverish condition of his heart and mind brooding perpetually on his disgrace and attributing to himself more blame than his folly and failure demanded he lost the refreshment of dreamless sleep which his jaded body called out for no rest could he find in the comforting words of his uncle and aunt and cousins he knew that they were meant for comfort and such knowledge vexes or at least it irritates a man until the broader time of life when things are taken as they are meant and any good word is welcome he was not however so very far gone as to swallow his dear aunts boluses he allowed his pillow to take his pills and his goodnatured cousins let him swallow them as much as a juggler swallows swords i cant take them while you are looking he said when you come in again you will find them gone now one of the girlsit was never known which because all three denied itstupidly let the sick cousin know that the master of the house was absent hilary paid no special heed at the moment when he heard it but after a while he began to perceive as behoved a blockaded soldier that here was his chance for a sally and he told them so after his gravybeef and a raw egg beaten up with sherry how cunning you are now said cecil who liked and admired him very deeply but you are not quite equal master captain to female ingenuity the spanish ladies must have taught you that if half that i hear is true of them now you need not look so wretched because i know nothing about them only this i know that out of this house you are not allowed to go withoutoh what do you call ita pass or a watchword or a countersign or something or other from papa himself so you may just as well lie downor mamma will come up with a powder for you the will of the lord be done said hilary but cecil you are getting very pretty and you need not take away my breeches i am sorry to do it cousin hilary but i know quite well what i am about and none of your military ways of going on can mislead me as to your character you want to be off we are quite aware of it you can scarcely put two feet to the ground oh dear how many ought i to be able to put you know bestat least four i should hope but you are not equal to argument and we are all particularly ordered to keep you from what is too much for you now i shall take away these thingswhatever they are called i have no idea but i do what i am told to do and after this you will take that glass of red wine declared to be wonderful and then you will shut both your eyes if you please till my father comes home from his hunting the lively girl departed with a bow of light defiance carrying away her fathers small clothes which had been left for hilary and locking the door of his bedroom with a decisive turn of a heavy key mother you may go to sleep she said as she ran down into the drawingroom i defy him to go if he were jack sheppard he has got no breeches to go in cecil you are almost too clever how your father will laugh to be sure and the excellent lady began her nap as the afternoon wore away hilary grew more and more impatient of his long confinement not only that he pined for the open airas of course he must do after living so long with the free sky for his canopybut also that he felt most miserable at being so near the old house on the hill yet doubtful of his reception there more than once he rang the bell but the old nurse who alone of the servants was allowed to enter would do no more than scold or coax him and quietly lock him in again so at last he got out of bed and feebly made his way to the window and thence beheld betwixt him and the grassy mounds of the churchyard that swift black stream which had so surprised him on the night of his arrival since then he had been persuaded himself or allowed others to persuade him that the water had been a vision only of his weak and exited brain but now he saw it clearly calmly and in a very few moments knew what it was and of what dark import how can i have let them keep me here he exclaimed with indignation my father and sister must believe me dead while i play at this miserable hideandseek perhaps they will think that i had better have been dead but at any rate they shall know the truth with these words he took up his sailorclothes which the clever cecil had overlooked and which had been left in his room for fear of setting the servants talking and he dressed himself as well as he could and tried to look clean and tidy but do what he might he could only cut a poor and sorry figure and looking in the glass he was frightened at his wan and worn appearance then knowing the habits of the house and wishing to avoid excitement he waited until the two elder daughters were gone down the village for their gossip and cecil was seeing the potatoes dug and mrs hales sleeping over fisher or patrick while the cook was just putting the dinner down and then without trying the door at all he quietly descended from the window with the help of a stackpipe and a spurry peartree so feeble was he now that this slight exertion made him turn faint and sick and giddy and he was obliged to sit down and rest under a shrub into which he had staggered but after a while he found himself getting a little better and pulling up one of the dahliastakes to help himself along with he made his way to the gate and there being cut off from the proper road followed the leave of the land and the water along the valley upward alice lorraine had permitted herself not quite to lose her temper but still to get a little worried by her grandmothers exhortations of all living beings she felt herself to be one of the very most reasonable and whenever she began to doubt about it she knew there was something wrong with her her favourite cure for this state of mind was a free and independent ride over the hills and far away she hated to have a groom behind her watching her and perhaps criticising the movements of her figure but as it was scarcely the proper thing for miss lorraine to be scouring the country like a yeomans daughter she always had to start with a trusty groom but she generally managed to get rid of him and now having vainly coaxed her father to come for a breezy canter alice set forth about four oclock for an hour of rapid air to clear invigorate and enliven her whatever she did or failed of doing when her grandmother was too much for her she always looked graceful and bright and kind but she never looked better than when she was sitting beautifully straight on her favourite mare skimming the sward of the hills or bowing her head in some tangled covert this day she allowed the groom to chase her like the black care that sits behind until she had taken free burst of the hills and longed to see things quietly and then she sent him in the kindest manner to a very old woman at lower chancton to ask whether she had been frightened and when he had turned the corner of a difficult plantation alice took her course for that which she had made up her mind to do according to the ancient stories no fairblooded creatures such as man or horse cow dog or pigeon would ever put lip to the accursed stream whereas all foul things polecats foxes fitches badgers ravens and the like were drawn by it as by a loadstone and made a feastingplace of it so alice resolved that her darling elfrida should be compelled to pant with thirst and then should have the fairest offer of the water of the woeburn and of this intent she was so full that she paid no heed to the dressing bell clanging over the lonely hill nor even to her pet mares sense of dinner but took a short cut of her own knowledge down a lonely borstall to the channel of new waters the stream had risen greatly even since the day before yesterday and now in full volume swept on grandly towards the river adur any one who might chance to see it for the first time and without any impression or even idea concerning it could scarcely fail to observe how it differed from ordinary waters not only through its pellucid blackness and the swaying of long grass under it whose every stalk and sheath and awn and even empty glume was clear as they quivered wavered severed and spread or sheafed themselves together again and hustled in their common immersionnot only in this and the absence of any waterplants along its margin was the stream peculiar but also in its force and flow it did not lip or lap or ripple or gurgle or wimple or even murmur as all wellmeaning rivers do but swept on in one even sweep with a face as smooth as the best plateglass and the silent slide of nightfall now the truth of the old saying was made evident to alice that one can take a horse to water but a score cannot make him drink unless he is so minded though it was not an easy thing to get elfrida to the water she started away with flashing eyes pricked ears and snorting nostrils and nothing but perfect faith in alice would have made her even come anigh but as for drinking or even wetting her nose in that black liquidmight the horsefiend seize her if she dreamed of doing a thing so dark and unholy you shall you shall you wicked little witch cried alice who was often obstinate i mean to drink it and we wont have any superstition she leaped off lightly with her skirt tucked up and taking the mare by the cheekpiece of the bridle drew her forward come along come along you shall drink if you dont ill pour it up your nostrils frida somehow or other you shall swallow it you know i wont have any nonsense dont you the beautiful filly with great eyes partly defiant and partly suppliant drew back her straight nose and blowing nostrils and the glistening curve of the foamy lip not even a hair of her muzzle should touch the face of the accursed water very well then you shall have it thus cried alice with her curved palm brimming with the unpopular liquid when suddenly a shadow fell on the shadowy brilliance before hera shadow distinct from her own and elfridas and cast further into the wavering who are you cried alice turning sharply round and what business have you on my fathers land she was in the greatest fright at the sudden appearance of a foreign sailor and the place so lonely and beyond all help but without thinking twice she put a brave face on her terror who am i said hilary trying to get up a sprightly laugh well i think you must have seen me once or twice in the course of your long life miss lorraine oh hilary hilary hilary she threw herself into his arms with a jump relying upon his accustomed strength and without any thought of the difference he tottered backwards and must have fallen but for the trunk of a pollard ash and seeing how it was she again cried out oh hilary hilary hilary that is my name he answered after kissing her in a timid manner but not my nature at the present moment i am not so very hilarious why you are not fit to walk or talk or even to look like a hero you are the bravest fellow that ever was born oh how proud we are of you my darling what is the matter why you look as if you did not know me help help help he is going to die oh for gods sake help poor hilary after looking wildly around and trying in vain to command his mouth fell suddenly back convulsed distorted writhing foaming and wallowing in the depths of epilepsy sky hill and tree swung to and fro across his strained and starting eyes and then whirled round like a spinningwheel with radiating sparks and spots then all fell into abyss of darkness down a bottomless pit into utter and awful loss of everything the vigour of youth had fought against this robbery of humanity so long and hard that alice the only spectator of the conflict began to recover from shriek and wailing at the time that her brother fell into the black insensibility the ground sloped so that if she had not been there the unfortunate youth must have rolled into the woeburn and so ended but being a prompt and active girl she had saved him from this at any rate she had had the wit also to save his tongue by slipping a glove between his teeth which scarcely a girl in a hundred who saw such a thing for the first time would have done and now though her face was bathed in tears and her hands almost as tremulous as if themselves convulsed she filled her lowcrowned ridinghat with water from the river and sprinkled his forehead gently and released his neck from cumbrance and then she gazed into his thin pale features and listened for the beating of his heart this was so low that she could not hear or even feel it anywhere oh how can i get him home she cried oh my only brother my only brother in fright and misery she leaped upon a crest of chalk to seek around for any one to help her and suddenly she espied her groom against the skyline a long way off galloping up the ridge from chancton in hope that one of the many echoes of the cliffs might aid her she shrieked with all her power and tore a white kerchief from under her ridinghabit and put it on her whip and waved it and presently she had the joy of seeing the horses head turned towards her the rider had not caught her voice but had descried some white thing fluttering between him and the sombre stripe which he was watching earnestly this groom was a strong and hearty man and the father of seven children he made the best of the case and ventured to comfort his young mistress and then he laid hilary upon elfrida the docile and softstepper and making him fast with his own bridle and other quick contrivances he tethered his own horse to a tree and leading the mare set off with alice walking carefully and supporting the head of her senseless brother so came this hero after all his exploits back to the home of his fathers chapter lix the grave of the astrologer what can i do oh how can i escape cried alice to herself one morning towards the end of dreary november one month out of three is gone already and the chain of my misery tightens round me no dont come near me any of you birds you will have to do without me soon and you had better begin to practise ah me you can make your own nests and choose your mates how i envy you well then if you must be fed you must why should i be so selfish with tears in her eyes she went to her bower and got her little basket of moss well known to every cockrobin and thrush and blackbird dwelling on the premises at the bottom were stored in happy ignorance of the fate before them all the delicacies of the seasonthe food of woodland song the stimulants of aerial melody here were woodlice beetles earwigs caterpillars slugs and nymphs wellgirt brandlings and the offspring of the tightlybuckled wasp together with the luscious mealworm and the peculiarly delicious grub of the cockchaferall as fresh as a westend salmon and savouring sweetly of moss and milkno wonder the beaks of the birds began to water at the mere sight of that basket you have had enough now for today said alice it is useless to put all your heads on one side and pretend that you are just beginning i know all your tricks quite well by this time no not even you you methuselah of a bob can have any moreor at least not much for this robin her old pet of all and through whose powers of interpretation the rest had become so intimate made a point of perching upon her collar and nibbling at her ear whenever he felt himself neglected there is no friend like an old friend was his motto and his poll was grey and his beak quite blunted with feeding a score of families and his large black eyes were fading methuselah come and help yourself said alice relenting softly you will not have the chance much longer now as soon as the birds with a chirp and a jerk and one or two furtive hops had realised the stern fact that there was no more for them and then had made off to their divers business but all with an eye to come back again alice with a smiling sighif there can be such a mixtureleft her pets and set off alone to have a good walk and talk and think the birds being guilty of cupboard love were content to remain in their trees and digest and as many of them as were in voice expressed their gratitude brilliantly but out of the cover they would not budge they hated to be ruffled up under their tails and they knew what the wind on the downs was i shall march off straight for chancton ring said alice lorraine most resolutely how thankful i am to be able to walk and poor hilaryah how selfish of me to contrast my state with his briskly she mounted the crest of the coombe and passed to the open upland the long chine of hill which trends to its highest prominence at chancton ringa landmark for many a league around crossing the trench of the celtic campa very small obstruction nowwhich loosely girds the ancient trees alice entered the vegetable throng of weatherbeaten and fantastic trunks these are of no great size and shed no impress of hushed awe as do the mossy ramparts and columnar majesty of new forest beechtrees yet from their countless and furious struggles with the winds in their might in the wild midnight and from their contempt of aid or pity in their loneliness they enforce the respect and the interest of any who sit beneath them at the foot of one of the largest trees the perplexed and disconsolate alice rested on a lowly mound which held if faith was in tradition the bones of her native ancestor the astrologer agasicles the tree which overhung his grave perhaps as a sapling had served to rest without obstructing his telescope and the boughs whose murmurings soothed his sleep had been little twigs too limp for him to hang his samian cloak on now his descendant in the ninth or tenth generationwhichever it washad always been endowed with due but mainly rare respect for those who must have gone before her she could not perceive that they must have been fools because many things had happened since they died and she was not even aware that they must have been rogues to beget such a set of rogues therefore she had veneration for the remains that lay beneath her mouldering in no ugly coffin but in swaddlingclothes committed like an infant into the mothers bosom and the young woman dwelt as all mortals must on death when duly put to them the everlasting sorrow of the moving winds was in the trees and the rustling of the sad sere leaf and creaking of the lichened bough and above their little bustle and small fuss about themselves the large sonorous stir was heard of weymouth pines and scottish firs swaying in the distance slowly like the murmur of the sea even the waving of yellow grassblades where the trees allowed them and the ruffling of tufted briars and of thorny thickets shone and sounded melancholy with a farewell voice and gaze in the midst of all this autumn sound alice felt her spirits fall she knew that they were low before and she was here to enlarge and lift them with the breadth of boundless prospect and the height of the breezy hill but fog and cloud came down the weald and grey encroachment creeping and on the hilltops lay some heavy sense of desolation and alice being at heart in union with the things around her although she tried to be so brave began to be weighed down and lonesome sad and wondering and afeared from time to time she glanced between the uncouth pillars of the trees to try to be sure of no man being in among them hiding and every time when she saw no one she was so glad that she need not look againand then she looked again it is quite early she said to herself nothingnot even three oclock i get into the stupidest fearfullest ways from such continual nursing how i wish poor hilary was here one hour of this fine breeze and cheerful scenemy goodness what was that the cracking of a twig without any sign of what had cracked it the rustle of trodden leaves but no one in and out the graves of leafage visible to trample them and then the sound of something waving and a sharp snap as of metal and a shout into the distant valley it is the astrologer thought alice oh why did i laugh at him he has felt me sitting on his dear old head he is waving his cloak and snapping his casket he has had me in view for his victim always and now he is shouting for me in confirmation of this opinion a tall grey form with one arm thrown up and a long cloak hanging gracefully came suddenly gliding between the trees the maiden whose brain had been overwrought tried to spring up with her usual vigour but her power failed her she fell back against the sepulchral trunk and did not faint but seemed for the moment very much disposed thereto when she was perfectly sure of herself and rid of all presence of spectres she found a strong arm behind her head and somebody leaning over her and she laid both hands before her face without meaning any rudeness having never been used to be handled at all except by her brother or father i beg your pardon most humbly madam but i was afraid of your knocking yourself sir i thank you i was very foolish but now i am quite well again will you take my hand to get up i am sure i was scared as much as you were now if i could only believe that said alice my selfrespect would soon return for you do not seem likely to be frightened very easily she was blushing already and now her confusion deepened with the consciousness that the stranger might suppose her to be admiring his manly figure of which of course she had not been thinking even for one moment i ought not to be so he answered in the simplest manner possible but i had a sunstroke in america fifteen months ago or so and since that i have been good for nothing may i tell you who i am oh yes i should like so much to know alice was surprised at herself as she spoke but the strangers unusually simple yet most courteous manner led her on i am one joyce aylmer not very well known though at one time i hoped to become so a major in his majestys servicehere he lifted his hat and bowedbut on the sicklist ever since we fought the americans at fort detroit oh major aylmer i have often heard of you and how you fell into a sad brainfever through saving the life of a poor little child my uncle mr hales knows you i believe and has known your father for many years that is so and i am almost sure that i must be talking to miss lorraine the daughter of sir roland lorraine whom my father has often wished to know yes and perhaps you know my brother who has served in the peninsula and is now lying very ill at home i am very sorry indeed to hear that of him i know him of course by reputation as the hero of badajos but i think i was ordered across the atlantic before he joined or at any rate i never met him that i know ofthough i shall hope to do so soon may i see you across this lonely hill having frightened you so i may claim the right to prevent any others from doing it alice would have declined the escort of any other stranger but she had heard such noble stories of this major aylmer and felt such pity for a brave career baffled by its own bravery which in some degree resembled her poor brothers fortunes that she gave him one of her soft bright smiles such a smile as he never had received before therefore he set down his broad sketchbook and case of pencils and went to the rim of the ring that looks towards the vale of sussex and there he shouted to countermand the groom who had been waiting for him at the farmhouse far below i am ordered to ride about he said as he returned to alice and be out of doors all daya very pleasant medicine and so for something to do i have taken up my old trick of drawing because i must not follow hounds i would not talk so about myself except to show you how it was that you did not hear me moving how soon it gets dark on the top of these hills cried alice most unscientifically i always believe that they feel it sooner because they see the sun go down that seems to me to be a fine idea joyce aylmer answered faithfully and his mind was in a loose condition of reason all the way to coombe lorraine chapter lx courtly manners sir remnant chapman in his dry old fashion was a stronglydetermined man he knew the bitter strait of coombe lorraine for ready money and from his father sir barker chapman a notorious usurer he had inherited the gift of spinning a disc into a globe but like most of the men who labour thus to turn their guineas he could be very liberal with them for the advancement of his family and though the chapmans had gradually acquired such a length of rentroll their pedigree was comparatively short among their norman neighbours nothing would cure that local defect more speedily and permanently than a wedlock with lorraine and father and son were now eager tenfold by reason of hilarys illness they had made up their minds that he must die within a few months and then alice of course would be the heiress of coombe lorraine but the marriage must be accomplished first before the mourning stopped it then hilary would drop out of the way and after sir rolands time was passed and the properties had been united there ought not to be any very great trouble with plenty of money to back the claim in awakening the dormant earldom of lorraine and enhancing its glory with a chapman to secure all this success at once they set forth in their yellow coach one fine november morning they knew that sir roland was fretting and pining although too proud to speak of it at his sons disgrace and the crippled and fettered fortunes of the family even apart from poor hilarys illness and perhaps fatal despondency the head of the house of lorraine would have felt with his ancient pride and chivalry that a stain must lie on his name until the money was made good again and now the last who could prolong male heritage unbrokenof which the lorraines were especially proudwas likely to go to a world that does not heed direct successionexcept from the sinful adamfor the want of cut and clipped and cleft with fissures of adjacent owners the once broad lands of lorraine were now reduced for the good of the neighbours but even in those evil days when long war had lowered everything the residue of the estates would have been for that sum good security being worth about twice the money this however was of no avail because by the deed of settlement made in the time of the late sir roger under the lady valeria nothing could be bound beyond lifeinterest while alice was living and under age this point had been settled hopelessly by reference to the highest and deepest legal authority of the age sir glanvil malahide kc sir glanvil was not all the man to stultify his own doings he had been instructed to tie tight and he was pleased to show now how tight he had tied after his own remonstrance i am of opinion wrote this great lawyer after drawing his pen through the endorsement of a fiftyguinea fee on the case that under the indentures of lease and release dated aug th and th the estates comprised therein are assured to uses precluding any possibility of valid title being made until alice lorraine is of age or deceased there was a good deal more of course but that was the gist of the matter having learned from the rector how these things stood the captain devised a clever stroke by which he could render the escape of alice almost an impossibility for by this contrivance he could make sir roland most desirous of the match who up to the present though well aware of the many substantial advantages offered had always listened to his daughters pleading and promised not to hurry her the captains plan was very simple as all great ideas are the honour of the family was to be redeemed by the sacrifice of alice for among other points it had been arranged upon the treaty of marriage that should be settled on alice for her separate use with the usual powers of appointment now the captains excellent idea was that on his weddingday this sum should be paid in hard cash to sir roland and hilary as trustees for alice and they by deed of even date should charge that sum on the lorraine estatevaleat quantum as the lawyers say for they could only bind their own interests the solicitors would be directed to waive the obvious objections which might lead to mischief or might not according to circumstances thus the flaw of title which would be fatal to any coldblooded mortgage might well be turned to good use when stopped by a snug little family arrangement sir remnant with inherited instinct saw the blot of this conception it comes to this he said as soon as ever he was told of it that you get the lorraine property saddled with a loss of which has gone to the scoundrelly government the government rob us all they can in a sensible point of view young lorraine is the first sensible man of his family he has stolen which the government stole from us taxpayers as for paying it back againan idiot might think of it it makes me kick and that always hurts me nevertheless he was brought round when he had kicked his passion out as most of the obstinate old men are to the plans and aims of the younger ones steenie was a foolthey all were foolsthere was scarcely any sense left in anybody but himself and the boy who stole all that money and was dying for fear of being prosecuted sir remnant could not bring himself to believe a word of the story except as himself had shaped it thus he worked himself up with his want of faith to believe that poor hilary had got the money buried somewhere on the downs and would dig it up like a morel as soon as the stir of the moment was over if so there could be no loss after all only it would have been very much better to make no fuss about the money stolen revolving these things in his mind and regretting the good old times when any one if at all in a good position might have stolen without any trumpery scandal this baronet of the fine old school prepared to listen in a quiet way to any plans that would come home again and he thought that this plan of his son would do so either in money or in kind yet having formed some misty sketch of the character of sir roland each of these chapmans wished the other to begin the overture it would have been pleasant for anybody quite outside of danger to watch the great yellow coach of the captain labouring up the chalky road the best approach to coombe lorraine now that the steyning road was stopped for all who could not walk a tree by the outburst of the water all the roads were drenched just now and wet chalk is a most slippery thing especially when it has taken blue stripes from the rubbing of soft iron the drag of some heavy waggon sliding down the steep with a clank and jerk sir remnant had very little faith in his sons most expensive gift of driving and he jerked out his bad head at every corner in anxiety for his good body and soul the wicked however are protected always and thus this venturesome baronet was fetched out of his coach with much applause and a little touch of gout about him such as he would not stop to groan at sir roland lorraine was not glad to see them and did not feign to be so he wanted to be left alone just now with such a number of things to think of he perceived that they were come to hurry him about a thing he was not ripe with knowing his daughters steadfast nature and his mothers stubborn stuff in the calm of his heart he had hoped good things to balance one against the other in psychological counterpoiseas all good english writers of the present day express itor as our rude granddads said to let them fight it out between them over your books again lorraine well well i can understand all that i was pretty nigh taking to such things myself after i put my kneecap out steenie is a wonderful scholar now i believe a can construe homer that depends on the mood i am in said the captain modestly sometimes i can make out a very nice piece well that is more than any man can say in the county that i know of except of course one or two new parsons and sir roland here and some ragamuffins that come about teaching their stuff in lodgings lorraine now after all how are you how do you get through these bad times sir roland lorraine for the third time now shook hands with sir remnant chapman not from any outburst of hospitality on his part but because the other would have it so a strong opinion had newly set in that all good britons were bound to shake hands that dirty and coldblooded frenchmen bowed at a distance homicidally and therefore that wholesome englishman must squeeze one anothers knuckles to the utmost and that idea is not yet extinct and how is her ladyship asked sir remnant striking his goldheaded stick on the floor very firmly at the mere thought of her do you think she will see her most humble servant gadzooks sir she is of the true old sort i was amused the last time you were here sir roland answered smiling to find how thoroughly you and my mother seemed to understand each other i am sure that if she is well enough to see anybody she will see you meanwhile will you take something now that is not the way to put it of course i will take something i like to see the glasses all brought in and then the cupboards opened and then the young women all going about with hot and cold water and sugartongs we will try to do those little things aright the host answered very quietly by the time of your reappearance trotman is come to say that my mother will do herself the honour of receiving you steenie you stop here shouted sir remnant getting up briskly and setting his eyebrows eyes and knees for business steenie you are a boy yet and court ladies prefer the society of men no no i can pick up my cane myself just you sit down quietly steenie and entertain sir roland till i come back sir remnant though somewhat of a bear by nature prided himself on his courtly manners when occasion called for them gadzooks sir he used to say nurse my vittels if i cant make a leg with the very best of them and he carried his stick in a manner to prove that he must have kissed hands or toes or something entering lady valerias drawingroom in his daintiest manner the old reprobate as he called himself sometimes with pride and sometimes with terror according as his spirits were up or down made a slow and deep obeisance then kissed the tips of his fingers and waved them and seeing a smile on the ladys face ventured to lay his poor hand on his heart oh sir remnant you are too gallant said the lady who in good truth despised him and hated him also as the owner of great broad stripes of the land of lorraine we never get such manners now never since the court was broken up and things that it would not become me at all to hint at are encouraged you are right my lady you are right all over gadzooksahem i beg your ladyships pardon by no means sir remnant the gentlemen always in the best society were allowed to say those little things and i missed them sadly when i came down here madam my admiration of you increases with every word you speak from what i hear of the mockcourt now as you and i might call it and my son has been handinglove for years with the pr indeed the whole number of their royal highnessesin short i cannot tell your ladyshipthings are very bad very bad indeed and sir remnant made a grimace as if his own whole life had been purity i fear that is too true the lady answered looking straight at him we find things always growing worse as we ourselves grow wiser but come now and sit in this chair and tell me if you please sir remnant how the poor things are getting onyour captain and my poor grandchild well madam i need not tell a lady of your high breeding and experience the maids of the present day are not at all the same thing as they used to be but thank the lord they get on on the whole as well as can be expected but sir roland will not help us and the young maid flies and flickers and dont seem to come to know her own mind you know my lady the lord in heaven scarce knows what to make of them they will have this and they wont have that and they hates to look at anything but their swingingglasses oh sir you have not been at court for nothing you have come to a very sad view of the ladies but they deserve a great deal more than that if you were to hear what even i at this great distance know of thembut i will say no more it is always best and charitable not to speak of them so let us go back if you please sir remnant i have my own ways of considering things indeed i am obliged to have them in a manner now scarcely understood but i hear a noiseis it a mouse or a rat do you think it was neither mouse nor rat as lady valeria knew quite well it was simply poor sir remnant tapping on the floor with his walkingstick which of course he had no right to do while the lady was addressing him it sounds like a very little mouse he said or perhaps it was the deathtick it often comes in these old rooms when any of the people are going to die the old gentleman had not been at court for nothing as the old lady had told him he knew how timid and superstitious were the brave women of the fine old time now sir are you sure that you never made a tap asked lady valeria anxiously not a quarter of a tap as i hope to be saved the old reprobate answered below his breath i pay no heed to nonsense but a thing of this sort must mean something there have been a great many signs of late said the old lady after listening with her keener ear brought round and the misty lace of her beautiful cap quivering like a spiders web there seems to have been a great many signs of bad things coming in their proper time they will come before we are ready madam old scratch waits for no invitation but they say that the deathtick runs before him and keeps time with his cloven heel oh lord sir remnant how dreadfully you talk i beg you to spare me i have had no sleep since i was told of that horrible water and of my poor grandson poor hilary he has done great things and spent no money of his own and indeed he had none of his own to spend and having denied himself so is it right that he should be disgraced and break his heart because he could not help losing a little money that was not at all his own and he had taken a town worth ten times as much now truly speaking is it fair of them certainly not madam pox upon them it is the scurviest thing ever heard of and you must remember sir if you please that from his childhood upward indeed ever since he could move on two legs he always lost every sixpence put by kind people into his pockets i gave him a guinea on his very fifth birthday and in the afternoon what do you think he showed me a filthy old tobaccopipe and nothing elseno change whatever and his pride was more than he could set forth though he always was a chatterer now if such a thing as that could only be properly put at the horse guards by some one of good position surely sir remnant they would make allowance they would see that it was his nature at least they would have done so in my time of course they would of course my lady but things have been growing from year to year to such a pitch ofhere sir remnant took advantage of the ladys courtly indulgence towards bad languagethatthatthey seem to want almostgadzooks they want to treat men almost all alike they never can do that good sir they never could be such fools as to try it and bad as they may be they must be aware that my grandson has done no harm to them why the money he lost was not theirs at all it was all for the pay of the common soldiers it comes out of everybodys pocket and it goes into nobodys and to my mind it serves them all perfectly right who is that generali forget his name an irishman if i remember arightwho is he or of what family that he should put a lorraine to look after dirty money the heir of all the lorraines to be put to do a cashiers business heaven save me from such a proud woman as this thought poor sir remnant chapman if alice is like her the lord have pity on our unlucky steenie he wont dare have his nip of brandy even in a corner and now poor dear he is very ill indeed continued the ancient lady recovering from the indignation which had even wrinkled her firm and smooth forehead he has pledged his honour to make good the money and my son also thinks that the dignity of our family demands it though to me it seems quite a ridiculous thing and you of course will agree with me and the doctors say that he has something on his mind and if he cannot be relieved of it he must die poor boy and then what becomes of the name of lorraine that has been here for nearly eight hundred years it becomes extinct of course my lady answered sir remnant as calmly as if the revolution of the earth need not be stopped but it might be revived in the female line by royal licence hereafter that would be of very little use why even your grandson might be a lorraine is that what you were thinking of no no no of course not my lady nothing could be further from my thoughts the old baronet vainly endeavoured as he spoke to meet the suspicious gaze of the ladys still penetrating and bright eyes we are not so particular about the spindle she resumed with some condescension but in the sword line we must be represented duly and we never could be supplanted by a chapman gadzooks madam are the chapmans dirt but in order to show how you wrong us my lady i will tell you what i am come to propose herewith he looked very impressive and leaned both hands on his stick as if inditing of an excellent matter and thus he set forth his scheme which bore at first sight a fair and magnanimous face as if all that large sum of money were given or without security trusted for no other purpose except to save a life precious to both families the old lady listened with prudent reserve yet an inward sense of relief and even a faint suspicious gratitude she was too old now to digest very freely any generous sentiment blessed are they who crossing the limit of human years can carry with them faith in worn humanity chapter lxi a sample from kent of all trite proverbs no truer there is in the affairs of men perhaps because in the kingdom of the clouds so untrue than this venerable sayingit never rains but what it pours the chapmans had come with a storm of cash to wash away hilarys obstructions and now on that very same day there appeared a smaller but more kindly cloud to drop its little fatness just when sir roland had managed to get rid at the expense of poor alice perhaps of that tedious halfborn stephen chapman the indefatigable trotman came with his volatile particles uppermost if you plaize sir he said i cant stop un at all he saith as he will see you well if he will he must of course but who is this man of such resolute mind if you plaize sir i never had seed un from adam and i showed un the wrong way to get a little time then go now and show him the right way john i am always ready to see any one sir roland knew well that this was not true he had said it without thinking and with his pure love of truth he began to condemn himself for saying it he knew that he liked no strangers now nor even any ordinary friends and he was always sorry to hear that any one made demand to see him before he could repent of his repentance the door was opened and in walked a man of moderate stature sturdy frame and honest ruddy and determined face well shaven betwixt grey whiskers sir roland had never been wont to take much heed of the human countenance therefore he was surprised to find himself rushing to a rash conclusionan honest man if ever there was one also a very kind one the grower came forward without any sign of humility awkwardness sense of difference or that which is lowest of allintense and shallow selfassertion he knew that he was not of sir rolands rank and he had no idea of defying it he was simply a man come to speak to a man for the love of those dependent on him in the largeness of humanity at the same time he was a little afraid of going too far with anything he made a bow by no means graceful but of a tidy english sort when the back always wants to go back again and then as true englishmen generally do he waited to be spoken to i am very sorry sir roland said that you have had trouble in finding me we generally manage to get on well but sometimes things go crooked will you come and sit down here and tell me why you came to see me martin lovejoy made another bow of pattern less like a tenterhook he had come with a will to be roughly received and lo there was nothing but smoothness full as he was of his errand and the largest views of everything he had made up his mind to say something fierce and here was no opportunity for he took it for granted in his simple way that sir roland knew thoroughly well who he was i am come to see you sir roland lorraine he began with a slightly quivering voice after declining the offered chair not to press myself upon you but only for the sake of my daughter indeed the other answered beginning to suspect are you then the father of that young lady i am the father of mabel lovejoy and sorry i should be to be her father ififi mean sir if she was anybody elses daughter but being as it is she is my own dear child and no man has a better one and if any one says that she threw herself at the feet of your son for the sake of his name sir roland that man is a liar my good sir i know it i never supposed that your daughter did anything of the kind i have heard that the fault was my sons altogether then why have you never said a word to say so why did you leave us like so many dogs to come when you might whistle because we are beneath you in the world is your son to do a great wrong to my daughter while you sit up here on the top of your hill as if you had never heard of us is this all the honour that comes of high birth then i thank the almighty that we are not high born the grower struck his ashstick with disdain upon the rich turkey carpet and turned his broad back on sir roland lorraine not out of rudeness as the latter thought but to hide the moisture that came and spoiled the righteous sparkle of his eyes the baronet perhaps had never felt so small and selfcondemned before he had not been so blind and narrowminded as to forget through the past two years that every question has two sides he had often felt that the kentish homestead had a grievance against the south down castle but with his contemplative ease and hatred of any disturbance he had left the case mainly to right itself persuading himself at last that he must have done all that could be expected in making that promise to struan hales but now all the fallacy of such ideas was scattered by a fathers honest wrath and he was not a man who would argue down the rights of another when he saw them you are right mr lovejoy he said at last i have not behaved at all well to you i will make no excuses but tell you fairly that i am sorry for my conduct now that you put it so plainly and whatever i can do shall be done to make amends to your daughter amends means money from one rank to another would you dare to offer me money sir certainly not it is the very last thing i ever should dream of doing not to mention the scarcity of cash just now in such a case money is an insult i should think soi should think so what money would ever pay for our mabel if you had only seen her once you could never have been angry with your son although i was although i wasuntil i heard how ill he is but bless you sir they will do these thingsand there is no stopping them it puts one into a passion with them until one begins to remember but now sir i have heard all sorts of things is it true that master hilary lies very ill abed for want of money you put it very shortly but it comes to that he has lost a large sum of the public money and we cannot very well replace it then you should a come to me ill cure all that trouble in a jiffy said the grower tugging heavily at something well inside his waistcoat there thats a very tidy lump of money and no call to be ashamed of it in the way you high folk look at thingsbecause us never made it not a farden of it ever saw covent garden all came straight without any trade whatever he cant a lost all that anyhow martin lovejoy with broadtipped fingers and nails not altogether exempt from chewing was working away as he spoke at a bag such as wheat is sampled in and tied with whipcord round the neck sir roland lorraine without saying a word looked on and smiled softly with quiet surprise no patiencei havent no patience with counting since i broke my finger sirseventeen eighteen nineteen nowell it must be right and ive reckoned amiss our mab reckoned every pennyno longer than yesterday morningtwenty thousand pounds it must be according to the ticket there is one lot amissing oh here it is in among my fingers i do believe what slippery rubbish this bank stuff is will you please now to score them all up sir roland mr lovejoy why should i do that it cannot matter what the quantity is the meaning is what i am thinking of well sir and the meaning is just this my daughter mabel hath had a fortune left her by her godfather the famous banker lightgold over to the town of tonbridge no doubt you have heard of him sir roland and of his death six months agone well no i forget it is so far away i be so used to home that i always speak as if i was at home and they made me trustee for herthat they did showing confidence in my nature almost on the part of the laiyers sir do you think at least i took it in that way it was kind of you so to take it they have no confidence in anybodys nature whenever they can help it so i have heard sir i have heard that same and in my small way proved it but will you be pleased just to count the money i must be worse than the lawyers if i did your daughter mabel must be the best and kindesthearted and most loving of course of course cried the grower as if that point wanted no establishing but business is business sir roland lorraine i am my daughters trustee do you see and bound to be sure that her money goes right and it is a good bit of money mind you more than i could earn in all my life will you tell me exactly what she said i should like to hear her very words i beg you to sit down are you afraid that i shall run off with the trustfunds you are like your son ill be dashed if you arent excuse me sir roland for making so freebut that was just his way of turning things a sort of a something in a funny manner that won the heart of my poor maid none of our people know how to do it except of course our mabel mabel can do it answer for answer with any that come provoking her but she hathnt shown the spirit for it now ever sincethe lord knows what was the name of the town master hilary took that signifies nothing neither here nor there only it showeth how they do take on yes mr lovejoy i see all that but what was it your good daughter said she is always saying something sirsomething or other except now and then when her mind perhaps is too much for it but about this moneybag she saidis that what you ask sir roland well sir what she said was this they had told me a deal you must understand about investing in good securities meaning their own blessed pockets no doubt but they found me too old a bird for that down with the money says i the same as john shorne might in the market they wouldnt they wouldnt not a bit of it till i put another laiyer at themmy own son sir if you please a counsellor on our circuit and he brought them to book in no time and he laid down the law to me pretty strong about my being answerable so as soon as i got it i said to her mabel how am i to lodge it for you to fetch proper interest until you come of age but the young silly burst out crying and she saidwhat good can it ever be to me take it all father take every penny and see if it will do any good to him and no peace could i have till at last i set off and there it is sir roland but i am thinking that the money in no way belonging to me i am bound to ask you to make a receipt or give me your note of hand for it or something as you think proper just to disappoint the laiyers you shall have my receipt said sir roland lorraine with his eyes beginning to glisten meanwhile place all the money in the bag and tie it up securely the grower fetched a quiet little sigh and allowed the corners of his mouth to drop as he did what he was told to do it had cost him many a hard fight with mabel and many a sulky puff of pipe to be sent on such an errand money is money and a man who makes it with so much anxiety chance of season and cheating from the middlemen as a fruitgrower has to struggle throughsuch a man wants to know the reason why he should let it go all of a heap however martin lovejoy was one of the noblest works of god an honest manthough an honest woman is even yet more noble if value goes by rarityand he knew that the money was his daughters own to do what she pleased with in a twelvemonths time when she would be a spinster of majority i have written my receipt said sir roland breaking in on master lovejoys sad retrospect at the bag of money read it and tell me if i have been too cold it is a thing quite unaccountable haply and yet there must be some cause for it that some men who allow no tone of voice no pressure of hand to betray emotion yet cannot take pen without doing it and letting the fount of heart break open from the sealed reserve of eye no other explanation can be offered for this note of hand from sir roland lorraine the grower put on his specs and then he took them off and wiped them and then as the shadow of the hill came over he found it hard to read anything the truth was that he had read every word but had no idea of being overcome and the note so hard to read was as follows mabel i have done you much injustice and i hope that i may live long enough to show what now i think of you your perfect faith and love are more than any one can have deserved of you and least of all my son who has fallen into all his sad distress by wandering away from you your money of course i cannot accept but your goodwill i value more than i have power to tell you if you would come and see hilary i think it would do him more good than a hundred doctors sometimes he seems pretty well and again he is fit for little or nothing i know that he longs to see you mabel and having so wronged you i ask you humbly to come and let us do you justice roland lorraine chapter lxii a family arrangement it did not occur to sir roland lorraine as he shook martin lovejoys hand and showed him forth on his way to meet the reigate coach at pyecombe that mabels rich legacy might be supposed to have changed his own views concerning her whether her portion was to be twenty thousand pounds or twenty pence made very little difference to him but what made all the difference was the greatness of her faith and love the grower was a man who judged a man very much by eyesight he had found out so many rogues by means of that keen kentish look for which the sidneys and some other old families were famous and having well applied this to sir roland he had no longer any doubt of him and yet with his shrewd commonsense he was not sorry to button up his coat with the money once more inside it in the samplebag which had sampled so much love and trust and loyalty money is not so light to come by as great landlords might suppose and for a girl to be known to have it is the best of all strings to her bow so master lovejoy grasped his staff and it would have been a hard job for even the famous black robin the highwayman of the time to have wrested the trustfund from him covering the ground at an active pace and crossing the woeburn by a treebridge rudely set up where the old one had been he strode through west lorraine and steyning and over the hills to pyecombe corner where he took the reigate coach and he slept that night at reigate meanwhile the chapmans gathered their forces for perfect conquest of alice father and son had quite agreed that the final stroke of victory might best be made by occupying the commanding fortress valeria they knew that this stronghold was only too ready for the sake of the land below it to surrender at discretion and the guns thereof being turned on the castle the whole must lie at their mercy yet there were two points which these besiegers had not the perception to value duly and seize to their own advantage one was the character of sir roland the other was the english courage and norman spirit of alice it is all at our mercy now they thought we have only to hammer away and the hammer of gold is too heavy for anything they did not put it so clearly as thatfor people of that sort do not put their views to themselves very clearly still if they had looked inside their ideas they would have found them so steenie let me see him first said sir remnant meeting his son by appointment at the sundial in the eastern walk which for half the year possessed a sinecure office and a easy berth even through the other half steenie you will make a muddle you have been at your flask again well what can i do that girl is enough to roll anybody over i wish i had never seen heroh i wish i had never seen her she disdisdis dislikes you steenie she can never do that of all i have settled with none have said it they are only too fond of you steenie just as they were of your father before you and now you are straight and going on so well after all you have done for the women steenie no girl can dislike you that is the very thing i try to think and i know that it ought to be so if only from proper jealousy but she never seems to care when i talk of girls and she looks at me so that i scarcely dare speak and it scarcely makes any difference at all what girls have been in love with me have you had the sense to tell her of any of the royal family of course i did i mentioned two or three with good foundation but she never inquired who they were and nothing seems to touch her i think i must give it up after all i never cared for any girl before and it does seem so hard after more than a score of them when one is in downright earnest at last not to be able to get a chance of the only one i ever lovlovloved steenie you are a mere ass said sir remnant you always are when you get too muchwhich you ought to keep for dinnertime i have settled everything for you upstairs so that it must come right if only you can hold your tongue and wait i have them all under my thumb and nothing but your rotten fuss about the young maid can make us one day later her time is fixed and whether she dislikes disdisdiswhat i meant to say wasdespises pish and tush fiddlemaree a young girl to despise a man i had better marry her myself i trow if that is all you are fit for now just go away go down the hill go and see old hales go anywhere for a couple of hours while i see lorraine only first give me your honour for this that you will not touch one more drop of drink until you come back for the dinnertime you are always talking at me about that now and i have had almost less than nothing and even that drop i should not have had if alice had not upset me so well you may have needed it i will say no more we will upset her pretty well byandby the obstinate haughty fagot but steenie you will give me your honournot another drop except water you always keep your honour steenie yes sir i do and i will give it but i must not go near either alice or hales she does so upset me that i must have a drop and i defy anybody to call upon hales without having two or three good glasses oh i know what ill do and i need not cross that infernal black water to do it ill call upon the boy at the bottom of the hill and play at pitch guineas with him they say that he rolls every night in money then steenie go and take a lesson from him all you do with the money is to roll it awayducks and drakes and dipping yourself i would not have stuck to this matter so much except that i know it for your last chance your last chance steenie is to have a wife with sense and power to steer you it is worth all the money we are going to pay even if it never come back again which i will take deuced good care it does you know you are my son my boy well i suppose i cant be anybodys else you carried on very much as i do and when my time is over steenieif you havent drunk yourself to death before meyou will say that you had a good kind father who would go to the devil to save you really sir you were down upon me for having had a sentimental drop but i think i may return the compliment go down the hill steeniego down the hill it seems to be all that you are fit for and do try to put your neckcloth tidy before you come back to dinner sir remnant chapman returned to the house with a heavy sigh from his withered breast he had not the goodness in him which is needed to understand the value of a noble maiden or even of any good girl taken as against mans selfishness but in his little way he thought of the bonds of matrimony as a check upon his sons poor rambling life and he knew that a lady was wanted in his house and his great ambition was to see at last a legitimate grandson if he comes of the breed of lorraine he exclaimed i will settle the very day he is born on him with this in his head he came back to try his measures with sir roland he knew that he must not work at all as he had done with lady valeria but put it all strictly as a matter of business with no obligation on either side but as if there were landed security for the purchasemoney of alice and he managed all this so well that sir roland proud and highminded as he was saw nothing improper in an arrangement by which alice would become an incumbent on the lorraine estates for the purpose of vindicating the honour of lorraine and saving perhaps the male heir thereof accordingly the matter was referred to the lawyers who put it in hand with the understanding that the trustees of the marriagesettlement receiving an indemnity from sir remnant would waive all defects and accept as good a mortgage as could be made by deed of even date to secure the sir roland had long been unwilling to give his favourite alice to such a man as captain chapman seemed to be although through his own retiring and rather unsociable habits he was not aware of the loose unprincipled doings of the fellow he could not but perceive the want of solid stuff about him of any power for good or even respectable powers of evil but he first tried to think and then began to believe that his daughter would cure these defects and take a new pride and delight in doing so he knew what a spirited girl she was and he thought it a likely thing enough that she would do better with a weak fond husband than with one of superior mind who might fail to be polite to her and he could not help seeing that steenie was now entirely devoted to her perpetual snubbings or silent contempt made little difference to steenie he knew that he must win in the end and then his turn might come perhaps and in half an hour after his worst setdown he was up again on the arm of cognac alice lorraine with that gift of waiting for destiny which the best women have allowed the whole thing to go on as if she perceived there was no hope for it she made no touching appeals to her father nor frantic prayers to her grandmother she let the time slip on and on and the people said what they liked to her she would give her life for her brothers life and the honour of the family but firmly was she resolved never to be the wife of stephen chapman the more she saw of this man the more deeply and utterly she despised him she could not explain to her father or even herself why she so loathed him she did not know that it was the native shrinking of the good from evil of the lofty from the low the brave from the coward the clean from the unclean all this she was too young to think of too maidenly to imagine but she felt perhaps an unformed thought an unpronounced suggestion that death was a fitter husband for a pure girl than a rakehell meanwhile hilary upon whom she waited with unwearying love and care was beginning to rally from his sad disorder and threatening decline the doctors who had shaken their heads about him now began to smile and say that under skilful treatment youth and good constitution did wonders that really they had seldom met with clearer premonitory indications of phthisis pulmonalis complicated by cardiac and hypochondriac atony and aggravated by symptomatic congestion of the cerebellum but proper remedial agents had been instrumental in counteracting all organic cachexy and now all the principles of sound hygiene imperatively demanded quietude in plain english he was better and must not be worried therefore he was not even told of the arrangement about his sister alice used to come and sit by his bed or sofa or easychair as he grew a little stronger and talk light nonsense to him as if her heart was above all cloud and care if he alluded to any trouble she turned it at once to ridicule and when he spoke of his indistinct remembrance of the woeburn she made him laugh till his heart grew fat by her mimicry of nanny stilgoe whom she could do to the very life how gay you are lallie i never saw such a girl he exclaimed with the gratitude which arises from liberated levity you do her with the stick so well do her again with the stick dear lallie his mind was a little childish now from long lassitude of indoor life which is enough to weaken and depress the finest mind that ever came from heaven and hankers for sight of its birthplace in a word alice lorraine was bestowing whatever of mirth or fun she had left in the face of the coming conflict all the liveliness of her life and revolt of bright youth against misery to make her poor brother laugh a little and begin to look like himself again chapter lxiii better than the doctors hilarys luck was beginning to turn for in a few days he received a grand addition to his comforts and wholesome encouragement to get well for after the growers return to his home and recovery from hard sussex air which upset him for two days and three nights from the want of any fruitiness about it a solemn council was called and held in the state apartment of old applewood farm there were no less than five personages present all ready to entertain and maintain fundamentally opposite opinions mr martin lovejoy mg mrs martin lovejoy counsellor gregory lovejoy brought down by special retainer miss phyllis catherow and lieutenant charles lovejoy rn poor mabel was not allowed to be present for fear she should cry and disturb strong minds and corrode all bright honour with mercy the grower thought that master john shorne as the london representative of the house was entitled to be admitted but no one else saw it in that light and so the counsel of a kentish crust was lost the question before the meeting waswhether without lesemajesty of the ancient lovejoy family and in consistence with maiden dignity and the laws of covent garden mabel lovejoy might accept the invitation of coombe lorraine a great deal was said upon either side but no one convinced or converted till the master said you may all talk as you like but i will have my own way mind mrs lovejoy and gregory were against accepting anything a letter written on the spur of the moment was not the proper overture neither ought mabel to go at last because they might happen to want her but the father said and the sailor also and sweet cousin phyllis that if she was wanted she ought to go dispensing with small formality especially if she should want to go she did want to go and go she did backed up by kind opinions and her father being busy with his pears and hops which were poor and late this wet season the fine young sailor now adrift on shorewhile his ship was refitting at chathammade sail with his sister in convoy for the old roadstead of the south downs gregory who had refused to go for reasons best known to himself but sensible and sound ones wishing them good luck returned to his chambers in the middle temple now there is no time to set forth how these two themselves set forth the sailor with all the high spirit of the sea when it overruns the land the spinster inclined to be meditative tranquil and deep of eye and heart yet compelled to come out of herself and smile and then let herself come into her smile it is a way all kindhearted girls have when they know that they ought to be grave and truly intend to be so yet cannot put a chain on the popgun pellets of young age health and innocence enough that they had arrived quite safely at the old house in the coombe with the sailor of course in a flurry of ambition to navigate his fathers horse whenever he looked between his ears the inborn resemblance between ships and horses has been perceived and must have been perceived long before homer or even job began to consider the subject and it still holds good and deserves to be treated by the most eloquent man of the age retiring into silence mr hales had claimed the right of introducing his favourite mabel to his brotherinlaw sir roland for amity now reigned again between the coombe and the rectory the little quarrel of the year before had long since been adjusted and the parson was as ready to contribute his valuable opinion upon any subject as he was when we began with him one might almost say even more so for the longer a good man lives with a wife and three daughters to receive the law from him and a parish to accept his divinity the less hesitation he has in admitting the extent of his own capacities nevertheless he took very good care to keep out of lady valerias way bless my heart you look better than ever said the rector to blushing mabel as her pretty figure descended into his strong arms at the great house door give me a kiss thats a hearty lass i shall always insist upon it what trembling lips that will never do a little more danish courage if you please you know i am the danish champion and here is the royal dane of course or a dane in the royal navy which does quite as well or better charlie my boy i want no introduction you are a fishermanthat is enough or too much if your sisters words are true you can catch trout when i cant no sir never i never should dare but mabel always makes me a wonder well perhaps we shall try some day the church against the navy and mabel to bring us the luncheon well said well said i have made her smile and that is worth a deal of trying she remembers the goose and the stuffing and how she took in the clerk from sussex i dont believe she made a bit of it i did i did how can you say such things i can make better stuffing than that tomorrow i was not at all at my best then you are at your best now he replied having purposely moved her mettle come in with that colour and those sparkling eyes and you will conquer every one i want to conquer no one she answered with female privilege of last word i only came to see poor hilary the rector with the fine gallantry and deference of oldfashioned days led the beautiful and good girl and presented her to sir roland she was anxious to put her hair a little back before being looked at but the impetuous parson wisely would not let her trim herself she could not look better than she did so coy and soft and bashful resolved to be by no means timid but afraid that she could not contrive to be brave sir roland lorraine came forward gently and took her hand and kissed her he felt in his heart that he had been hard upon this very pretty maiden imputing petty ambition to her which one glance of her true dear eyes disproved to his mind for ever she was come to see hilary nothing more her whole heart was on hilary she had much admiration of sir roland as her clear eyes told him but she had more than admiration for some one on another floor you want to go upstairs my dear sir roland said with the usual bathos of all critical moments you would like to take off your things and so on before you see poor hilary of course she must touch herself up cried the rector what do you know about young women roland where is mrs pipkins i told her to be not so very far off but she is boiling down bullace plums or something of the highest national importance we could not tell when this dear child would come or we might have received her better oh i am so glad you cannot receive me you could not receive me better and now that you have called me your dear child i shall always love you i did not think that you would do it and i came for nothing of the kind i only came for hilary oh we quite understand that we are nobodies answered sir roland smiling you shall go to him directly but you must not be frightened by his appearance he has been a good deal knocked about and fallen into sad trouble but we all hope that now he is getting better and the sight of you will be better than a hundred doctors to him but you must not stay very long of course and you must keep him very quiet but i need not tell youi see that you have a natural gift of nursing all who have the gift of cookery have the gift of nursing exclaimed mr hales because omne majus continet in se minus ah roland you think nothing of my learning if only you knew how i am pervaded with latin and with logic these elderly gentlemen chattered thus because they were gentlemen they saw that poor mabel longed to have their attention withdrawn from her and without showing what they saw they nicely thus withdrew it then alice having heard of miss lovejoys arrival came down and was good to her and their hearts were speedily drawn together by their common anxiety alice thought mabel the prettiest girl she had ever seen anywhere and mabel thought alice the loveliest lady that could exist out of a picture what passed between mabel and hilary may better be imagined duly than put into clumsy words chapter lxiv impending darkness the darkness of the hardest winter of the present centuryso far as threefourths of its span enable us to estimatewas gathering over the south down hills and all hills and valleys of england there may have been severer cold by fits and starts before and since but the special character of this winter was the consistent low temperature there may have been some fiercer winters whose traditions still abide and terrify us beyond the range of test and fair thermometer but within the range of trusty records there has been no frost to equal that which began on christmasday seven weeks it lasted and then broke up and then began again and lingered so that in hilly parts the snowdrifts chilled not only the lap of may but the rosy skirt of june that winter was remarkable not only for perpetual frost but for continual snowfall so that no man of the most legal mind could tell when he was trespassing hedges and ditches were all alike and hollow places made high and hundreds of men fell into drifts and some few saved their lives by building frozen snow to roof them and cuddling their knees and chin together in a pure white home having heard the famous and true history of elizabeth woodcook but now before this style of things set in in bitter earnest nobody on the south down hills could tell what to make of the weather for twenty years the shepherds had not seen things look so strange like there was no telling their marks or places or the manners of the sheep a sulky grey mist crawled along the ground even when the sky was clear in the morning every blade and point and every spike of attraction and serrated edge without any intention of ever sawing anything and drooping sheath of something which had vainly tried to ripen and umbellate awning of the stalks that had discharged their seed were one and all alike incrusted with a little filmy down sometimes it looked like the cottongrass that grows in boggy places and sometimes like the american blight so common now on appletrees and sometimes more like gossamer or the track of flying spiders the shepherds had never seen this before neither had the sheepthose woolly sages of the weather the sheep turned up their soft black eyes with wonder towards the heavensthe heavens where every sheep may hope to walk in the form of a fleecy cloud when men have had his legs of mutton it is needless to say that this long warning without which no great frost arrives was wholly neglected by every man the sheep the cattle and the pigs foresaw it and the birds took wing to fly from it the fish of the rivers went into the mud and the fish of the sea to deep water the slug and the cockroach the rat and the wholesome toad came home to their snuggeries and every wireworm and young grub bored deeper down than he meant to do only the human race straggled about without any perception of anything in this condition of the gloomy air and just when frost was hovering in the grey clouds before striking alice lorraine came into her fathers bookroom on the christmaseve there was no sign of any merry christmas in the shadowed house nor any young delighted hands to work at decoration mabel was gone after a longer visit than had ever been intended and alice who had sojourned in london under lofty auspices had not been long enough at home to be sure again that it was her home upon her return she had enjoyed the escort of a mighty warrior no less a hero than colonel clumps the nephew of her hostess the colonel had been sadly hacked about in a skirmish soon after vittoria when pressing too hotly on the french rearguard he had lost not only his right arm but a portion of his one sound leg and instead of saying his prayers every morning he sat for an hour on the edge of his bed and devoted all his theological knowledge to the execration of the clumsy bullet which could not even select his weak point for attack this choler of his made much against the recovery of what was left of him and the doctors thought that country air might mitigate his state of mind and at the same time brace his body which sadly wanted bracing therefore it had been arranged that he should go for a month to coombe lorraine posting all the way of course and having the fair alice to wait on himwhich is the usual meaning of escort at the date of this journey the colonels two daughters were still away at a boardingschool but they were to come and spend the christmas with his aunt in london and then follow their father into sussex and perhaps appear as bridesmaids meanwhile their father was making himself a leading power at coombe lorraine he naturally entered into strict alliance with his aunts friend lady valeria and sternly impressed upon everybody the necessity of the impending marriage what earthly objection can there be he argued with mrs pipkins now alices only partisan except old mr binns the butler even if captain chapman is rather lazy and a little too fond of his wineglass both points are in her favour maam she will manage him like a top of course and as for looking up to him thats all nonsense if she did he would have to look down upon her and thats what the women cant bear of course how would you like it now mrs pipkins tut tut tut now dont tell me i am a little too old to be taken in i only wish that one of my good daughters had thrown at her with ayear to follow but perhaps sir your young ladies is not quite so particular and romantic like as our poor dear miss alice i should hope not id romantic them bread and water is the thing for young hussies who dont know on which side their bread is buttered but i dont believe a bit of it its all sham and girlish makebelieve in her heart she is as ready as he is almost everybody said the same thing and all the credit the poor girl got for her scorn of a golden niddering was to be looked upon as a coy piece of affectation and thanklessness all this she was well aware of evil opinion is a thing to which we are alive at once though good opinion is well content to impress itself on the coffin alice who otherwise rather liked his stolid and upright nature thought that colonel clumps had no business to form opinion upon her affairs or at any rate none to express it but the colonel always did form opinions and felt himself bound to express them i live in this house he said when alice hinted at some such phantasy and the affairs of this house are my concern if i am not to think about the very things around me i had better have been cut in two than made into three pieces he waved the stalk of his arm and stamped the stump of the foot of his better leg with such a noise and gaze of wrath that the maiden felt he must be in the right and so perhaps he may have been at any rate he got his way as a veteran colonel ought to do with everybody he had his way being unable to fight any more he had come to look so ferocious and his battered and shattered body so fiercely backed up the charge of his aspect that none without vast reserve of courage could help being scattered before him even sir roland lorraine so calm and of an infinitely higher mind by reason perhaps of that gave way and let the maimed veteran storm his home but alice rebelled against all this now father she said on that christmaseve when the house was chilled with the coming cold and the unshedden snow hung over it and every sheep and cow and crow and shivering bird down to the jennywren was hieing in search of shelter father i have not many words to say to you but such as they are may i say them sir roland lorraine being struck by her quite unwonted voice and manner rose from his chair of meditation left his thoughts about things which can never be thought out by mankind and came to meet what a man should think of foremosthis child his woman child lallie my dear he said very gently and kindly looking at her sad wild eyes whose difference from their natural softness touched him with some terrorlallie now what has made you look like this papa i did not mean to look at all out of my usual look i beg your pardon if indeed i do i know that all such things are very small in your way of regarding things but still papabut still papa you might let me say something have i ever refused you alice the right to say almost everything no that you have never done of course but what i want to say now is something more than i generally want to say of course it cannot matter to you papa but to me it makes all the difference my dear you are growing sarcastic all that matters to you matters a great deal more to me of course you know what you have always been to me i do papa and that is why i find it so very hard to believe that you can be now so hard with me i do not see what i can have done to make you so different to me girls like me are fond of saying very impudent things sometimes and they seem to be taken lightly but they are not forgiven as they are meant have i done anything at all to vex you in that way papa how can you be so foolish lallie you talk as if i were a girl myself you never do a thing to vex me then why do you do a thing to kill me it must come to that and you know it must i am not very good nor in any way grand and i dont want to say what might seem harsh but papa i think i may say thisyou will never see me stephen chapmans wife well lallie it is mainly your own doing i did not wish to urge it until it seemed to become inevitable you encouraged him so in the summer that we cannot now draw back honourably father i encouraged him yes your grandmother tells me so i was very busy at that time and you were away continually and whenever i wanted you i always heard miss alice is with captain chapman how utterly untrue but o papa now you got jealous do say that you got jealous and then i will forgive you everything my dear there is nothing to be jealous of i thought that you were taking nicely to the plan laid out for you the plan that will lay me out papa but will you tell me one thing yes my dear child a hundred things if you will only ask them quietly i am not making any noise papa it is only that my collar touched my throat but what i want to know is this if anything should happen to me as they say if i should drop out of everybodys way could the money be got that you are all so steadfastly set upon getting could the honour of the family be set up and poor hilary get restored and well and the lorraines go on for ever why dont you answer me papa my question is a very simple one what i have a right to ask is thisam i for some inscrutable reason which i have had nothing to do with the stumblingblockthe fatal obstacle to the honour and the life of the family alice i never knew you talk like this and i never saw you look so why your cheeks are perfectly burning come here and let me feel them thank you papa they will do very well but will you just answer my question am i the fatalam i the deathblow to the honour and life of our lineage sir roland lorraine was by no means pleased with this curt mode of putting things he greatly preferred at his time of life the rounding off and softening of affairs that are too dramatic he loved his beautiful daughter more than anything else on the face of the earth he knew how noble her nature was and he often thought that she took a more lofty view of the world than human nature in the end would justify but still he must not give way to that alice he said i can scarcely see why you should so disturb yourself there are many things always to be thought ofmore than one has time for to be sure papa i know all that and i hate to see you worried but i think that you might try to tell me whether i am right or not my darling you are never wrong only things appear to you in a stronger light than they do to me of course because you are younger and get into a hurry about many things that ought to be more dwelt upon it is true that your life is interposed through the command of your grandmother and the subtlety of the lawyers between poor hilary and the money that might have been raised to save him that is true papa now is it i believe every word that you say but i never believe one word of my grandmothers you shocking child yes it is true enough but after all it comes to nothing of the law i know nothing i am thankful to say but from sir glanvil malahide i understand through some questions which your grandmother laid before him that the money can only be goteither through this family arrangement or else by waiting till you as a spinster attain the age of twentyonewhich would be nearly two years too late but papa if i were to die lallie why are you so vexatious if you were to die the whole of the race might endso far as i care my father you say that to make me love you more than i do already which is a hopeless attempt on your part now you need not think that i am jealous it is the last thing i could dream of but ever since mabel lovejoy appeared i have not been what i used to be either with you or with hilary in the case of poor hilary i must of course expect it and put up with it but i cannot see for a moment why i ought to be cut out with you papa what foolish jealousy alice shall i tell you why i like and admire mabel so much but as for comparing her with you but papa why do you like and admire her so deeply you jealous child i did not say deeply but i like her because she is so gentle so glad to do what she is told so full of selfsacrifice and selfdevotion while i am harsh and disobedient selfseeking and devoted to self no doubt she would marry according to order though i dreamed that i heard of a certain maltster who had the paternal sanction veni vidi vici appears to be her motto even grandmamma is vanquished by her or by her legacy she says that she curtseys much better than i do she is welcome to that distinction i am not at all sure that the prime end and object of womans life is to curtsey but i see exactly how i am placed i will never trouble you any more papa with these words alice lorraine arose and kissed her fathers forehead gently and turned away not to worry him with the long sigh of expiring hope she had still three weeks to make up her mind or rather to wait with her mind made up and three weeks still is a long spell of time for the young to anticipate misery you are quite unlike yourself my child sir roland said with perfect truth you surprise me very much today i am sure that you do not mean a quarter of what you are saying you are right papa i do not mean even a tenth part of my spitefulness i will try to be more like mabel lovejoy who really is so good and nice it is quite a mistake to suppose that i could ever be jealous of her she is a dear kindhearted girl and the very wife for hilary but i think that she differs a little from me it is no matter of opinion alice mabel differs from you as widely as you differ from your cousin cecil i begin to incline to an old opinion which i came across the other day that much more variety is to be found in the weaker than in the stronger sex regard it thus excuse me father i have no courage for regarding anything you can look at things in fifty lights and i in one shadow only goodbye darling perhaps i shall never speak to you again as i have tonight but i hope you will remember that i meant it for the best chapter lxv a fine christmas sermon according to all the best accounts that long and heavy frost began with the clearing of the sky upon christmasday at least it was so in the south of england though probably two or three days earlier in the northern countries a great frost always advances slowly creeping from higher latitudes if the cold begins in london sooner than it does in edinburgh it very seldom lasts out the week and if it comes on with a violent wind its time is generally shorter it does seem strange but it is quite true that many people even wellinformed attribute to this severity of cold the destruction of the great french army during its retreat from moscow and the ruin of napoleon they know the date of the ghastly carnage of the beresina and elsewhere which happened more than a year ere this but they seem to forget that each winter belongs to the opening and not to the closing year passing all such matters it is enough to say that christmasday was unusually bright and pleasant the lowering sky and chill grey mist of the last three weeks at length had yielded to the gallant assault of the brightspeared sun that excellent knight was pricking merrily over the range of the south down hills his path was strewn with sparkling trinkets from the casket of the clouds the brisk air moved before him and he was glad to see his way again but behind him and before him lay the ambush of the snowblink to catch him at night when he should go down and to stop him of his view in the morning however for the time he looked very well and as no one had seen him for ever so long every one took him at his own price rector struan hales was famous for his sermon on christmasday for fiveandtwenty years he had made it his grand sermon of the year he struck no strokes of enthusiasmwhich nobody dreamed of doing then except the very low dissentersstill he began with a strong idea that he ought to preach above the average and he never failed to do sopartly through inspiration of other divines but mainly by summing up all the sins of his parish and then forgiving them the parish listened with apathy to the wisdom and eloquence of great men who said what they had to say in englisha lost art for nearly two centuries and then the parish pricked up all its ears to hear of its own doings the rector preached the first part of his sermon in a singsong manner with a good seesaw but when he came down to his parishbounds and traced his own peoples trespasses he changed his voice altogether so that the deafest old sinner could hear him it was the treat of all the year to know what the parson was down upon and to be sure who had done it then being of a charitable kind and loving while he chastened the rector always let them go with a blessing which sounded as rich as a grace for everybodys christmas dinner everybody went out of church happy and contented they had enough to talk about for a week and they all must have earned the goodwill of the lord by going to church on a weekday but the rector always waited for his two churchwardens to come into the vestry and shake hands and praise his sermon and not to be behindhand farmer gates and mr bottler now come from steyning to west lorraine and immediately appointed in right of the number of pigs killed weekly junior churchwardenthese two men of excellent presence and of accomplished manners got in under the vestry arch and congratulated the rector alice lorraine was not at church everybody had missed her in her usual niche between the two dark marble records of certain of her ancestors there she used to sit and be set off by their fine antiquity but she did not go to church that day for her mind was too full of disturbance west lorraine church had been honoured that day by the attendance of several people entitled to as handsome monuments as could be found inside it for instance there was sir remnant chapman for whom even an epitaph must strain its elastic charity stephen his sonwho had spent his harm without having much to show for it colonel clumps who would rise and fight if the resurrection restored his legs a squire of high degree a distant and vague cousin of the true lorraines who wanted to know what was going on having great hopes through the woeburn but sworn to stick whatever might happen to his own surname which was bloggs and last and best of all joyce aylmer viscount aylmers only son of a true old english family but not a very wealthy one a merry christmas to you all cried mr hales as they stood in the porch a merry christmas gentlemen but my certy we shall have a queer one how keen the air is getting they all shook hands with the parson and thanked him after the good old fashion for his learned and edifying discourse and they asked what he meant about the weather but he was too deep to tell them even he had been wrong upon that matter and had grown too wise to commit himself then cecil who followed her father of course made the proper curtseys as the men made bows to her and major aylmers horse was brought and a carriage for the rest of them are you coming with us rector we dine early said sir remnant with a hungry squeak you cant have another service can you god knows you have done enough for one day enough to satisfy you at any rate the rector answered smiling but i should have my house about my ears if i dined outside of it on a christmasday plain and wholesome and juicy fare sirnone of your foreign poisons well goodbye gentlemen i shall hope to see all of you again tomorrow if the snow is not too deep the rector knew that a very little snow would be quite enough to stop them on the morning of the morrowthe sunday snow indeed no sign of snow sir remnant answered sharply he had an inborn hate of snow and he wanted to be at home on the monday but i say missie remember one thing tuesday fortnight is the day have all your fallals ready blushing bridesmaidsah fine creatures i shall claim a score of busses mind dont you wish it was your own turn eh the old rogue with a hearty smack blew a kiss to cecil hales who blushed and shivered and then tried to smile for fear of losing her locket for it had been whispered that sir remnant chapman had ordered a tenguinea locket in london for each of the six bridesmaids so checking the pert reply which trembled on the tip of her tongue she made them a pretty curtsey as they drove away now did you observe papa she asked as she took her fathers arm bent fully to gossip with him up the street how terribly pale major aylmer turned when he heard about the bridesmaids i thought he was going to drop as they say he used to do when he first came home from america i am sure i was right papa i am sure i was in what i told you the other day nonsense fiddlesticks romantic flummery you girls are never content without rivalry jealousy love and despair you may laugh as much as you like but it makes no difference to me papa i tell you that major aylmer has lost his heart to alice a great deal worse than he lost his head in america well then he must live with no head and no heart he cant have alice he has got no money even if it were possible to change the bridegroom at the door of the church i will tell you what proves it beyond all dispute you know how that wretched little captain chapman looks up when he hates any one and thinks he has made a hit of it therelike that only i cant do it until i get much uglier he often does it to me you know and then he patted his wonderful waistcoat now cecil what spiteful things girls are it is quite impossible that he can hate you i am thankful to say that he does papa or perhaps you might have sold me to him if ever any girl was sold alice is both bought and sold and sir roland cannot love her as she used to think or he would have had nothing to do with it it must be fearfully bitter for her and to marry a man who is tipsy every night and tremulous every morning oh papa papa my dear you exaggerate horribly you have always disliked poor steenie perhaps that is why he looks up to you we must hope for the best we must hope for the best why bless my heart if every man was to have the whole of his doings raked up i should never want the marriageregister oh but papa if we could only manage to change the man you know the other is so different so kind and noble and grand and simple if any man in all the world is worthy to marry dear alice it is major aylmer the man might be changed but not the money said the rector rather shortly and his daughter knew from the tone of his voice that she must quit the subject the truth being as she was well aware that her father was growing a little ashamed of his own share in the business chapter lxvi coming down in earnest dark weather and dark fortune do not always come together indeed the spirit of the british race and the cheer flowing from high spirit seem to be most forward in the worst conditions of the weather something to battle with something to talk about something to make the father more than usually welcome and the hearth more bright and warm to him and something also which enlarges by arousing charity and spreads a mans interior comfort into general goodwillbitter weather at the proper season is not wholly bitterness but when halfadozen gentlemen who care not a fig for one another hate books as they hated their hornbooks scorn all indoor pursuits but gambling gormandising and drinking and find little scope for pursuing thesewhen a number of these are snowed up together and cannot see out of the windowsto express it daintily there is likely to be much malediction and this is exactly what fell upon them for more than a week at coombe lorraine they made a most excellent dinner on christmasday about three oclock as they all declared and in spite of the shortness of the days they saw their way till the wine came they were surprised at this so far as any of them noticed anything for of course no glance of the setting sun came near the old house in the winter and they thought it a sign of fine huntingweather and so they went on about it whereas it was really one of the things scarcely ever seen down here but common in the arctic regionsthe catch and the recast and the dispersion of all vague light downward by the dense grey canopy of gathering snowvapour the snow began about seven oclock when the influence of the sun was lost and for three days and three nights it snowed without taking or giving breathingtime it came down without any wind or unfair attempt at drifting the meaning of the sky was to snow and no more and let the wind wait his time afterwards there was no such thing as any spying between the flakes at any time the flakes were not so very large but they came as close together as the sand pouring down in an hourglass they never danced up and down like gnats or motes as common snowflakes do but one on the back of another fell expecting millions after them and if any man looked up to see that gravelly infinitude of pelting spots which swarms all the air in a snowstorm he might just as well have shut both eyes before it was done by snowflakes all the visitors except the colonel were to have left on monday morning but only one of them durst attempt the trackless waste of white between the south down coombe and their distant homes for although no drifting had begun as yet some forty hours of heavy fall had spread a blinding cover over road and ditch and bog and bank and none might descry any signpost house tree or hill or other landmark at the distance of a hundred yards through the snow still coming down as heavily as ever therefore everybody thought major aylmer almost mad when he ordered his horse for the long ride home in the midst of such terrible weather i dont think i ought to let you go his host said when the horse came round as white already as a counterpane alice where is your persuasive voice surely you might beg major aylmer to see what another day will bring another day will only make it worse joyce aylmer replied with a glance at alice which she perfectly understood i might be snowed up for a week sir roland with my father the whole time fidgeting and after all what is this compared to the storms we had in america oh but you were much stronger then you would not be here were it not so i scarcely know i shall soon rejoin if i get on so famously as this but i am keeping you in the cold so long and miss lorraine in a chilly draught goodbye once more can i leave any message for you at the rectory in another second the thick snow hid him and his floundering horse as they headed towards the borstall for as yet there was only a footbridge thrown over the course of the woeburn and horsemen or carriages northward bound were obliged to go southward first and then turn to the right on the high land and thus circumvent the stream even as alice quickly thinking had enabled poor bonny to recover his jack alice went back with a sigh to her own little room to sit and think awhile she knew that she had seen the last of a man whom she could well have loved and who loved her as she knew somehow much too well already feeling that this could do no good but only harm to both of them he had made up his mind to go ere any mischief should arise from it he had no idea how vastly alice scorned poor steenie chapman otherwise even his duty to his host might perhaps have failed him however he had acted wisely and she would think no more of him this resolution was hard to keep when she heard a little later in the day that the major had sent back his groom after making believe to take him the groom brought a message from his master begging quarters for a day or two on the plea that his horse had broken down but alice felt sure that he had been sent back because major aylmer would not expose him to the risk which he meant himself to face for she knew it to be more than twenty miles having studied the map on the subject from coombe lorraine to stokeaylmer and ill in the teeth of a bitter wind now just beginning to crawl and wail as only a snowy wind can do the rest of the gentlemen plagued the house it was hard to say which was the worst of themsir remnant who went to the lower regions to make the acquaintance of the kitchenmaids or colonel clumps who sat on a sideboard and fought all his battles over again with a park of profane artillery or squire bloggs who bit his nails and heavily demanded beer all day or steenie who scorned beer altogether and being repulsed by onesimus binns at last got into trotmans study and ordered some bottles up and got on well he sent for his groom and he sent for his horn which he had not wind enough to blow and altogether he carried on so with a greasy pack of cards and a dozen grimy tumblers that while the women being strictly sober looked down on his affability the men said they had known much worse for a week sir roland lorraine was compelled to endure this wearing worrytenfold wearisome as it was to a man of his peculiar nature he had always been shy of inviting guests but when they were once inside his door the hospitality of his race and position revived within him all in the house was at their service including the master himself so far as old habits can be varied but now he was almost like the whelk that admits the little crab for company and is no more the master of his own door no man in all england longed that the roads might look like roads again more heartily and sadly than the hospitable sir roland with brooms of every sort and shape and shovels and even pickaxes all the neighbourhood turned out as soon as ever a man could manage to open his own cottagedoor for three days it had been no good to try to do anything but look on but the very first moment the sky left off everybody living under it began to recover courage the boys came first in a joyful manner sinking over their bracebuttons in the shallow places and then the girls came and were puzzled by the manner of their dress till they made up their minds to be boys for a time and after these came out their mother for the sake of scolding them and then the father could do no less than stand on his threshold with pipe in mouth and look up wisely at the sky and advise everybody to wait a bit and thus a great many people managed to get out of their houses and it was observed not only then but also for many years to come how great the mercy of the lord was having seen fit to send such a storm he chose for it not a wednesday night nor a thursday night nor a friday night but a saturday night when he knew in his wisdom that every man had got his wages and had filled his breadpan as for the roads they were blocked entirely against both wheels and horses until a violent wind arose from the east and winnowed fiercely sweeping along all the bend of the hill and swaying the laden copses it tore up the snow in squally spasms and cast white blindness everywhere three days the snow had defied the wind and for three days now the wind had its way vexed mortals could do nothing more than shelter themselves in their impotence and hope as they shivered and sniffed at their pots that the lord would repent of his anger it was already perceived and where people could get together they did not hide it that mr bottler must go up and farmer gates come down a peg for although the sheep were folded well and mainly fetched into the hollows as soon as the drift began it was known that the very precaution would murder them for sheep have a foolish trick of crowding into the lee of the fold just where the drift must be the deepest but pigs are as clever as their mother dirtwhich always gets over everything so farmer gates lost three hundred sheep while bottler did not lose a pig but saved and exalted the price of his bacon when the snow on the wings of the wind began to pierce the windows of coombe lorraine for in such case no putty will keep it out and every ancient timber creaked with cold disgust of shrinking and the drawing of all the fireplaces was more to the door than the chimney and the chimneys drew submissive moans to the howling of the tempest and chilly rustles and frosty taps sounded outside the walls and infrom all these things the young lady of the house gained some hope and comfort surely in such weather no one could ever think of a wedding nobody could come or go it would take a week to dig out the church and another week to get to it blow blow thou east wind blow and bury rather than marry us but the east wind after three days of blowing and mixing snow of earth and sky suddenly fell with a hollow sound like the convolutions of a shell into deep silence clear deep silence settled on the storm of drifted billows as the wind left them so they stopped until the summer rose under them for spring there was none in that terrible year and no breath of summer until it broke forth and now set in the long steadfast frost which stopped the thames and severn the trent and tweed and all the other rivers of great britain from the source to the mouth a man might cross them without feeling water under him alas for poor alice the roads of the weald being mainly unhedged at that time were opened as if by sesame the hillroads were choked many fathoms deep wherever they lay in shelter but the furious wind had swept the flat roads clear as with a besom their brown track might be traced for miles frozen as hard as an oaken plank except where a slight depression or a sudden bend or a farmers wall had kept the white wave from shoaling so as soon as a passage had been dug through the borstall and down the hill to the westward the chapmans were free to come and go with their gaudy coach as usual alice took this turn of matters with all the calmness of despair it was nothing but a childish thing to long for a few days reprieve which could not help her much and might destroy all the good of her sacrifice in one way or the other she must go standing so terribly across the welfare of all that was dear to her and seeming as she told herself to have no one now to whom she was dear with no one to advise or aid her no one even to feel for her she had to meet the saddest doom that can befall proud womanwedlock with an object chapter lxvii the last chance lost and now there was but one day left monday was come and on the morrow alice was to be mrs stephen chapman you call yourself an unlucky fellow said colonel clumps to hilary who was leaning back in his easychair but i call you the luckiest dog in the world what other man in the british army could have lost fifty thousand guineas escaped courtmartial and had a good furlough made it all snug with his sweetheart after gallivanting to his hearts content and then got the chance to get back again under old beaky and march into paris i tell you they will march into paris sir what is there to stop them but colonel you forget that i can scarcely march across the room as yet and even if i could there is much to be done before i get back again our fellows may go into winter quarters and then the generals promise drops or even without that he may fail with the duke of york who loves him not stuff and rubbish my dear boy you pay the moneythats all youve got to do no fear of their refusing it of course it will all be kept very quiet and we shall find in the very next gazette some such paragraph as this captain lorraine of the headquarter staff who has long been absent on sick leave is now on his way to rejoin and will resume his duties upon the staff come now colonel you are too bad cried hilary blushing with pleasure they never could put me on the staff again it is impossible that they could have the impudence dont tell me why they had the impudence never to put me on it they have the impudence enough for anything you set to and get strong that is all are you going to your sisters wedding tomorrow i will tell you a secret i mean to go though i am under strict orders not to go what do i care for the weather tush i have settled it all very cleverly you will see me there when you least expect it lallie has behaved very badly to me so has everybody else about it am i never to be told anything she seems to be in a great hurry about it desperately in love no doubt though from what i remember of stephen chapman i am a little surprised at her tastebut of course of course of course one must never say a word about young ladies fancies there was a young lady in spainto be sure there are a great many young ladies in spain the colonel dropped the subject in the clumsiest manner possible he was under medical orders not to say a word that might stir up hilary and yet from the time he came into the room he had done nothing else but stir him up colonel clumps was about the last man in the world that ought to stump in at any sick mans door dash it there i am again he used to say as he began to let out something and stopped short and jammed his lips up and set his wooden apparatus down therefore he had not been allowed to pay many visits to hilary otherwise the latter must soon have discovered the nature of the arrangement pending to retrieve his fortunes at present he thought that the money was to be raised by a simple mortgage of which he vowed in his sanguine manner that he would soon relieve the estates by getting an appointment in india as soon as he had captured paris mabel of course would go with him and be a great lady and make his curries he was never tired of this idea and was talking of it to colonel clumps who had seen some indian service when a gentle knock at the door was heard and a soft voice said may i come in as alice entered the battered warrior arose and made a most ingenious bow quite of his own invention necessity is the mother of that useful being and the colonel having no leg to stand upon and only one arm to balance with was in a position of extreme necessity of late he had almost begun to repent of serving under lady valeria the beauty and calm resignation of alice had made their way into his brave old heart and the more he saw of captain chapman the more he looked down on that featherbed soldier goodbye my lad keep your pecker up he said beginning with his thick bamboo to beat a retreat for hilary was not allowed two visitors well march into paris yet brave boys with colonel clumps at the head of the column dont be misled by appearances alice the colonel has good work in him yet his sword is only gone to be sharpened maam and then hell throw away this dd bamboo in his spirited flourish the colonel slipped and not yet being master of his wooden leg and down he must have come without the young ladys arm as well as the aid of the slighted staff alice in spite of all her misery could not help a little laugh as the colonel recovering his balance strutted carefully down the passage what a merry girl you are cried hilary who was a little vexed at having his martial counsel routed you seem to me to be always laughing when there is nothing to laugh at that shows a low sense of humour she answered or else an excess of high spirits perhaps in my case the two combine but i am sorry if i disturbed you i am not quite so easily disturbed i am as well as i ever was it is enough to make one ill to be coddled up in this kind of way my dear brother you are to be released as soon as the weather changes at present nobody ventures out who is not going to be married of that i can judge from the window lallie and even from my waterjugs but how is your very grand wedding to be i have seen a score of men shovelling you seem to be in such a hurry dear perhaps not let us talk of something else do you really think without any nonsense that all your good repute and welfare depend on the payment of the money which you lost how can you ask me such a stupid question i never could lift up my head againbut it is not myself not at all myselfit is what will be said of the family alice and i do not see how the raising of the money can interfere at all with you no no of course not she said and then she turned away and looked out of the window reflecting that hilary was right enough neither loss nor gain of money could long interfere at all with her goodbye darling she said at last forgiving his sick petulance and putting back his curly hair and kissing his white foreheadgoodbye darling i must not stay i always seem to excite you so you will not think me unkind i am sure but you may not see me again for everoh ever so long i have so much to do before i am ready formy wedding hilary allowed himself to be kissed with brotherly resignation and then he called merrily after hernow lallie mind you must look your best you are going to make a grand match you know dont be astonished if you see me there why dont you answer she would not look round because of the expression of her face which she could not conceal in a momenti am not at all sure said the brother wisely as the sister shut the door and fled that the man who marries alice wont almost have caught a tartar she is very sweettempered but the good lord knows that she is determined also now mabel is quite another sort of girl c creflections which he may be left to reflect alice lorraine having none to advise with and being in her firm heart set to do the right thing without flinching through dark days and through weary nights had been striving to make sure what was the one right thing to do it was plain that the honour of her race must be saved at her expense by reason of things she had no hand in it had come to pass that her poor self stood in everybodys way her poor self was full of life and natural fun and mind perhaps a little above the average no other self in the world could find it harder to go out of the world to be a self no more peradventure but a wandering something to lose the sight and touch and feeling of the light and life and love not to have the influence even of the weather on them to lie in a hollow place forgotten cast aside and dreaded never more to have or wish for power to say yes or no this was all that lay before her if she acted truly as to marrying a man she scornedshe must scorn herself ere she thought of it she knew that she was nothing very great and her little importance was much pulled down by the want of any one to love her but her purity was her own inborn right and nobody should sell or buy it i will go to my father once more she thought he cannot refuse to see me i will not threaten that would be low but if he cares at all to look he will know from my face what i mean to do he used if i had the smallest pain he used to know it in a moment but now he cares not for a pain that seems to gnaw my life away perhaps it is my own fault perhaps i have been too proud to put it so i have put it defiantly and not begged i will beg i will beg on my knees i will beg i will cry as i never cried before oh father father father perhaps if she had won this chance she might even yet have vanquished for her last reflection was true enough she had been too defiant and positive in her strength of will towards her father she had never tried the power of tears and prayers and a pet childs eloquence and her father no doubt had felt this change in her attitude towards him and had therefore believed more readily his mothers repeated assertions that nothing stood in the way of a most desirable arrangement except the coyness of a spirited girl whose fancy was not taken but the luckless girl lost all the chances of a last appeal through a simple and rather prosaic affair her father was not to be found in his bookroom and hurrying on in search of him she heard the most melancholy drone almost worse than the sad east wind her prophetic soul told her what it was and that she had a right to be present so she knocked at the door of a stern cold room and being told to enter entered there she saw seven people sitting and looking very miserable for the bitter cold had not been routed by the newmade fire one was reading a tremendous document five were pretending to listen and one was listening very keenly the reader was a lawyers clerk three of the mocklisteners were his principal and the men of the other side the other two were sir roland lorraine and captain stephen chapman the real listener was sir remnant who pricked up his ears at every sentence upon the table lay another great deed or rather a double one lease and releasethe mortgage of all the lorraine estates invalid without her signature which she was too young to give alice lorraine knew what all this meant it was the charter of her slavery or rather the warrant of her death she bowed to them all and left the room with and the said and the saiddoth hereby doth herebybuzzing in her helpless brain now followed a thing which for ever settled and sealed her determination steenie on the eve of his weddingday really felt that he ought to do something towards conciliating his bride he really loved so far as his nature was capable of honest love this proud and most lovable maiden who was to belong to him tomorrow and his father had said to him as they came over to go through the legal ceremony nurse my vittels now steenie for gods sake try to be a man a bit the mistake you make with the girl is the way you keep your distance from her why they draw up their figures and screw up their mouths on purpose to make you run after them i have seen such a lot of it and so have you all girls are alike as you ought to know now why cant you treat her properly the unfortunate steenie took his advice and he took which was worse a great draught of brandy and so when the lawyers drone had driven him thoroughly out of his patience at the sight of alice he slipped out and followed her down the passage she despised him too much to run away as he had hoped that she would do she heard his weak step and weaker breath and stopped and faced him quietly chapter lxviii the deathbourne standing in a dark grey corner of the old stone passage below a faded and exiled portrait of some ancestor of hers alice looked so calm and noble that steenie although he had his grog on board with his daily bill of lading found it harder than he expected to follow his fathers counsel in twentyfour hours he would have this lovely creature at his mercy and then he would tame her and make her love him and perhaps even try to keep to her for he really did love this poor girl in a way that quite surprised him and he could not help thinking that if she knew it by jove she must be grateful alice dear alice sweet alice he said as at every approach she shrank further away lovely alice what have i done that you will not yield me one beautiful smile you know how very well i have behaved i have not even pleaded for one kiss and considering all that is between us considering the distance there is between us you have shown your judgment you do not understand me at all what i meant was entirely different there should be no difference between us why should there be why should there be in a few hours more we shall both be alike flesh of one flesh and bone of one bone i am not quite sure that i have got it right but i am not far out at any rate your diffidence is your one good point you are very far out when you overcome it have the kindness to keep at a proper distance and hear what i have to say i believe that you mean well stephen chapman so far as you have any meaning left i believe that you mean well by me and in your weak manner like me but if you had gone all around the world you could not have found one to suit you less i used to think that i was humble as of course i ought to be but when i search into myself i find the proudest of the proud nothing but great misery could have led me to this knowledge i speak to you now for the last time stephen and i never meant to speak as i do but i believe that in your little way you like me and i cannot bear to be thought too hard here alice could not check a sigh and a tear at the thought of the name she might leave behind what shall i do what can i do cried stephen not being such a very hard fellow any more than the rest of us but feeling himself unworthy even to touch her pockethandkerchief you have nothing to do i should hope indeed answered alice recovering dignity i am very glad that whatever happens you may blame other people please to remember that i said that and goodbye captain chapman goodbye till dinnertime my darlingwell then goodbye miss lorraine at any rate i am glad she thought as she hastened to her room that even to him i have said my last as kindly as i could manage it when she entered her room it was three oclock and the day already waning though the snow from hill and valley and the rime of quiet frost spread the flat pervading whiteness of the cold and hazy light alice looked out and thought a little and the scene was by no means cheering the eastern side of the steep straight coombe up which clomb the main road to the house lay thirty or forty feet deep in snow being filled by the drift that swept over its crest for nearly the breadth of the coombe itself but under the western rampart still a darkbrown path was open where the wind leaping over the eastern scarp had whirled the snow up the western and here through her own pet garden fell a direct path down to the woeburn she had long been ready to believe that here her young and lively life must end down this steep and narrow way she had gazed or glanced or peeped according to the measure of her courage ever since the woeburn rose and she was sure what it meant for her now looking at it with her mind made up and her courage steadfast she could not help perceiving that she had a great deal to be thankful for her life had been very bright and happy and it had been long enough she had learned to love all pleasant creatures and to make them love her she had found that nature has tenfold more of kindness than of cruelty and that of her kindness all the best and dearest ends in death painless death the honest and peaceful end of earthly things noble death that settles all things scarcely leaving other life its brief exception time to mourn all this lay clear and bright before her now that the golden mist of hope was scattered by stern certainty many times she had been confused by weak desires to escape her duty and foolish hankerings after things that were but childish trifles about her bridal dress for instance she had been much inclined to think of course she never meant to wear it still she knew that the london people meant to charge to a long extreme and she thought that she ought to try it on once more ere ever it was rashly paid for she truly cared no more than can be helped by any woman whether it set her off or not but she knew that it must be paid for and she wanted to know if the frenchwoman had caught any idea of her figure to settle this question she locked the door and then very carefully changed her dress being the tidiest of the tidy and as neat as an old maid in her habits she left not a pin nor a hair on the cloth nor even a brush set crooked then being in bridal perfection and as lovely a bride as was ever seen without one atom of conceit she knew that she was purely beautiful she stood before the glass and sadly gazed at all her beauty there she saw the large sweet forehead calm and clear as ever the deep desire of loving eyes for some one to believe in the bright lips even now relaxing into a sadly playful smile the oval symmetry of chastened face in soft relief against the complex curves and waves of rebellious hair to any man who could have her love what a pet what a treasure she might have been what a pearl beyond all priceor as she simply said to herself what a dear good wife it was worse than useless to think of that but being of a practical turn of mind she did not see why she should put on her lovely white satin and let no one see it therefore she rang for her maid who stared and cried oh laws miss what a booty you do look and then of course wanted to put in a pin and to trim a bow here and to stroke a plait there it is waste of time said alice then she told her to send mrs pipkins up and the good housekeeper came and kissed her beautiful pet as she always called her maintaining the rights of the nursery days and then began some of the very poor jokes supposed to suit such occasions pippy said alice that the old endearment might cure the pain of the sudden check you must not talk so i cannot bear it now just tell papa not yet but when dinner is going in give him this messagesay with my love that i beg him to excuse me from coming in to dinner because i have other things to see to and mind pippy one thing i have many arrangements to make before i go away and if my door should be locked tonight nobody is to disturb me i can trust you to see to that i know and now say goodbye to me pippy dear i may not see you again you know let me kiss you as i used to do when i was a dear good little child and used to coax for sugarplums as soon as her kind old friend was gone alice made fast her door again and took off her bridal dress and put on a plain white frock of small value and then she knelt down at the side of her bed and said her usual evening prayers although she made no pretence to any vehement power of piety in the depth of heart and mind she nourished love of god and faith in him she believed that he gives us earthly life to be rendered innocently back to him not in cowardly escape from trouble but when honour and love demand it in the ignorance common to us all she prayed being now in a calmer state of mind she took from her desk a tress of long hair the most valued of all her treasures her longlost mother oh if only she had a mother to advise her now she kissed it and laid it in her breast and then she glided forth to steal one last sad look at hilary he lay with his back to her fast asleep and she kissed him lightly and ran away then when all the house was quiet except for the sound of plates and dishes greasily going into deep baskets one on the head of another alice lorraine having gathered her long hair into a laconian knot put her favourite garden hat on and made the tie firm under her firm chin she looked round her favourite room once more and nodded farewell to everything and went to seek death with a firmer step than a brides towards a bridegroom attired in pure white she walked through a scene of bridal beauty every tree was overcast with crystal lace and jewellery common briars and ignominious weeds stood up like sceptres weeping branches shone like plumes of ostrich turned to diamond and on the ground wave after wave of snowdrift like a stormy tide driven by tempestuous wind and bound in its cresting wrath by frost although there was now no breath of wind alice knew from the glittering whiteness that it must be very cold she saw her pretty bower like a pillow under bedclothes and on the clear brown walk she scattered crumbs for the poor old robin as soon as he should get up in the morning and there she saw her favourite rose a clusterrose of the softest blush overcome with trouble now and the hardness of the freezing world when the spring should come again who would there be to unroll its grubs or watch for the invasion of greenfly at this thought for fear of giving way she gathered up her dress and ran she had no overwhelming sense of fate necessity or atthe powers that drove fair maids of greece to offer themselves for others she simply desired to do her duty to save the honour of her race and her pure self from defilement the woeburn was running as well as ever quite untouched by any frost and stretched at its length like a great black leech who puts out its head for suction gliding through great piles of snow it looked sable as cocytus with long curls of white vapour hovering where the cold air lay on it the stars were beginning to sparkle now and a young moon gazing over chancton ring avouched the calm depth of heaven then alice came forward commending her soul to god in good christian manner and without a fear or tear or sigh committed her body to the deathbourne chapter lxix bottler beats the elements it seems to be almost a settled point in the affairs of everybody except perhaps prince bismarck that nothing shall come to pass exactly according to arrangement the best and noblest of mankind can do no more than plan discreetly firmly act and humbly wait the pleasure of a just beneficent and allseeing power for instance mr bottler had designed for at least three weeks to slay a large styful of fat pigs but from day to day he had been forced to defer the operation the frost was so intense that this good azrael of the grunters had no faith in the efficacy of his ministrations not indeed as regarded his power to dismiss them to a happier world in any kind of weather he could stick a pig the knife they could not very well decline when skilfully suggested but they might and very often did break all the laws of hospitality by sternly refusing to accept his salt and the object of a pigs creation is triplesetting aside his head and heels and other small appurtenancesfresh pork pickled pork and bacon and the greatest of these three is bacon now what was west lorraine to do and even the town of steyning cartloads of mutton came into the market from the death in the snow of so many sheep which as the general public reasoned must have made the meat beautifully white and a great many labourers got a good feed who had almost forgotten the taste of meat and it did them good and kept them warm but the best families would not have this they liked their mutton to have interviewed the butcher in a constitutional manner and not being sure how to prove this point they would not look at any mutton at all till lamb came out of snowdrift this being so what was now to be done many people said live on bread and so on red herrings and shipchandlers stores and whatever else the lord may send fifty good women came up through the snow to learn the rectors opinion and all he could say was boil down your bones this produced such a desperate run upon the bank of poor bonny which really was a bankof marrow bones put by in the summer to seasonthat jack was at work almost all the day long and got thoroughly up to the tricks of the snow and entirely learned how to travel it bonnys poor hands were so chapped by the cold that he slurred all the polish of the rectors boots and mr hales said that he had better grease them which cut the boy deeper than any chap superior people however could not think of relying upon bonnys bones their money was ready and they would pay for good meat what it was worthand no more now a thoroughly honest man grows uneasy at the thought of getting more than he ought to get it is pleasant to cheat the public but the pleasure soaks down through the conscience leaving tuberculous affection there or bacteria or at any rate some microscopic affliction bottler felt all these visitations and in spite of all demand he could not bring himself to do any more than treble the price of pigmeat it does weigh so light this weather only take it in your hand he was bound to tell everybody for their own sakes now you might scarcely think itbut what with one thing and another that pig have cost me two and threepence a pound and i sell him at one and ninepence oh mr bottler what a shame of you true as you stand there my dear you might not believe it from any one but me till you marry and go into business ah and a very bad business it is starvation to everybody unless they was bred and born to it and even then only a crust of bread mr churchwarden bottler however did not look at all as if he sustained existence on a crust of bread his stockings whiter than the snowdrifts round him showed very substantial bulge of leg and his blue baize apron did like duty for that part of the human being which is so fatal to the race of pigs and the soft smile without which he never spoke arose and subsided in no gaunt cheeks and flickered in the channels of no paltry chin in a word mr bottler was quite fat enough to kill polly he said to his favourite child as soon as he had finished his monday dinner you have been a good child through this very bad weather and dad means to give you a rare treat tonight not consarning the easing of the pigs he continued in answer to her usual nod and employing his regular euphemismthere will be a many pigs to be eased to satisfy the neighbourhood and shut off the rogue to bramber but you shall see polly you shall see something as will astonish you bottler put on his brown leathern apron and gently performed his spiriting and without any nonsense polly saw a lovely scene soon afterwards for her father had made up his mind to do a thing which would greatly exalt his renown and quench that little rogue at bramber in spite of the weather he would kill pigs and in spite of the weather he would pickle them he had five nice porkers and four bacon pigs as ready as pigs can be for killing they seemed to him daily to reproach him for their unduly prolonged existence they could not lay on any fat in this weather but relapsed for want of carving for bottler in the morning had done thiswhich could not have occurred to any but a very superior mind in his new premises facing the lane a short way below nanny stilgoes cottage he had a little yard well away from all thatch and abutting on nothing but his scaldinghouse this yard was square and enclosed by a wall of the chalky flints that break so black and bind so well into mortar of course the whole place was still snowed up but master bottler soon cured that he went to the parish school which was to have opened after the christmas holidays on this th of january but the schoolmaster vowed that in such weather he would warm no boys educational part unless the parish first warmed his own and the parish replied that he might do that for himself not a knob of coal should he have it was quite beginning at the wrong end to warm him first his answer was to bolt the school door and sit down with a pipe and a little kettle the circumspect churchwarden had anticipated this state of siege for he knew that every boy in the parish who would have run like the devil if the door was open knowing the door to be bolted would spend the whole day in kicking at it and here he found them bonny at the head as a boy of rising intellect and captain dick of the biblecorps and the boy who had been shot in the hedge and many other less distinguished boys furiously raging together because robbed of their right to a flogging come along my lads said bottler knowing how to manage boys you may kick all day and wear out your shoes ive got a job for fifty of you and a penny apiece for all as works well not to be too long these boys all followed churchwarden bottler and he led them to his little yard and there he fitted every one of them up with something or other to work with some had brooms and some had shovels some had spades and some had mops one or two worked with old fryingpans and bonny had a wornout warmingpan all the boys who had got into breeches were to have twopence apiece and the rest who were still stitched up at the middle might earn a penny a head if they worked hard not one of them shirked his work they worked as boys alone ever do work throwing all their activity into it and taking the big with the little ones it cost mr bottler four shillings and fourpence to get some hundred cubic yards of snow cleared out so thoroughly that if a boy wanted to pelt a boy he must go outside for his snowball mr bottler smiled calmly as he paid them well he knew what an area of hunger he was spreading for his good pork by means of this army of workboys then he showed the boys the pigs still living and patted their shoulders and smacked his lips with a relish that found an echo at more than forty hearths that evening ah wont they come up rare he said ay and go down rarer still replied bonny already beginning to stand in high esteem for jocosity which he did his very best to earn all boys other than bonny departed with lips overflowing with love of pork into little icicles then mr bottler went to his cartshed and came back with his largest tarpaulin he spread and fixed this in a clever manner over the middle of his little yard leaving about ten feet clear all round between the edge of it and the wall this being done he invited bonny to dinner and enjoyed his converse and afterwards pledged himself to polly as heretofore recorded later in the day many squeaks were heard while bonny worked hard at the furzerick all things are judged always by their results be it enough then to chronicle these west lorraine wiston and steyning itself pronounced with one voice on the following day that a thing had been done on the bank of the woeburn that verily vanquished the woeburn itself as hercules conquered the achelos and the great pelides hacked up by the roots both simois and scamander so bottler a greater hero than even nestor himself could call to mind to snub inferior pigstickers bottler aroused his valour and scotched and slew that pythonthe woeburn it is not enough to speak of such doings in this casual sort of way bottlers deeds are now passing into the era of romance which always precedes the age of history out of romance they all emerge with a tail of attestation and if anybody lays hold of this and clearly sees what to do with it his story becomes history and himself a great historian but lo here are the data for any historian of duly combative enthusiasm to work out what bottler did he let bonny workas all heroes permita great deal harder than he worked himself he calmly looked on and smoked his pipe and knowing quite well how the pigs would act according to bulk and constitution in the question of cooling down he kept his fathers watch in hand and at proper periods eased them meanwhile bonny laboured for his life and by the time all the pigs were ready for posthumous toilet their dressingroom was warm and waiting for them a porker may come home to his positive degreeporkin less than no time but the value of his dedication of himselfin the manner of a young curateto the service of humanity depends very much upon how he is treated the porktrade at this time of writing is so active that everybodyhowever small his operations areshould strive to give it a wholesome check rather than further impetus and for that reason the doings of bottlerfully as they deserve descriptionshall not have a bit of it chapter lxx oh haro haro haro again another thing will show how heavily and wearily all people that on earth do dwell plod and plead their little way and are but where they came from three young people all well wrapped up and ready to face anything set out from old applewood farm on the very day next after twelfthday they meant with one accord to be at coombe lorraine by the saturday night all being summoned upon churchservice there was not one of them that could be dispensed withaccording to the last advicesand they felt their extreme responsibility when the grower locked them out of the great white gate now dont make fools of yourselves he shouted you wont be there quite so soon as you think they laughed him to scorn but even before they got to tonbridge a snowstorm came behind them and quite smothered all their shoulders up and grizzled the roots of the whiskers of the only one who had any this was counsellor gregory and the other two laughed at him and vowed that his wig must have slipped down there and then flicked him with pockethandkerchiefs counsellor gregory took no heed he was wonderfully staid and sapient now and the day when he had played at dartsif crossexamination could have fetched it upwould have been to his expanded mind a painful remembrance of allfools day he stuck to his circuit and cultivated the art of circuitous language and being a sound and diligent lawyer of good face and temper he was able already to pay a clerk who carried his bag and cleaned his boots but any client who had seen him now driving two spirited horses actually in tandem process and sitting as if he were on the kings bench would have met him at the gate with a quo warranto if not a quousque tandem he was well aware of this his conscience told him that a firm of attorneys abode in the chief street of tonbridge and in spite of the snow either partner or clerk would almost be sure to be out at the door he would not have been the growers son if he had tried to circumvent them so he drove by their door and the senior partner took off his hat to mabel and said that gregory was a most rising young man mabel sat in the middle of course with a brother on either side to break the cold wind and keep off the snow she laughed at the weather at first but soon the weather had the laugh of her according to their own ideas they were to put up for the night at the fine old inn at horsham and make their way thence to coombe lorraine in time for dinner on the saturday for mabel of course was to be a bridesmaid the rectors three daughters and the colonels two completing the necessary six but it soon became clear that the grower knew more about roads and weather than the counsellor and the sailor did by the time these eager travellers passed penshurst and the home of the sidneys the road was some eight or nine inches deep with soft newfallen snow they had wisely set forth with a twowheeled carriage strong and not easily knocked out of gearno other in fact than the old yellow gig disdained by mrs lovejoy for the look of it they cared not one jot anything was good enough for such weather and a couple of handsome and powerful horses would carry off a great deal worse than that even if they had thought of it but they never gave one thought to the matter except that the counsellor was a little tamed by the law and its ramifications they all took after their father about the esse v the videri nevertheless they all got snowed up for the friday night at east grinstead instead of getting on to horsham for the further they got away from home the more they managed to lose their way the hedges and the ditches were all as one the guideposts were buried long ago instead of the proper finger and thumb great fists and bellies of drift now and then stuck out to stop the traveller no thoroughfare here in great letters of ivythe ivy that hangs in such deep relief as if itself relieved by snowand trespassers beware from an alder perhaps overhanging a swamp where if the snowcrust were once cut through a poor man could only toss up his arms and go down and be no more heard of and now that another heavy storm was at it black behind them and white in front the horses asked for nothing better than to be left to find their way they threw up their forelocks and jerked their noses and rattled their rings and expressed their ribs and fingered away at the snow with their feet meaning that their own heads were the best if they could only have them so the counsellor let them have their heads for the evening dusk was gathering and the leader turned round to the wheeler and they had many words about it and then they struck off at a merry trot having both been down that road before and supped well at the end of it foreseeing the like delight with this keen weather to enhance it they put their feet out at a tidy stretch scuffling one anothers snowballs and by the time of candlelighting landed their three inferior bipeds at the green man at east grinstead on the following day they were still worse off for although it did not snow again they got into an unknown country without any landmarks and the cold growing more and more severe they resolved to follow the brighton road if ever they should find it but the brighton coaches were taken off and the road so entirely stopped that they must have crossed without perceiving it and both the nags growing very tired and their own eyes dazed with so much white they had made up their minds to build themselves a snowhouse like the esquimaux when the sailor spied something in the distance tall and white against the setting sun which proved to be horsham spire with difficulty they reached the town by starlight and all pretty well frostbitten and there they were obliged to spend the sunday not only for their horses sakes but equally for their own poor selves to finish a bitter and tedious journey they started from horsham on the monday morning as soon as the frozenout sun appeared and although the travelling was wonderfully bad they fetched to west grinstead by twelve oclock and found good provender for man and beast after an hours halt and a peck of beans to keep the cold out of the horses stomachs and a glass of cherrybrandy to do the like for their own and a visit to the blacksmith to fetch up the cogs of the shoes and repair the springs all set off again in the best of spirits and vowing never to be beaten but labour as they might the sun had set ere they got to steyning and under the slide of the hills of course they found the drift grow deeper so that by the time they were come to the long loose street of west lorraine almost every soul therein having regard to the weather was tucked up snugly under the counterpane with the weary leader stooping chin to knee to rub off icicles and the powerful wheeler tramping sedately with his withers down and his crupper up these three bold travellers gregory mabel and charles lovejoy sitting abreast in the yellow gig passed silently through the deep silence of snow and not even a boy beheld them until they came to a place where red light streamed from an opening upon the lane and cast on the snow the shadow of a tall man leaning on a gate inside the gate was a square of bright embers and a man in white stockings uncommonly busy oh gregory stop for a moment cried mabel how warm it looks oh how i wish i was a pig they drew up in the ruddy light and turned their frosted faces frozen cloaks and numbed hands towards it and the leader turned round on his traces and cheered up his poor nose with gazing for warmth as well as light came forth in clouds upon the shivering air what a wonderful man exclaimed mabel again we have nobody like him in all our parish he looks very goodnatured oh do let us go in and warm ourselves and get our noses frozen off directly we come out no thank you said gregory we will drive on get up spangler will you then he flipped the leader with his frozen lash and the tall man leaning upon the gate as if he were short of employment turned round and looked at them and bade the busy man a very good evening and came out into the snow as if he were glad of any wheel track at the turn of the lane they lost sight of him slowly as they ploughed their way and in another minute a very extraordinary thing befel them hark cried mabel as they came to a bank where once the road might have gone straight on but now turned sharply to the right being broken by a broad black water i am quite sure i heard something the frost is singing in your ears said charlie that is what it always does at sea or a blessed cold owl is hooting greg what do you say i will offer my opinion replied the counsellor when i have sufficient data and when you get your fee endorsed there it is again now did you hear it she stood up between her two brothers and stayed herself in the mighty jerks of road with a hand on the shoulder of each of them they listened and doubted her keener ears and gave her a pull to come back again what a child it is said the counsellor she always loses her wits when she gets within miles of that blessed hilary is that all you know about itnow after all the mischief you have made you have done your worst to part us though still quite a junior counsel gregory had been long enough called to the bar to understand that women must not be cited to the bar of reason their opinions deserve the most perfect respect because they are inspired and no good woman ever changes them at any rate mabel was right this time before they could say a word or look round they not only heard but saw a boy riding and raving furiously on the other side of the water he was coming down the course of the stream towards them as fast as his donkey could flounder and slide and tear along over the snowdrifts and at the top of his voice he was shouting a swan a swan a girt white swan the bootiful leddy have turned into a girt swan oh i never are you mad you young fool just get back from the water cried gregory lovejoy sternly for as bonny pulled up the horses weary as they were jumped round in affright at jacks white nose and great ears jerking in a shady place get back from the water or we shall all be in it for the wheeler having caught the leaders scare was backing right into the woeburn and mabel could not help a little scream till the sailor sprang cleverly over the wheel and seized the shafthorse by the head there she cometh there she cometh shouted bonny all the while oh whatever shall i do i see it i see it cried mabel leaning over the rail of the gig and gazing up the dark stream steadfastly oh what can it be it is all white and hangs upon the water so it must be some one floating drowned charlie the sailor without a word ran to a bulge of the bank as he saw the white thing coming nearer looked at it for an instant with all his eyes then flung off his coat and plunged into the water as if for a little pleasant swim he had no idea of the power of the current but if he had known all about it he would have gone headforemost all the same for he saw in midchannel the form of a woman helpless senseless at the mercy of the water and that was quite enough for him from his childhood up he had been a swimmer and was quite at his ease in rough water and therefore despised this sliding smoothness but before he had taken three strokes he felt that he had mistaken his enemy instead of swimming up the stream which looked very easy to do from the bank he could not even hold his own with arms and legs against it but was quietly washed down by the force bearing into the cups of his shoulders but in spite of the volume of torrent he felt as comfortable as could be for the water was by some twenty degrees warmer than in the frosty air cut the traces he managed to shout as his brother and sister hung over the bank what does he mean asked gregory take my little knife said mabel it cuts like a razor but my hands shake i see i see nodded the counsellor and he cut the long traces of the leader and knotted them together meanwhile charlie let both feet sink and stood edgewise in the rapid current treading water quietly of course he was carried down stream as he did it but slowly compared with a floating body and he found that the movement was much less rapid at three or four feet from the surface before he had time to think of this or fairly fetch his balance the white thing he was waiting for came gliding in the blackness towards him he flung out his arms at once and cast his feet back and made towards it in the gliding hurry and the flit of light it passed him so far that he said goodbye and then perhaps from the attraction of bodies it seemed for a second to stop and the hand he cast forth laid hold of something his own head went under water and he swallowed a good mouthful but he stuck to what he had got hold of as behoves an englishman then he heard great shouting upon dry land and it made him hold the tighter bravo my noble fellow he heard he was getting a little tired but encouragement is everything catch it catch it lay hold lay hold he heard in several voices and he saw the splash of the traces thrown but had no chance to lay hold of them the power of the black stream swept him on and he vainly strove for either bank unless he would let loose his grasp and he would rather drown with it than do that now who saved him and his precious salvage a poor despised and yet clever boy whose only name was bonny when gregory lovejoy had lashed the woeburn with his traces vainly and mabel had fixed her shawl to the end of them and the tall man who followed the gig had dropped into the water quietly and bottler disturbed by the shouting had left his pigs and shone conspicuousnot one of them could have done a bit of good if it had not been for bonny from no great valour on the part of the boy but from a quickwitted suggestion his suggestion had to cross the water as many good suggestions have to do and but for bottlers knowledge of his voice nobody would have noticed it yell nab em down to bridge he cried hurn down to bridge and eell nab em tell un not to faight so let yoursen go with the strame shouted bottler to the gallant charlie no use faighting for the bank theres a tree as crosseth down below and usll pullee both out when a gets there charlie had his head well up and saw the wisdom of this counsel he knew by long battle that he could do nothing against the tenor of the woeburn and the man who had leaped in to help him brave and strong as he was could only follow as the water listed the water went at one set pace and swimmers only floated and now it was a breathless race for the people on the dry land to gain the long tree that spanned the woeburn ere its victims were carried under and but for sailor lovejoys skill and presence of mind in seeking downward and paddling more than swimming the swift stream would have been first at the bridge and then no other chance for them as it was the runners were just in time with scarcely a second to spare for it three men knelt on the trunk of the tree while mabel knelt in the snow and prayed the merciless stream was a fathom below them but they hung the staunch traces in two broad loops made good at each end in a fork of bough and they showed him where they were by flipping the surface of the water clinging to his helpless burden still and doing his best to support it the young sailor managed to grasp the leather but his strength was spent and he could not rise and all things swam around him the snowy banks the eager faces the white form he held and the swift black currentall like a vision swept through his brain and might sweep on for ever his wits were gone and he must have followed and been swept away to another world if a powerful swimmer had not dashed up in full command of all faculties the tall man whom nobody had heeded in the rush and hurry came down the black gorge with his head well up and the speed and strength of an osprey he seized the broad traces with such a grasp that the timber above them trembled and he bore himself up with his chest to the stream and tearing off his neckcloth fastened first the drowned white figure and then poor charlie to the loop of the strap and saw them drawn up together then gathering all his remaining powers he struck for the bank and gained it hurrah shouted bottler and every one present mabel included joined the shout be quick be quick it is no time for words cried the tall man shaking his dress on the snow let me have the lady you bring the fine fellow as quickly as possible to bottlers yard bottler just show us the shortest way to be sure sir mr bottler answered but major you cannot carry her and the drops are freezing on you do as i told you run in front of me and just show the shortest road dash my stockings cried master bottler they wont be worth looking at tomorrow and all through the snow ive kept un white and i aint got any more clean ones however he took a short cut to his yard while aylmer with the lady in his arms and her head hanging over his shoulder followed so fast that the good pigsticker could scarcely keep in front of him never mind me cried brave charlie reviving i am as right as ever mabel go on and help though i fear it is too late to do any good whoever it is it is dead as a stone said the counsellor wiping the wet from his sleeves it fell away from me like an empty bag you might have spared your ducking charlie but it must have been a lovely young woman dead or alive i have done my duty but dont you know who it is oh mabel how could i see her face said mabel the men would not let me touch her and about here i know no one yes you do you know alice lorraine it is poor sir rolands daughter chapter lxxi an argument refuted while these things were going on down in the valley a nice little argument was raging in the diningroom of the old house on the hill by reason of the bitter weather mr binns and john trotman had brought in two large threewinged screens of ancient poikoloddal canvas upon them was depicted every bird that flies and fish that swims and beast that walks on the face of the earth besides many that never did anything of the sort and betwixt them and a roaring fire sat six good gentlemen taking their wine in the noble manner of the period under the wings of one great screen sir roland lorraine and colonel clumps and parson hales were sitting in the other encamped sir remnant chapman stephen his son and mr john ducksbill a fundamentally trusty solicitor to see to the deed in the morning the state of the weather brought about all this it would have been better for the bridegroom to come with a dash of horses in the morning stir up the church and the law and the people and scatter a pounds worth of halfpence but after so long an experience of the cold white mood of the weather common sense told everybody that if a thing was to be done at all all who were to do it must be kept pretty well together but alas even when the weather makes everybody cry alas it is worse than the battles of the wind and snow for six male members of the human race to look at one another with the fire in their front and the deuce of a cold draught in their backs and wine without stint at their elbows and dwell wholly together in harmony and the most exciting of all subjects unluckily had been startedor rather might be said inevitably six gentlemen could not in any reason be hoped to sit over their wine without getting into the subject of the ladies this is a thing to be always treated with a deep reserve and confidential hint of something that must not go beyond a hint every man thinks with his glass in his hand that he knows a vast deal more about woman than any womans son before him opinions at once begin to clash every man speaks from his own experience which upon so grand a matter is as the claw of a lobster grasping at a whalethe largest of the mammals rector i tell you repeated sir remnant with an angry ring of his wineglass that you know less than nothing about it sir all the more to your credit of course of course a parson must stick to his cloth and his gown and keep himself clear of the petticoats but my dear sir my own three daughters you may have got thirty daughters without knowing anything at all about them but my good sir my wife at leastcome now is that no experience you may have got sixty wives sir and be as much in the dark as ever ducksbill you know come now ducksbill give us your experience sir remnant i am inclined to think that upon the whole your view of the question is the one that would be sustained though the subject has so many ramifications that possibly his reverence knows nothing at all about it gadzooks sir less than nothing i tell you they have no will of their own any more than they have any judgment a man with a haporth of brains may do exactly what he likes with them colonel you know it come colonel now after all your battles my battles were not fought amongst the women said colonel clumps very curtly hear hear cried the rector smacking his fat leg in the joy of a new alliance very well sir said sir remnant with his wrath diverted from the parson to the soldier you mean i suppose that my battles have been fought among the women only i said nothing of the sort i know nothing of your battles you alluded to mine and i spoke my mind colonel clumps had been vexed by sir remnants words he had long had a brother officers widow in his mind and ever since he had been underfitted with a piece of boxwood his feelings were hurt whenever women were run down in his presence chapman i think said sir roland lorraine to assuage the rising storm that we might as well leave these little points which have been in debate for some centuries for future centuries to settle at their perfect leisure mr ducksbill the wine is with you struan you are not getting on at all my son has been in portugal and he says these olives are the right ones all the other gentlemen took the hint and dropped the pugnacious subject but sir remnant was such a tough old tyrant that there was no diverting him he took a mighty pinch of snuff rapped the corner of his box and began again why look you lorraine at that girl of yours as nice a girl as ever lived and well brought up by her grandmother a clever girl tooill be dashed if she isnt she has said many things that have made me laugh and it takes a good joke to do that i can tell you but no will of her ownno judgmentno what i may call decision i am sorry to hear it said sir roland dryly i thought my daughter had plenty of all those of course you did all men think that till they find their mistake out nurse my vittels if there is any one thing a woman should know her own mind about it would be her own marriage but gadzooks gentlemen miss lorraine over and over again declared that she would not have our steenie and tomorrow morning she will have him as merry as a grig sir now father began captain chapman but as he spoke the screens were parted and trotman stood there in all the importance of a great newsbearer what do you mean sir cried colonel clumps whose sedentary arrangements were suddenly disturbed by gad sir if i only had my bamboo if you plaize sir said trotman looking only at his master there be very bad news indeed miss halice have adrowned herself in the woeburn and her corpse be at bottler the pigmans dead good god cried the rector and the men either started to their feet or fell back on their chairs according to their constitution sir roland alone sat as firm as a rock upon what authority authority sir roland neither finished that sentence nor began another his face became livid his underjaw fell he rolled on his side and lay there as if by a hand direct from heaven he was struck with palsy chapter lxxii on lethes wharf as soon as the master of the house had been taken to his bedroom and a groom sent off at full gallop for the nearest doctor mr hales went up to stephen chapman who was crying in a corner and hauled him forth and took his hand and patted him on the shoulder come my good fellow he said you must not allow yourself to be so overcome the thing may be greatly exaggeratedeverything always is you know i never believe more than half of a story and i generally find that twice too much oh but i did so lovelovelove her it does seem too hard upon me oh parson i feel as if i should die almost when the doctor comes let him see me first he cannot do any good to sir roland and sir roland is old and he has always been good but i have been a very bad man always bad or good be a man of some sortnot a whining baby said the rector put on your hat and come out with me if you have got a bit of pluck in you i am going down to see my poor niece at once oh i could not do it i could never do it how can you ask me to do such a thing and in such weather as this is very well mr hales replied buttoning up the collar of his coat i have no son stephen chapman and i am in holy orders and therefore canonically debarred from the use of unclerical language but if i had a son like you dash me if i would not kick him from my housedoor to my mixen having thus relieved his mind the rector went to the main front passage and chose for himself a most strenuous staff and then he pulled the wire of the frontdoor bell that the door might be fastened behind him and before any of the scared servants came up he had thought of something who is it oh mrs merryjack is it yes sir please sir the men are all away and the housemaids too frightened to come up the stairs you are a good woman where is mrs pipkins she hath fetched up her great jar of leeches sir and she is trying them with poor master lord bless you you might every bit as well put horse radish on him and better merryjackbetter i believe now you are a sensible and clever woman no sir oh lord sir i was never told that though some folk may a said so they were right every time they said it maam and no one has said it more often than i have now mrs merryjack yes sir yes sir anything you tells me sir it is only this i am going as fast as i can to churchwarden bottlers i shall take the short cut and cross the water you cannot do that it would not be safe for a woman in the dark to attempt it but just do this order the light close carriage as soon as possible the horses are roughed to go to church tomorrow get inside it with your warmest cloak on and blankets and shawls and anything else you can think of and tell the man to drive for his life to bottlers women will be wanted there for one thing or the other yes sir to be sure sir we are always wanted ohs me the poor young dear the rector set off by a path to the right passing eastward of the coombe and leading as well as might be to the tree that crossed the water it was a rough and dreary road and none but a veteran sportsman could in that state of the weather have followed it but mr hales knew every yard of the hill and when he could trust the drift and where it would have been death to venture and though the moon had set long ere this the sky was bright and the sparkle of the stars was spread as in a concave mirror by the radiance of the snow at bottlers gate mr hales was rudely repulsed until they looked at him gregory and bonny were on guard with a great tarpaulin behind them each of them having a broom in hand ready to be thrust into anybodys face a great glow of light was in the air and by it their eyes shonewhether it were with ferocity or whether it were with tenderness i am her own unclei must go in i stand in the place of her father bonny of course knew his master and opened the palinggate to let him in and there mr hales beheld a thing such as he never had seen before every sign of the singeing or dressing of pigs had been done away with the embers of fuel all around the grey walls had given their warmth and lay quivering the grey flints bedded in lime behind them were of a dull and sulky red the ground all over the courtyard steamed as the blow of the frost rose out of it and the cover spread overhead reflected genial warmth and comfort near the middle of the yard on the mattress lay the form of poor alice enfolded in the warm blankets and mrs bottlers best counterpane the kind and good woman with mabels help had removed the wet and freezing clothes when major aylmer had laid his burden in mrs bottlers parlour the only hope that the fleeting spirit might remain or return was to be found in warmth or rather strong heat applied at once and therefore with the majors advice and aid clever use had been made of mr bottlers great preparations it is needless to say that the pigman who had now galloped off to steyning for a doctor would if left to himself have settled matters very speedily by hanging the poor girl up head downwards to drain off the water she had swallowed but now under major aylmers care everything had been done as well as a doctor could have managed it the body was laid with the head well up and partly inclined on the right side so that the feeble flutter of the heartif any should arisemight not be hindered the slender feet so white and beautifully arched were laid on a brown stone jar of hot water and the little helpless palms were chafed by the rough hands of mrs bottler mabel also spread light friction with a quick and glancing touch over the cold heart frozen breast and chill relapse of everything and from time to time she endeavoured to inspire the gentle rise and fall of breath the major came forward and took the hand of his friend the rector silently is there any hope whispered mr hales less and less it is now two hours since we began trying to restore her i was nearly drowned myself some years ago and lay for an hour insensible every minute that passes now lessens the chance but this young lady is wonderfully clever i only do what you tell me said mabel looking up without leaving off her persevering efforts flying in the face of the almighty i call it cried mrs bottler who was very tired and ought to have had equal share of the praise poor dear we had better let her bide till the doctor cometh or the crowner not till a doctor declares her dead said major aylmer quietly i am delighted that you are come mr hales you are a great reinforcement i have longed to try my own hand butbut you can you are her uncle perhaps you have not seen a case like this will you act under my directions with all my heart replied the rector pulling off his coat and pitching it down anywhere oh my dear my pretty dear i do believe you will know my touch go out of the way mrs bottler nowgo and make some soup maam mabel and i mabel and i when we get together i do believe we could make a flock of sheep out of a row of flints now sir what am i to do whatever he was told he did with such a will that presently mabel looked up and exclaimed with breathless delightoh i feel a little throbi did feel a little flutter of the hearti am almost sure i did my dear girl rub away answered the rector that is right major is not it i believe so now is the critical time a relapseand all is over there shall be no relapse cried the rector working away with his shirtsleeves up and his ruddy face glowing in the firelight please god there shall be no relapse the bravest and the noblest maid in the world shall not go out of it do you know me my darling you ought to know your kind uncle struan purely white and beautiful as a piece of the noblest sculpture alice lay before them her bashful virgin beauty was even in the shade of death respected with pure reverence the light of the embers which alone could save her mouldering ash of life showed the perfect outline and the absence of the living gift which makes it more than outline mabels face intense with vital energy and quick resolve shone and glowed in contrast with the apathy and dull whiteness over which she bent so eagerly now even while she gazed the dim absorption of white cheeks and forehead slowly passed and changed its dulness like a hydrophane immersed into glancing and reflecting play of tender light and life rigid lines set lineaments fixed curves and stubborn vacancy began to yield a little and a little and then more and more to the soft return of life and the sense of being alive again there is no power of describing it those who have been through it cannot tell what happened to them only this we know that we were dead and now we live again and by the law of nature which we undercrept so narrowly we are driven to the opposite extreme of tingling vitality softly as an opening flower and with no more knowledge of the windy world around us eyelids fair as cythereas raised their fringe and fell again then a long deep sigh of anguish quite uncertain where it was but resolved to have utterance arose from rich pure depth of breast and left the kind heart lighter darling cried mabel do you know me open your eyes again and tell me alice opened her eyes again but she could not manage to say anything and she did not seem to know any one then the doctor pulled up at the palinggate skipped in felt pulse or felt for it and forthwith ordered stimulants put her to bed in a very warm room the carriage is here with the blankets but on no account must she go home mrs bottler will give up her best room let mrs merryjack sit up all night she is a cook she can keep a good fire up let her try to roast her young mistress only keep the air well moving i see that you have a firstrate nursethis pretty young ladyexcuse me maam well i shall be back in a couple of hours i have a worse case to see to he meant sir roland but would not tell them he had met the groom from coombe lorraine and he knew how the power of life has dropped from a score of years to threescore chapter lxxiii pollys doll in this present state of things and difficulty everywhere the one thing most difficult of all is to imagine greater goodness than that of mr bottler he had a depression that could not be covered by a fivepound note to begin with in the value of the pigmeat he was dressing scientifically when he had to turn it all out to be frozen and take in poor alice to thaw instead of that he thought nothing less than nothinghe said so and he tried to feel it but take it as you will it is something a mans family may be getting lighter as they begin to maintain themselves but the man himself wants more maintenance after all his exertions with them and the wife of his old bosom lacks more nourishment than the bride of his young one more money goes out as more money comes in and not only that but professional pride grows stronger as a man grows older and more thoroughly up to his business especially if a lot of junior fellows like the man at bramber rush in and invent new things and boast of work that we know to be clumsy if any man in england was proud of the manner in which he turned out his pork that man was churchwarden bottler yet disappointment combined with loss could not quench his accustomed smile or plough one wrinkle in his snowy hose as he quitted his cart on the following morning and made his best duty and bow to alice alice still looking very pale and frail was lying on the couch in the pigmans drawingroom while mabel who had been with her all the night sat on her chair by her pillow alice had spoken with tears in her eyes of the wonderful kindness of every one her mind was in utter confusion yet as to anything that had befallen her except that she had some sense of having done some desperate deed which had caused more trouble than she was worthy of her pride and courage were far away her spirit had been so near the higher realms where human flesh is not that it was delighted to get back and substantially ashamed of itself what will my dear father say and what will other people think i seem to have considered nothing and i can consider nothing now darling dont try to consider mabel answered softly you have considered far too much and what good ever comes of it none she answered less than none consider the lilies that consider not oh my head is going round again it was the roundness of her head which had saved her life in the long dark water any long head must have fallen back and yielded up the ghost but her purely spherical head with the gardenhat fixed tightly round it floated well on a rapid stream with air and natural hair resisting any waterlogging and thus the woeburn had borne her for a mile and vainly endeavoured to drown her oh why does not my father come she cried as soon as she could clear her mind he always used to come at once and be in such a hurry even if i got the nettlerash he must have made his mind up now to care no more about me and when he has once made up his mind he is sternsternstern he never will forgive me my own father will despise me where now where is somebody you are getting to be foolish again said mabel much as it grieved her to speak thus your father cannot come at the very first moment you call for him he is full of lawyers business and allowances must be made for him now you are so clever and you have inherited from the normans such a quick perception take this thing and tell me alice what it can be meant for from the place of honour in the middle of the mantelpiece mabel lovejoy took down a tool which had been dwelling on her active mind ever since the night before she understood taps she had knowledge of cogs she could enter into intricate wards of keys and was fond of letterpadlocks but now she had something which combined them all and she could not make head or tail of it i thought that i knew every metal that grows she said as alice opened her languid hand for such a trifle i always clean our forks and spoons and my mothers three silver teapots but i never beheld any metal of such a colour as this has got before can you tell me what this metal is i ought to know something but i know nothing alice answered wearily my father is acknowledged to be full of learning every minute i expect him no doubt he will tell us when he comes but i am so impatient and it looks like the key of some wonderful lock that nothing else would open may i ask what it is come at least say that it will give me the greatest delight to know said alice with a yawn what the thing is because it will please you darling and it certainly does look curious upon this question mrs bottler like a good woman referred them to her learned husband who came in now from his morning drive scraping off the frozen snow and accompanied of course by polly pollys doll thats what we call it he said the little maid took such a liking to it that bonny was forced to give it to her where the boy got it the lord only knows the lord hath given him the gift of finding amost everything he hath it both in his eyes and hands i believe that boyd die lord mayor of london if hed only come out of his hole in the hill but cannot we see him mr bottler asked mabel when he is finding these things does he lose himself not he miss replied the man of bacon he knows where he is go where he will you can hear him awhistling down the lane now he knoweth when ive a been easing of the pigs sharper than my own steel do chittlings or skirt or milt or trimmingsoh hes the boy for a rare pigs fryit dont matter what the weather is id as lief dine with him as at home amost oh let me go and see him at the door cried mabel i am so fond of clever boys so out she ran without waiting for leave and presently ran back again oh what a nice boy she exclaimed to alice so very polite and he has got such eyes but im sadly afraid hell be impudent when he grows much older aha miss aha miss you are right enough there observed mr bottler with a crafty grin he aint over bashful already perhaps and where do you think he found this most extraordinary instrument at shoreham drawn up by the nets from the sea and they said that it must have been dropped from a ship many and many a year ago when shoreham was a place for foreign traffic and he is almost sure that it must be a key of some very strange oldfashioned lock then you may depend upon it that it is a key and nothing else said bottler with his fine soft smile that boy bonny hath been about so much among odds and ends and rakings that he knoweth a bit about everything an oldfashioned key from the sea at shoreham let me think of something said alice leaning back on her pillow with her head still full of the woeburn i seem to remember something and then i am not at all sure what it is oh when is my father coming your father hath sent orders miss alice said bottler coming back with a good bold lie that you must go up to the house if you please he hath so much to see to with them chapman lot that he must not leave home nohow the coach is acoming for you now just very well answered alice i will do as i am told i mean to do always whatever i am told for all the rest of my life i am sure but will you lend me pollys doll lord bless you miss i darent do it for my life polly would have the house down shem is the strangest child as you ever did see until you knows how to manage her her requireth to be taken the right side up now if i say poll to her her wont do nothing but if i say polly dearwhy there she is alice was too weak and worn to follow this great question up but mabel was as wide awake as ever although she had been up all night now mr bottler just do this go and say polly dear will you lend your doll to the pretty lady till it comes back covered with sugarplums mr bottler promised that he would do this and by the time alice was ready to go square polly with a very broad gait came up and placed her doll without a word in the hands of alice and then ran away and could never stop sobbing until her father put the horse in on purpose and got her between his legs in the cart where are you going cried mrs bottler we will drive to the end of the world he answered im blowed if i think therell be any gate to pay between this and that by the look of things polly hold on by daddys knees chapter lxxiv from hades gates in the old house and good household warmth of opinion and heat of expression abounded now about everything pages might be taken up by saying what even one man thought and tens of pages would not contain the half of what one woman said enough that when poor alice was brought back through the snowdrifts quietly every moveable person in the house was at the door everybody loved her and everybody admired her but now with a pendulous conscience also with much fear about themselves as the household of admetus gazed at the pale return of alcestis alice being still so weak and quite unfit for anything was frightened at their faces and drew back and sank with faintness sillies cried mabel jumping out with pollys doll inside her muff naturals or whatever you are just come and do your duty they still hung away and not one of them would help poor alice across her own fathers threshold until a great scatter of snow flew about and a black horse was reigned up hotly you zanies cried the rector you cowardly fools you never come to church or you would know what to do you skulking hounds are you afraid of your own masters daughter i have got my big whip by the lord you shall have it out of my parish ill set to and kick every dastardly son of a cook of you where is my father said alice faintly i hoped that he would have come for me at the sound of her voice they began to perceive that she was not the ghost of the woeburn and the rectors strong championship cast at once the broad and sevenfold shield of the church over the maidens skeary deed oh uncle struan she whispered hanging upon his arm as he led her in have i committed some great crime will my father be ashamed of me he should rather be ashamed of himself i think he answered for the present declining the subject which he meant to have out with her some day but my dear he is not quite well that is why he does not come to see you and indeed he does not knowi mean he is not at all certain how you are trotman open that door sir this moment the parson rather carried than led his niece into a sittingroom and set her by a bright fire and left mabel lovejoy to attend to her while he himself hurried away to hear the last account of sir roland and to consult the doctor as to the admittance of poor alice but in the passage he met colonel clumps heavily stumping to and fro with even more than wonted energy upon my life and soul master parson i must get out of this house he cried slashing work sir horrible slashing i had better be under old beaky again i came here to quiet my system sir and zounds sir they make every hair stand up why colonel what is the matter now surely a man of war like you yes sir a man of war i am but not a man of suicide and paralysis and precipices and concussions of the brain sirbattle and murder and sudden deathwhy my own brain is in a concussion sir so it appears said the rector softly but surely colonel you can tell us what the news is the news is just this sir cried the colonel stamping the two chapmans were upset in their coach last night down a precipice and both killed as dead as stones sir they sent for the doctor thats proof of it our doctor has had to be off for his life no man ever sends for the doctor until he is dead there is some truth in that replied mr hales but i wont believe it quite yet at any rate no doubt they have been upset i said so as soon as i heard they were gone particularly with their postilions drunk and i dare say they are a good deal knocked about but snow is a fine thing to ease a fall whatever has happened they brought on themselves by their panic and selfish cowardice ay they ran like rats from a sinking ship when they saw poor sir rolands condition alice had frightened them pretty well but the other affair quite settled them sad as it was i could scarcely help laughing a sad disappointment for your nice girls colonel instead of a gay wedding a house of death and for your pretty daughters rector too however we must not think of that you have taken in the two lovejoys i hear gregory and charlie yes poor fellows they were thoroughly scared last night and of course bottler had no room for them that charlie is a grand fellow and fit to follow in the wake of nelson he was frozen all over as stiff as a rick just thatched and what did he say to me he said i shall get into the snow and sleep i wont wet mother bottlers floor well done well said there is nothing in the world to equal english pluck sir when you come across the true breed of it ah if those dd fellows had left me my leg i would have whistled about my arm sir but the worst of the whole is this supposing that i am grossly insulted sir how can i do what a briton is bound to dohow can i kickyou know what i mean sir come colonel if you can manage to spin round like that you need not despair of compassing the national salute but here we are at sir rolands door are we allowed to go in or what are the orders of the doctor oh yes he is quite unconscious you might fire off a cannon close to his ear without his starting a hairs breadth he will be so for three days the doctor thinks and then he will awake and live or die according as the will of the lord is most of us do that answered the parson but what shall i say to his daughter leave her to me i will take her a message sir i have been hoaxed so in the army that now i can hoax any one i believe you are right she will listen to you a great deal more than she would to me moreover i want to be off as soon as i have seen poor sir roland i shall ride on and ask how the chapmans are i dont believe they are dead they are far too tough what a blessing it is to have you here colonel with the house in such a state how is that confounded old woman who lies at the bottom of all this mischief lady valeria lorraine said the colonel rather stiffly is as well as can be expected sir she has been to see her son sir roland and her grandson hilary my opinion is that this brave girl inherits her spirit from her grandmother whatever happens i am sure of one thing she ought to be the mother of heroes sir not the wife of steenie chapman ahs me cried the rector it will take a brave man to marry her after what she has done stuff and nonsense answered the colonel a good man will value her all the more and scorn the opinion of the county sir the rector in his own stout heart was much of the same persuasion but it would not do for him to say so yet so after a glance at sir rolands wan and deathlike features he rode forth with a sigh to look after the chapmans chapter lxxv something like a legacy a grand physician being called from london pronounced that sir rolands case was one of asthenic apoplexy rather than of pure paralysis he gave the proper directions praised the local practitioners hoped for the best took his fifty guineas with promptitude and departed if there were any weight on the mind it must be cast aside at once as soon as the mind should have sense of it for this a little effort might be allowed such as the making of a will or so forth or goodbye to children for on the first return of sense some activity was good for it but after that repose dear sir insist on repose and nourishing food no phlebotomyno that is quite a mistake an anachronism a barbarism in such a case as this is it is anmia with our poor friend and vascular inaction no arterial plethorism quite the opposite in fact you have perfectly diagnosed the case how it will end i cannot say any more than you can one more there was one miserable heart perpetually vexed and torn that could not tell how things would end if even they ended anyhow alice lorraine could not be kept from going to her fathers bed and she was not strong enough yet to bear the sight of the wreck before her it is my doingmy doing she cried oh what a wicked thing i must have done to be punished so bitterly as this if you please miss to go away with your excitement said the old nurse who was watching him you promised to behave yourself and this is how you does it us never can tell what they hears or what they dont when they lies with their ears pricked up so nurse i will go away said alice i always do more harm than good the only comfort she now could get flowed from the warm bright heart of mabel everybody else gave signs of being a little or much afraid of her and what is more dreadful for any kind heart than for other hearts to dread it she knew that she had done a desperate thing and she felt that everybody had good reason for shrinking away from her large deep eyes she tried to keep up her courage in spite of all that was whispered about her and truly speaking her whole heart vested in her father and her brother mabel watched the whole of this and did her best to help it but sweet and good girl as she was and in her way very noble she belonged to a stratum of womanhood distinct from that of alice she would never have jumped into the river she would simply have defied them to take her to church she would have cried here i am and i wont marry any man unless i love him i dont love this man and i wont have him now do your worst every one of you a sensible way of regarding the thing except for the need of the money on the third day sir roland moved his eyes and feebly raised one elbow alice sat there at his side as now she was almost always sitting oh father she cried if you would only give me one little sign that you know me just to move your darling hand or just to give me one little glance or if i have no right to that go away miss leave the room if you please my orders was very particular to have nobody near him when he first begins to take notice to anything alice with a deep sigh obeyed the orders of the cross old dame and when the doctor came she received her reward in his approval it was pitiful to see how humble this poor girl was now become the accident to the chapmans her fathers stroke poor hilarys ruin the lowering of the family for years had all been attributed to her wicked sin by lady valeria whose wrath was boundless at the overthrow of all her plans what good have you done what good have you done by such a heinous outrage you have disgraced yourself for ever who will ever look at you now everybody i am afraid madam alice answered with a blush you know what i mean as well as i do even if you were drowned i believe you would catch at the words of your betters drowning people catch at straws she answered with a shudder of memory and you could not even drown yourself you were too clumsy to do even that well madam said alice with a smile almost resembling that of better times surely even you will admit that i did my best towards it ah you flighty child leave my room and go and finish killing your father now when the doctor came and saw the slight revival of his patient he hurried in search of miss lorraine towards whom he had taken a liking after he had given his opinion of the case and comforted her until she cried he saidnow you must come and see him and if you can think of anything likely to amuse him or set his mind in motionany interesting remembrance or suggestion of mild surprise it will be the very best thing possible but surely to see me again will sufficiently astonish him it is not likely in most of these cases perfect oblivion is the rule as to the occurrence that stimulated the predisposition to these attacks sir roland will not have the smallest idea thatthat anything has happened to you and so it proved when alice came to her fathers side he looked at her exactly as he used to do except that his glance was weak and wavering and full of desire to comfort her the doctor had told her to look cheerful and even gayand she did her best sir roland had lost all power of speech but his hearing was as good as ever and being ordered to take turtlesoup he was propped up on a bank of pillows and doing his best to execute medical directions oh my darling darling cried alice after a little while being left to feed her father delicately i have got such a surprise for you you will say you were never so astonished in all the course of your life before she knew how her father would have answered if he had been at all himself he would have lifted his eyebrows and aroused her dutiful combativeness with some of that little personal play which passes between near relatives who love and understand each other as it was he could only nod to show his anxiety for some surprise and then alice did a thing which under any other circumstances would have been most inconsistent in her in the drawer of his lookingglass she found his bestbeloved snuffbox and she put one little pinch between his limp forefinger and white thumb and raised them towards the proper part and trusted to nature to do the rest a pleasant light shone forth his eyes and she felt that she had earned a kiss betwixt a smile and a tear she took it and then for fear of a chill she tucked him up and sat quietly by him she had learned as we learn in our syntax what vacuis committere venis when he had slept for two or three hours with alice hushing the sound of her breath he was seized with sudden activity his body had been greatly strengthened by the most nourishing of all food and now his mind began to aim at like increase of movement what do you think i have got to show you said alice perceiving this condition nothing less i do believe than the key of the fine old astrologers case of course i can only guess because you have got it locked away papa but from the metal looking just the same and the shape of it and the seven corners and its being found at shoreham in the sea where memel was said to have lost it i do think it must be that very same key and i found it papawell i found it under rather peculiar circumstances now may i go and try there can be no harm if it turns out to be pure fancy her father nodded and pointed to a drawer where he kept his important keys as his daughter of course was well aware and in five minutes alice came back again with the strange old case in one hand and pollys queer doll in the other mabel lingered in the passage not being sure that she ought to come in though alice tried to fetch her then alice set the case or cushion upon her fathers bedside table and with a firm hand pushed the key down and endeavoured to turn it not a tittle would anything yield or budge although it was clear to the dullest eye that lock and key belonged together it is the key papa cried alice it fits to a hair but it wont turn this queer old thing goes round and round instead of staying quiet and waiting to be unlocked justly i suppose my hands are too weak oh there provoking thing it goes round again i know how i could manage it if i may my darling father in the astrologers room i saw a tremendous vice fit to take anything i have inherited some of his turn for tools and mechanism though of course in a most degenerate degree now may i go up i shall have no fear whatever if mabel comes with me winning mute assent she ran for the key of that room and took mabel with her and soon they had that obstinate case set fast in a vice whose screw had not been turned for more than two centuries the bottom of the cone was hard and solid and bedded itself in the old oak slabs now turn mabel turn the key is warped or we might apply more force said alice they did not know that it had been crooked by the jaws of jack the donkey even so it would not yield until they passed an ancient chisel through its loop and worked away then with a thin and sulky screech the cogs began to move and the upper half of the case to slide aside oh i am so frightened alice cried mabel drawing back her hands and the room is so cold it seems so unholy it feels like witchcraft and all his old tools looking at us witch or wizard or necromancer i am not going to leave off now answered alice the resolute you may run away if you like but i mean to get to the bottom of this if iif i can at least she was going to say if i die for it but she had been so close to death quite lately that she feared to take his name in vain how slowly it moves how it does resist cried mabel returning to the charge i thought i was pretty strongwell it ought to be worth something for all this work it is fireproof it is lined with asbestos alice answered eagerly oh there must be an enormous lot of gold there cant be said mabel why a thousand guineas is more than you or i could carry and you carried this easily in one hand dont talk so cried alice but work away i am desperately anxious as for me i am positively dying of curiosity lend me your pockethandkerchief dear i am cutting my hands to pieces here it comes i do believe well what an extraordinary thing the dome of the cone had yielded sulkily to the vigour and perseverance of two good young ladies it had slidden horizontally the key of course sliding with it upon a strong rack of metal which had been purposely made to go stiffly and now that the cover had passed the cogs it was lifted off quite easily all this was the handiwork of the man the simpleminded eastern sage who loved the shepherds and the sheep and whose fine spirit would have now rejoiced to see the result of good workmanship the two fair girls poured hair together with forehead close to forehead when the round substantial case lay coverless before them a disc of yellow parchment was spread flat on the top of everything with its edges crenelled into the asbestos lining hours and perhaps days of care had been spent by clever brain and hands to keep the air and dust out who shall lift it asked mabel panting i am almost afraid to move i will lift it of course said alice i am his descendant and he foresaw that i should do it she took from the lathe a little narrow tool for turning ivory which had touched no hand since the princes and she delicately loosened up the parchment and examined it it was covered with the finest manuscript in concentric rings beginning with half an inch of diameter but she could not interpret a word of that below it shone a thick flossy layer of the finest mountain wool and under that the soft spun amber of the richest native silk now alice do you mean to stop all night cried mabel see how the light is fading the light was fading and spreading also in a way that reminded alice although the season and the weather were so entirely different of her visit to that room two and a half long years ago alone among the shadows the white light with the snowgleam in it favoured any inborn light in everything else that was beautiful alice with the gentlest touch of the fairygifts of her fingers raised the last gossamer of the silk and drew back and sighed with wonder mabel always prompt to take the barb and shaft of everything leaned over and looked in and at once enlarged her eyes and mouth in purest stupefaction before and between these two most lovely specimens of the human race lay the most beautiful and more lasting proofs of what nature used to do before the production of women alice and mabel with the light in their eyes and the flush in their fair cheeks quivering felt that their beauty was below contemptexcept in the opinion of stupid menif compared with what they were looking at of all the colours cast by nature on the world as lavishly as shakespeare threw his jewels forth of all the tints of sun and heaven in flower sea and rainbow there was not one that did not glance or gleam or lie in ambush and then suddenly flash forth and blush and then fall back again none of them waited to be looked at all were in perpetual play they had been immured for centuries and when the glad light broke upon them forth they danced like meteors and then as all quick with life they began to weave their crossing rays and cast their tints through one another like the hurtling of the aurora and to back their fitful brilliance in amongst them lay and spread a soft delicious milky way of bashful white serenity it is terrible witchcraft cried dazzled mabel no said alice it is the noblest casket ever seen of precious opals and of pearls you shall carry them to my father indeed i will not said the generous mabel you have earned and you shall offer them chapter lxxvi scientific solution beauty having due perception and affection for itself it is natural that young ladies should be much attached to jewels it does not however follow that they know anything about them any more than they always do about other objects of their attachment nevertheless they always want to know the moneyvalue i should say that they are worth a thousand pounds if they are worth a penny said mabel sagely shaking her head and looking wonderfully learned a thousand cried alice ten thousand you mean now put it all back as we found it oh one more glance one more good look before other people see them oh let the light fall sideways mabel in her admiration of them danced all round the astrologers room whisking the dust from the wheel of his lathe and scattering quaint rare tools about while alice calmly smiling at her repacked the case silk wool and parchment and giving her friend the cover to carry led the way towards her fathers room sir roland lorraine was so amazed that for the moment the mind resumed command of the body the needful effort was made and he spake with his tongue once more though feebly and inarticulately father darling that is worth more to me cried alice throwing her arms around him than all the jewels that ever were made from the first year of the world to this oh i could never never live without hearing your dear voice it was long however before sir roland recovered mind and spirit so as to attempt a rendering of the provident sages document the writing was so small that a powerful lens was wanted for it the language moreover was latin and the contractions crabbed to the last degree and crammed as it was with terms of art an interpreter might fairly doubt whether his harder task would be to make out the words or their meaning but omitting some quite unintelligible parts it seemed to be somewhat as follows oh descendant of mine in faroff ages neither be thou carried away by desire of riches neither suppose thine ancestor to have been so carried i bid thee rather to hold thy money in the place of nothing and to be taught that it is a work of royal amplitude and most worthy of the noblest princes to conquer the obstinacy of nature by human skill and fortitude labouring much i have accomplished little seeking many things i have found some it is not just that i should be forgotten or mingled with those of my time and rank who live by violence and do nothing for the benefit of humanity among many other things which i have by patience and learning conquested the one the most likely of all to lead to wealth is of a simple kind to wit as glaucus of chios following up the art of celmis and damnameneus discovered the of iron so have i discovered that of jewelsthe opal and perhaps the ruby as regards the opal i am certain as regards the ruby i have still some difficulties to conquer all who know the opal can with very clear vision perceive that its lustre and versatile radiance flow from innumerable lamins united by fusion in the endless flux of years having discovered how to solve the opal with a caustic liquorhere followed chemical marks which none but a learned chemist could understandand how to recompose it i have spent twelve months in hungary collecting a full medimnus of small opals of the purest quality after many trials and a great waste of material i have accomplished things undreamed by baccius evax or leonardus i have produced the priceless opal cast to mould and of purest water from the size of an avellannut to that of a small castane larger i would not make them knowing the incredulity of mankind who take for false all things more than twice the size of their own experience alas it is allowed to no man great works having been carried through to see what will become of them these gems of inestimable value polished by their own liquescence and coherent as the rainbow demand as far as i yet can judge at least a hundred years of darkness and of cavernous seclusion such as nature and the gods require for all perfect work and when the air is first let in it must be very slowly done otherwise all might fall abroad as though i had never touched them for this with the vigilance of a great philosopher i have provided now farewell whether descended from me or whether if the fates will alien a philosopher who has penetrated and under the yoke led nature is the last of all men to speak proudly or record his own great deeds that he leaves for inferior and less tranquil minds as are those of the poets only do not thou sell these gems for little if thou sell them the smallest of them is larger and finer than that of the senator nonius or that which is called troy burning from the propugnacled flash of its movement be not misled by jewellers rogues they are and imitators and perpetually striving to make gain disgracefully hearken thou not to one word of these but keep these jewels if thou canst if narrow matters counsel sale then go to the king of thy country or great nobles who will not wrong thee and be sure that thou keep them well advised that neither in skill of hand nor in learning should they attempt to vie with agasicles the carian chapter lxxvii her heart is his long ere the writing of the diffident sage had been thus interpreted the casket or rather its contents being intrusted to the wary hands of the counsellor on his return to london had passed the severest test and been pronounced of enormous value the great philosopher had not deigned to say a word about the pearls whether produced or amalgamated by his skill or whether they were heirlooms in his ancient family the jewellers said that they were cingalese and of the rarest quality and for these alone one large house holding a commission from a coalowner offered fifteen and then twenty and finally twentyfive thousand pounds but sir roland had resolved not to part with these but divide them between his daughter and future daughterinlaw if he could raise the required sum without them in this no difficulty was found though opals were not in fashion just then and indeed they are even now undervalued through a stupid superstition six of the smaller gems were sold for and now their owners would not accept double that price for them lady valeria right quickly discarded her terror of the casket and very quietly appropriated the magnificent central gem it was the cover with its spiral coils of metal which had frightened her ladyship the strongestminded ladies are as a general rule the most obstinate in their dread of what has injured them the earl of thanet this ladys father had been a great lover of the honeybee and among his other experiments he had a small metal hive which his daughter upset with results which need not trouble us so much as they troubled the lady and although so much smaller the astrologers case strangely resembled that deadly hive when hilarys sin had been purged and himself at certainly a somewhat heavy figure allowed to draw his sword again he soon regained all his former strength and health and perhaps a little more than his former share of wisdom but he did not march into paris as colonel clumps had once predicted or at least not in that memorable year but in july of the following year he certainly put in an appearance there under the immortal wellington who had been truly pleased to have him under his command but never on his staff again and hilary lorraine at waterloo had shown most clearly through the thick of the smoke that if the duke had erred about his discretion he had made no mistake about his valour and it was of course tenfold more valorous of him to carry on as he did there when he called to mind that he had at home a lovely wife of the name of mabel and a baby of the name of roger because he had taken advantage of the piping time of peacewhen all the crowned heads were in englandto put on his own head that crown of glory richer than mural or civic whereof the wise man speaks the more warmly because he had so many of them in june hilary and mabel were made one under junction of the good rector and nature objecting to this depopulating fusion of her integrals had sternly recouped her arithmetic by appeal to the multiplication table at waterloo hilary worked his right arm much harder than he worked it through the rest of his life because there he lost it when the french cuirassiers made their third grand charge upon the british artillery to change the fortune or meet their fate lorraine with his troop of the dasherhussars now commanded by colonel aylmer was in front of the rest of the regiment the spirit of these men was up they had been a long while held back that day and they could not see any reason why they should not have their turn at it man and horse were of one accord needing no spur neither heeding bridle as straight as hounds in full view they flew and hilary flew in front of them in the crush and crash he got rolled over dismounted and left slashing wildly in a storm of horses an enormous cuirassier made at him with a sword of monstrous length their eyes met and they knew each otherthe robber and the robbed the crafty plotter and the simple one the victor and the victim alcides cried in spanishthou art at thy latest gasp i have no orders now from my precious wifereceive this and no more of thee with rowels deep in the flank of his horse he made a horrible swoop at hilary spent of strength and able only to present a feeble guard hilarys blade spun round and round and his right arm flew off at the elbow and the crash was descending upon his poor head when a stern reply met alcides through the joints of his harness joyce aylmers sword went in and drank his lifeblood his horse dashed on the plain like the felled trunk of a poisontreethat plain where lay so many nobler and so few meaner than himself having run through the whole of the stolen money he had donned the french cuirass and left his wife and infant child to starve when the times of slaughter passed and nature began to be aware again that she has other manure than bloodshed when even the cows could low without fear of telling where their calves were and mares could lick their foals unwept on and hills and valleys began again to listen to the voice of quiet waters drowned no more in the din of the drum and everything in our dear country was most wonderfully dearsomething happened at this period not to be passed over parenthetically it may be saidand deserves no more than parenthesisthat neither of the chapmans had been killed as mendacious fame reported only knocked on the head and legs and stomach and other convenient places steenie wedded their housemaid sally and it was the best thing he could have done to clean up the steps of the family but now there is just time to say that it must have been broad august when the fields were growing white for harvest after the swath of waterloo ere colonel aylmer durst bring forth what he nursed in his heart for alice his words were short and simple though he did not mean to make them so but he found her in old chancton ring where first he had beholden her and so much came across him that he never took his hat off but just whispered underneath it the whisper went under a prettier hat where it long had been expected and if a feather waved at all it only was a white one are you not afraid of me asked alice lorraine with a tremulous glance enough to terrify any one that i am to the last degree i never shall get over it that augurs well she replied with a smilesuch a smile as none else could give but i mean more than that i mean your fear of what the world will say of me of that i am infinitely more afraid it will vex me so to hear for everwhat has he done to deserve such a wife then what he has done is simply this cried alice looking nobly he has saved her life and her brothers he has taught her now to fear herself and her heart is his if he cares for it chapter lxxviii the last word comes from bonny it takes but little time to tell what happened to the rest of them sir roland lorraine had the pleasure of seeing two tribes of grandchildren round him who routed him out of his bookroom and scattered his unwholesome tendencies wholesale if he shocked society in his middle age society had revenge in the end and pursued him like the eumenides the difference was this however that here were truly wellmeaning ones not called so by timorous truckling and another point of distinction might be found in the style of their legs and bodies also they had no stony glare but the brightest of all young eyes that shine like a flower filled with morning dew these little men and women played at hideandseek and made rich echo in the woeburn channel forsooth that fearful stream like other fateful rivers beaten by vulcanian fires of bottleror as some people said who knew not bottler by the power of the long dry frostretired into the bowels of the earth and never means to come forth again but before leaving off it did one good thingit drowned old nanny stilgoe prophet of ill never yet to me spakest thou thing lucksomethis was the sentiment of that river when disappointed of alice old nanny ran out of her door next day with a stick at a boy who cast snowballs and she slipped on some ice and in she went and some people tried to rake her out but she was too perverse for them her prophecies of evil fell like lead on her head and sank her and the parish was fiercely divided whether she ought to have christian burial but rector hales let them talk as they liked and refused to hear reason about it he had made up his own mind what to do which of all things is the foremost so he buried old nanny and paid for it all and set up her tombstone whereon the sculptor with visions of his own date prolonged set down her figure at the passing of time is one of those things that most astonish every one for instance no one would ever believe except with a hand upon either temple that applewood farm is now carried on and all the growing business done by a sturdy and highly enlightened young fellow whose name is struan lovejoy he owes his origin to a heavy cold caught by his father the present highly respected admiral sir charles lovejoy through the freezing of his naval trousers and the coddling which of course ensued charlies heart lay open through all the stages of catarrh and he felt even in the worst fits of sneezing whose initials were done in hair on three handkerchiefs under his pillow in short no sooner did his nose begin to resume its duty in the system and his eyes to cease from running then he took cecil hales by the hand and said that he had something to say to her and he said it well as sailors do and she could not deny that it might mean something if ever they could maintain themselves this is what all young people say some with a little and some with less discretion upon the subject the helm of all the question hangs upon the mans own sternpost there is no time to talk of that charlie married cecil and they had a son called struan struan lovejoy took the turn for gardening and for growing which had failed the lovejoy race in the middle generation gout descends and so does growing with a skip of one step of mankind and you cannot make the wrong generation lay heel on spade or toe in slipper but most of us can make some men feelhowever small our circle isthat there is room for them inside it that we scorn hypocritical love of mean humanity but love the noble specimenswhen we get them that we know how short our time is and attempt to do a little forward for the slowly rolling age in a word that taking things altogether they are pretty nearly as good as could have been hoped for even sixty years ago but it is quite a few years back to wit in when the great leading case upon rights of waylovejoy v shatterlockswas tried for the ninth and final time chief justice sir gregory lovejoy through feelings of delicacy left the bench and would not even allow his wifeour phyllis catherowto be called but majorgeneral sir hilary lorraine marched into the witnessbox and so vividly did he call to mind what had passed and what had been stopped at the white gate and where the key was kept half a century ago that the defendant had no leg to stand upon mabel who heard all his evidence with an alice mabels hand in hers vowed that he made a confusion of keys and was thinking of the gate where she came to meet him and when he had time for more reflection he could not contradict her now what says bonny he sits on his hill he sees his life before him though he does not know that for finding the key he is to have invested already and to accumulate until he entirely settles down in fulness of time he will cast away the unsaleable portion of his rags and wed square polly bottler their hearts are as one they only wait for parental assent and the band or bannwhichever may be the proper wordshouted thrice by the rector defiant of the world to forbid those two they are not ready yet to be joined together but they are polishing their fireirons meanwhile bonny may be seen to sit on one of those wonderful nicks of the hill which seem to be scolloped by nature and padded to tempt her restless mankind to rest for here the curve of the slope is so snug that only pleasant airs find entry with the flowery tales they bring and the grass is of the greenest and the peep into the lowland distance of the most refreshing blue lulled on a bank here bonny sits not quite so fair as the fairyqueen who perhaps is watching him unseen but picturesque enough for the age and provided with a donkey worthy of titanias purest love jack is gazing with deep interest at an image of himself cleverly shaped by his master on the green with snowy outline of chalky flints here are set forth his long tail white nose and ears as long and rich as the emblem of fair ceres he sniffs at his nose and he treads on his toes and not being able to explain away all things he falls to and grazes from his own stomach but what is bonny doing here instead of attending to his rags and bones well he ought to be but he certainly is not attending to the rectors sheep to wit mr hales growing stiff in the saddle betakes himself freely to saddles of mutton and has paid and is paying his three daughters portions after the manner of the patriarchs but leaving the flock to their own devices for which an he were satirical he might quote his master as precedent bonny opens his capacious mouth and the fresh air of the downs rings richly with a simple southdown song when the sheep are on the hill in the early summer day they may wander at their will while i go myself astray chorus sustained by sheep and jack we may wander at our will while you go to sleep or play if the may wind hath an edge rather winterly and cold i shall sit beneath a hedge while they wander oer the wold chorus by the same performers there you sit beneath the hedge singing like a minstrel bold should illnatured people say that i loiter or do ill pick a hole in me they may when they see me through the hill chorus if they catch you at your play whip you merrily they will playful creatures grow not old play is healthy natures pledge tis the dull heart gives the hold for the point of troubles wedge chorus these reflections are as old as the saws of rush and sedge frisky lambkins in the grass mint and pepper if they spy do they weep and cry alas nay but whisk their tails on high chorus weep indeed and cry alas sooner you than we or i look how soon the shadows pass how the sun hath chased the gloom if our life is only grass grass is where the flowers bloom chorus if we mainly live on grass many a flower we consume and so may we leave them singing
