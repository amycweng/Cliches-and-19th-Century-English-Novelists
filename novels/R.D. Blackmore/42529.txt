dariel a romance of surrey chapter i a nightingale if any man came to me and said you are going to tell your tale good sir without knowing how to handle it i should look at him first with some surprise and anger at his interference yet in a very few minutes unless he wanted to argue about it probably he would have my confession and a prayer for his assistance for every one knows how to do a thing much better than the one who does it in spite of all that i will declare in a truthful manner unabashed whatever i know concerning the strange affairs which have befallen me and perhaps if you care to look into them you will admit that even now when the world supposes itself to be in a state of proud civilization there are things to be found near its centre of perfection which are not quite up to the standard of the lord towards the middle of the month of may in a year which i never shall forget i happened to be riding home from guildford in the county of surrey after a long but vain attempt to do a little business for my father for we were not as we used to be people of wealth and large estates and such as the world looks up to but sadly reduced and crippled and hardpushed to make a living and the burden of this task had fallen most heavily upon me because i was the only son at home and my fathers mind was much too large to be cramped with petty troubles so that when he had been deprived of ninetenths of his property and could not procure any tenants for the rest it became my duty to work the best of the land that still remained and make both ends meet if possible to a young man this was no great hardship unless he were spoiled for country life by ambition or sloth or luxury and it seemed to me at first a welcome change to be recalled from oxford and from lincolns inn and set to watch the earth and sky instead of ink and paper and although there were storms and swamps of loss and disaster to cross continually i was always at the point of getting on if only there came just a little turn of luck but that which seemed to baffle mainly my most choice endeavours was that when i had done good work and made good stapleas it seemed to menever a man to whom i showed it at the most reasonable figure would stop to look at it for a moment in a reasonable spirit because whatever i had to offer was by strange coincidence the very thing my fellowcreatures happened not to want just then what had i done this very day but carried into guildford market more than twelve miles from our home samples of as fair and fat and thoroughly solid grain as ever was grown to be ground in england and what had the dealers said to me tut tut what call you that not so bad for an amateur try again sir try again sir harold must grow it cheaper and they made me not a single offer such as i could think of twice while the farmers looked askance and smiled very kindly and respectfully yet as if i had no business there and must soon discover my sad mistake never mind what they think i exclaimed to myself or how they laugh at all i can do wait a bit wait a bit my friends we are not come to the bottom of the basket yet hold up ancient joseph ancient joseph was the only horse now remaining with us who could get along at all without a plough or waggon at his heels or tail like us he had seen better days and like us he did not dwell upon them faithful generous and conscientious he kept up to his own standard still and insisted upon his twelve miles an hour whenever his head was homeward it was in that pleasant direction now and much as i longed for a gentle glide of the soft may breeze around me and a leisurely gaze at the love of the year now telling its tale in the valleys that old fellow sniffing his oats leagues away cared for nothing but a quick stroke towards them much as i wanted to think about the money that i ought to have got but couldnt this horse between my legs was so full of what he meant to be filled with that i was compelled to attend to his mood instead of giving rein to my own lest haply a ditch should be our conclusion without any heed we scoured past the loveliest views in england as people in a train are forced to do till old joes wind became a gale more adverse now than favourable his four legs which had been going like two began to go like a figure of four and he gave me to understand through the flaps of leather that his heart was repentant of having its own way on the ridge of the hills at the four crossroads i allowed him therefore a welcome rest having the worst of the road before us and the shadows growing deeper perhaps i had prided myself too much upon seldom indulging in whims and freaks as my elder brother harold did to his great disadvantage and our own and now at the age of twentyfive i should have known better than to begin but some strange impulse which changed the whole course of my life from that hour seized me as i stopped to breathe my horse opposite that old directionpost to cobham and esher was on the left arm the forward one pointed to a village near our home and that was the road i had always taken but the arm that would have pointed to the right if it had been in its duty was not there now though a double morticehole gave token of its late existence and the lane towards the right of which it should have told us seemed rather desirous of evading notice and certainly had received very little for years from any roadsurveyor narrow and overhung and sinking into sleepy shadows with a fringe of old roots and dead bracken it afforded a pleasant sense of passing into quietude and loneliness time was more plentiful than money with me and why should i hurry to tell my father the old tale of failure so often repeated but none the more welcomeas an old joke isby reason of familiarity i knew the chief outlines of the country pretty well because an old fox had been fond of it whom we never brought to book when the hounds were kept at crogate park how he had beaten us we never knew beyond having fifty opinions about it of which only two were in favour with the wise onesthe first that he sank into the bowels of the earth and the other that he vanished into the clouds of heaven and the place was lonely enough for him to have taken whichever course he chose leaving nothing but negative evidence knowing that if i could cross that valley i should probably strike into a bridlelane which would take me home at leisure i turned my old horse much against his liking into this dark and downhill course away from the main road which according to the wisdom of our forefathers followed the backbone of the ridge soon we began to descend steep places broken with slippery falls of rock while branches of thicket and sapling trees shook hands overhead and shut out the sky my horse who had never been down on his knees and knew perhaps by instinct the result of that attitude in the eyes of men was beginning to tremble exceedingly and in fairness to him and myself as well i jumped off and led him he looked at me gratefully and followed without fear though sometimes sliding with all four feet and throwing back his head for balance and perhaps he observed as soon as i did that no horse had ever tried that descent since the rains of winter washed it when i was ready to think myself a fool and wish both of us well out of it the sweetest and clearest note that ever turned the air into melody and the dull world into poetry came through the arching bowers of spring and made the crisp leaves tremulous then as a bud with its point released breaks into a fountain of flower the silvery overture broke into a myriad petals of sensitive song what a stunning nightingale said i as a matteroffact young briton might with never an inkling of idea that the bird meant anything to me but he seemed to be one of those that love mankind as the genial robinredbreast does or at any rate desire to be thought of kindly and to finish well what is well begun for he flitted before me down the hill and enlivened the gloom with vicissitudes of love listening to this little fellow and trying to catch sight of him i was standing with old joes nose in my handfor he was always friendlywhen the music that should lead my life in the purest strain came through the air it was not the voice of a bird this time but a sound that made my heart beat fast and then held me in rapture of wonder dew of the morning in a mossrose bud crystal drops beading a frond of fern lustre of a fountain in full moonlightnone of these seem to me fit to compare with the limpid beauty of that voice and more than the sweetest sounds can do that indite of things beyond us and fall from a sphere where no man dwells this voice came home to my heart and filled it with a vivid sorrow and a vague delight sturdy as i was and robust and hardy and apt to laugh at all sentimental stuff the force of the time overcame me as if i had never been educated and as soon as i rather felt than knew that i was listening to some simple hymn i became almost as a little child inhaling his first ideas of god the words that fell upon my ears so softly were as unknown as the tune itself voice and verse and air combining into a harmony of heaven ought any man to be called a snob for doing a thing that is below himself on the impulse of the moment and without a halt of thought it is not for me to argue that but i hope that fair ladies will forgive me when i confess that i stepped very gently avoiding every dry twig and stone across the brown hollow that is generally found at the foot of any steep fall of wood by this time the lane was gone to grass and i slipped old joes bit that he might have a graze while i went in quest of my siren on the further brink of the spongy trough a dark frizzle of alder and close brushwood was overhanging a bright swift stream which i recognised as the pebblebourne a copious brook beloved of trout and as yet little harassed by anglers through this dark screen i peered and beheld a vision that amazed me along a fair meadow that bent towards the west and offered a slim tree here and therelike a walkingstick for eveningthe gentle light of days departure came quite horizontally there was as there often is in nature some deep peace of sadness which rebukes mankind for its petty cares and perpetual fuss about itself and yet there was something in front of all this to set the heart of a young man fluttering on the opposite bank and within fair distance for the eyes to make out everything was a niche of dark wall shagged with ivy and still supporting the grey stonework of a ruined chapelwindow between whose jagged mullions flowed the silvery light of the west and fell upon the face of a kneeling maiden the profile as perfect as that of a statue yet with the tender curves of youth more like the softness of a cameo was outlined as in a frame of light against the black curtain of the ivied wall beside the kneeling figure lay a headtire of some strange design removed perhaps when the hymn was followed by the attitude of prayer the beauty and rapture of this devotion made me hold my breath and feel as if i were profaning it get away you low intruder said my better self to me but it is all very well to talk it was out of my power to go away under this spell i stood until that gentle worshipper arose with a bend of her graceful neck and gathered her pale grey robe around her it was not such a dress as english ladies according to the fashion of the moment wear with pumpkin sleeves or with wens upon their shoulders and puckers and gathers and frizzles and scollops in a mangle of angles and zigzags what it was made of is more than i can say i only know that it was beautiful drawn in at the waist with a narrow belt and following rather than trying to lead the harmony of the living form but one thing caught my attention even so and that was the flash of a bright red cross on the delicate curve of the bosom it appeared to me that tears were sparkling under the fringe of large dark eyes as the lonely maiden glanced around while preparing for departure then to my surpriseif anything could surprise me furtherwith a rapid movement she laid bare a gleaming shoulder and set upon it the tip of a long straight finger her face was partly obscured to me by the bend of her arm but i fancied that she smiled and was opening her lips to pronounce some words when suddenly that horse old joe who had been doing his best to lessen the burden of his maintenance gave vent to a snort of approbation not of the fair sight across the waterfor that was hidden by bushes from himbut at the juiciness of his graze my guilty conscience made me start for i fully expected to be found out in a thing i had never done before and i felt ashamed to look again till i knew there was no suspicion then a breath of wind turned up a leaf and who could help glancing under it i saw that the beautiful and mysterious damsel had taken some little alarm at the grunt of the greedy quadruped from the foot of the old chapelwindow she was taking something white like a crucifixthough i could not be certain about that meanwhile she had placed on her head that strange affair which i had seen lying on the ground to me it looked like an octagonal hat with a long veil of gauze descending from it resembling nothing that i had ever seen on a ladys head to the best of my remembrance although in bright fact they wear such strange things and trim them anew so wondrously that no man must be positive whatever it was it looked very sweetas the ladies themselves express itbut i grieved that i could see her face no more she placed that white object very carefully in the folds of her dress beneath the veil which covered her down to the waist and then to my great disappointment she was gone seeming rather to float on the air than to walk with a definite stride as our ladies make their way but the quivering points of some pendulous leafage showed that a bodily form had passed there i was left in a conflict of wonder and doubt and intense desire to know more mingled with some selfreproachthough the worst of that came afterwardsand a hollow feeling in my heart as if i should never fill it with myself again something told me that the proper course and the most manly and businesslike was to jump on my horse and make him climb the hill anew and take the high road and get home at full speed and never say a word about what i had seen nor even think about it if it could be helped but i assure you and i hope again that allowance will be made for me as a young man not much accustomed to the world and hitherto heedless of feminine charms that i found it impossible to do the right thing now instead of a lofty and resolute withdrawal in i went for more of that of which i had taken too much already i stuck old joes bit into the hungry leather of his most voracious mouth and came down on his back with a ponderous swing and girded him with a hard grip of his belly to show me some more of what he had scared away much against his likingfor if ever a horse was totally destitute of romance here he was and no mistakewith a grunt of remonstrance he plodded into the pebbly ford at the bottom of the hill but when we struck into the silence of the meadow what was i the wiser lo the dusk was settling down in the most indifferent manner the sunset flush was fading into a faint and chill neutrality the trees had no shadow and worst of all no sign or even memory of any sweet passage among them only on the left hand some hundred yards away was a black door set in an old grey wall which curved along leisurely as far as i could see and offered no other entrance i am not the sort of fellow to put up with this i exclaimed to myself impatiently and yet there was no way to help it just now and if it came to reason what business had i there still the whole of this land had been ours not more than a century ago and a true briton feels that he has his rights however long he may have lost them but it is not in his nature to lose sight of reason though i am not quite so certain how that was with me as i wandered home slowly along forgotten ways and knew that my life was changed thenceforth chapter ii the family it is said and seems worthy of beliefthough denied quite lately by a great frenchmanthat there are in the world no fairer damsels than those of our own dear island graceful elegant straight and goodly gentlewhich is the first point of allyet lively and able to take their own part eager moreover to please and clever to obtain what they want by doing so they have no cause to envy their brothers or feel ungrateful to providence for making them fair if any of them do that sometimes when led astray every now and then by feminine agitators for the most part they will come back to themselves if left without contradiction my sister grace for instance was one of the best and kindesthearted english girls that ever blushed far in front of me i confess in quickness of apprehension and perception of character and readiness of answer and i might almost say in commonsense though i never quite conceded that because i had so much need of it nevertheless she looked up to me as her elder by five years and a man therefore it was my custom always to listen with much toleration to her and often adopt her views in practice after shaking my head for the time at them for she always finished her orations with well brother george you are sure to know the best now if we had none but grace to deal with things would have been very different not that we could have retrieved our fortunesof that there was no possibility still we might have carried on in our humble way and kept my father sir harold cranleigh comfortable in his old age and even happy among his books and collection of minerals and seals and coins my mother also might have had all she could wish for she was in truth a very quiet soul bound up in her children and fond of little else unless it were county histories and the fulfilment of prophecy sometimes she was grieved that we occupied now the old cottage in a corner of the park which had once been the house of our agent also at having but a ponycart instead of what she was accustomed to but the grief was not on her own account and simply for our sake as we knew well and we kept on telling her that we liked it better so for after all if one comes to think those very wealthy folk have no true enjoyment and no keen relish for anything good in the first place they can never feel the satisfaction of having earned by honest work their pleasure it comes to them but as an everyday matter wearisome vapid insipid and dull many of them have a noble spirit and that makes it all the worse for them they see and they feel the misery of the poverty around them but all they can do is of no avail they are cheated and wronged in their best endeavours if they show discernment they are called niggards if they are profuse it is ostentation and if they are large enough not to be soured by any of these expressions they begin to feel more and more as time goes on that the money should stop in the family remembering this we should have regarded with delicate compassion that very wealthy individual mr jackson stoneman this eminent stockbroker claimed not only our sympathy for his vast riches but also some goodwill by the relief afforded us in a cumbrous difficulty my father had long been casting about as matters went from bad to worse and farm after farm was thrown up by insolvent tenants for some one to occupy our old house crogate hall and the park as well for he could not bear to let them separately and have the old place cut into patches but there was no one left among the old families of the county still possessing cash enough to add this to the homes already on their hands there is much fine feeling and warmth of heart toward one another among those who have never had much to do from one generation to another except to encourage the good people who love order by punishing those of an opposite turn and to keep up the line which has always been drawn between landed estate and commerce as well as to be heartily kind to the pooreven though they do encroach a little on preservesand above all to be hospitable not to one another only but to people of business who know their position our family one of the oldest in surrey and of saxon lineage requiring no mixed norman blood of outsea cutthroats to better it had always kept its proper place and been beloved for its justice generosity and modesty our tenants had never made any pretension to own the lands they held of us any more than a man to whom i had lent a thousand pounds at interestsupposing that i owned such a sumwould set up a claim to my capital we were very kind to them as long as they could pay and throughout their long struggle with the foreign deluge we made every effort to keep them afloat reducing their rent to the vanishing point and plunging with them into poverty but what can be done when the best land in england will not pay for working and is burdened as heavily as ever cut your coat according to your cloth is a very fine old precept and we went on doing so as heaven only knows but when there is no cloth left at all and the climate is not good enough to supply figleaves wherewithal shall a man be clothed and for a woman how much worsethough they sometimes exaggerate their trials my sister grace was as lovely a maiden as ever was born of saxon race which at its best is the fairest of all to my mind she was far more beautiful than her sister elfrida the eldest of us now the wife of lord fitzragon who had children of her own and very seldom came to see us being taken up with her own world and one of the things that grieved me most was to see my favourite sister dressed in some common blue serge with a brown leather belt round her waist and thick shoes on her delicate feet like a boy elected by twickenham parish to the bluecoat school for a boy it is all very well and may lead to the highest honours of the realm but with a maiden of gentle breed it is not so encouraging notwithstanding this i say that you might put a lady of any rank you please and of any wealth to back it up by the side of my sister grace and i know to which of them your eyes would turn the lord may see fit for some good purpose to set one of his children high and to pluck down another but he never undoes what he did at the first and his goodness remains in the trouble many girls lowered from their proper line of life and obliged to do things that seemed hard for them would have turned sour and tossed their heads or at the very least would have taken unkindly to what they were forced to do and if anybody blamed them for it the chances are that it would be some one who would have done the very same but to see our grace now you would have thought that she had been born a small yeomans daughter or apprenticed quite young to a dairyman what i mean isunless you looked at her twice and to fail of doing that would be quite sufficient proof that you care not for the most interesting thing in all human natureexcept perhaps a loving motherto wit a gentle truthful lively sweet and affectionate young maid it is not in a man to be so good and luckily it is not expected of him certainly i did speak strongly sometimes and find fault with the luck and the world and the law and above all with the government which every englishman has a right to do at such times my sister would scarcely say a wordwhich alone is enough to prove her selfcommandbut draw down her golden hair between her fingers and look at me softly from her deep blue eyes and clearly be trying to think as i thought when any one whose opinion is at all worth having does that sort of thing almost any man is pleased with the silence he has created and his temper improves as he approves of himself and so i always felt with grace that she might be right because i was right and it helped me more than any one might think to know that my words made a stronger impression on another mind than they left upon my own happy beyond all chance of fortune would be the man who could win such a heart and be looked at with even deeper love than a sister has for a brother and feel himself lifted more nigh to heaven than he had any power or perhaps even any desire of his own to go but no man so gifted had appeared as yet neither did we want him to turn up for the very good reason that grace cranleigh was the heart and soul of our little household just as i george was the hand and head for all practical purposes though much against my liking because my elder brother harold heir to the title and the dwindled heritage was the proper person to come forward and take the lead of our forlorn hope and stand up bravely in the gap and encourage the elders when thus stricken down and impoverished but as i have hinted before we had a trouble almost as bad as mortgages loss of invested money and even the ruinous price of corn and that was a genius in the family without any cash to support him truly in almost every family the seeds of genius may be found but most of them are nipped in early days or start in some harmless direction but harolds was not to be cured like this for it started in every direction with a force that left nothing to be desired except the completion of something there was no conceit in this brother of mine neither any defect of energy no matter what he took up not only was he full of it for the time but perfectly certain that nothing of equal grandeur had dawned upon the human race till now time would fail me to begin the list of his manifold inventions for every one was greater than the one before it and in justice to him i should have to go through all while there were difficulties in the way his perseverance was boundless but the moment he had vanquished them and proved that there was little more to do as sure as eggs are eggs he would stop short exclaim oh any fool can do that and turn his great powers to something even greater we all admired him as no one could help doing for he was a wonderfully taking fellow gentle handsome generous and upright a lover of shakespeare a very fine scholar as tender to animals as if he knew their thoughts and in every way a gentleman though not fond of society but the worst of it was that we had to pay for him and this was uncommonly hard to do under our present circumstances for inventors must have the very best material as well as the finest tools for their work and some one of skill to hold things in their place and to bear the whole blame when the job miscarries we were grieved when instead of the untold gold which was to have set us staggering a basketful of bills was all that came with headings that sent us to the cyclopaedia and footings that spelled the workhouse what is all this about letting the old house harold had asked me without indignation but still with some sadness at our want of faith the very last time i had seen him you have so very little foresight george you forget altogether how easy it is to let a man in but to get him out again theres the rub and how often the landlord is forced to take the roof off the rub has been to get him in this time i answered in my dry submissive way for i never tried to reason with such a clever fellow the doors are scarcely large enough for a man of such substance and as for the roof it was taking itself off after three years without any repairs and no one to ask where the leaks were i think it is a wonderful piece of luck that mr jackson stoneman a man of extraordinary wealth has taken such a fancy to the poor old place it was grace who showed him round for there was no one else to do it and she says that although he may not be quite accustomed oh i dont wish to hear any more about him i detest the idea of letting our old house and the park and the stables i suppose he wants them all and just when i am at the very point of securing a patent which must restore us to our proper position in the county for the model is as good as finished no lease no lease my dear george if you let him in have a binding agreement to get him out at any time with three months notice and when you speak of roofing have you quite forgotten that i have discovered a material which must supersede all our barbarous plans for keeping the sun and the rain out oh yes i remember you mean to let them in i replied without any attempt at sarcasm but having a vague recollection of something undoubtedly i do to a certain extent and then to utilise them every great idea must be in accordance with nature instead of repelling her now the sun and the rainbut just give me that sheet of paper and in two minutes you will see it all it is the most simple and beautiful idea all i fear is that some one else may hit upon it but george i can trust you because you are so slow with pencil and compass he was sure to be happy for an hour or more and come beaming to dinner so i left him and went to tell my father that his eldest son whose consent he required had given it to that most necessary step the letting of crogate hall and park to some eligible tenant not only was a very great burden removedfor we could not bear to see the old place lapse into ruinbut also a welcome addition was made to our very scanty income for the great stockbroker paid a handsome rent without any demur and began for his own sake to put everything into good order once more the windows shone with light instead of being grimed with dust and fog and the park was mown and the deer replaced and the broad expanse of lawn was gay with cricket colours and the pretty ways of women but we in our corner kept ourselves at a distance from such enjoyment not through any false pride or jealousy of a condition which had once been ours but simply because as my father said and my mother agreed with him warmly it had never been the habit of our family to receive entertainment which it could not return our homemade bread was for relish and for nurture worth fifty of their snowy vienna stuff and a pint of the ale which i brewed myself was better than a dozen of their dry champagne or a vintage of their chateau this and that but they would never think so and if englishmen choose to run down their own blessings as they do their merits let the fashion prevail while the few who can judge for themselves hold fast their convictions chapter iii tom erricker mr jackson stoneman wasso far as i could make him out without having had six words with hima very clever cityman yet keeping two sides to his life as he could well afford to do at an early age he had come into the chief control of a longestablished firm one of those that venture little but keep on rolling from age to age the ball of accumulating gold this globe of all human delight was not at all likely to slip between such legs as his though the wicked metal will do that sometimes and roll away down the great hill of despair he attended very strictly to the main chance of all humanity the object for which we were born and die that of course ruled his existence but the people who met him outside the covert or rode with him when the scent was hot declared that he was a most excellent fellow ready at an answer intelligent of hounds skilful of hand and full of pluck neither showing off nor shirking work and as courteous to a farmer as to the lordlieutenant this was high praise for a man of his position and we found before long that every one confirmed it he took a large farm off our hands which had long been begging anybody to take it and though his solicitor was keen enough to grind down the rent to the lowest figure and insist upon many new conditions we could not blame his principal for that and were well aware that landlords nowadays must be grateful to any who will patronise them in fact we had no other grievance against him except that he was rich and we were poor and i am sure that we were not so narrowminded as to feel any grudge on that account my mother especiallyas behoved one of the most charitable of womenfound many good excuses for a practice of his which some might have taken as a proof of want of taste our cottage was beside the direct road from the hall to the nearest railway station for no line had cut up our neighbourhood as yet every morning at least except on saturday and sunday when we were sitting down to breakfast a rattle of wheels and clank of silver harness would explain itself into mr jackson stoneman sitting boltupright with a cigar in his mouth and flourishing a long tandemwhip while a couple of glittering chestnuts whirled him along the smooth road and a groom in white buckskins and topboots accordingly sat behind and folded his arms in contempt of the world grace like a child though she was dignity itself when any stranger looked at her used to run to the window and exclaim oh what loves of horses how everything shines and how well he drives who couldnt drive a team of circus horses was the first thing i said but she took no notice and the next morning when the thing came jingling by and she stopped my sugar to stare at itperhaps you long to be upon that spare cushion i remarked for what man can put up with his sisters nonsense and after that she never knew when the brilliant tandem passed which made me feel a little ashamed of myself however i will not blame the great stockbrokerstocksandstones was the name i gave him without meaning harm but the nickname spread and gave him some trifling annoyance i fearwhat right has any man to blame another for a little bit of thoughtlessness redressed at first perception somebody told stoneman or perhaps he found it out for nothing escaped him that i was displeased at his flashing by like that not on my own account as scarcely need be said and the next week he took another road to the station half a mile longer and much worse for his horses and so we lost sight of his handsome turnout to which we were getting accustomed and began to set our timepiece by it all these things are small but what is truly great unless it be concerned with love or valour freedom piety or selfdenial and desire to benefit the world at large and yet as a rule we care most about those who dwell little upon such big matters but carry on pleasantly and suit us and amuse us and seem to be rather below than above us in mind and ambition and standard of life tom erricker knows that he is of that class and i am welcome to say what i like of him without any danger to our friendship and if i describe him exactly as he is he will take the better part as a compliment and tell me that the rest is of my imagination as he came to and fro from his chambers in the temple my friend tom was a very bright young fellow indolent yet restless perpetually in love though his loves were of brief continuity light of heart impulsive very eager to oblige and gifted with a very high opinion of himself and a profound scorn of everything that he could not understand he was generous bold and adventurous a keen judge of character according to his own idea yet a thorough heroworshipper very fond of addressing himself in the mirror and trying to give an impartial account of his own appearance and qualities well tom my boy i heard him say one day for he was confidential to others as well as to himself about himself you are not looking quite the thing this morning a few cigars less tom would suit you better and little crowsfeet already coming what business have they there at fiveandtwenty it cant be reading too hard or you would have got through last time never mind tom you are not a badlooking fellow though you mustnt suppose you are handsome there is not enough of you thats the great faultnot enough of you to look dignified in all this he was perfectly correct though he might have supposed himself handsome without any very great partiality for his eyes were of a rich and lively brown such as many a maiden might have envied and his features quite regular enough and short and full of genial vivacity he was right enough also in the observation that there was not enough of him to enforce the impression which such wisdom as his should create for although not by any means a dwarf he was of less than average stature while exceedingly active and very well built but he never said a truer thing in the purest of all selfcommune than that his crowsfeet if any there were could not have owed their origin to excess of mental labour such is the sort of man one likes because he can never put one right when a plague of accuracy comes on now what was my inducement who shall say and the reasons come too late to make much difference when a man has done a very foolish thing it may have been partly because i had never kept any secret back from tom after my long time at school and college with him and i did not like to do so now and it may have been also that i felt uneasy about my own behaviour and longed for some encouragement be that as it will when tom erricker came down as he never failed to do at least once every month to spend saturday and sunday with us no sooner had i got him in my little den at the back of our cottage where the harness was kept than i bundled old croaker our only stableman away to his dinner and with proper introductions poured forth to my friend the whole narrative of that strange affair which i had witnessed as above but spoken of as yet to no one my friends interjections and frequent questions need not be set down for he was of the many who can never hear a story without interruption but when i had assured him for the fiftieth time that there was nothing more to tell his face which had been a fine study of amazement became equally full of oracular wisdom leave it to me he said leave it to me george i will soon get to the bottom of it i never speak rashly you know what i am there is something very deep behind all this you who live so near and are only acquainted with country ways must not move in the matter i shall find the key to it you can do nothing i get about among people so much and i know nearly all that goes on in soho you have never done a wiser thing than to keep this dark and consult me about it and a wonderfully lovely girl you say dark let it be if you please i answered though i had never even thought about that before for i do detest all mystery erricker i told you this in confidence it looks as if i was wrong in doing even that when you begin talking in that sort of way is it likely that i would let you take it up if i cannot myself as a gentleman pry into a thing i was not meant to see do you suppose i would let a young fellowtom was my junior by about three monthsa young fellow like you meddle with it now dont be in a huff george he spoke with a smile as if i were making a fuss about nothing i have far more important things than this to think of it was only for your sake that i said a word but i always try to be straightforward why did i go down in the last exam they asked me to describe a contingent remainder and i said it was a remainder that was contingent could anything be more correct than that and yet the infernal old q c said that i must pursue my studies and now if i dont get through next time the glorious tinman will cut short my allowance but thank god i have got a maiden aunt the glorious tinman was toms worthy father the head of a great plating firm at sheffield being perpetually involved in lawsuits concerning trademarks and patents and finding silver and gold enough for a months heavy plating sink into the long robe this gentleman had said to his wife why not keep it in the family and she had replied oh how clever our tom is none of those councillors understand the trade therefore was tom at the temple now when my friend once began upon his own affairs and the ignorance of his examiners he was ready to go on for ever and so i cut him short with the question which had chiefly induced me to unburden my mind to him the point is this my dear boy ought i to feel ashamed do you feel ashamed of me for acting the spy upon a young lady who had no idea i was looking at her speak plainly i wont be offended if i ever get through i am sure to be a judge tom erricker replied with a glance of deprecation at his rather loud suit of redandwhite plaid dittoes my aunt gertrude has said so fifty times and i feel the making of it in me though it takes a long time in development and i sum up the merits thus george cranleigh you had no right to begin but when you had begun i am blowed if i can see how you could help going on and i should like to go on a lot further with it my mind which was larger then than now for nothing loses more by wear and tear was relieved much more than it would be now by even some valid pronouncement tom erricker you are a brick i said and i dont mind showing you the place there is plenty of time before dinner yet only you must give me your word of honournot a syllable about it to any one hands up thats what we say in our corpsfor he was a member of the devils own and a very zealous one for such a lazy fellowbut i could not walk so far without a gun this difficulty did not last long for i ran to the door and asked my sister to lend her pony amabel to my friend tom for an hour or two grace was the most obliging girl that was ever too good to be married and although she felt some kind disdain as it seemed to me sometimes for tom her pony was heartily at his service if he would promise not to whip her tom came out of our little hole when this stipulation reached his ears and he put on his hat for the pleasure and glory of taking it off again to my sister among his many tendernesses the sweetest and biggest of all perhaps was one with our grace at the end of it but he knew as we know such things by instinct that she never would come in to share it and though he fetched many a sigh they were shallow because hope had never been beneath them off we set in the summer afternoon for the month was come to june already with everything going on as if we were nothing because i have not said much about itas behoves an average young englishmanif anybody reads this he may think that nothing to dwell upon had come home to me by reason of what i had seen that day when the millers made light of my samples but this i can declare and would have done so long ago except for some sense that it was my affair alone the whole world had been quite a different thing to me ever since i set eyes uponwell there is but one to any man worth anything and does he ever get her tom erricker was the last fellow in the world to whom one could offer any fine gush of feeling because he was sadly sentimental sometimes when his veins of thought were varicose and when something nasty had happened to himself but when his spirits were up you would think there had never been a tear shed in the world except by some brat who knew not how to cut his teeth he was now in great exaltation at having fetched me as he thought to his level for i had always regarded his light flirtations with a pleasant turn of humour and he could not see the difference between himself and me so i rode old joseph who was a good tall horse and he on little amabel looked up at me with no more reverence than sancho panza showed to the immortal knight who ever failed to elevate him give me an open country not your slash and scratchpins there was nothing tom loved more than talking as if he had followed hounds from his infancy instead of growing up under a dishcover but romancing on such subjects would not go down with me surely you might have brought us by a better road than this george i have had my bad times i dont mind them in a burst but im blessed if i like being scratched to pieces with nothing whatever to show for it to talk about you mean tom well here we get out into as pretty a bit of firland as can be found even in surrey and that may challenge all england to equal it but i never go in for the picturesque to be sure not the ladies do it ever so much better to own the land or at any rate the shooting is the chief thing for us to care about and the shooting is worth twice as much as the crops in the present condition of the market never mind george i wont talk about that for i know it is a very sore subject do you mean to say that all this belonged to you not more than fifty years ago out of the fryingpan into the fire as regards the subject i answered with a smile for i knew that he never meant to vex me but i am sorry that we cannot give you leave even to poke about here with your gun and pot blackbirds and magpies there go two magpies you dont often get so near them two for a weddingdont they say a good omen for you george but where the deuce does your nymph hang out aha good hit of mine a nymph means a bride doesnt she in greek shut up i said for this talk was very paltry and perhaps tom errickers appearance was not quite up to the mark of a romantic moment my chief desire was to gaze across the valley down the further side of which about a mile away i could trace pretty clearly by its fringe of bushes the windings of the brook which i had crossed that day on my return from guildford it seemed to be ages ago whereas it was only four weeks but i had thought about it enough to make a very broad space of time and here was tom chaffing and eager to make fun with his red plaid trousers forced up to his knees by his jerking about in the saddle and his loftiest air of acquaintance with the world and his largest smiles of superiority to women for the moment i longed to deposit him in an anthill well what can i see or what am i to look for he spoke as if he had paid me for a view and i was bound to make it worth the money whereas though i did ask his opinion at a distance it was the last thing i should think of now and in plain truth what business had he here at all and spying about through a shilling eyeglass but it was not for me to take things as he did let him long to enter into them all right i said we will come another day this may or it may not be the place look at your poor legs they are fat enough but what a sight for a lady what a fool you were not to take my straps bless the fellow well you are hard hit or you would not carry on in this style tom turned his eyeglass upon me in a manner which might have provoked me if i had been capable of thinking twice about him now in a blue study george everything looks blue even the mist in the valley has she got blue eyes ah there is nothing like them blue eyes have no depth what do you know about eyes i spoke with some warmth as was natural and then just to show him how calmly i took his childish and shallow observation i proceeded as if he had never spoken you see that long mass of black ivy to the right cutting a sort of jag or perhaps it is a great curve out of the flat steep line of the meadow yes to be sure i do nothing could be plainer a jag which is a curve at the same time and a flat meadow which is also steep never mind the meadow you are not so stupid that you cant see the wall and the ivy on it now tom erricker what do you suppose that to be how can i tell about two miles away let us go on and make it out old chap not another step i am not at all sure that i ought to have brought you so far as this however you can hold your tongue i know and you are upon your honour about all this well that is the wall of an old monastery more than five hundred years old i believe and connected with that ancient chapel on the hills naturally it is all in ruins now and there has been an attempt to set a mill up in its place the best thing to be done with it tom replied for his nature was not reverent but a mill should have paid if it had any water free trade has not had time to destroy the pounders yet although it has killed the producers but i dont want to hear about monks and mills the lovely nuns are more to my taste what nuns could there be in a monastery tom you are even more abroad than usual but though i have not been near the place since the time i told you of and we have nothing to do with that valley now i have put a few quiet questions here and there and i find that the old place has been sold to a foreign gentleman whose name our fine fellows cannot pronounce oho that becomes very interesting hes papa of the beautiful nymph no doubt but you never mean to say that you left off there certainly i do how could i go prying what englishman would ever think of meddling with his neighbours and a foreigner too who has come here for quiet bother replied tom if they have lovely daughters everybody has a right to find out all about them ill bet you a hat it is some wicked old conspirator a nihilist perhaps or at least an anarchist taking advantage of our stupid hospitality to hatch some fiendish plot and blow up some foreign monarch with whom we pretend to be in strict friendship why only a few months ago no more of that i hoped to have found a little commonsense in you as if it were possible that thatthat perfect angel cried tom you cant get beyond that and i am blessed if i ever could have believed that a sensible slowgoing bloke like you george i took hold of his bridle and turned amabel homeward and gave her such a sharp little flick behind that my friend had as much as he could do to keep in the saddle for the best part of the way back to our cottage for we never grudged oats to our horses chapter iv mr stoneman no man who has to contend with the world and support those he loves against it cares twopence about being taken for a fool by the people he has to contend with their opinion to this effect frequently is of some service to him and very seldom hurts him unless he wants to get into their employment or to borrow money from them and in the latter point it even helps him when he has good security to give there is a certain worm whose name i know not being all abroad in natural history whose habit it is to come out of the ground and give himself an airing late at night and then if you moisten him from above in september or october so grateful is heor if you deny him that lofty feeling so sensitivethat he glitters like any glowworm with no less amplitude perhaps a man who has deep emotions such as shy ambition or literary yearnings or passionate humanity or true love of a woman sometimes lets himself out at night when small things are lost to the eyes and the larger objects begin to assert themselves for after all what are the toys of the day for which we sweat and fight and crawl and rack our poor brains till they cry for the revolvereven if we get such gauds what are they to make up for the gentle delight we have lost of the days when we loved all the world and the moments when some one tried to do the like to us now nothing of this kind comes in here for verily i had been cheated too often to rush into the embrace of the universe but for the life of me i cannot tell how to explain the behaviour of a man keener by a thousandfold and harder than in my worst moments i could long to be except by such principles or if they are not that such want of principle such backsliding such loosening of texture and relapse into nature as we feel even in ourselves sometimes and are more ashamed of them in voice than heart however let every one judge for himself it must have been close upon st swithins day for people were watching the weather as they do to keep up the fine old legend when after a long turn among the hay which was very late that year i sat in my little den after dark considering my pipe or perhaps allowing it to consider for me because i was tired with a hard days work and fit for nothing but putting my legs up while we were so busy with the only thing worth growing now in england because it grows itself the wisest plan was to dine or at least to feed among it and be content and to feed upon it is what the true briton must come to whenever a great war arises the man who has shut his eyes must also shut his mouth as the proverb hath it while i was nodding at every puff and full of the sleepy scent of hay the sound of a step and the darkening of my open doorway aroused me come in bob i said anything the matter for some of our ricks had been carried rather green and we were still obliged to watch them excuse me for taking you thus by surprise if you can spare me a few minutes mr cranleigh you will do a great favour it is jackson stoneman having seen this rich gentleman chiefly at a distance and not cared much to look at him i wondered at his coming in upon me thus and was rather inclined to resent it but the thought of my father and mother and of the great help that his tenancy was to them compelled me to drop such little points and receive him with all civility my snuggery was but a very little place forming a part of the harnessroom and resigned whenever the door was shut to a very modest share of daylight coming through leaded diamonds which were certainly not brilliants so i lit my candles still having a pair and offered him my one armchair an ancient windsor with a cushion in the bottom more cosy than most of the easychairs made now to be gazed at rather than sat upon he thanked me but took his seat upon an oaken bench and looked at me steadily as if to search my humour being of an equable and by no means rapid temper i returned his gaze with interest and left him to begin first of all i must have this settledhis voice was very clear and rather pleasant though he showed some signs of nervousness it must be understood that whether i am right or wrong in coming to you like this you will not be annoyed and turn against me very well i said for the promise was a light one what harm could i do to a man of his wealth and if a man offends me i let him alone until it is cowardice to do so you attach much importance i think mr cranleigh to questions of birth and position in the county and ancient family and so on i am not at all aware that i do so the fact is that i am too busy now to dwell much upon such things and their period seems to be over i knew that i was talking stuff and that bitterness made me do it one glance from his swift eyes showed me that he thought none the more of me for taking such a tone although for the moment it was genuine if you make little of such matters i do not said stoneman neither will any one of commonsense for many generations yet to come at least if those who are born to such advantage have the wisdom not to overdo it but i want to put a few plain questions to you and from what i have heard and seen of you i am sure that you will answer them plainly when you know that they are not impertinent and i give you my word that they are not that anything you please to the best of my knowledge of anything a stranger has a right to know i am not a stranger altogether though i have no privilege of friendship when i tell you what i have come about you may think that i should have gone to your father first but i thought it better to give you the chance of saving him from annoyance in almost every way you act as the manager now for the family am i right in believing that yes as regards all local business my brother harold would be the proper man but he is seldom here and he is not fond of businessbusiness of a small kind i mean of course my visitor smiled as if he doubted that ever there could be any but small business here and remembering what we must have been once i regarded him rather sternly he was tall and strongly built and straight and plainly dressed as a man should be leaving beauty to the beautiful not that he was an unsightly fellow but very goodlooking in a certain way his forehead was large and square and gave the idea of strength and steadfastness and his eyes perhaps too deeply set but full of vigour and decision his complexion was dark for an englishmans and his closecropped hair as black as jet and so was his short moustache the only growth allowed upon his face a good clear countenance upon the whole without any sign of weakness in it neither of more hardness than a man of the world requires to hold his own and enlarge it he saw that i was taking stock of himas his own phrase might have been perhapsand he waited the result with confidence then he put me to some little confusion well mr cranleigh i hope that some of your prejudices are not confirmed i know that my position here is not very likely to produce goodwill especially with young men of high spirit but i will not go into that question now beyond asking you this as a favour have i done anything since i occupied the hall that a stranger should not have done amongamong the real owners not that i know of i may say more than that i may say that you have shown us in every way very kind consideration thank you i have tried to do so in everything round here but now as to taking the hounds i have given no promise until i knew your opinion would it annoy sir harold or any of your family not in the least especially after you have been so kind as to ask us they have long left our hands as you know my grandfather kept them on long after he could afford it but my father never cared for them and gave it up as soon as possible as for my brother he would have nothing to do with them if he were made of money and my liking matters of course neither way that seems hard when you do all the work you mean i suppose that you would like to keep them under different circumstances if i were head of the family and could afford it handsomely as it is i would not even if i could afford it i should seem to be putting myself too forward exactly so and shall not i appear to be putting myself too forward if i bring them back to the old place just because i can afford it your candid opinion about that then i think not no one could take it amiss but ourselves and we are not so small as that not even the ladies sometimes ladies do not see things quite as we do they might take it into their headsi mean they might think not unreasonably that i was of the upstart order there is very little fear of that i said in our family the ladies are never difficult to deal with they have always been consulted and therefore they are shy about forming their opinions it is not as if they had no weight as among the less solid norman race they know that what they say is something and that makes them like to hear our opinions first that state of things is most interesting as well as rather unusual mr stoneman spoke with a smile of calm inquiry entirely free from irony and evidently wished me to go on but i did not see how it concerned a stranger so i left him to his own affairs he seems a very decent sort of fellow but if he has come to pump me thought i he will find that the water has gone from the sucker and he saw that he could not pursue that subject i have lately received a requisition or whatever is the proper name for it from several of the people about here whose acquaintance i made last season that i should take over the old crogate hounds as lord wiedeland has resigned them it was signed by yourself and your brother harold that made me think more about it it seems rather absurd for a busy man like me who could never be out more than twice aweek and very seldom as much as that and i am not such a fool as to care two raps about random popularity but i want to do what i ought to do and i will whenever i know it then i think that you ought to do this i answered seeing that he was in earnest you ride very well you enjoy it thoroughly and you know quite enough about it to keep things in good order there is not a man in the neighbourhood who dares take any liberties with you joe stevens of course will come over with the pack he is a host in himself the kennels are as good as they ever were and perhaps the hounds will recognise their duty to their ancestors who lived so happily in the old place ah there you touch me up although i am sure that you never meant it and that brings me to my second point if i undertake this affair upon the distinct conditions which i shall make will you join me and be in effect the real master although my name is used you are here always i am generally away everybody knows and values you i am a mere interloper if you would only help me thus everything would go beautifully not being very quick of thought which is upon the whole a benefit while on the other hand i am uncommonly fond of hunting i was not far from saying yes when luckily my pipe went out with that i arose to get another and as i stood by the mantelpiece a clearer waft of mind came to me and showed me the many objections your offer is wonderfully kind and tempting and shows more confidence in me than i have earned i spoke with some emotion because i felt that last point strongly having shown no friendship towards this man but i cannot accept it mr stoneman i will do all i can to make things easy and to help you to the utmost of my power but my first duty is to my father and mother and i could not do this without neglecting that you are right i was wrong in proposing it my stable of course would have been at your service but the inroads upon your time and the many derangementswell never mind so long as you are not angry with me for proposing it but if you will come out with us now and then certainly i will upon our old joseph he ran away with me not very long ago some of your young cracks would find him not so very far behind for he is wonderfully knowing good for you i know how that tells up though i am not a parson jack who laid l that he would be in at the death upon his old donkey and won it very well all that is settlednot exactly as i should wish but as much as we ever get things but the next thing i shall never get and it is the only thing in life i care for i should have thought that a man like you resolute very clearheaded and wealthy might make sure of everything that in reason he required with life and health i mean of course and the will of the lord not against him we never know what is the will of the lord until we console ourselves with it not that i am a scoffer or even a sceptic mr cranleigh and in some of the greatest moments of my lifebut i will not bother you with them only i may say that i look upon this as the very greatest of them all i dont want to make a fool of myselfbutperhaps the lord has done it for me he tried to make a little smile of this and looked as if he wanted me to help him out but i could only stare and wonder whether any man ever born is at all times right in his head for if anybody could be expected to know what he is about at all times i should have thought that man would be jackson stoneman of the stock exchange so i waited as my manner is for him to make good sense of this then he got up from his bench and set his face which had been quivering as firm as the funds and looked down at mefor i was in my windsor chair againand his eyes seemed to flash defiance at me although his voice was tender george cranleigh you may think what you like i care not a rap what anybody thinks i love your sister grace as no man ever loved a woman or ever will my amazement was so great and sudden that i looked at him without a word for a moment i was beaten out of time by this strong mans intensity i know all the stuff that you will say he went on with scanty politeness that i have not seen her more than halfadozen times that i have no right to lift my eyes to her that even a mint of money can never make up for the want of birth that i am nothing but an upstart that i may be a rogue for all you know that she is a million times too good and pure and beautiful for such a fellow go on go on i would rather have it over but i have not begun yet and you give me no time i answered very steadily having now recovered myself and objecting to have my arguments forestalled you seem to forget yourself mr stoneman there is no necessity for excitement that a man of the world like you that is the very point thats what makes my chance so bad there is nothing of romance or sweet sentiment about me i dont know anything about hearts and darts i have no poetical ideas i could not fling myself off a rockif there was one i dont know how to couch a lance i am pretty sure though i have never tried that i couldnt do a sonnet at any price and if i did and it leaked out it would be the ruin of my business you can buy a sweet sonnet for five shillings as good as they make them nowadays but a little commonsense is better than a thousand sonnets and of that when you are at all yourself you must have a very large supply now sit down and let us talk this out at first it came to me as a very great surprise it was about the last thing that i could have expected but i think you were wise in coming first to me when i look back upon this interview it often astonishes me that i should have been able so quietly to take the upper hand with a man not only my elder and of tenfold experience in the world but also before me in natural gifts and everything that one could think of except bodily strength and the accident of birth nevertheless i did at once after that weak confession of his take a decided lead upon him why because he was plunged into lovea quicksand out of which no man attempts to pull another being well aware what he would get for his pains and rather inclined to make sport of him whenever it may be done without harm to oneself well i said after waiting to see whether he would make another start but even his vigour was unequal to that and he felt that he had trespassed over the british bounds of selfcontrolwell let us look at this affair like men and as if there were no woman in it he lifted his hand by way of protest as if i were begging the question but seeing how judicious my view was and desiring perhaps to conciliate me he pulled out a large cigar and did his best to light it you may take it i proceeded with much magnanimity and some contempt little presaging my own condition in less than a month from that very day that i look at these subjects sensibly i have every reason so far to like you because you have behaved very well to us you behaved very handsomely and justly long beforewell long before you could possibly have taken this strange turn what a way to put it but let everything be straight i should never have taken the hall unlessi mean if anybody else had been there to show meto show me what a nice place it was i see well never mind how it began but i will be as straight as you are it is difficult for me to do that without saying some things to offend you say what you please mr cranleigh say what you will i shall not forget whose brother you are and that you mean to do your duty to her to the best of my power in the first place then do you know what the character of our grace is she is gentle and shy and affectionate and unselfish as a girl alone can be on the other hand she is proud and highspirited and as obstinate as the very devil of money she never thinks twice except for the sake of those around her she has the very loftiest ideals which she cherishes but never speaks of them can a moneymaker realise them this i ought never to have said for it pained him very bitterly he made no answer but the expression of his face showed that i had hit his own misgivings not that i would make too great a point of that i proceeded more politely for a woman is not like a man altogether however consistent she may be and grace is only a girl after all so that no one must be too certain she forms her own opinions to some extent and nothing will work her out of them she takes likes and dislikes at first sight and she declares they are always justified you dont happen to know i supposei mean you have not formed any idea what she thought of you mr stoneman no i was rather surprised that she never said a word that day she was sent for to give you the keys the utmost i could get out of her was oh yes he was very polite very polite i assure you and so it is still as if your entire nature was politeness and you consisted of good manners manners maketh man my visitor spoke for the first time lightly and the smile on his face was no small improvement but you will think that i cannot claim them if i delay any longer to thank you you have taken what i had to tell you much better than i could have expected and for that i am very grateful but i want to know this i have heard a good deal of the importance attached by the cranleighs to their very old lineagesaxon i believe but my family has no such claims we can boast no more than thisfor three or four generations at the most we have been well educated and well off all business men no lords of the land no knights with coats of mail and legs crossed upon a slab now does that make you look down upon me from the height of salisbury steeple without any knowledge of his wealth such as most of us look up to it would have been hard for any one to look down upon the man before me and sooth to say there are plenty of men in his position and of far lower birth than his who would have considered themselves at the top and me at the bottom of the tower but before i could answer a sudden flush came over his face and he rose in hastefor i had made him sit down againand he seemed to be trying very hard to look as if he were not where he was perhaps his conscience told him that he was caught in the attempt to steal a march but my sister grace who had just come in with her usual light step to tempt me to have at least a glass of beer before despising everything by some extraordinary gift of sightthough there never have been straighter eyesgrace never saw that great stockbroker who wanted her not to look at him george this is too bad of you again she began with a smile almost too sweet for homeconsumption only work work all day double double toil and trouble and scarcely a morsel of nourishment not a bit to eat is what you generally say and ever so much better english i spoke in that way because i really do dislike all affectation and i was sure that she had espied the stockbroker never mind how i express it said grace and i thought that rather independent of her and it confirmed my conviction that she knew of some one too ready to make too much of her if you understand it that is enough but do come darling george you make us so sadly anxious about you what should we do if you fell ill and your poor dear eyes that were so bluethe loveliest blueoh such a blue she knew that her own were tenfold bluer and mine no more than cigarash to them now a man can put up with a lot of humbug from a sister who is good to him but he must be allowed to break out sometimes or she herself will soon make nought of him and all this unusual gush from grace because i had missed my supper beer when she offered to kiss my poor lonely brow it annoyed me as i thought of being superseded my dear child i said waving my hand towards the corner where stoneman looked envious the light is very dim but i really should have thought that you must have seen mr stoneman there mr stoneman allow me to apologise for my sisters apparent rudeness i fear that she overtries her eyes sometimes the stockbroker favoured me with a glance as if he longed to overtry my eyes too and then he came forward and offered his hand to my discomfited sister with the lowest bow i ever did behold all this was a delight to me but neither of them for the moment seemed to be enjoying it oh i beg your pardon mr stoneman said our grace recovering herself with a curtsey as profound as his bow and a thousand times more graceful really i must take to spectacles but i hope as you have heard my little lecture you will join me in persuading my dear brother to take a little more care of himself he works all day long and then at night he sits all by himself and thinksas i thought he was doing when i came so in the dark after a few more words she left us departing with a dignity which showed how wrong i must have been in suspecting her of levity she isshe is mr stoneman stopped for he could not find anything grand enough oh i wish i might only call you george with all my heart i replied quite humbly perceiving a touch of bathos which in human affairs is almost sure to mean a return to commonsense all over the farm they call me george at any rate behind my back then my dear george i will leave you now i have had a most delightful visit and i wish to go and think about it but do not suppose for a moment that i shall cherish any foolish hopes i know what i am and what she is did you see how she walked from the table and my cigar was smoking on it shall i tell you what to do my friend i answered rather pettishly you are famous for strong decision as well as quick sagacity exert a little of them now and put away this weakness it is not my weakness it is my strength before i could speak again he was gone and verily when i went out of doors and saw the stars in their distant gaze and felt the deep loneliness of night it struck me that perhaps this man was wiseto set his heart upon a constant love some warmth and truth not far to seek and one at least who would never fail to feel his thoughts and endear his deeds chapter v ticknors mew some men there are whom it is a pleasure to observe at their daily work how they swing their shoulders and sway their arms and strain the strong cordage of the bulky thigh casting weight as well as muscle into the fight they are waging and this pleasure should be made the most of because it is growing very rare i have heard my grandfather say that when he was a boy one man could do ay and would insist on doing more work in a day than is now to be got out of three by looking hard at themthree men of the very same stock and breed perhaps even that grandfathers own grandchildren and the cause which he always assigned for this though not a bad scholar himself and even capable of some latin was the wild cram and pressure of pugnacious education the more a jug gurgles the less it pours was his simple explanation there is much to be said on the other side especially as the things put into their heads are quick enough to go out again and the muses as yet have not turned the villageboy into a ganymede but the only man on our little farm who ever worked with might and main had never been at school at all and his name was robert slemmick to this man nothing came amiss if only there was enough of it he was not particularly strong nor large of frame nor well put together but rather of a clumsy build and gait walking always with a stoop as if he were driving a full wheelbarrow and swinging both arms at full speed with his legs but set him at a job that seemed almost too heavy for him and he never would speak nor even grunt nor throw down his tool and flap his arms but tear away at it without looking right or left till you saw with surprise that this middlesized man had moved a bigger bulk in the course of a day than a couple of hulking navvies but one fault he had and a very sad fault which had lost him many a good place ere now and would probably bring him to the workhousehe was what is called by those who understand such matters a black buster at the nearest approach i could make to this subject sidling very carefullyfor the british workman would be confidential rather to a ghost than to his own employerit seems that there are two kinds of busters the white one who only leaves work for a spree of a day or two meaning to jollify and to come back in a chastened vein after treating all his friends and then going upon trust and the black who is of a stronger mind this man knows better than to waste his cash upon clinking glasses with a bubble at the top he is a pattern for weeks and months together pours every shilling on a saturday night into the hands of his excellent wifefor it is his luck to have a good onesits in a corner with his quiet pipe at home and smiles the smile of memory when the little ones appeal to his wisdom and so he goes on without much regret for adventure or even for beer beyond the halfpint to which his wife coerces him everybody says what a steady fellow bob is he is fit for a guild if he would only go to church he ties the canary creeper up and he sees to his cabbages upon a sunday morning and the nextdoor lady shakes her head over the fourfeet palings with her husband upstairs roaring out for a fresher after a tumbledown night of it oh if my tom was like your mr robert but mrs bob also shakes her head oh yes he is wonderful good just now then comes the sudden break down and breakaway without a word to any one or whisper to his family off sets mr robert on a monday morning generally after doing two good hours work before breakfast perhaps he has been touched on the virtuous road home by a fine smell of beer at the corner where the potboy was washing the pewters and setting them in the sun for an airing perhaps it was a flower that set him off a scarlet geranium who can tell under some wild impulse he bolts and makes away he is in the next parish before his poor wife has given up keeping the teapot warm and by the time she has knocked at the toolhouse door in the forlorn hope that he may be ill he is rousing the dust of the adjoining county still going straight ahead as if the devil were after him and that last authority alone can tell how bob lives what he thinks of where his legs and arms are whence his beer flows down to him for a month or even halfayear or nobody knows how long it is this robert slemmick had been in our employment ever since last candlemas and had only broken out once as yet in the manner above described excepting only that little flaw his character was excellent and a more hardworking obliging intelligent man never came on any premises when i took him back after his escapade i told him very plainly that it would not be done again and he promised to stick to his work and did so but not a word to me or anybody else as to why he went away or whither or what he had been doing or how he got his living knowing how peculiar the best men areotherwise could they be good at alli tried not to intrude upon the romance of his beerhaven but showed myself rather cold to him though i longed to know about it master jarge said this man one day when he was treading a hayrick and i was in the waggon with the fork below and it must according to the times have been the very day after jackson stoneman came to me master jarge what would e give to know summut as i could tell e he had had a little beer as was needful for the hay and i looked at him very seriously reminding him thus without harshness of my opinion of his tendencies but he did not see it in that light you shape the rick i said i dont want to hear nothing for you must use double negations if you wish them to understand you we were finishing a little rick of very choice short staple with a lot of clover in it and old joe in the shafts was likely to think of it many a winter night at such a juncture it will not do to encourage even a silent man bob went cleverly round and round dealing an armful here and there for a very small round rick is the hardest of all for scientific building and then he came back to the brink close to me till i thought he was going to slide down upon my knees what would e give master jarge he whispered making a tube of his brown bristly hand to hear all about the most bootifullest maiden as ever come out of the heavens although i felt a tingle in my heart at this i answered him very firmly get on with your work dont talk rubbish to me you be the steadiest of the steady every fool knows that but i reckon master jarge hath his turn to come same as every young man the lord hath made with a pair of eyes oh our miss grace she be bootiful enough but this one over yonnero lord o lord he waved his hand towards the valley in the distance whose outline was visible from where we stood and dignified as i tried to be he saw my glance go wandering why you knows all about it master jarge you be clapping your eyes upon the very place why neer a man in england hath ever seed the like and who could athought it astanding outside nonsense i said why you must have been dreaming who knows what comes over you sometimes this reference to his busting weakness was not in good taste when the crime had been forgiven and the subject was known to be hateful to him but this was the sure way to let his tongue loose and when a reserved man once breaks forth he is like a teetotaller going on the spree i could show e the place now just master jarge the place cant run away i reckon all over ivyleaves the same as a churchtower you cant deny of they when you sees them can e and the bootiful young galwhy youve seed her master jarge by the twinkle of your eyes i could swear to it robert slemmick you are off your head i answered with a very steadfast gaze at him for his keen little eyes were ready to play i spy with mine i insist upon knowing where you have been and what you have done and what people you have met if they knew that you were in sir harold cranleighs service you may have done us great discredit with some indignation he told his tale and finished it before the other men came back for his tongue was as brisk as his arms and legs which had rare gifts of locomotion but i must fill in what he left out for it would be neither just nor wise to expect him to inform against himself it seems that he was walking very fast discharging himself from domestic bonds and responsibility and temperance when he came to a black door in a big wall and rapid as he was this brought him up his thoughts if any were always far in advance of him at such moments and perhaps his main object was to overtake them this he could not explain and had never thought about it but at any rate that door should not stop him it was locked or bolted and without a bell but he worked all his members together against it as he alone of mankind could do and what could withstand such progressive power the door flew open and in rushed slemmick like the london county council but there are powers that pay no heed to the noblest psychical impulse two dogs of extraordinary bulk and stature had him prostrate between them in an instant and stood over him grinding enormous jaws dazed as he was cold terror kept his restless members quiet and perhaps he feltthough he did not so confess itthat conjugal law was vindicated i were in too terrible a funk to think was his statement of the position but the two dogs appeared to enjoy the situation and being of prime sagacity were discussing his character between them if he had been a mere white buster that is to say a common tramp they would have stopped his tramp for ever but they saw that he was a respectable man a sound homeliver in his proper state of mind and although they would not hear of his getting up they deliberated what they ought to do with him slemmick in the meanwhile was watching their great eyes and their tails flourished high with triumphant duty and worst of all their tremendous white fangs quivering if he even dared to shudder abashed i were to the last degree he told me and i could well believe it my last thought was to my poor wife sally a good partner to whom his first thoughts should have been but while he was thus truly penitent i hope a clear sound as of a silver whistle came to his ears and the dogs stood up and took the crush of their paws from his breast and one of them sat by him in strict vigilance still while the other bounded off for instructions then according to slemmick there appeared to him the most beautiful vision he had ever seen straight from heaven dont tell me master jarge for never will i hear a word agin it straight from heaven with the big hound ajumping at her side and him looking like an angel now if you was to see her youd just go mad and never care to look at any other maid no more what was she like bob it had not been my intention to put any question of this kind but slemmick was in such a state of excitement that i had a right to know the reason dont e ask me sir for good dont e ask me there never was no words in any dixunary and if there was i couldnt lay to them there then you go and judge for yourself master jarge but she cant be there all by herself my friend surely you must have seen some one else and what language did she speak in blowed if i can tell e sir all i know is t were a mixture of a flute and a blackbird and the playemoutofchurch pipes of the horgan not that she were singing only to the ear my meaning is and never mind the words no more than folk does in a hanthem lor to hear poor sallys voice after coming home from thateven in the wisest frame of mind with all the wages in her lap but you did not come home bob slemmick for i know not how long did you spend the whole of your time in that enchanted valley ah a chant it were by gum a chant as i could listen towhy master jarge ill take e there for two skips of a flea i would wont e very well best not i reckon never look at no english maids no more this was nearly all that i could get from bob without putting hundreds of questions for instead of straight answers he went off into ravings about this most ravishing young lady who must have contrived to make out what he wanted for after having saved him from the dogs she led him directly to the lower door and sped him on his way with halfacrown but that as he assured me was of no account in his estimate of her qualities you ask farmer ticknor sir if you think i be alying farmer ticknor hath seed her more at his comfort than ever i did and ticknor come hotter than i do hold your blessed jawhe say when i goeth to ask about her knowing as he were neighbourlywhat call for you bob slemmick he saith to come running like a dog on end down here ill give you a charge of shot he saith if i catch you in the little lane again t is the royal family and no mistake that knoweth all about this here and dont you make no palaver of it to come stealing of my mushrooms as if we hadnt better as we kicks up every day now all this talk of bobs although it may have told upon my mind a little was not enough to set me running straight away from my home and friends at a very busy time of year as slemmick was so fond of doing but betwixt the green and yellow as our people call the times of hay and corn it seemed to me that i might as well have a talk with that farmer ticknor who was known to be a man of great authority about the weather and the crops and had held land under us as long as he could afford to do so he was rather crusty now as a man is apt to be when he lives upon a crust for the benefit of foreigners and receives his exchange in coloured tallow it was two or three years since i had seen him now for ticknors mew as he called his place was out of the general course of traffic and as lonely among the woods as a dead fernfrond i found him at home on a fine summer evening and he put up my horse and received me very kindly for he was not a bad sort of man though rough and if any pleasure yet remained in farmers lane to workhouse this man made the most of it by looking at the sky as if it still could help him against the imbecility of the earth yes i have been a fine hand at it he said after sending for a jug of ale and two bellrummers there never was a cloud but i know the meaning of un though without they long names they has now bessie my dear fetch ticknors marks dont care much to do it nownought to lose or gain of it not much odds to this land of england now what weather god almighty please to send and when they shamed the lord out of caring to mind the harvest the government goeth for to hirritate him more with a hoffice to tell us what sort of hat to put upon our heads when us cant pay for none but ill bet my sunday beaver against his band of gold what say to that mr cranleigh i stuck un on the barndoor every marnin as long as there was anything to care for in the whitfields it covereth a whole year dont it bessie cross stands for wrong and straight line for right ticknors marks as he called his calendar certainly seemed to hit the mark more often than the men of science did on a great blackboard were pasted in parallel columns the daily forecasts and farmer ticknors predictions entered at noon of each preceding day his pretty daughter bessie the editor no doubt of his oracles displayed them with no little pride if you will be pleased to observe mr cranleighbessie had been at a boardingschoolmy fathers predictions are in manuscript of courseand much better than he could write thought iwhile the authorised forecasts are in type now the crosses on the manuscript are not quite five per cent while those upon the printing exceed seventyfive if there were any impartiality in politics dont you think mr cranleigh they would give father the appointment and he would be glad to do it in these bad times for less than half the money though we must not blame the gentlemen who have to do it all through the window you never hear me boast interrupted the farmer there never was that gift in our family but ill go bail to give that meatyard man or whatever they calls un five pips out of tenall this reckoning by scents hath come after my timeand give un twelve hours longer with his arrows and his dots and then ill name the day agin him for the best joint in his yard but bless your heart and mine too master jarge what odds for the weather now why even the hay they tell me now is to come in little blocks from foreign parts make a ton of it they say they can by hyderaulic something come out not a morsel bigger than the parishbible well well well well knowing that if he once began upon free trade there would be many changes of weather before he stopped i brought him back to the other subject and contrived to lead him as far as the margin of the wood where the clouds by which he made his divinations could be contemplated more completely but he told me a great deal about their meanings although he knew nothing of their names all of which i forget though i tried to attend it was not for any knowledge of clouds or weather or politics or even harvestprospects that i was come to see this prophet ticknor in the woods my mothers favourite subject was the fulfilment of prophecy but what i cared for now and thought myself bound to follow out was the vision seen by others as well as myself of a foreign young maidenif it must be sounequalled by any of english birth the prevalence of loose commercial ideas and the prostitution of britannia so highly respected while she locked her own gate had given me a turn against things foreign though none but my enemies could call me narrowminded and here i was open to conviction as usual with a strong prepossession against my country or at any rate against her girls however lovely i suppose you dont happen to know i said to that excellent ticknor while still among his clouds whether anybody lives in that old place where there seems to be such a lot of black stuff what is it ivy it looks like and old walls behind it or something very old i think i have heard of some old monastery there and it was part of our property long and long ago oh farmer ticknor how everything does change the farmer afforded me a glance of some suspicion narrow tradeinterests had got the better of him you be gone into the retail line he said to think of the cranleighs coming down to that but you dont sell milk by the quart now do e though i did not see how it could bear upon the subject i assured him that most of our milk went to london under contract with a great man whose name i mentioned and the rest we kept for making butter well then i does a good little stroke of business there though not much profit out of that of course they takes in a galloncan every morning and they asked the boy whether i didnt keep no goats goats why then they must be foreigners i said no english people care about goats milk at least unless their doctor orders it they hant got no doctor and dont want none a rare strong lot according to all i hear toorks i call them and i put it on the bill toork esquire debtor to john ticknor having raised no objection why it stands they must be toorks but people cant live on milk alone mr ticknor and they must have some other name besides turks even if they are turks which i scarcely can believe well you knows more about them than i do sir i never form an opinion so long as they pays me good english money but they never has no butchers meat nor no beer and that proves that they baint english folk if you want to know more about them mr cranleigh the one as can teach you is my dog grab grab feeleth great curiosity about them because of the big dogs inside the old wall he hath drashed every other dog in the parish and it goeth very hard with him to have no chance to drash they never mind old boy your time will come an atrocious bulldog of the fiercest fighting type who had followed us from the farmhouse was nuzzling into his masters grey whiskers now i love nearly all dogs and as a rule they are very good to me but that surly fellow who is supposed to be the type of our national character does not appear to me by any means adorable very faithful he may be and consistent and straightforward and devoted to his duty but why should he hold it a part of his duty to kill every gentle and accomplished dog he meets unless the other dips his tail the canine ensign to him and of all the bulldogs i have ever seen this grab was the least urbane and polished a white beast with three grisly patches destroying all candour of even bloodthirstiness red eyes leering with treacherous illwill hideous nostrils like ulcers cut off and enormous jowls sagging from the stark white fangs he saw that i disliked him and a hearty desire to feel his tusks meet in my throat was displayed in the lift of his lips and the gleam of his eyes wonnerful big hounds they furriners has according to what my milkboy says the farmer continued with a plaintive air but they never lets them free of the big wall hardly to let grab see what they be made of but come back to house and have a bit of supper with us before you go home mr cranleigh t is a roughish ride even in summertime thank you not a bit to eat but perhaps before i go another glass of your very fine homebrewed but i see a tree down in the valley there that i should like to know more about ill follow you back to the house in a few minutes but how long did you say that those strangers have been here it seems such an odd thing that nobody appears to know anything about them well a goodish long while they must have been there now and they dont seem to make no secret of it bakes their own bread if they have any never has any carriagefolk to see them never comes out with a gun to pot a hare dont have no fishmonger butcher grocer nor any boy to call out papper at the door my boy charlie is uncommon proud because he have got into their goodmorning they says it like christians so far as he can judge and naturally he sticketh up for them you can ask him master jarge if you think fit nothing clandestical about ticknors mew but none of them inspectors to pump into our milk and swear as we did it thats why i keep you grab farmer ticknor made off with this little grumble lifting his hat to me until i should return for he did not look down upon the gentry of the land for being out at elbows after thinking for a minute of all that i had heard which was not very much to dwell upon i twirled my ridingcrop which i had brought from habit and been glad to have when i watched grabs teeth and set off with a light foot to explore that lonely valley i was now on the opposite side from that by which i had entered it to the tune of the nightingale and at first i could scarcely make out my bearings for though i had seen it afar with tom erricker something prevented me from letting him come near it tom was an excellent fellow in his way but of reverence and lofty regard for women no decent englishman could have much less decent i say because if such sentiments are cast by and scoffed atas fools think it clever to dothe only thing left is indecency this valley was not like many places that are tempting only at a distance the deeper i found myself in it the more i was filled with its gentleness and beauty it has never been in my line at all to be able to convey what comes across mewhen i see things that look as if they called upon us to be grateful for the pleasure they contribute to our minds certain people can do this as some can make fine afterdinner speeches while others are more fitted to rejoice inside and if i were to fail in depicting a landscape such as any surrey man may see by walking a few miles how would you care to follow me into the grandest scenery the maker of the earth has made anywhere unless it be in his own temple of the heavens enough that it was a very lovely valley winding wherever it ought to wind and timbered just where it should be with the music of a bright brook to make it lively and the distance of the hills to keep it sheltered from the world and towards the upper end where first the stream came wimpling into it that ancient wall which had baffled me enclosed a large piece of land as well as some length of watercourse but gave no other token of its purpose this was what i cared most about for stupid and unreasonable as it must appear a sharp spur had been clapped to my imagination by the vague talk of slemmick and ticknor and not only that but to some extent the zeal and the ardour of jackson stoneman and his downright policy had set me thinking that poor as i was while he was rolling in money the right of my manhood was the same as histo pursue by all honest means the one fair image which a gracious power had disclosed to me therefore after looking at the tree to soothe my conscience i followed the course of that wandering wall by no means in a sneaking manner but showing myself fairly in the open meadows and walking as one who takes exercise for health the wall was on my left hand all the way from the track in which the steep road ended after crossing the brook and although i would rather sink into a bog than seek to be spying impertinently nothing could have come upon that wall and no one could have peeped over it without my taking it in at a sideflick but i only had sense of one thing moving throughout all my circuit and that was but little to comfort me just as i was slipping by the upper door which slemmick had burst open and taking long stridesfor if some one had opened it and asked what i wanted there how could i as a gentleman tell the whole truthsuddenly there appeared within a square embrasure and above the parapet among the ivy the most magnificent head i ever saw mighty eyes full of deep intelligence regarded me noble ears such as no man is blest with quivered with dignified inquiry while a majestic pair of nostrils as black as night took sensitive quest of the wind whether any of the wickedness of man were in it knowing that i only intended for the best though doubtful if that would stand me in much stead supposing that this glorious dog took another view of it i addressed him from below with words of praise which he evidently put aside with some contempt he was considering me impartially and at leisure and if i had moved he would have bounded down upon me luckily i had the sense to stand stockstill and afford him every facility for study of my character at the same time i looked at him not combatively but as if i felt similar interest in him which i had excellent reason for doing to my great relief his eyes assumed a kind expression by the pleasant waving of his ears i could tell that his tail was wagging and he showed a bright dimple beneath his black whiskers and smiled with the humour which is far beyond our ken whereupon i nodded to him and made off when i came to think of him in that coarser frame of mind in which we explain everything so meanly it occurred to me that those noble nostrils curving like the shell of amphitrite were scarcely moved so much perhaps by the influence of my goodness as by the fragrance of my sisters spaniel lady silky who had nestled in my hairy jacket while i was casting up accounts that day however be his motive large or small he had formed a friendly opinion of me and when i disappeared among the trees a low whine followed me as if the place had grown more lonely upon the whole i had made some progress towards the solution of this strange affair within those walls there must be living a settlement of foreigners an establishment of some size to judge by the quantity of milk they used some of them could speak english but they did not seem to associate with any of their neighbours and probably procured from london the main part of what they needed to farmer ticknor as to most of the rustics round about us all who were not of british birth were either turks or frenchmen to my mind these were neither and the possession of those noble dogsa breed entirely new to meshowed that they were not dwelling here to conceal their identity or to retrench from poverty for there were at least two dogs perhaps more worth a hundred guineas each to any london dealer at the lowest computation and not by any means qualified to live on scanty rations another point i had ascertainedthat the old mill out of use for many years was now at work again this had been built no one knows how long ago among the monastic ruins upon the neverfailing pebblebourne and while i was counting the moments for that gigantic dog to spring down on me i heard very clearly the plash of the wheel and the boom and murmur of the works inside as a last chance of picking up something more when i was getting on my horse i said across his mane to the fair bessie ticknor that highlycultured maidena little bird has told me though i would not listen to him that a young lady almost as pretty as miss ticknor lives in a valley not a hundred miles from here bessie raised her jetblack eyes and blushed and simpered and whispered so that her father could not hear it oh i d give anything to know it is such a romantic mystery culture does put such a cruel curb upon curiosity but it does not take much to surpass me mr cranleigh we are not all quite blind in this world miss ticknor though some may try to contradict their lookingglass chapter vi true hygiene whenever my brother harold deigned to visit us from london we had not much time to do anything more than try to understand his last idea if he had only been fond of society or philosophy or even ladies we could have got on with him ever so much better for he really never meant any harm at all pity for the pressure he was putting on his brain saddened to some extent the pride which he inspired and when he came down to announce his last eureka the first thing my mother did was to make him show his tongue my mother did think mighty things of this the firstborn child she had and him a sonendowed beyond all sisterbabies with everything nevertheless she did her utmost to be fair to all of us and sometimes when her eyes went round us at christmastime or birthdays any stranger would have thought that we all were gifted equally i am happy to say that this was not the case never has it been my gift to invent anything whatever not even a single incident in this tale which i am telling you everything is exactly as it happened and according to some great authorities we too are exactly as we happened but my brother harold can never have happened he must have been designed with a definite purpose and a spirit to work his way throughout although it turned to proteus he had been through every craze and fadi beg his pardonliberation of the age enlightenment amelioration of humanity c c and now in indignation at the pump court drains he was gone upon what he called hygiene what the devil do you mean by this blessed hygiene though by no means strong at poetry i turned out this very neat couplet one day with the indignation that makes verses when i saw that he had a big trunk in the passage which certain of us still called the hall george will you never have any large ideas he replied with equal rudeness such as brothers always use this time even you will find it hard to be indifferent to my new discovery the ardour of truth has triumphed go ahead i said for he had had his dinner though that made very little difference to him his ardour of truth being toast and water now but if you wont have a pipe i will is the smell antihygienic undoubtedly it is about that there cannot be two sane opinions puff away but be well assured that at every pull you are inhaling and at every expiration spreading all right tell us something new and you are never far to seek in thatpennyroyal fenugreek ruta nigra tintacks hydrised hyoscyamus colocasia geopordon carbonisedwhat is the next panacea tabacum nicotianum nothing pleased my brother more than the charge of inconsistency and selfcontradiction seeing that he lay in wait for this i would not let him have it but answered with indifference that is right old fellow i am glad that you have come to a sensible view of tobacco any very choice cigars in your trunk old chap but i should fear that you had invented them no one could help liking harold at first sight he was simply the most amiable fellow ever seen amiable chiefly in a passive way although he was ready for any kind action when the claims of discovery permitted and now as we were strolling in the park and the fine surrey air had brightened his handsome face with more hygiene than he ever would produce i was not surprised at the amount of money he extracted even from our groans would you like to know what is in my trunk he asked with that simple smile which was at once the effect and the cause of his magnetism i have done it for the sake of the family first and then of the neighbourhood and then of the county i shall offer the advantages to surrey first as an old county family that is our duty there is some low typhoid in the valleys still run and fetch my trunk george it is heavy for me but nothing for your great shoulders bring it to the bower here i dont want to open it in the house because becausewell youll soon know why when you follow my course of reasoning i brought him his trunk and he put it on a table where people had tea in the park sometimes to watch a game of cricket from a sheltered place come quite close he said very kindly throwing open the trunk and then making for the door while i rashly stooped over his property in another minute i was lying down actually sneezed off my legs and unable to open my eyes from some spasmodic affection or affliction thats right said harold in a tone of satisfaction dont be uneasy my dear brother for at least a fortnight you are immune from the biggest enterprises of the most active local board you may sit upon the manholes of the best sanitated town you may sleep in the house of commons you may pay a medical fee and survive it it is my own discovery see those boxes not yet but i shall as soon as my eyes get right i was able now to leave off sneezing almost for a second and when i had chewed a bit of leaf he gave me there seemed to be something great in this new idea you are concluding with your usual slurmy brother began again as soon as i was fit to receive reason instead of sympathythat this is nothing more than an adaptation of lundy foote irish blackguard or welsh harp george you are wrong as usual you need not be capable of speech for that your gifts of error can express themselves in silence cowardly reasoner i began but the movement of larynx or whatever it might be threw me out of ratiocination he had me at his mercy and he kept me so to attempt to repeat what he said would convict me of crankiness equal to his own and worsebecause he could do it and i cannot but the point he insisted on most of all and which after my experience i could not but concede was that no known preparation of snuff without his special chemistry could have achieved this excellence pteroxylon euphorbium and another irritant unknown as yet to chemists have brought this to the power needful but this is not a merely speculative thing you feel a true interest in it now george as men praise mustard with tears in their eyes but let me never hear of it think of it most of all never smell the like again my nose will be red and my eyes sore for a fortnight harold tucked my arm under his with a very affectionate manner of his own which he knew that i never could resist four pockets always in your waistcoat he observed and a flap over every one to keep it dry now i very seldom ask a favour do i george of you here are three hundred little boxes here as well as the bulk of my preparation the boxes are perfectly airtight made from my own design very little larger and not much thicker than an old crownpiece you touch a spring here and the box flies open without that you never would know that it was there promise me that you will always carry this and open it whenever you come to a place where the local boards have got the roads up one of my best friends and i have not many has lost his only little girlsuch a darling she used to sit upon my knee and promise to marry me the moment she was big enoughbut now she has gone to a better world through the new parish authorities diphtheria in the worst form my dear boy his eyes filled with tears for he was very tenderhearted and in the warmth of the moment i promised to carry that little box of his as a safeguard against sanitation my dear george you will never regret it you will find it most useful i can assure you he spoke with some gratitude for he knew how much i hated all such chemistry little did i think how true his words would prove why there goes that extraordinary fellow stoneman i exclaimed suddenly to change the subject what a firstrate horse he always rides but there is something i ought to tell you about that great stockbroker i have not told the governor yet because i was not meant to do so and must not without the mans consent but you ought to know it and he would not object to that what has he discovered i have often thought that men who fall into the thick of humanity ought to get their minds into an extremely active state like mariners straining their eyes to discover the gold coast there is nothing else they care for but there i am wronging jackson stoneman he is a man of the world if there ever was one and yet he is taken above the world by love love of what asked my brother who was sometimes hard upon people who despised all the things he cared for love of gold love of rank love of dainty feeding love of his own fat self perhaps he is not fat he is scarcely round enough he is one of the most active men in the kingdom there are very few things that he cannot do and now he is deeply and permanently in love with filthy lucre if there is anything i hate it is the scorn of humanity that goes with that harold in a lofty mood began to strap up the trunk that was to save mankind if filthy lucre means our grace i said with much emphasis for it was good to floor him you have hit the mark but our grace has not a farthing i very nearly addedthanks to you but it would have been cruel and too far beyond the truth ridiculous he answered trying not to look surprised though i knew that i had got him there why his grandfather kept a shoeshop that is a vile bit of lying gossip but even if it were so the love of humanity should not stop short of their shoes i am afraid you are a snob harold with all your vast ideas i am a little inclined to that opinion myself he answered very cordially but come this is very strange news about grace has she any idea of the honour done her not the smallest so far as i know at least and i think it is better that she should not know just at present i mean until he has had time but surely george you would not encourage such a thing putting aside the mans occupation which may be very honourable if he is so himself what do we know of his character except that he gives himself airs and is rather ostentatious he gives himself no airs what you call ostentation is simply his generosity you forget that in right of his wealth he stands in the place we have lost through our poverty that makes it a delicate position for him especially in his behaviour to us and do what he will we should scarcely do our duty to ourselves unless we made the worst of it how long have you turned cynic why you put that rather neatly i did not think it was in you george it should be explained that my brother harold could never be brought to see that it was possible for me to do anything even fairly well unless it were in manual labour or sporting or something else that he despised and this was all i got for my admiration of his powers never mind about me i replied i am not a cynic and i never shall be one and when i spoke thus i had not the least intention of including my father who is above all such stuff but mother and you and i and no doubt grace herself although she thinks so well of everybodyit would be against all human nature for us to take a kind or even candid view of our successors doings and as for his station in life as you might call it you must live entirely out of the world even in the heart of london not to know that he is placed far above us now everywhere except among the oldfashioned people who call themselves the county families a man of his wealth would be thought much more of than we should have a chance of being what good could we do to anybody now you must learn to look up to him harold my boy very well ill study him whenever i get the chance i cant look up to any man for his luck alone though i may for the way he employs it but he must not suppose that his money will buy grace if ever there was a girl who tried to think for herself and sometimes succeeded probably it is our grace she cannot do much what woman has ever yet made any real discovery although they are so inquisitive but she has a right to her own opinion at any rate as to the disposal of herself here i was on strong ground though i never could argue with harold upon scientific questions but i knew my dear grace much better than he did and she always said that she liked me best whenever i put that question to her not only to make up for mothers preferences in the wrong direction but also because she could understand mewhich did not require much intelligencenot to mention that i was much bigger and stronger than harold though nothing like so goodlooking as anybody could see with half an eye leave it so said harold for he liked sometimes to assert himself as he had the right to do when he cast away scientific weaknesses let such things take their course old fellow if grace takes a liking to him that will prove that he is worthy of it for she is uncommonly hard to please and she never seems to care about understanding me perhaps because she knows it would be hopeless i want to go on to godalming tomorrow there will be a meeting of sanitary engineersthe largest minds of the period i speak of them with deference though as yet i am unable to make out what the dickens they are up to can you get me the onehorse trap from the bell most likely i will go and see about it byandby old jacob will always oblige me if he can but you wont take away your sneezing trunk you owe it to your native parish first my native parish must abide its time in country places there is seldom any outbreak of virulent diseases until they set up a local board i shall leave a score of hygioptarmic boxes in your charge the rest are meant for places where the authorities stir up the dregs of infection and set them in slow circulation and the first thing a local board always does is that i did not contradict him for the subject was beyond me and fond as i was of him and always much enlarged by his visits and the stirring up of my dull ideas it so happened that i did not want him now when so many things had to be considered in which none of his discoveries would help me in fact it seemed to me that he thought much more of his hygienic boxes than of his and my dear sister when he was gone in the old rattletrap from the bell with his trunk beneath his feet my mother seemed inclined at first to think that no one had made enough of him all for the benefit of others she exclaimed after searching the distance for one last view of him if haply the sun might come out for the purpose of showing his hat above some envious hedge does that poor boy ever think of himself what makes it the more remarkable is that this age is becoming so selfish so wedded to all the smaller principles of action so incapable of taking a large view of anything but harold my haroldno words of the requisite goodness and greatness occurred to my dear mother and so she resorted to her handkerchief it seems as if we always must be parted it is for the good of mankind no doubt but it does seem hard though no one except myself seems so to regard it it was five oclock yesterday before he came it is not yet halfpast ten and to think of the rapidlyincreasing distance i defy him to get more than five miles an hour out of that old screw i said not even with one of his hygioptarmic boxes tied beneath the old chaps tail why you can hear his old scuffle still mother she listened intently as if for a holy voice while grace looked at me with a pleasant mixture of reproach and sympathy for who did all the real work who kept the relics of the property together who relieved the little household of nearly all its trouble who went to market to buy things without money and which is even harder still to sell them when nobody wanted them who toiled like a horse and much longer than a horsehowever i never cared to speak up for myself as a general rule i would rather not be praised and as for being thanked it is pleasant in its way but apt to hurt the feelings of a very modest man and of course he knows that it will not last after such a speech from my dear mother no one could have blamed me very severely if i had put my fishingrod together and refused to do another stroke of work that day chapter vii kuban that evening we stuck to our work like britons and got all the ricks combed down so well and topped up ready for thatching that the weather was welcome to do what it pleased short of a very heavy gale of wind not a mowingmachine nor a patent haymaker had been into our meadows nor any other of those costly implements which farmers are ordered by their critics to employ when they can barely pay for scythe and rake all was the work of man and horse if maids may be counted among the menfor in truth they had turned out by the dozen from cottage and farm and the great house itself to help the poor gentleman who had been rich and had shown himself no prouder then than now for about three weeks while the corn began to kern and nature wove the fringe before she spread the yellow banner a man of the farm though still wanted near at hand might take a little change and look about him more at leisure and ask how his neighbours were getting on or even indulge in some distractions of his own now in summer a fellow of a quiet turn who has no time to keep up his cricket and has never heard of golfas was then the case with most of usand takes no delight in green teaparties neither runs after moths and butterflies however attractive such society may be this man finds a riverbank or better still a fair brookside the source of the sweetest voices to him here he may find such pleasure as the indulgence of nature has vouchsafed to those who are her children still and love to wander where she offers leisure health and large delights so gracious is she in doing this and so pleased at pleasing us that she stays with us all the time and breathes her beauty all around us while we forget all pains and passions and administer the like relief to fish worms however were outside my taste to see a sad creature go wriggling in the air and then cursing the day of its birth descend upon the wet storm of the waters and there go tossing up and down without any perception of scenerythis which is now become a very scientific and delicate art in delusion of trout to me is a thing below our duty to our kin a fish is a fellow that ought to be caught if a man has sufficient skill for it but not with any cruelty on either side though the lord knows that they torment us more when they wont bite on any conditions than some little annoyance we may cause themwhen we do pull them outcan balance certain of the soundness of these views if indeed they had ever occurred to me but despairing to convince my sister of themfor women have so little logici fetched out a very ancient flybook with most of the hackles devoured by mothgrubs and every barb as rusty as old enmity should grow harold never fished he had no patience for it and as for enjoying nature his only enjoyment was to improve it tom erricker who was lazy enough to saunter all day by a river while he talked as if examiners were scalping him not an atom did he know of any sort of fishing except sitting in a punt and pulling roach in like a pod of seedy beans upon a long beanstick therefore was everything in my book gone rusty and grimy and maggoty and looped into tangles of yellow gutthat very book which had been the most congenial love of boyhood if i had only taken half as well to homer virgil horace i might have been a fellow of all souls now bene natus bene vestitus and brought my sister grace to turn the heads of heads of houses in the grand old avenue where the dons behold the joys that have slipped away from them but perhaps i should never have been half as happy to battle with the world instead of battening in luxury is the joy of life while there is any pluck and pith and i almost felt as a man is apt to feel when in his full harness and fond of it that to step outside of it even for a few hours was a bit of selfindulgence unworthy of myself however i patched up a cast of two flies which was quite enough and more than enough for a little stream like the pebblebourne wherein i had resolved to wet my line this was a swift bright stream as yet ungriddled by any railway works and unblocked by any noticeboards menacing frightful penalties for although the time was wellnigh come when the sporting rights over english land should exceed the rental in value the wary trout was not yet made of gold and rubies and in many places any one with permission of the farmers was welcome to wander by the babbling brook and add to its music if the skill were in him the silvery tinkle of the leaping fish and though all this valley was but little known to me a call at a lonely farmhouse on the hill a mile or two further on than ticknors mew made me free of the water and them that dwelled therein now why should i go to this pebblebourne rather than to some other surrey stream fishful picturesque and better known to anglers partly i believe through what robert slemmick said and farmer ticknor after him and partly through my own memories there can be no prying air or pushing appearance about a gentle fisherman who shows himself intent upon the abstract beauties of a rivulet or the concrete excellence of the fish it holds my mother liked nothing better than a dish of trout my father though obliged to be very careful about the bones considered that fish much superior to salmon ever since salmon had been propagated into such amazing rarity so i buckled on a basket which would hold some lb took an unlimited supply of victuals and set forth to clear the pebblebourne of trout my mother had no supper except toasted cheese that night although i returned pretty early neither did my father find occasion to descant upon the inferiority of salmon and the same thing happened when i went again i could see great abundance of those very pleasing fish and they saw an equal abundance of me they would come and look at my fly with an aspect of gratifying approval as at a laudable specimen of clever plagiarism and then off with them into the sparkles and wrinkles of the frisky shallows with a quick flop of tail and yours truly till next time and yet i kept out of sight and cast upstream and made less mark than a drop of rain on the silver of the stream i was half inclined to drop any third attempt having daintily treated some meadows of brook without any token of fish to carry home or of human presence to stow away in heart although i had persisted to the very door which had swallowed that fair vision in the twilight of the may her little shrine and holy place i never had profaned feeling that a stranger had no business there neither could i bring myself to hang about in ambush and lurk for the hour of her evening prayer and hymn but my dear mother seemed to lose her fine faith in my skill for ladies are certain to judge by the event moreover to accept a beating lightly was entirely against my rules so i set forth once again saying to myselfthe third time is lucky let us have one more trial on that third evening of my labour against stream i was standing on the bank where the bridletrack came through and packing up my rod after better luck with fish for i had found a fly which puzzled them and had taken a good dozenwhen who should come up gambolling round my heels and asking as it seemed to me for a good word or a pat but that magnificent and very noble dog who had reviewed and so kindly approved of me from the battlements near the upper door what is your name my stately friend i said to him not without some misgivings that he might resent this overture but he threw up his tail like a sheaf of golden wheat and made the deep valley ring and the heights resound with a voice of vast rejoicing and a shout of glorious freedom but was it this triumph that provoked the fates while the echoes still were eddying in the dimples of the hills a white form arose on the crest of the slope some fifty yards behind us a vast broad head with ears prickled up like horns of an owl and sullen eyes under patches of shade regarded us while great teeth glimmered under bulging jowls and squat red nostrils were quivering with disdain it was grab farmer ticknors savage bulldog and hoping that he would be scared as most dogs are when they have no business by the cast of a stone i threw a pebble at him which struck the ground under his burly chest he noticed it no more than he would heed a grasshopper but began to draw upon us as a pointer draws on game with his wiry form rigid and his hackles like a toothbrush and every roll of muscle like an oak burrknot i drew the last loops of my line through the rings and wound up the reel in all haste and detaching the butt of my rod stood ready for it looked as if he meant to fly at me but no he marched straight up to my noble friend with blazing eyes fixed on him and saluted him with a snarl of fiendish malice clearly my dog as i began to consider him had no experience of such low life he was a gentleman by birth and social habits not a coarse prizefighter so he stood looking down with some surprise at this underbred animal yet glancing pleasantly as if he would accept a challenge to a bout of gambols as my lord will play cricket with a potboy nay he even went so far as to wag his courtly tail and draw his taper forelegs which shone like sable a little beneath the arch of his body to be ready for a bound if this other chap meant play grab spied the mean chance and leaped straight at his throat but missed it at first or only plunged his hot fangs into a soft rich bed of curls my dog was amazed and scarcely took it in earnest yet his attitude was that of our truly peaceful nationi dont want to fight but by jingo if i must it wont be long before this little bully bites the dust at him grab at him boy show un what you be made of tip un a taste of british oak give un a bellyful by the lord in heaven would you though i stretched my rod in front of ticknor as he appeared from behind a ridge dancing on his heavy heels at the richness of the combat and then rushing at the dog my friend with a loaded crabstick because he had got the bulldog down and was throwing his great weight upon him he had tossed him up two or three times as if in play for he seemed even now not to enter into the deadliness of the enemy fair play farmer i said sternly it was your beast that began it let him have a lesson i hope the foreign dog will kill him no fairminded person could help perceiving the chivalry of the one and bestiality of the other while the combat grew furious for life or death with tossing and whirlings and whackings of ribs and roars of deep rage on the part of my friend while the other scarcely puffed or panted but fought his fight steadily from the ground and in deadly silence furriner cant hurt un much said the farmer as i vainly strove to get between them made of iron and guttaperk our grab is ive been abiding for this for two months i sent e fair warning master george by that fellow slemmick that you might not lose it fair play you says and i say the very same halloa our grab hath got his hold at last wont be long in this world for your furriner now well done our grab neednt tell un to hold fast to my dismay i saw that it was even so my noble foreign friend was still above the other but his great frame was panting and his hindlegs twitching and long sobs of exhaustion fetching up his golden flanks the sleuth foe the murderer had him by his gasping throat and was sucking out his breath with bloody fangs deepburied let un kill un let un kill un shouted farmer ticknor serve un right for showing cheek to an honest english dog but i sent ticknor backwards with a push upon his breast and then with both hands i tugged at his brutal beast as well might i have striven though i am not made of kid gloves to pull an oak in its prime from the roothold the harder i tugged the deeper went the bulldogs teeth the faster fell the gouts of red into his blazing eyes and the feebler grew the gasps of his exhausted victim then i picked up my ashen butt and broke it on the backbone of the tyrant but he never even yielded for the rebate of a snarl death was closing over those magnificent brown eyes as they turned to me faintly their last appeal a sudden thought struck me i stood up for a moment although i could scarcely keep my legs and whipping out of my waistcoat my brothers patent box i touched the spring and poured the whole contents into the bloody nostrils of that tenacious beast aha what a change his grim set visage puckered back to his very ears as if he were scalped by lightning the flukes of his teeth fell away from their grip as an anchor sags out of a quicksand he quivered all over and rolled on his back and his gnarled legs fell in on the drum of his chest while he tried to scrub his squat nose in an agony of blisters then he rolled on his panting side and sneezed till i thought he would have turned all his body inside out as for me i set both hands upon my hips though conscious of some pain in doing so and laughed until the tears ran down my cheeks my enjoyment was becoming actual anguish when the pensive ticknor stooping over his poor pet inhaled enough of the superfluous snuff to send him dancing and spluttering across the meadow vainly endeavouring between his sneezes to make an interval for a heartfelt damn but suddenly this buffoonery received a tragic turn from the door in the ivied wall came forth a gliding figure well known to me but not in its present aspect the calm glory of the eyes was changed to grief and terror the damask of the cheeks was blurred with tears the sweet lips quivered with distress and indignation ah kuban kuban daretza dula kuban this or something like this was her melancholy cry as she sank on her knees without a glance at us and covered that palpitating golden form with a shower of dark tresses waving with sobs like a willow in the breeze ah kuban kuban and then some soft words uttered into his ear as if to speed his flight i ran to the brook and filled my hat with water for i did not believe that this great dog could be dead when i came back the young lady was sitting with the massive head helpless on her lap and stroking the soft dotted cheeks and murmuring as if to touch the conscience of farmer ticknor ah cruel cruel how men are cruel allow me one moment i said for she seemed not even to know that i was near be kind enough to leave the dog to me i may be able yet to save his life do you understand english mademoiselle illustration allow me one moment i said his life it is gone another sob stopped her voice as she put her little hand where she thought his heart must be yes sir i understand english too well then if you will be quick we may save his life yet i am used to dogs this noble fellow is not dead though he will be very soon unless we help him there is a wound here that i cannot bind up with anything i have about me bring bandages and anything long and soft also bring wool and a pot of grease and a sponge with hot water and a bowl or two i will not let him die till you come back if that could be trusted for when would i come back she glanced at me having no time to do more with a soft thrill of light such as hope was born in and before i could answer it she was gone leaving me unable to follow with my eyes for it was the turningpoint of kubans lifeif that were the name of this highsouled dog the throttling was gone and the barbed strangulation and devils own tug at his windpipe but the free power of breath was not restored and the heart was scarcely stirring lifting his eyelids i saw also that there was concussion of the brain to deal with but the danger of all was the exhaustion luckily in the breastpocket of my coat was a little silver flask with a cup at the bottom tom errickers present on my last birthday i had filled it with whiskey though i seldom took spirits in those young days but carried this dram in case of accidents when fishing instead of dashing cold water out of my hat on the poor dogs face as i had meant to dowhich must in such a case have been his last sensationi poured a little whiskey into the silver cup and filled it with the residue of water that was leaking quickly from my guaranteed felt then i held up the poor helpless head and let the contents of the cup trickle gently over the black roots of the tongue down it went and a short gurgle followed and then a twitch of the eyelids and a long soft gasp the great heart gave a throb and the brown eyes looked at me and a faint snort came from the flabby nostrils and i shouted aloud kuban is saved there was nobody to hear me except the dog himself and he was too weak to know what i meant ticknor was gone with that beast at his heels for at the end of the meadow i saw grab the british champion slouching along like a vanquished cur with his ropy stomach venting heavy sneezes and to the credit of his wisdom i may add that even a lamb in that valley ever after was sacred from a glance of his bloodthirsty goggles with his long form laid between my legs while i sat down on the sod and nursed him my wounded dog began more and more to recover his acquaintance with the world and to wonder what marvel had befallen him he even put out his tongue and tried to give me a lick and his grand tail made one or two beats upon the ground but i held up my hand for he had several frightful wounds and he laid down his ears with a grateful little whine for the main point was to keep him quite still now until the dangerous holes could be stopped from bleeding so intent was i upon doing this that before i was at all aware of it three or four people were around me but i had eyes for only one the lovely mistress of the injured dog while she for her part had no thought whatever of anything or any one except that blessed kuban that was right enough of course and what else could be expected still i must admit that this great fellow rose even higher in my estimation when he showed that he knew well enough where to find the proper course of treatment and was not to be misled even by the warmest loyalty into faith in feminine therapeutics he has turned his eyes away from me oh kuban kuban but i care not what you do beloved one if only you preserve your life do you think that he can do that sir with all these cruel damages now that she was more herself i thought that i had never heard any music like her voice nor read any poetry to be compared to the brilliant depths of her expressive eyes and the sweetness of her voice was made doubly charming by the harsh and high tones of her attendants who were jabbering in some foreign tongue probably longing to interfere and take the case out of my management if they would not make such a noise i said it would be all the better for my patient can you persuade them to stand out of my light and let the fresh air flow in upon us oh thank you that is a great deal better there i think now if we let him rest a minute and then carry him home he will be all right how clever you must be to bring the right things so well for this bit of praise i was rewarded with a smile more lovely than i should have thought possible since the fair cheeks of eve took the fatal bite and human eyes imbibed satan but she was truthful as eve was false without stepan i could have done nothing stepan come forth and receive the praise yours you must now take kuban in your arms and follow this gentleman into the fort understand you he has very little english yet he can do everything except learn stepan is too strong for that but he has not the experience that i have nevertheless he is very good i am praising thee oh stepan lose not the opportunity of thanking me stepan a huge fellow dressed very wonderfully according to my present ideas stood forth in silence and held up his arms to show that they were ready for anything but i saw that a hard leather bandoleer or something of that kind with a frill of leather cases hung before his great chest and beneath the red cross which all of them were wearing stepan is strong as the ox said the lady that he might be and he looked it too can he pull off that great leather frill i asked seeing that it would scrub the poor dog sadly as well as catch and jerk his bandages he cannot remove it that is part of stepan his young mistress smiled at him as she said this then put him up here i said holding out my arms though not sure that i could manage it for the dog must weigh some twelve stone at least and one of my arms had been injured stepan lifted him with the greatest ease but not so did i carry him for he must be kept in one position and most of his weight came on my bad arm so difficult was my task indeed that i saw nothing of the place they led me through but feared that i should drop down at every rough spotwhich would have meant the death of poor kuban and down i must have come i am quite sure of that if i had not heard the soft sweet voice behind meit is too much for the kind gentleman i pray you sir to handle him to the great stepan when i was all but compelled to give in by the failure of the weak arm and the fear of dropping my patient fatally a man of magnificent appearance stood before me and saw my sad plight at a glance permit me he said in a deep rich tone yet as gentle as a womans voice this is overtrying your good will i see what it is i have only just heard i will bear him very gently take orla away for another dog was jumping about me now most anxious to know what on earth had befallen that poor kuban and displaying as i thought even more curiosity than sympathy but when the weight was taken from me and my companions went on i turned aside with pains and aches which came upon me all the worse i have done all i can i am wanted no more the sooner i get home the better thinking thus i made my way towards the black door of our entrance now standing wide open in the distance and i felt low at heart through the failure of my strength and after such a burst of excitement i am not wanted here i have no right here what have i to do with these strange people i said to myself as i sat for a moment to recover my breath on a bench near the door i have quite enough to do at home and my arm is very sore they evidently wish to live in strict seclusion and as far as concerns me so they may if they wanted me they would send after me a dog is more to them than a christian perhaps what on earth do they wear those crosses for i would not even look around to see what sort of a place it was but slipped through the door and picked up my shattered rod and halffilled creel and set off as the dusk was deepening on the long walk to my fathers cottage chapter viii through the corn according to farmer bandilow who was now our last old tenant striving to escape from the wreck of plough by paddling with spade and trowel the london season begins with turniptops and ends with cabbagegrubs but this year it must have lasted well into the time of turnipbottoms otherwise how could my sister lady fitzragon have been in london not that we knew very much about the movements of her ladyship for she found our cottage beyond the reach of her fat and glittering horses only that she must have been now in town because our grace was with her and this was a lucky thing for me for if grace had been at home she must have known all about my wounded arm and a nice fuss she would have made of it but my mother though equally kind and good was not very quick of perception and being out of doors nearly all the day now and keeping my own hours i found it easy enough to avoid all notice and escape all questions for the people at the cottage very seldom came to my special den the harnessroom and i kept my own little larder in what had once been a kennel close at hand and my own little bed up a flatrunged ladder and so troubled none but a sweetly deaf old dame and this arrangement grew and prospered whenever there was no grace to break through it however there is no luck for some people one night when i felt sure that all the cottage was asleep i had taken off the bandages and was pumping very happily on my left forearm where the flesh had been torn when there in the stableyard before me conspicuous in the moonlight with a blazing satin waistcoat stood the only man who could do justice to it for this gallant fellow had a style of his own which added new brilliance to the most brilliant apparel why tom i cried where on earth do you come from i cant shake hands or i shall spoil some of your charms why you must have been dining with the governor new togs again what a coxcomb it is never would i have sported these and indeed i would never have come down at all if i had known grace was out of the way he was allowed to call her grace to me how slow it is without her but i say old chap what a frightful arm youve got pitchfork again i supposefor i had received a scratch beforeonly ten times as bad why you mustnt neglect this youll have it off at the elbow if you do why even by this lightby jove what a whacking arm youve got why it is twice the size of mine i could never have believed it let me pull off my coat and show you but you cannot want one the size of minei answered with a laugh for it was thoroughly like tom to fetch everything into his own person you could never put it into a waistcoat like that george you are an ass was his very rude reply and it seemed to ring into me far beyond his meaning my dear fellow you will be in your own parish what nobody has seen anywherea dead jackassif you go on like this there is a black stripe down your arm the same as you see on a mildcuredhaddy when he shines by moonlight what does that mean putrefaction rot i replied meaning his own words ill pump on you waistcoat and all my dear tom if you go on with this sort of rubbish and yet i had some idea that he might be right but the worstas i need not tell any strong young fellowof the absurdities our worthy doctors try to screw into us nowthat a man must not draw the breath the lord breathed into him for fear of myriomyceliamicrosomethings neither dare to put his fork into the grand haunch of mutton which his maker ordered him to arise and eatof all such infantile stuff the harm is this that it makes a healthy man deride the better sense that is in them come to my hole and have a smoke i said to my dear friend and mind you not a word about this scratch to my good people tomorrow we shall cut our first field of wheat though it wont pay for cutting and binding tom the sight is as glorious as ever what a pity for our descendants if we ever have any to get no chance of ever seeing the noblest sight of old england come to this gate and take a look in a few more years there will be no such sight poetry is all very fine in its way replied tom who had about as much as i possess although he could make a hook and eye of rhyme sometimes but the moon will go on all the same i suppose and she does most of our poetry she was doing plenty of it now in silence such as any man may feel but none can make another feel we waited a minute or two by the gate till a white cloud veiled the quivering disc and then all the lustre flowed softly to our eyes like a sea of silver playing smoothly on a shore of gold after all love is rot said tom carried away by larger beauty after some snub of the day before i should like to see any girl who could compare with that and a man must be a muff who could look at this and then trouble his head about their stupid little tricks look at the breadth of this look at the depth of it why it lifts one it makes one feel larger george that is the way to take things especially when some one has been making you feel small i answered at a venture for i understood my friend and this abstract worship of beauty was not so satisfactory to me now but come into my place and tell me all about it my dear tom you were so mysterious the other day that i knew you were after some other wild goose i am happy most happy tom went on to say after pouring forth the sorrows of his last lovetale through many a blue eye and bright curl of smoke i feel that i cannot be thankful enough at the amount of side that girl puts on and the beauty of it is that she hasnt got a rap and her husband would have to help to keep her mother how lucky for me she never can have heard of the glorious tinman or my oofy maidenaunt wouldnt she have jumped at me if she had a fellow cant be too careful george when you come to think but youll never make a fool of yourself not a bit of romance about you farmer jarge and a fellow of your size and family has a right to go in for ten thousand ayear how about those gipsies in the valley though you mustnt go on with that even if you could my friend great swells i daresay but no tin what business of yours what do you know about them ill thank you to hold your tongue upon subjects that are above you ha ha ho ho tinmen must look up to tinkers must they how dare i call them tinkers well it is just like this these people are gipsies all gipsies are tinkers therefore these people are tinkers but dont get in a wax george i was only chaffing it may be cleopatra herself for all i know come to look after her needlewould not look at it while her own will look at nothing else when lost oh i know what women are and i know what idiots are i answered with a superior smile not being quite such a fool i trust as to pretend to that knowledge which even the highest genius denies to man and an idiot you are tonight tom well i may be a little upset said he striking his glorious waistcoat and then stroking it to remove the mark i confess i did like that girl and she liked me i am sure of that why bless her little heart she cried my boy however it was not to be and when i told her that i must look higher meaning only up to heaven for gradual consolation what a wax she did get in never mind let it pass there are lots of pretty girls about and no man can be called mercenary for i am blest if any of them have got a bit of tin i thank the lord every night of my life that my old aunt never was a beauty and that makes her think all the more of me sir your most obedient behind my chair was an old lookingglass which grace had insisted upon hanging there to make the place look rather smart and tom who had not seen himself for some hours stood up before it in the weak candlelight and proceeded in his usual manner tom my friend you dont look so much amiss if your heart is broken there is enough of it left to do a little breaking on its own account dont be cast down my boy you may not be a beauty though beautiful girls think better of you than your modesty allows you to proclaim but one thing you may say tom whoever has the luck to get you will find you a model husband this i thought likely enough if only he should get a wife with plenty of sense and love to guide him but what was the opinion of a tall hard man who stood in the doorway with a long gun on his arm criticising errickers sweet selfcommune with a puzzled and yet a very wellcontented gaze mr stoneman i exclaimed giving tom a little push for he stood with his back to him in happy innocence of critics we did not expect this pleasure so late at night this is an old friend of minemr erricker allow me to introduce you tom to mr jackson stoneman my old friend turned round without a symptom of embarrassment and bowed almost as gracefully as he had been salaaming to himself i have heard of mr erricker and have great pleasure in making his acquaintance our new visitor replied and i saw that the pleasure was genuine and knew why to wit that he was thinking in his heart that little fop to make up to grace cranleigh for no doubt he had heard of toms frequent visits and the inference drawn by neighbours but i must beg pardon he continued for daring to look in at such a time it was only this i have been down to the pond at the bottom of the long shrubbery to look for some shoveller ducks i heard of and see that no poachers are after them i dont want to shoot them though i brought my gun and going back i happened to see your light up here sit down mr stoneman said tom as if he were the master of the place i have often wished to see you and i will tell you why i am a bit of a sportsman when i can get the chance but this fellow cranleigh is so hard at work always that he never will come anywhere to show me where to go and he has not many places to take you to now i spoke without thinking for to beg permission from this new landowner was about the last thing i would do and i was vexed with my friend for his effrontery of course i should never dream proceeded tom for he had some reason in him after all to ask leave to shoot on any land of yours or where you have taken the shooting rights but there is a little warren with a lot of rabbits on bandilows farm where sir harold gives me leave but i must go a mile round to get at it unless i may cross the park with my gun may i do so without firing of course to be sure as often as you like any friend of mr cranleigh may do much more than that and i am come to ask a favour too i have three fellows doing next to nothing they have just finished bundling a lot of furze capital fellows with a hook i believe and so i dont want to turn them off i hear you intend to begin reaping tomorrow can you find a job for them just for a few days this was a very pretty way to put it i knew that he had plenty of work for the men but wanted to help us with our harvest labour having heard no doubt that we were short of hands i thanked him warmly for these men would be of the greatest service to us and then he turned upon me severely as if my health were under his superintendence and i was trying to elude it by keeping my arm from his notice you are doing a very stupid thing you have a shocking wound in your left arm caused by the tooth or the claws of a dog and instead of having it treated properly all you do is to pump upon it halloa cried tom erricker a dog i wouldnt have that for a thousand pounds george how could you play me such a trick you told me it was a pitchfork i told you nothing of the kind i simply said nothing whatever about it it can concern nobody but myself and i will thank mr stoneman and you too to attend to your own business it may be no business of mine perhaps the stockbroker answered severely but it is the undoubted business of any intimate friend of yours and most of all that of your family such behaviour of yours is not true manliness as i daresay you suppose but foolhardy recklessness and want of consideration for your friends and what does that come to but selfishness under one of its many disguises tom chimed in to the same effect even going so far as to ask me what my father and mother could do without me even if they survived the trial of seeing me smothered under a featherbed but when both my friends had killed me of rabies to their entire satisfaction i showed them in very few words how little they knew about what they were talking of for i had done for myself all that could be done as well as any doctor could have managed it and now there was nothing for it but cold water and an easy mind and trust in providence as soon as tom erricker heard of providence he began to yawn as if he were in church so i begged him to go to bed for which he was quite ready while i had a little talk with our tenant how did you hear of this affair i asked hoping for some light upon other matters none of our people know it they make such a fuss about a dogbite that i was obliged to keep it close i will beg you to do the same if you wish to oblige me there is nothing i wish for more than that stoneman drew his chair over as he spoke and offered me one of his grand cigars and i was not above accepting it with my knowledge of his feelings i have your permission to call you george i will do so now that your bright young friend is gone when i think of the reports that reached mebut i will say no more a fine young fellow no doubt or he would not be a friend of yours the vision of tom erricker at the mirror brought a smile to his firm lips but for my sake he suppressed it now i want to talk to you seriously george and you will not take it as a liberty knowing my very warm regard forfor you you may say what you like i shall take it kindly i am well aware that you know a thousand times as much of the world as i do and a very poor knowledge it is he replied gazing at a cloud of his own smoke when the question is of deeper matters the wisdom of the world is a broken reed and yet i want to bring it into play just now in the case of another that is so much easier just as any fool can pass judgment on the labour he has never tried with his own hand excuse me george if i speak amiss i do it out of goodwill as some of them do not but to show their own superiority to cut the matter shorti know all aboutno not all but a lot about your new friends down in the valley they can scarcely be called my friends if i require to be informed about them my mind had been full of them although it was clear that they cared not to hear any more of me you are surprised perhaps at my knowledge of what occurred the other day that was by the purest accident for i am not the sort of man to play the spy you know that i hope very well i took the liberty then of inquiring for my own sake and that of the neighbourhood who these mysterious settlers were and i knew where to go for my information like most things when you get nearer to them there is no real mystery at all the only wonder is that they can have been there so long without attracting notice if the country had been hunted as it used to be when people could afford to keep up the pack they would never have been left so quiet the parson of the parish as a general rule routs up every newcomer for church purposes no matter what his creed may be and i know that they seldom give much start even to the taxcollectors but the parson of that parish is a very old man and has no one to look after him and the country is very thinly peopled well they seem to have bought the place for an old song so that nobody can interfere with them and they soon put it into better order but who are they and what are they doing there and how long do they mean to stop dont be in a hurry my good friend there is plenty of time for another cigar pipes you prefer very well fill again however for fear of being knocked on the head i will resume my parable nothing can be done without paying for it that is the golden rule in england and everywhere else upon this planet and wherever money passes it can be followed up the strange thing is that these people seem to care very little about concealment though they are not sociable what their native language is we do not know though they seem to be great linguists french german russian arabic and i dont know what else and some of them very good in our beloved tongue the hardest to learn of all the lot they are of eastern race that appears quite certain though neither jews turks nor armenians but what they are here for seems pretty plainforgery ridiculous i exclaimed though without showing any wrath they are people of high rank i am sure of that political exiles refugees anarchists or even nihiliststhough i cannot think that but as for forgers it scarcely sounds nice and yet i have little doubt about it and the police have come to that conclusion and are keeping a sharp eye upon them for what other purpose can they want a mill and a mill which they have set up themselves to suit themselves the old waterwheel they had and the cogs and all that left from the old corngrinding time but they have refitted it for quite a different purpose and done almost all of it with their own hands what for plain as a pikestaffto make their own paper and get stamping power and turn out forged notes foreign of course russian rouble the simplest of all he had made up his mind he was sure of this solution he had no doubt whatever ah but he had never seen the majestic man who met me much less that beautiful nymph of the shrine stoneman all this sounds very fine i met his smile of confidence and as it seemed to me of heartless triumph with a gaze of faith in humanitywhich some people might call romance but there is not a word of truth in it what inference does a policeman draw the worst he can imaginegrist for his own mill they make the world a black chapter to suit their own book but i have no motive what motive could i have to make out that people are better than they seem i tell you and you may take my word for it that this little colony of whatever race it may be has no evil purpose in coming among us i might even go further and say that i am sure of their having an excellent object a noble object some great discovery perhaps surpassing all my brothers and something that will be of service to entire humanity money to wit you know what the last great forger who was hanged before we left off that wise plan what he said when exhorted to repentance you make money for yourself sir i make it for the good of the public no doubt they take that view of the case very well you take a lesson from them and improve the morals of the stock exchange the stockbroker smiled very pleasantly as one who was thoroughly at home with that old joke then he took up his gun and marched off for the hall leaving me to make the best of things feeling how small are the minds of mankind even the best of them when they listen to the police and knowing that i could not sleep as yet i went once more to the gate at the top of the yard and gazed over the wheat which was to lie low on the morrow although i had just received proof of friendship from two very nice fellows better than myself which should have encouraged me to think the best sadness came into my heart and a sombre view of life depressed me there are two things only that can save a man from deep dejection occasionally one of them is to have no thought whatever except for affairs of the moment and the other and surer is to believe with unchangeable conviction that all is ordered by a higher power benevolent ever and ever watchful for those who commit themselves to it that atom of humanity which is myself has never been able to sink to the depth of the one condition or soar to the height of the other so there must be frequent ups and downs with ordinary mortals gleams of light and bars of shade and happy is the man who can keep the latter from deepening as his steps go on but who am i to moralise enough that any fellow worth his salt must be grieved and lowered when suspicions arise concerning those of whom he has formed a high opinion how much worse when his own judgment owns that things look rather black and memory quotes against his wishes more than one such disappointment if it were so if those who had made so deep an impression on me were skulking rogues and stealthy felons no wonder they had not cared to ask what became of the stranger who by remarkable presence of mind had saved the life of their valued warder and then with a modesty no less rare had vanished before they could thank him if they ever had the grace to intend it all the better i said to myself with the acumen of the wisest fox that ever entered vineyard even if all had been right it never could have led to any good and see what a vast amount of work is coming on all at once with no one else to do it and all the time is there any one but myself to see to my young sisters doings here is this fellow stoneman sweet upon her wonderfully sweet quite spoonywho could have believed it of a stockbroker what do i know about him nothing except that he has endless tin and spends it certainly like a brick is he worthy of her and if he is will she even look at him rather a romantic girl too fond of her own opinions and yet a little prone to heroworship she might fall in love with some hero in london who hasnt got a halfpennyhalloa what can that be winding in and out so through the wheat the moon now very nearly full was making that low round of the sky which is all it can manage in august and seemed rather to look along the field than heartily down upon it the effect was very different now from that which tom and i had watched for the surface of the luxuriant corn instead of imbibing and simpering with light was flawed and patched like a flowing tide with flittings and hoverings of light and shade and along a sweep of darkness near the shadow of a tree there was something moving stealthily like the figure of a man for a moment or two i did not enjoy that calmness of mind which is believed by britons to be the prerogative of britons the period of the night and the posture of the moon and peculiar tone of things not to be told as well as some dread of a mischief to my brainthrough what had befallen me recentlytook away from me that superior gift which had enabled me to beat the bulldog however i might just as well not have been afraidas we generally find out afterwardsfor the other apparition whatever it might be was ever so much more afraid of me what on earth are you about there i shouted bravely when this welcome truth came to my knowledge cant you stand up like a man and say what you are about in reply to my challenge an undersized figure scarcely any taller than the corn arose showing a very strange headdress and other outlandish garments and a loose idea generally of being all abroad you are the little chap i saw the other day said i he nodded his head and said something altogether outside of my classical attainments and then he pulled forth from a long coat whose colours no moon or even rainbow could render a small square package which he lifted to his eyes with a rush of my heart into the situation i seized him by his collar or the thing that represented it and twisted him over the gate and he looked thankful having some fear perhaps of english fivebars in half a minute i had this little fellow in my den where he trembled and blinked at the light and then grinned as if to propitiate a cannibal and i was pleased to see that he had pluck enough to put one hand upon the hilt of a little blue skewer which he wore in his belt and then he looked at me boldly with a smile to reassure him i offered to take the missive from his other hand but that was not the proper style of doing business with him he drew back for a pace or two and made the utmost of his puny figure and then with a low bow stretched forth both hands and behold there was a letter in the end of a cleft stick where he found the cleft stick is more than i can tell at the same time he said allai which turned out afterwards to be his own name sit down in that corner little chap i said as graciously as if he knew english and make yourself at home while i get on with this perhaps he was out of practice in the art of sitting down for instead of accepting the chair i offered he clapped himself in some wonderful manner upon a hassock but it was impossible for me to attend to him much until i knew what he had brought now there was nothing particularly foreign about this it looked like an ordinary english letter except that the paper was not like ours and the envelope was secured with silk as well as sealed but the writing was the daintiest that ever i did see and i longed to get rid of that darkie in the corner whose eyes flashed at me from the gloomy floor and his hand was playing with his kinjal all the time for so they call those deadly bits of steel without which they never think their attire complete being unaccustomed to be looked at so i could not enter into my fair letter as i wished though that little fellow would have flown up to the slates before he could get near me with that hateful snakish thing and to tell the truth i did him wrong by any such suspicion for there could never be a more loyal honest and zealous retainer than allai here you are i said addressing him in english though well aware now that he was none the wiser heres a drop of good beer for you young man you take a pull at that while i write my answer ah you wont get such stuff as that inwell i dont know where you hail from but all over the world i defy you to get anything like it allai gave a grunt which i took for acquiescence and leaving him to enjoy himself i wrote a few lines and enclosed them in a cover then i found a bit of sealing wax and sealed it very carefully and fixed it in the cleft wand and handed it to allai you go straight away quicksticks with this and dont you lose it or ill break your neck why im blest if the pagan has drunk a drop of his beer can such a race ever be brought up to date why he takes it for virulent poison the young savage had poured my good ale upon the floor and was soaking the point of his dagger in it he had put the glass to his lips no doubt and arrived at the sage conclusion that here was swift death for his enemies however he possessed some civilisation as to the meaning of a broad crownpiece which in the fervour of my joy i set before him to a rich man it would have been well worth the money to see the glad sparkle of those black eyes and the grin upon those swarthy cheeks suddenly with a deep salaam his slender form turned and was gone like a shadow and then i was able at last to dwell upon this very beautiful letter which might to the outward eye appear to convey not a token of anything more than miss mary jones presents her compliments but to my deeper perception and hopes higher than any telescope may carry it showed the sky cast open at the zenith like a lily and a host of golden angels letting down a ladder for me for no longer could i hide my state of mind or disguise it from myself henceforth i shall be open about it though hitherto ashamed to say half of what i thought while i had such a little to go upon but here is my key to paradise let every man judge for himself bearing in mind that he never can be wise until he has been a fool seventy times seven sirmy dear father sur imar of daghestan has been injured very greatly by your alien conduct to him your actions were of high bravery and great benevolence to us but when we desired very largely to inform you of our much gratitude we could not discover you in any place and we sought for you vainly with great eagerness of sorrow and then for a long space of time we made endeavour to find out the name of the gentleman who had done us so great a service but would not permit us to thank him we are strangers here and have not much knowledge after that a man who possesses three goats pronounced to us that he understood the matter according to his words i take the liberty of letter entreating you if it is right to come and permit us to see to whom we owe so much and my father is afraid that the gentleman was injured in the conflict with a furious english beast if then this should have happened he can remedy it as perhaps you cannot in this country i desire also if it is right to join my own entreaties i am sir yours very faithfully dariel chapter ix strange sensations yours very faithfully oh if that were only written in earnest instead of cold convention to have faithfully mine the most lovely and perfect entrancing enslaving poetical celestialtush what word is there in our language none of course because there has never been anything like it until now gentleness sweetness gracefulness purity simplicity warmth of heart gratitude for even such a trifling serviceall these were very fine things in their way but away with them all if they want to tell me why i love my darling because i cannot help it is the only reason it must be so because it is so surely this is their own fair logic and they must feel the force of it all this jumped with reason well and was plainer than a pikestaff but the path of true love still was crossed by one little bar without a signpost in the name of the zodiac where was daghestan man had not quite hatched boardschools yet though already under the tread of progress incubating of them having been only at a public school and then for two years at oxford no opportunity had i found for hearing of modern geography that such a thing existed i could well believe from the talk of undergraduates whose lot it was to cram for competition of a lower kind i had been a prefect at winchester and passed my littlego at oxford and might have gone in for honours there though very likely not to get them but in all this thoroughly sound education i had never dreamed of modern geography i could have told you though it is all gone now the name of every village in peloponnese and of every hill in attica and the shape of every bay and island and a pestilent lot of them there was from the hellespont to taenarus but if you had asked me the names and number of the counties of england and other wild questions of that sort i should have answered as a friend of mine did who got an open scholarship at oxford and then went in for something in london there are about half a hundred more or less but parliament is always changing them and this man got the highest marks in the geography of that year because the examiner was a welshman and therefore laid claim to monmouth but wherever daghestan might be i felt sure of its being the noblest country outside the british dominions of all the sun could shine upon moreover it sounded as if it had no little to do with the garden of eden ispahan and teheran and other rhymes for caravan had a gorgeous oriental sound as of regions of romance inhabited by peris and paved with gold and diamonds and the glow that flickered through the wheat that day as the mellow fountains danced before the blue halfmoon of sickle was warmer than an english sun can throw and quickened with a brilliance of heavenly tints such as hope alone the iris of the heart may cast farmer jarge heres nuts for you what do you suppose i have found out now this was that lazy fellow tom sprawling in the yellow stubble with his back against a stook and a pipe in his mouth and a dogseared novel on his lap we had knocked off work for half an hour in the middle of the day just to get a bit to eat and i was not best pleased with erricker because of the difference between the noble promise of the breakfast table and the trumpery performance in the field illustration sprawling in the yellow stubble get away i said you can talk and nothing else all you have found out is where the beercan is you are not even worthy of your bread and cheese however i gave him some and he began to munch wont you laugh when i tell you about this and it upsets all your theories that you are so wonderfully wise with i must have heard you say a thousand times that it is only a fool that ever falls in love you never understand a thing that anybody says there are limitations and conditions and a whole variety of circumstances that may make all the difference otherwise a man would be a fool to talk like that fool to do it or fool to talk about it you seem to be getting a bit mixed friend george its the stooping that has done it by jove i couldnt stand that nature never meant me for a reaper george and you may thank the lord that i did not cut your legs off but what do you think stocks and stones has done and you cant call him a fool altogether head over heels stocks and stones has fallen in love with our grace our grace indeed have you a sister of that name if you should happen to refer to my sister i will thank you to call her miss cranleigh is there anything this fellow does not meddle with mr george cranleigh mr jackson stoneman aspires to the hand of miss grace cranleigh daughter of sir harold cranleigh bart is that grand enough mr cranleigh and if so what do you think of it what i thought of it was that there scarcely could have been a more unlucky complication than was likely now to be brought about by toms confounded discovery it was not in his nature to hold his tongue and if he should once let this knowledge escape him in the presence of my father and mother or worst of all in that of my sister it would be all up with stonemans chance of marrying grace cranleigh and as to binding tom to secrecy as well might one blow the kitchen bellows at a dandelion ball and beg it not to part with a particle of its plumage on the spur of the moment i said more than facts would bear me out in when they came up at leisure dont tell me you stupid fellow how many more mares nests must come out of your eyes before you see anything but if you must take in such rubbish just do this tom will you keep your eyes wide open my boy you know how sharp you are tom but not a word to any one or it would spoil your game altogether by the by where is daghestan tom you are such a swell at geography daghestan i seem to have heard of it and yet i cant be certain persian i think no that is ispahan tut tut what a fool i amof course i know all about it why its in the united states a prime place for scalping and buffaloes no you old muff that is dakota quite another pair of shoes i dont want to disturb the governor or i could find out in a moment never mind it doesnt matter and here we go to work again now what is the sweetest smell do you think in all the world of farming not a great overpowering scent but a delicate freshness through the air i should say the hay on an upland meadow when it begins to make or perhaps a field of new beanblossom i never knew that till this year but upon my word it was stunning no the most delicate of all scents is from the clover first laid bare among the wheat where it was sown no blossom of course but the fragrance of the leaf among the glossy quills that sheltered it but come along if you cant swing hook without peril of manslaughter you can bind or you can set up stooks or earn your keep some little why grace is worth a score of you poor tom is your finger bleeding you must come harvesting in kid gloves i will tell you what it is said tom after keeping his place among the binders for about five minutes i am a thoroughgoing countryman and i know a lot about farming and you know how i can jump and run and a good light weight with the gloves i am but this job beats me altogether pay your footing sir pay your footing youll have to pay for my headstone george if you keep me on much longer how you can go on all day longbut i want you to do something for me and by the powers i have earned it he wanted me to promise in return for all his labours to give up my plans for the evening and present myself at dinnertime for the ceremony at the cottage this though a very simple business must be done in the proper form and then it would be my duty perhaps to offer to take a hand at whist and be ready for the wearisome wrangle which even wellbred people make of it but i had nobler fish to fry tom i cant do it you like that sort of thing and my mother is delighted with your sprightly little tales go and put your brave apparel on everybody admires you and you love that he knew that he did why should he deny it the happiness of mankind is pleasure though it passes without our knowledge because we never can stop to think of itas a man in a coach sees the hedges race by and if it comes to that where may you find true bliss so near at home as in being pleased with your own good self our tom had a happy time nothing long tormented him he carried a lofty standard with him and flopped its white folds joyously at little gnats and buzzing bees and he never failed to come up to it because that standard was himself what else could it be he says to me and that is why everybody likes me chapter x upon the ground alas to come down from those pleasant heights if ever i did attain to them to the turbulent dissatisfaction with oneself and contempt of every creature in the world save one which lonely love engenders never had i seemed to myself so low so awfully prosaic and unpicturesque as when i was trying to make myself look decent that very evening since then i have learned that even pretty girls who are roses to thistles in comparison with us are never quite certain at their lookingglass that another touch might not improve them and what did i behold a squarebuilt fellow with a stubby yellow moustache and a nose fit for the ringor to have a ring through ita great bulky forehead like ticknors bulldog and cheeks like a roasted coffeeberry the only thing decent was the eyes firm and strong of a steadfast blue and the broad full chin that kept the lips from drooping in a tremble even now proud as i was of my saxon breed and english build and character in the abasement of the moment i almost longed for a trace of the comely norman traits as if any girl could love you i exclaimed in parody of that handsome toms selfcommune in for a penny in for a pound without a trial theres no denial handsome is that handsome does beauty is only skindeep and so oni laboured to fetch myself up to the mark but it was a very low one the neap of the tide or the low spring waterwhich goes ever so much further outwas ebbing away on the shores of selfesteem as i entered the glen of st winifred tom erricker would have descended as if the valley and its contents belonged to him heaviness of heart may sometimes visit even a healthy and robust young man living the life intended for us working in the open air all day and sleeping on a hard palliasse at night heaviness and diffidence and clownish hesitation and fear of losing precious landmarks in a desertdazzle surely it were better to turn back before they can have seen me set the sheepish face to the quiet hill and thank my stars that not one of them yet has turned into a comet sadly was i perpending this slower and slower at every step while the shadows of the trees grew longer and the voice of birds was lower and the babble of the brook began to sink into the lisping of a cradled child as the draught of the valley hushed it and falling into harmony with all these signs my breath was beginning to abate me when along a trough of sliding mist like a trysting track for the dusk appeared the form of my friend kuban courage at once arose within me and spirit of true patronage to men and women i may be nought but to him i am a hero lo how he licks my hand and whines as if he had never seen my like and would never believe it if he did he longs to roll upon his back and offer himself a prostrate sacrifice but he knows that i should be vexed at that because it would not be safe for him the labour of his great heart is to show me all his damages and make me understand that but for me he could not display them what with love and what with fear and the utter unsettlement of my mind down i went on the grass beside him and took him paw by paw to feel how much of him was still existing now if i had thought of it in the coldest bloodif there still were cold blood in methere was nothing in the world i could have done so wise as this abasement what says ovid in the art of love many low things i am afraid that no englishman would stoop to but if that great master arose anew to give lessons to an age of milder passion probably he would have said to me water those wounds with your tears my friend my eyes being british were dry as a bone but upon them fell as they looked up the lustre of a very different pair like bright stars extinguishing a glowworm and the glory of these was deepened by the suffusion of their sparkle with a tender mist of tears no blush was lurking in the petal of the cheeks no smile in the brilliant bud of lips pity and gentle sorrow seemed to be the sole expression i dropped the dogs great legs and rose and with all the grace that in me layand that was very littletook off my hat and made a bow the former being of the bowler order and the latter of the british no no please not to do that she said it is so very grievous forgive me if i am sad to look at it always comes upon me so when i behold things beautiful but i replied being quite unable to consider myself of that number even upon such authority it is i that should be shedding tears it is i that behold things beautiful it was of the dog i meant my wordsthis was rather a settler for meand the beautiful tokens he manifests of gratitude to the kind gentleman and we have been desiring always but the place we could not find it is my father who will best speak for he has great talent of languages he was hoping greatly that you would come i also have been troubling in my mind heavily that we must appear so ungrateful it is now ten days that have passed away but we could not learn to what place to send neither did we know the name of mrbut i will not spoil it until you have told me how to pronounce cranleigh cranlee as if it were spelled with a double e coming after the letter l said i to her while to my all abroad self i whispered may the kind powers teach her to spell it by making it her own while she looks like that for sometimes it is vain to think and to talk is worse than lunacy her attitude and manner now and her way of looking at meas if i were what she might come to like but would rather know more about itand the touches of foreign style which it is so sweet to domicile and the exquisite music which her breath made or it may have been her lips with our stringy wordsi am lost in my sentence and care not how or why any more than i cared how i was lost then so long as it was in dariels eyes if dariels eyes will find me there and send me down into her heart what odds to me of the earth or heaven the stars the sun or the moon itselfwherein i am qualified to walk with her possibly that sweet dariel saw but could not comprehend my catastrophe she drew back as if from something strange and utterly beyond her knowledge then she cast down those eyes that were so upsetting me and i felt that as yet i had no right to perceive the tint as of heaven before the earth has glimpsed the dawn which awoke in welcome wonder on the wavering of her face see it i did however and a glow went through me who can measure time when time acts thus kuban arose as if his wounds were all a sham or as if we at least were taking them in that light and hatingas a good dog always doesto play second fiddle turned his eyes from one to the other of the twain in a manner so tragic that we both began to laugh and when dariel laughed there could be nothing more divine unless it were dariel crying oh how he does love you mr cranlee she exclaimed with a little pout pretending to be vexed what a wicked dog he is to depart from his mind so why he always used to think that there was nobody like me if he would only think that i am like you or at any rate try to make you like me what a blessed animal he would be this i said with pathos and vainly looking at her i am not very strong of the english language yet it has so many words that are of turns incomprehensible and when one thinks to have learned them all behold they are quite different to you i seem to speak it very very far from native to me you seem to speak it so that it is full of music of soft clear sounds and melody that no english voice can make of it it is like the nightingale i heard when firsti mean one summer evening long ago only your voice is sweeter is it then i am glad because my father hears it always and he knows everything i think before i have time to tell him and he can speak the english wellas well as those who were born in it seven different languages he can speak oh how he is learned to hear me talk is nothingnothingfolly trifles nothing more than deficiency of wisdom and yet of himself he thinks no more perhaps not so much as you do i think nothing of myself at all how can i when i am with you yet a great many different people think highly of me and i do my best to deserve it this was no vain word although it is not like my usual manner to repeat it i am glad of that she answered simply looking with kind approval at me and i saw that her own clear nature led her to believe everything she heard that is the proper way for people and as the good lord intended but how long we have been discoursing without anything to be said while the dusk of the night is approaching it is my father beyond all doubt whom you have come by this long road to see and he has been desiring for many days to obtain the privilege of seeing you not only that he may return his thanks but to learn that you did not receive a wound for he says that the wound of a dog is very dangerous in this country yes i did receive a wound and a bad one ratherhow mean of me it was to speak like this although i was telling the simple truth for there was a deep gash all down my left forearm but i would gladly receive a hundred wounds for the sake of anything that you loved for what am i who could find any good in me compared with you or even with kuban but this fine appeal to the tender emotions did not obtain any success that time if the pity so ignobly fished for felt any tendency to move it took good care not to show itself in the fountains watched by me mr cranlee speaks much from his goodwill to please for there must be good in him even to compare with kuban if a great many people think highly of him and he does his best to deserve it but is it not the best thing to hasten at once with this very bad wound to the one who can cure it let us waste no more time but go at once to meet my father there was no getting out of this and i said to myself that miss dariel was not quite so soft after all what had she told me about herself nothing how much about her father very little and here was i being towed off to him when i wanted to talk with her study her make way with her find out whether there was any other villain in pursuit of her marvellous attractionsin a word make my best love to her but this was the very thing she would not have at present and i felt like a man tumbling out of a tree through making too lofty a grab at the fruit so i fell into the opposite extreme of manner to make it come home to her that i was hurt this was another mistake because as i came to understand long afterwards the feminine part of mankind is never struck all of a heap as we are if you will only think twice you will see that it never could be expected for drop as we mayand the ladies too often call upon us now to drop itthe sense that is inborn in us of a purer and higher birth in them which they kept and exalted by modestyeven if at their own demand we let fall every atom of that and endeavour to regard them as bipeds on a wheel with limbs rounder than our owni say that we ought to try still to regard them as better than ourselves though they will not have it so and what could say more for their modesty i looked at dariel and saw that she was not thinking of me at all except as a matter of business and fearing to have gone too far i tried to behave in every way as a wellconducted stranger this put her into a friendly state of mind and even more than that for it was now her place to be hospitable and i displayed such bashfulness that believing her father to be the greatest man on earth she concluded that i was terribly afraid of him you must not be uneasy about meeting him she spoke in a voice as gentle as the whisper of the wind in may when it tempts a young lamb to say ba i assure you mr cranlee although he can be very stern with persons at all wicked to those who are upright and good he is a great deal less austere and rigid than even i am and i am afraid that you have discovered much harshness in my character for you appear to dread a walk with me i had fallen behind as we approached the door partly to show my humility and partly to admire the grace and true perfection of her slender figure in motion english girls may have lovely figures but none of them can walk like that no i said after some delay to make her turn her head again and repeat that look of penitence you have been as kind as i could expect perhaps more kind than the ladies of your country are to a mere stranger if ever i deserved a good hearty kick and too often that has been my merit here was a solid occasion for it she stopped and spread both hands to me and looked at me with her clear chin raised and trembling lips and soft dark eyes whose radiant depths appeared to thrill with tender sorrow and selfreproach what eyes to tell the tale of love to the happy man who shall inspire it no dawn was there now of any warmth but light alone the light of kindliness and goodwill and the tranquil beams of gratitude what more could i expect as yet though myself in such a hurry what a beautiful place i had no idea that it would be like this i spoke as we stood within the wall for the maiden now seemed timid why i must have lost my wits altogether when i was here the other day for i do not remember a bit of this what a wonderful man your father is what taste and skill and knowledge but it must have taken him many years to bring it into this condition it was nothing but a pile of ruins inside an old ruinous wall at the time when i used to come home from winton and how beautifully it is laid out i should like to know who planned it why you must have quite a number of men to keep it in such order it is almost like a dream to me but how rude i must appear to you though really if the light were good i could sit here for an hour together and like to look at nothing else but all this perfect loveliness she had come quite close to me as i spoke with a bright smile of pleasure on her facefor i warmed my description knowinglyand as i said perfect loveliness i think she knew where i found it for she turned away as if to look at the distance i was praising and being in rapid chase of ever so trifling a thing to encourage me after the many mistakes i had made i tried with the greatest delight to believe that she did that to rob me of a conscientious blush but the wonder of all these zigzag ways when a straight solid man tumbles into them is that they tussle him to and fro a hundred times as much as they upset a slippery fellow whose practice is to slide in and out at pleasure oh for the wits of tom erricker now was the only thought of things outside that came to me in this crisis then again in a moment i scorned that wish for a strong heart from its depth despises surface gloss and frothy scum what is the proper expression for me i see your noble father in the distance how shall i accost him that i used such a word as accostwhich i hate but no better word would come to meshows the state of mind i had fallen into not about him but his daughter for the great surwhatever they might meani did not care a fig as yet and in fact felt rather annoyed with him but it was of the utmost moment now to make her prize my deference that she did far beyond the value and smiled at me with a superior light in his own land he is a prince she said not as those russians call everybody but a prince of the longest generations he however makes lightness of that for he must have been the same without it i have read that you are proud of your english race which comes down to you naturally but my father is purer than to dwell upon that he allows no one to call him prince and i never call him anything but father we have not many names in our country he is imar and i am only dariel before i could go further into that important subject i found myself looking up at the most magnificent man i ever saw chapter xi sur imar although it may seem very wonderful to those who have never been in that state nevertheless it is quite true that in this condition of my feelings the magnitude of no man was a question that concerned me let him be taller than the son of kish or wiser than solomon the son of david with supreme indifference i could scan the greatness of his body or even of his mind if shakespeare had marched up to me at that moment with hamlet in his right hand and the tempest in his left i should only have said to himmy good sir are you the father of dariel but the beauty of goodness has some claim too although more rarely recognised because so rarely visible sur imars face invited love as well as admiration not only when his glance was resting on his gentle daughter but even when he had his eyes on me who was longing all the time to steal her and i put on a manner whence he might conclude that it had never occurred to me to look at her but dariel was above all thoughts of that as much as i wished him to be she rose on her purple sandals which i had not observed till then and kissed her dear father as if she had not seen him for a month but i suppose it is their fashion and he glanced at me as if he meant to saynature first manners afterwards then he looked again with some surprise and her face which could tell all the world without a word seemed to say to menow be on your very best behaviour i was afraid she would use some foreign language but her breeding was too fine for that father at last we have the pleasure to see and know the kind gentleman who was so very brave and who did us that great benefit you behold him and his name is mr cranlee mr cranlee you behold sur imar being still in the skies to a certain extent i longed for a hat of greater dignity to make a better bow withal but still i stood up as an englishman should in the presence of the biggest foreigner until he knows more about him i have thought sometimes that as every player at chess golf or billiards knows almost at the first contact when he has met his better so we without any sense of rivalry and without being ever on the perk about ourselves by some wave of natures hand along the scale of her gifts to us are aware without a thought when we come into converse with a larger mind not of necessity a quicker one not peradventure a keener one possibly one that we could outdo in the game of chuckfarthing now the highest test we have this foreigner made me no bow at all though i expected a very grand one he took me quietly by both hands and said i am very glad to know you will you do me the favour of coming to my room the light of my eyes and of his as wellfor that could be seen in half a glancevanished with a smile and i followed my host through a narrow stonepassage to an ancient door studded with nails and iron fleursdelis that solid henchman was standing on guard whom i had seen before and known as stepan and inside lay that other mighty dog of whom i had seen but little as yet orla the son of kuban the room was not large but much loftier than the rooms of an old dwellinghouse would be and the walls were not papered nor painted but partly covered with bright hangings among which mirrored sconces were fixed with candles burning in some of them stepan soon set the rest alight so that the cheerful and pleasant aspect of the whole surprised me but against the walls were ranged on shelves betwixt the coloured hangings metallic objects of a hundred shapes tools castings appliances implements unknown to me and pieces of mechanism enough to puzzle my brother harold or any other great inventor but although they were not in my line at all i longed to know what they were meant for one of the great and peculiar features of the english nation my host said with a friendly smile and slow but clear pronunciation according to my experience is that they never show much curiosity about things that do not concern them a frenchman a german an italian would scarcely have cast his eyes round this room without eager desire arising in his bosom to know what the use of all these things may be even if he were too polite to enquire he would contrive to fill me with some conclusion of a duty to himthe duty of exposing to him my own affairs with you it is entirely different you do not even entertain a wish you are free from all little desires to learn what could not in any way be your own business all this he put not as a question but a statement of facts long proven whereas i was pricked internally with a very sharp curiosity could he be chaffing me i almost thought he must be so far were his words from describing my condition but on the other hand it would be too absurd for a foreigner to attempt to chaff an englishman in his own language and at the first conversation so i tried to look as if i deserved the whole of his compliments and more for i never like to think that a man is chaffing me not even one of my own nation and of proper rank to do it two bad turns of mind at once ensue contempt of myself for being slow and anger with him for discovering it that is all a trifle continued prince imar for so i felt inclined to call him now to console myself for having such a cut beyond mebut i did not bring you here for a trifle mr cranleigh you englishmen think very little of yourselves not in comparison with foreigners i mean for when it comes to that you have much selfrespect i mean with regard to your own bodies you detest what you call a fuss about them such as the gallant frenchman makes but as this has happened to you on our behalf you will not deny my right to learn what it is i am not a man of medicine but i have been present among many wounds will you do me the favour of allowing me to see what has happened it would not be right for any one to say that i had fallen under this mans influence no doubt i did that when i came to know him better but as for any abject prostration of will on the part of any healthy and sane man to another at first sight and through some occult power some odylic force and so onlet the people believe in that who can do or feel it nevertheless i showed him what had happened because that was common sense and he took it strictly as a thing of common sense you have done the very best that could be done he said after looking at it carefully it is a bad rent even worse than i expected and there will always be a long scar there but it will not lessen the power of the arm if there is no other mischief one thing is very important to know of the two dogs which inflicted that wound i told him that i could not pretend to say having been in the thick of it between the two and it had not occurred to me to think it out since then but remembering all i could of the ups and downs i thought it more likely that his dog had done it having been so much more up in the air while the bulldog fought low and was striving to grip upward probably kuban was making a rush at his foe while i tried to get him by the neck i hope with all my heart that it was so my host replied very cheerfully for then we need have no fear of any bad effects there is no venom in the teeth of our noble mountain breed but you will leave yourself to me this i did with the utmost confidence and while he was using various applications carefully and with extraordinary skill i ventured to ask in a careless toneof what mountain race is kuban is it possible that you do not know he is of the noblest race of dogs from the noblest mountains of the earth a wolfhound of the caucasus sur imars voice was very sad as he dropped for a moment the herb he was using and fixed his calm dark eyes on mine for the first time then i became aware that the general expression of his face was not that of a happy man but of one with a sorrow deeply stored though not always at interest in the soul he was very unlikely in his proud quiet way to enlarge upon that but of the common grief he spoke with less heat and much greater resignation than we feel about a railway overcharge i am banished from the land where i was born of that i have no complaint to make if i had been on the victorious side perhaps i should have done the like to those who fought against me perhaps i should have been obliged to do so whether it was just or otherwise that question cannot have any interest for you and i owe you an apology for speaking of it but i am so grateful to the hospitable land which receives me as if i belonged to it and allows me to go anywhere without a passport that i wish every englishman to understand that i shall never make mean of their benefit will you do me the favour of tasting this you have borne much pain without a sign it is kahiti the choice wine of the caucasus made within sight of kazbek where kazbek was or what kazbek might be i had not the least idea then though i came to know too well afterwards but in fear of hurting his feelings and perhaps his opinion of myself i looked as if i knew all about it and as he began to pour out a pinkish liquid from an old black bottle with a fine smile sparkling in his quiet eyes i could not help saying to myselfhe deserves to be an englishman he was worthy also of that crown of bliss and came uncommonly near to it when he praised his liquor as a good host does with geniality conquering modesty if you could only make this in england he exclaimed after drinking my health most kindly and i answered ah if we only could with a smack of my lips which meanti hope we never should is this scratch likely to require further treatment or can i manage it myself now my question recalled him from some delightful vision perhaps of grapes blushing on the slopes of some great mountain perhaps of the sun making a sonnet of beauty perhaps of his own honeymoon among them with the lovely mother of dariel it was rude of me to disturb him but why if he wanted true politeness why not send for a certain nymph to taste her native helicon orla come and show your teeth he said now mr cranleigh his teeth are the very similarity of his fathers that is the one that inflicted the wound the right canine quite different would have been that of the bulldog you need have no alarm shall i give you awhat call you itwritten testimony to set your family at ease what have you never told them ah but you take things with composure it is therefore all the more necessary for me to administer the proper measures i shall require to see you in three days from this and then at least once a week for the following two months oh what a chance what a glorious chance of improving my acquaintance with dariel of course i could not expect to meet her every time still now and thenand as for that big stepan i warrant he knows what a crownpiece is as well as little allai with admirable selfdenial i contended that such visits never could be needful and that it was out of the question to spare so much time etc etc but the great caucasian stopped all that by declaring that unless i trusted him entirely and obeyed him implicitly he should consider it his duty to inform my friends that they might place me under strict medical treatment thereupon what could i do but consent to everything he required till with many directions as to my own conduct he led me as far as the door of little guinib as he playfully called his snug retreat and showed me before closing it behind me how to obtain entrance at any time by pressing my hand against an upper panel and he gave me leave to do so as he said goodnight no stranger would dare to enter thus with kuban and orla loose inside but you have made them both your faithful slaves goodnight and the lord be with you now though a briton may be and generally is a very looseseated christian only gripping on his steed when he is being taught to ride or when he has to turn him into pegasus he is able to stand up in his stirrups high enough to look down upon every other pilgrim when the prince opened that bottle of wine i said in my heart hurrah this great father of dariel cannot be a thoroughgoing islamite and now when he committed me to the lord instead of any antibritish allah a strong warmth of the true faithwhich had been languishing until i should know what dariels wasset me quite firmly on my legs again thus i went upon my way rejoicing and the beautiful ideas that flowed into my mind were such as come to no man except when deep in love and such as no man out of it deserves or cares to hear of chapter xii in the background surely as the world of night goes round with clusters of stars thronging after one another and loose wafts of vapour ever ready to flout them and the spirit of dreams flitting over us without any guidance of mind or matter so surely will the dawn of our own little days bring new things to us which we cannot understand in the clearest light of our wits beneath the sun and of this i must give an instance now sorry as i am to do it my sister grace the very sweetest girl always excepting one of course that ever tied a hatstring what did she do but take a little touch of cupid without knowing anything about it she denied it strongly and hotly even as a swiss hotelkeeper abjures scarlet fever but i insisted the more upon it because it was quite picturesque to see grace cranleigh in a passion i found it worth while to go as near the brink of a downright lie as a truthful man can step without falling over in order to rouse and work up this dear girl till she actually longed to stamp her feet there was a vivid elementthe father calls it gold and the brother calls it carrotsin her most abundant locks and if you could only hit upon a gentle strain of chaff which must have a little grain left in it and pour it upon her with due gravity she became a charming sight to a philosopher her affection was so deep and her character so placid that a sharp word or two or a knowing little sneer produced nothing better than a look of wonder or sometimes a smile that abased us she made no pretence to any varied knowledge or power to settle moot questionsthough she would have known where daghestan wasand as for contradiction her tongue was never made for it though her mind must have whispered to her often enough that brother georges words outran his wits in spite of all this it was possible to put her in a very noble passion when one had the time to spare and it certainly was worth while for the beauty of the sight as well as for increase of perception concerning the turns of the feminine mind the first sign of success for the most part was a deepening of the delicate and limpid tint that flitted on the soft curves of cheek and then if one went on with calm aggravation that terrible portent lightning in the blue sky of the eyes and a seam as of the finest needlework of an angel who hems her own handkerchief just perceptible and no more in the white simplicity of forehead and after that if you had the heart to go on no tears none of that opening of the dikes which the low country quenches an invasion with but a genuine burst of righteous wrathqueenly figure and all that sort of thing such as britannia alone can achieve when unfeeling nations have poked fun at her too long filled with a spirit of discontent and a longing to know how girls behave when they are beginning to think about somebodyfor dariel must be a girl as well as an archfemaleangeli contrived to fetch grace to a prime state of wrath the very first morning after her return from london and i assure you that i learned a lot of things by that which served me a good turn in my own case a woman might call this a selfish proceeding but what is love except self flown skyward and asking its way among the radiance of heaven this is a nice trick of yours i said with a careless air and an elderly smile to go waltzing about in hot weather with young earls as if you thought nothing of your brother hard at work i have not the least idea what you mean brother george i am thinking of you george wherever i may be i never see anybody to compare with you thousands of much better fellows everywhere true enough that was although i did not mean it brilliant young men in gorgeous apparel i am not fit to hold a candle for them then hold it for yourself george as you have the right to do and for all of us as well for if ever there was an industrious simple unselfish fellow i never like to hear about that as you know the little i can do is altogether useless i only want to hear about the romantic young earls young earls exclaimed grace with an innocence so pure that it required a little mantle on her cheeks i fear that you have not been looked after properly while i have been away dear george or else you have overexerted yourself coming home also so late at night several times they tell me continuing your labours for our benefit nobody seems to know exactly where such frightful work makes you quite red in the face if that were true all that i can say is that the idea of being brought to book by a young girl like this was enough to annoy the most superior brother but to let her see that was beneath me i have thriven very tidily while you have been away my buttons never come off when i sew them on myself but you know well enough what i mean about young earls and for you to prevaricate is quite a new thing what i mean is about that young milksop of a fellow who writes verses makes sonnets stuff he calls poemsfytte and fytte enough to give you fifty fits lord honeysomething what the deuce is his name if you mean the earl of melladew the only thing i regret dear george is that you have not a particle of his fine imagination not that you need write poems george that of course would be wholly beyond you but that the gift of those higher faculties those sensitive feelings if that is the right name makes a man so much larger in his views so very superior to coarse language so capable of perceiving that the universe does not consist of men alone sensitive feelings i should rather think so he has got them and no mistake my dear girl why the year we licked eton at lords i happened just to graze him on the funnybone with a mere lob nothing of a whack at all for a decent fellow and what did he do but throw down his bat and roll about as if he was murdered what could ever be the good of such a mollycoddle it comes to this then because you hurt him sadly when he was a boy you are inclined to look down upon him for life nice masculine logic and you nearly broke his arm i daresay scarcely took the bark off but ill break something else if i catch him piping loveditties down here i should have hoped that you would have shown a little more selfrespect well i dont quite understand what my crime is george and to fly into a passion with anybody who dares so much as to look at me that is all lord melladew has done and even that seemed too much for his courage i believe if he had to say boh to a goose he would call for pen and paper and write it down but your anxiety about me is quite a new thing is there any favoured candidate of yours down here how sharp girls are this was too bad of her when i was doing my utmost for her good the twinkle in her eyes was enough to show that she suspected something and if she found it out all up thenceforth with the whole of my scheme for her benefit yes to be sure there is i answered in some haste for if i had said no it would have been untrue for i thought more highly every day of jackson stoneman whereas lord melladew might be soon pulled down as we were and through the same ruinous policy where will you find a nicer fellow or one more highly esteemed at any rate by himself than my old friend tom erricker and when the tinning business comes to you harold will invent you a new process every day until we are enabled to buy back all our land though that would be a foolish thing to do unless he could find some new crop to put upon it i cannot see why you think so little of tom erricker do you think much of him george in earnest is he a man to lead ones life would you like to see your favourite sister the wife of a man she could turn round her finger confound it there is no such thing as pleasing you i spoke with a sense of what was due to myself having made the great mistake of reasoning all of you girls begin to talk as if you were to rule the universe no man is good enough for you unless he is a perfect wonder of intellect and then if you condescend to accept him his mind is to be in perfect servitude to yoursyours that are occupied nine minutes out of ten with considerations of the lookingglass can you say that of me george now with your love of truth can you find it in your conscience to say such a thing of me well perhaps not and for excellent reason you have no need to make a study of it whatever you do or whatever you wear it makes no difference for you are always what what am i come tell me the worst while you are so put out with me what are you going to call me now the sweetest and the best girl in the world i should not have put it quite so strongly except for the way she was looking at me but it was too late to qualify my words before i could think again grace was in my arms and her hair in a golden shower falling on my breast after all this is the best way to reason she said with a smile that contained a world of logic and i only answered at any rate for women because it is not for them to have the last word always however i had not changed my opinions and did not mean to change them for jackson stoneman whom i had at first repulsed and kept at a very stiff arms length was beginning to grow upon meas people saynot through any affection for his money so far from that indeed that the true reason was i could think of him now without thinking of his money when we first know a man of great wealth especially if we happen to be very short of cash ourselves we are apt to feel a certain shyness and desire to keep away from him not from any dislike of his money or sense of injustice at his owning such a pile but rather through uneasiness about ourselves and want of perfect certainty in the bottom of our hearts that we may not trylike a man who steals his gasto tap the main chance behind the meter and fetch a little into our own parlour on the sly and even if our conscience is too brave to shrink from that we know that if we walk too much in amity with this man of gold he will want or at least he ought to want to pay the piper who besets every path of every kind in england whereas it hurts our dignity to be paid for except by our uncles or the government but supposing jackson were to become a member of our family what could be more inspiring and graceful as well as delightful for him than the privilege which must fall to his share of endeavouring to please his relatives and looking at the matter from a point of view even more exalted i began to perceive the course of duty very clearly staked out for me and the conversation above recorded made it doubly manifest my sister had neither admitted nor denied that this young melladew had been attracted by her while she was staying at her sisters house she had spoken of his courage with some contempt and any perception of such a defect would be fatal to his chances with nine girls out of ten but grace had her own little pet ideas and to shoot with swanshot at a swarm of gnats is better worth the cost than to reason with such girls they are above reason and theres an end of it to pass from all this to the things one can see it was either that very same day or the next that i came away out of the harvestfield just for a morsel to eat and a pipe in a snug place under the fringe of a wood where a very small brook fit only for minnows and grigs made a lot of loops and tinkles two or three times i had been there before and in fact was getting fond of it because i believed or as good as believed without knowing every twist of it that this little water in its own modest way never left off running until it reached the pebblebourne and after that it must have gone a little faster till it came to the place where dariel lived possibly if i threw in a pint bottle after scraping off the red pyramid who could say that it might not land at the very feet to which all the world they ever trod upon must bow encouraging these profound reflections i sat upon the bank and pulled out my pocketknife being a little sharpset for the moment and aware of some thrills in a quarter near the heart there was very little more to be done that afternoon the week having ripened into saturday when no man of any selfrespect does more than congratulate himself upon his industry and on this point few have a stronger sense of duty than the cultivator of the soil of surrey no matter what the weather is or how important the job in hand may be his employer may repose the purest confidence in him that he will make off with holy zeal right early on a saturday therefore when i heard a step behind me i knew that it could be none of our enlightened operatives not even bob slemmick would pull his coat off at that hour though he would sometimes stop long enough to put away his tools correct was my reasoning and with pleasure i beheld the active figure and expressive countenance of mr jackson stoneman not that every one would like this man or care to have very much to do with him universal benevolence was not by any means the polestar of his existence neither was it his chief employment to saunter amicably in the milky way butter for his bread and that the very best butter had probably been the main quest of his life until his good stars brought him down into our county and toward our grace he was even beginning to relax his mind while he braced up his body already and we thought that a year or two of our fine air would bring a lot of hard gold out of him glad to see you again somebody told us that you were off for the mediterranean in this careless manner did i shake hands with this cubit and carat colossus of gold there is humbug in all of useven in me well i was thinking of it he replied as he sat down beside me and stretched his long legs trousered a thousand times better than mine though i knew which had most inside the cloth but after all whats the good of foreign parts knowing but little about them as yet and believing that he might traverse many thousand leagues without finding anything to come up to surrey i answered very simply you are quite right there but isnt it disgusting that in your native land you can never make anything go to your liking this was very difficult for me to answer i could not get along for a thousand wicked reasonsfreetrade democracy adulteration sewagebutter footandmouth complaint living wage for men who have no life and all the other wrong end of the stick we get what i mean has nothing to do with your ideas he continued as if all my ideas must be wrong just when i was hoping that he began to see the right for constitutional questions i dont care twopence it has become a race of roguery between both sides dont look savage george you know it as well as i do your party would do anything to get into power again when the bone is in their own mouths will they even try to crack it but i have not come to talk all that stuff i am under your directions in a matter nearer home are you going to play fast and loose with me while your sister is being truckled away to an idiot of an earl if my mind had not been very equable and just i must have had a quarrel with him over this and if he had looked at me with any defiancebut his gaze was very sorrowful as if all his hopes were blasted jackson i answered in a rather solemn voice having sense of my own tribulation and i saw that he liked me to address him thus though the name is not purely romantic you are not a bit worse off than any other fellow do you suppose that nobody has ever been in love before you look at things from such a narrow point of view consider how much worse it must be for a woman well i wish it was his reply upset my arguments i found it very difficult to rearrange them on that basis so far as that goes i can get on well enough he proceeded as i looked at him sensibly i shall feel it for years no doubt but stillbut still the blackness and the bitterness of it is this that such a girl such a girl as never before trod the face of the earth or inhaled the light of the sun dont get mixed i implored but he regarded me with scornshould be sold i say sold like a lamb in the market to an idiot just because he has a title you will be sorry when you have offended me i spoke with extraordinary selfcontrol taking a side glance at my own case for i dont come round in a hurry i can tell you but you really dont know what you are talking of my father and mother have heard of no proposal neither have i and as for grace herself she despises that milksop as heartily as i do george cranleigh i have not known you long but this i can say without hesitation and i should like to see any man deny it you are the very noblest fellow that ever trod the face of the earth or inhaled the light of the sun and why because i happen to agree with you ah jackson allow me to improve the moment is there any human praise that does not flow from the like source from the sense that the other fellow thinks as we do and the subtle flattery of our own wisdom and concurrence with our wishes shut up he cried with a smile which must have procured him much lucrative business in the city what has farmer jarge to do with moralising but are you quite sure of what you saidthat she despises him heartily unless anybody runs him down she never has a good word to say for him he will be here upon some pretext or another but you need have no fear i see exactly how to treat the caseto praise him to the nines and exalt him as the paragon of all manliness and selfdenial and every tiptop element and then to let her observe him closely to see if he comes up to that markand behold she finds him a selfish little funk that is the true policy with women jackson stoneman the stockbroker looked at me with puzzle in his eyes which were ever so much keener than mine and had a gift of creating a gable over them like a pair of dormerwindows with the frames painted black bless my soul if you wouldnt do up our way he said and what higher praise could be given to a man friend george you are a thousand times sharper than i thought but all i wish is fair play and no favour except of course favour in a certain pair of eyes you shall have it my dear fellow you shall have it if only you will keep yourself in the background and do the most benevolent things you can think of without letting anybody know it your money is the main point against you with her could you manage anyhow to be bankrupt that comes to most of us in the end he replied with a sigh which i did not like at all but hoped that it was rather of the heart than pocket if that were so george would you still take my part not unless my sister were really committed but if she had set her heart upon you stoneman your wealth or your poverty would make no difference to me and i am sure that it would make none to her what more could a man wish and i am sure you mean it come what will i will play my game in an open and straightforward way we must never try any tricks with women george bless them they know us better than we know ourselves perhaps because they pay so much more attention to the subject chapter xiii smiles and tears if any one has followed my little adventures only half as carefully as i have tried to tell them he will see that the time had now come and gone for my second visit to st winifreds otherwise little guinib and i would have set forth what happened then if it had been worth mentioning but except for the medical treatment received i might just as well have stayed away for i never got a glimpse of dariel and her father was in such a sad state of mind that he scarcely cared to speak at all being a most kind and courteous gentleman he begged me to make due allowance for him for this was the anniversary of the most unhappy day of his life and in truth it would have been better for him if he had died before he saw that day one of the worst things of being a gentleman or of having highculture like miss ticknor is that you must not ask questions or even hint at your desire to know more but sit upon the edge of curiosity in silence although it may be cutting you like hoopiron on the toprail and this feeling was not by any means allayed when i saw the great henchman stepan in the court hanging his head and without his red cross and when with the tender of five shillings worth of sympathy i ventured to ask him to explain his woe his only answer wasme no can but when another week had passed and my next visit became due the hills and the valley and everything else had put on a different complexion it was not like a sunset when the year is growing old but as lively and lovely as a morning of the may when all the earth is clad in fresh apparel and all the air is full of smiling glances at it there came to my perception such a bright wink from the west and so many touches on the high ground and the low of the encouragement of heaven to whatsoever thing looks up at it that in my heart there must have been a sense it had no words fora forecast of its own perhaps that it was going to be pleased far beyond the pleasure of the eyes and mind and in that prophecy it hit the mark for who should meet me at a winding of the path but dariel herself no other dariel my darling as yet she knew notand i shivered with the thought that she might never care to knowin what lowly but holy shrine she was for ever paramount but a little blush such as a white rose might feel at the mark h c in an exhibition answered my admiring gaze and then i was nowhere in the splendour of her eyesnowhere except for being altogether there but with no such disturbance was her mind astray alas it was all there as sharp as the wits of the last man who wanted to sell me a horse and she did not want to sell me anything only to keep her precious value to herself what a shame it is to leave things so that a poor fellow never knows how to begin but that was not her meaning in all her lovely life she never meant anything that was not kind i am not quite assured she began after waiting for me to speakas if i could with the tongue in such a turbulence of eyes and heartit is beyond my knowledge of english society mr cranlee to be confident that i am taking the correct step in advancing in this manner to declare to you the things that have come into my thoughts but if i have done wrong you will pardon me i hope because i am so anxious about very dismal things i assure you i answered with a flourish of my hat which i had been practising upon the road that it is of the very best english society if we dared we should insist upon it upon every occasion mademoiselle you must not call me that sir i am not of the french i prefer the english nation very greatly there has only been one name given to me by my father and that is dariel it is the sweetest name in all the world oh dariel am i to call you dariel if it is agreeable to you mr cranlee it will be also agreeable to me for why should you not pronounce me the same as stepan does and allaioh that was a cruel fall for me although i have passed most of my life in england and some of it even in london i have not departed from the customs of my country which are simple very simple see here is kuban and orla too will you not make reply to them how could i make reply to dogs with dariels eyes upon me many fellows would have been glad to kick kuban and his son orla to teach them better than to jump around emotions so far above them but not i or at any rate not for more than half a moment so sweetly was my spirit raised that i never lifted either foot some of dariels gentle nature came to strike the balance for i may have been a little short of that good dogs noble dogs what a pattern to us i had a very choice pair of trousers on worthy of tom errickerif his had been ever bashfuland in another minute there scarcely would have been enough of them left to plough in but the joy of my heartas i was beginning already to myself to call herperceived at a glance the right thing to do and her smile and blush played into one another as the rising sun colours the veil he weaves if mr cranlee will follow me a step or two i will show him a place where the dogs dare not to come follow thee follow thee wha wud na follow thee came into my head with a worthier sequence than ever was vouchsafed to highlanders where the dogs dare not comei kept saying to myself instead of looking to the right or left the music of her voice seemed to linger in those words though they have not even a fine english sound let alone italian but my mind was so far out of call that it went with them into a goodly parable all men are dogs in comparison with her let none of them come near where ever it may be except the one dog that is blest beyond all others are you a christian the question came so suddenly that it sounded like a mild rebukebut no it was not meant so the maiden turned towards me at a little wicketgate and her face expressed some doubt about letting me come in yes i am a christian i answered pretty firmly and then began to trim a littlenot a very hot one i should say not at all bigoted i mean not one of those who think that every other person is a heathen i had made a mull of it for the first time i beheld a smile of some contempt upon the gentle face and i resolved to be of the strictest orthodoxy evermore feeble religious views did not suit her christian i should think so i proceeded with high courage there is scarcely a churchtower for ten miles round that has not been built by my ancestors possibly this assertion needed not only a grain but a block of salt but dariel was of good strong faith without which a woman deserves only to be a man she opened the gate and let me in so beautifully that i was quite afraid you must not be frightened she said with a very fine rally of herself to encourage mine it is the house of the lord and you have come into it with your hat on but you did not know because there is no roof no roof and no walls and no anything left except the sweet presence of this young maid i took off my hat and tried to think of the creed and the catechism and my many pious ancestors if there had been any and i almost tumbled over a great pile of ruin stones we will not go in there becausebecause we are not thinking of it properly she pointed as she spoke to an inner circle of ruins with some very fine blackberries just showing colour and suddenly i knew it as the sanctuary in which i had first descried her kneeling figure but here we may sit down withoutwithoutit is a long word mr cranlee i cannot quite recall it desecration i suggested and she looked at me with doubt as if the word had made the thing but you do not think it will be that if i speak of my dear father here i was very near telling her that we think nothing of such old monkish ruins except to eat our chickenpie and drink our bottled beer in their most holy places but why should i shock her feelings so little knows the ordinary english girl that when she displays her want of reverence for the things above her she is doing all she can to kill that feeling towards herself which is one of her choicest gifts dariel you may be quite sure of this i replied after taking my seat upon a stone over against the one she had chosen but lower so that i could look up at her a place of holy memories like this is the very spot especially fitted forfor consideration of your dear father some of my ancestors no doubt were the founders of this ancient chapel so that i speak with some authority upon a point of that sort all content has a murmur in it according to the laws of earth and within a few yards of my joy the brook with perpetual change of tone and rise and fall of liquid tune was making as sweet a melody as a man can stop to hearken but the brook might have ceased its noise for shame at the music of my dariels voice she gave me a timid glance at first not for any care of me but doubt of unlocking of her heart and then the power of a higher love swept away all sense of self my father as you must have learned already is one of the greatest men that have ever lived there are many great men in this country also in their way which is very good but they do not appear to cast away all regard for their own interests in such a degree as my father does and although they are very high christians they stop or at least they appear to stop short of their doctrines when the fear arises of not providing for themselves they call it a question of the public good and they are afraid of losing commerce but my father is not of that character the thing that is recommended to him by religion is the thing he does and trade is not superior to gods will please to take notice of this mr cranlee because it makes him difficult to be persuaded and now he has told me quite lately a thing which if he adheres to it as he always does will take him away will extinguish and altogether terminate him she turned her head aside that i might not see the tears that were springing upon either cheek and a cloud of very filmy lace from the strange octagonal cap she wore mingled with the dark shower of her hair oh no oh no that shall never be i answered as if i were master of the world oh dariel dont let your beautiful eyes it is of my father and not of myself we are speaking mr cranlee and you are surprised what reason i can have forfor inviting you to give opinion but it is not your opinion for which i make petition or not the opinion only but the assistance of kind action from you if you can indeed be persuaded and before that can be accomplished i must expand to you things that you may not have been informed concerning my father you know do you not nothing or very little except what you yourself have told me i know all about daghestan of courseso i did by this time or at least all that was in the cyclopaediaand that your father has been a very great man there and i can see that he has been accustomed to authority and probably to wars and that he is worshipped by his retainers and that he has some especial purpose here and prefers a private life but is kind enough to give me admission because of my accident and after that let me see what else do i know why nothing at all except that he has wonderful taste and sense of order and the loveliest daudoorpainting i ever beheld and after that doorpainting of great loveliness i do not remember to have seen that my father has never concealed from mei will ask him doornailing is what i should have said of course fleur de lis flourishes classic patterns but what is all that in comparison with him a man of majestic appearance and a smilehave you ever beheld such a smile never cried dariel with great delight but i expected not that you would already be captured with that demonstrance it shows how good he was to be pleased with you for he is not taken in with every one but now please to listen while i tell you so far as my acquaintance of your language goes with me what the condition is of circumstances tending about my father only i know not the half of it myself for he fears to make me so solicitous and it would not be just for me to ask questions of people of the lower rank in whom he has placed confidence though stepan could tell me many things if he thought proper and i have proved to him that it is his duty my father is the prince as they call it in most countries though he never takes it to himself of the highest and noblest and most ancient of the tribes belonging to the lesghian race the great warrior shamyl who contended so long against all the armies of russia was of the lower the moslem division of the ancient lesghian race which is of the first origin of mankind and has kept itself lofty as the mountains but when all the other tribes fell away with treachery and jealousy and bribery and cowardice and shamyl himself was betrayed in his stronghold my father who had been called to take the place of his father who died in battle at the head of the christian and higher division of the race could not prolong the war not that he was vanquished that could never happen to him but because all the mohammedans who had made what they call a holy war of it would not go on under the command of a christian and they showed themselves so treacherous that they betrayed him for money no doubt of which they were too loving into the hands of the russian general every one expected that he would be destroyed on account of the bitterness between them and the many times when he had been victorious but the russian commander was much pleased with him from the nobility of his manners and treated him very gently and finding that he was a christian and descended from english crusaders according to the red cross which we always wear as the badge of our lineage against the moslem tribes he obtained permission from moscow to release him upon very generous conditions his great extent of property was not taken from him as was done to most of the other chiefs who had fought so long against russia but was placed in the hands of a kinsman as his steward and he was only banished for fourteen years until there should be no chance of any further war my father made the best of all these things he collected all the relics of his patrimony and travelled to many other lands and then settled in england having learned while a boy in the city of languages where he was educated to speak the english language as well as many others german french italian russian arabic almost every tongue for which he has a talent not granted to his daughter but above all he loves his own lesghian words and the rest of his life if he ever goes home will be spent for the education of the lesghian people he will never conspire against russia any more he says that the tribes of the caucasus are made up of every race under the sun are always in conflict with one another and speak i forget how many languages and have i forget how many forms of religion whenever they have any religion at all but though he sees all these things and is of the largest mind ever vouchsafed to a man he is filled in his heart with perpetual longing to be among the mountains of his early days and to finish all his wanderings in his first home the fourteen years of his exile will expire very soon and then what a joy there would be for him i also long more than it is possible to explain to see the most noble land the lord has ever made though i only behold it in dreams sometimes according to his description for although i was born in the noblest part under the shadow of kazbek and in the most magnificent pass of the earth from which my name is taken i was but a babe when my father took me with him if it must be so if you must leave england i asked with a very grim smile for what on earth would become of me without her and i did not even belong to the alpine club why should you be so unhappy about it i fear there is no one in this country whom it would pain you much to leave i fear that you find all english people rather dull and cold and uninteresting and you will be too glad to be quit of them i hear that they are cold but i do not perceive it her glance as she said this was beyond interpretation could it mean any cruel check to me they are the first nation of all mankind my father has declared to me many times but of such matters i have not yet arrived to think the thing that makes me full of fear about going from this safe land is that though the people may be dull and cold as you do describe them among them there is law and justice and the wicked men are hanged whenever they require it but alas my father says that among his noble people no one can be sure of that dariel i exclaimed with amazement having made up my mind that her nature was all softness and all sweetness surely you would never wish to be sure of anybody being hanged i would never go to see it as the people do in england and i am not at all convinced that it ought to be done here but in lands where the law of mens lives is revenge even upon those of their own family what else is there to prevent them from committing murder and that which terrifies me from all pleasure of seeing the land of my birth consists of that our family the highest of the lesghian race have not that most wicked rule of bloodrevenge but all the other tribes around them have and i am in the most dreadful alarm that my father has done something to make him subject to that barbarous abominable horribleoh what shall i do what shall i do once more i made offer to administer to her the kindest and softest consolation but she turned away sobbing yet concealing it as if it could be no concern of mine and this made me feeli should be sorry to say how i believe that there is a bit of sulkiness in love even with a man and perhaps a large lump in a woman because they are obliged to let it grow at anyrate i held my tongue if her ladyship did not think me worthy of her confidence after all i felt perhaps there was somebody else who deserved it i knocked my stick against my trousers and it almost seemed to me as if i should like to whistle if i mattered so little to the wind and sky you are offended you are angry with me cried dariel turning round as if she were the larger part of me recoiling upon all the littleness but i cannot tell you what i do not know everything is so dark to me now whether it was mean of me or noble depends upon the right view of the case but before she could repent of being kind i got hold of her hand and kissed it so as to assure her of my forgiveness then the loveliest colour ever seen on earth arose in her face and in her eyes there was the sweetest light just for a moment and then she trembled and i was afraid of myself by mutual accord we dropped that point but i knew that she felt for the first time in her heart that the whole of mine belonged to it crafty love and maiden fear combined to let that bide a while i fear that it is too selfish of me and too great trespass upon your goodwill she said without looking at me again if i ask you to help me in this matter but you do admire my father i think nobody can meet him without that he is the noblest and the grandest man i have ever had the honour of speaking to i wish that i could only do something for him there can be no trespass on my goodwill only tell me plainly this is all i know and i dare not ask more for it is not considered good to tell me there is one day in the year of great sorrow and bitterness through something that has happened in my fathers life it is something that he himself has done though no one could believe that he would ever commit a sin last year and every year before that until now i was away and saw nothing of it being under education with good ladies of great learning but now that is finished and it was not possible for the tribulation to be concealed from me long before that i had known there was something of very great misfortune and calamity to us but i have never been permitted to hear more about it and how can i learn of whom can i enquire stepan knows i am almost sure of that and perhaps baboushka doesbut as for telling meit appears that with our people the young maidens are kept out of reach of all knowledge but i have been brought up in england and it is not curiosity mr cranlee you must not be in such error as to think that i have curiosity it is anxiety and love of my dear father which any one of any age or nation has a right to and if he is to go back into that land of danger without my knowing what i have to dread or what to save him from how can i be of any use he had better have no daughter shall i go and ask him all about it he may think what he likes of me if it will be of any good to you no that is not exactly what i mean what i mean is that i will take any row upon myself i can scarcely understand what the english is of that oh dariel can even you tell fibs but if it is anything mr cranlee of a proposal unpleasant to you and offering unkindness to my father it is the very last thing i would desire you to do and what would become of you when he regarded you as he has the power of doing to thoseto thosewho show him what you call impertinence what i was thinking of was quite different to that and though it would give some trouble which i have no right to seek from you there could not be anything unbecoming in it i thought of it last night when i was in such sorrow that i could not sleep with any happiness my father has one great friend in london a gentleman known to him in our native land and who was a great part of his coming to this country he understands everything of our situation here and i have seen him several times my father has told me to make application to him if anything should arise beyond his own assistance the gentleman is not of our own rank of life because he is of commerce which we do not understand nevertheless he is very wealthy and nothing can be more respected than that point in england he is now entitled signor nicolo because it is better among the nations with whom he has dealings with the precious stones but by birth and of language and the ways of thinking he has always been an englishman of the name of nickols and he is of an integrity beyond all common foreign names he resides in the best part of london mentioned by your great shakespeare and still called hatton garden and you would like me to go and see him i enquired with the greatest alacrity perceiving a good chance now of discovering many things still mysterious dariel it shall be done tomorrow dont talk of trouble i beseech you it is not only that she answered already assuming her right to my services which women are never very slow to do but also the difficulty that signor nicolo will have to perceive in what authority you come it is not as if you bore any message or power of enquiry from my father for he would not wish at all that i should so employ myself and if you do this for me mr cranlee you must bear in mind that my dear father will perhaps be much displeased that it has been done and then although he is so just and righteous he will inflict the whole of the blame upon you because he can never find any fault with me and then perhaps you would never come here any more oh that wouldnt do at all i exclaimed hoping that i saw a little sadness in her eyes i shall put old nickols under a frightful pledge penalty of his very biggest diamond never to let that cat out of the bag he is not old nickols he is quite a young man very clever and very agreeable and he has promised to do anything in the world for me signor nicolo is a gentleman you would be much delighted to converse with now you must know much better than that thought i the more delightful he is the more hateful to me however she did not seem to catch that clue but went on as unconscious as the wire in the air is of its own significance the last time he was here i told him of my ancient ruby cross the one which i wear most frequently when i come to pray for my father here it has been preserved in our family from the period of the crusades when the noble prisoners escaping to our mountains converted our tribe from idolatry and married the fairest of the maidens signor nicolo desires much to see it and i will lend it to you mr cranlee and then he will know that you have a right to ask concerning the questions of my father and the great question that you go to enquire of is this whether he can go back to the land belonging to him without the greatest peril to his own dear life it is my determination i replied with some infection of her freely imported english so sweet was the voice conveying it not to leave this matter now until i have got to the bottom of it is there any other prince or jeweller or crusader whose ins and outs i ought to know before i can deal with him properly my wrath grew as its tongue rolled on and what tongue but our own can tell it then there is another gentleman who has expressed a desire for a knowledge of our position here and a little interview with me she spoke as if she lived without any dogs or walls or river and i resolved at once to make kuban and orla as savage as grab himself was but him i have not as yet beheld at all and he is a prince as you suppose so well possessed of great power already even while he is so young because of his courage and noble appearance and desire to die for his country he is a cousin of mine and i have heardbut my father is most righteous in whatever he proposes she dropped her beautiful eyes with a blush and it was lucky that she did not see me grind my teeth for verily i must have lookedhowever i controlled myself whats the fellows name was the only thing i said prince hafer the chief of the ossets she answered looking with great surprise at me ossets if i dont make bones of him i muttered but pardon me can i have the cross at once i cannot go to see your dear father tonight important businessi had quite forgotten but yours shall be the first attended to oh dariel dariel i must be off before i say anything to vex you send allai tomorrow night and you shall hear of that young nickols probably she thought i was mad and she was not far wrong if she did so she gave me the cross to get rid of me perhaps and i snatched her hand and kissed it and was out of sight in no time chapter xiv the ruby cross in all matters of love there is a vast amount of luck that there is of course in all human affairs as far as we can interpret them but what i mean is a larger element of luck than in any of our other miseries unless it be the still finer conflict and far more enduring one for money any one might have concluded as i did that it was all up now with every little hope i might have nursed of winning the favour of dariel yielding to a sudden rush of jealousy i had quitted her hastily and almost rudely and broken my appointment with her father it was true that her calmness and perfect indifference were enough to provoke a saintif he ever falls in love but how could she know that though certainly she ought to know it if she ever thought of me in at all the proper vein what a fool i am it will serve me quite right if she never even condescends to glance at me again i thought as i wandered about in the dark after going home at a great pace upon the wings of rage and just as i was getting on so nicely too what is the use of my going to see that nickols a rogue no doubt almost sure to be a rogue for sticking a foreign tail on to his name no doubt he cheats them of their diamonds and rubies that is why he wants to see this cross worth a lot of money i dare say what an idiot i must be to even think of that when i remember where it has been so often oh dariel dariel when i first saw your beautiful enchanting ravishing idolatrousidolised i mean confound it allwho could have imagined that i should ever hold this badge of your faiththis symbol of your own highminded loftysouled archetypepish there is no word to come near her but oh shall i never come near her again to cut short all discussion i found myself in a frightful state both of head and of heart and ready to do anything to bring matters to the crisis accordingly i said to slemmick who was in his right mind now just look after things today im obliged to go to london he grinned and i knew that he would be a tiger to any man lying down under a rick as yet my conceptions about jewellers diamondmerchants and the like were little more than a confusion of the arabian nights and bond street so that it seemed to be quite a mistake when the policeman in a little dingy street pointed out a very commonlooking house as the abode of signor nicolo there was nothing to show that it contained as much as a paste shoebuckle or a coral pin and it struck me that if diamonds were tested there the light must proceed from the jewel itself but perhaps it would be lighted up by kohinoors stars of the south and other glorious luminaries not only the house but the inhabitants thereof appeared to be sadly in need of lighting up how many times i rang or at any rate pulled the long handle i will not pretend to say but at last an old woman not at all too clean showed me into a small square room remarkable for nothing except that one end appeared to consist of polished steel my card was taken upstairs and presently signor nicolo himself appeared upon important business he said ah yes mr george cranleigh ah yes ah yes he was rather a handsome little man about forty years old with dark eyes and complexion wearing a black velvet blouse gathered in with a belt and a red scarf under it apparently an englishman who desired to pass as a foreigner and having a considerable share of jewish blood might do so without much trouble whether his perpetual ah yeswhich i shall not repeat half as much as he didhad first been assumed in imitation of some foreigner or had struck root into his tongue as you know dont you see and other little expletives are wont it is beyond my power to say and this you have brought me ah yes ah yes he proceeded when i had explained my purpose to certify that the prince desires me to impart to you all my knowledge concerning him the rubies are very fine and the trinket very ancient they would not be set in silver nowadays but i do not perceive in them mr cranleigh you will excuse my saying so any message from the prince to that effect you mistake me signor i answered with some warmth for the mans affectation annoyed me and i longed to call him jemmy nickols as his godfathers and godmothers meant him to be called i said nothing about sur imar who makes no pretence to be called a princethat was a little rap at jemmyit is his daughter who has sent me to you because she is most anxious and miserable about her father what she wants to know is thiscan he return to his native land from which he has been so long banished without incurring very great danger you can tell me or not just as you please the question lies between you and her she has always believed you to be her true friend she cannot come to see you herself of course and her father might be angry if she tried to do so and he would know your hand if you wrote to her it appears to me that she has a right to ask ah yes she has a right to ask and more than that it is her place to ask that she may know how to act about it on the other hand the point for me ishave i any right to tell i began to respect the man more as i perceived that he really wished to do what was right but scarcely saw the way to it through some little complication signor i am not in any hurry i observed ah you cannot understand he said as if i had no power even if i had a right to put my tongue in it is no reproach to you but a young man who has never been among such things ought to thank his good stars and keep out of them you english are so stiff you can allow for no ideas you think that all the world must have the same right and wrong as you have now signor nicolo i replied with admirable selfcontrol for i began to know all about him now by the lights that break in as we go on in the dark if ever there was an englishman you are one he looked at me steadily with eyes almost too dark for a purebred englishman and then seeing that i meant to make him proud he became proud as he ought to be ah yes he said first from the force of habit and then he went on as became his birthright sir i am an englishman and as proud of it as you are but we are not popular among the smaller nations because they have a lower standard we give them everything in the way of trade and they have not the calibre yet to enter into it and i am very much afraid that they wont have that till they have taken every farthing out of us in spite of all lessons we carry on still as if all the world were full of our own ideas and what comes of that they believe through thick and thin that our only ambition is to rob them my business lies chiefly on the continent and therefore i am signor nicolo feeling the truth of this sad state of things i took the hand he offered me it was not his fault but that of our blind rulers that to do any business he must be of foreign blood still it was a new light shed upon me for hitherto my belief had been that people unlucky enough to have to live upon the land had to bear the brunt of that british suicide endowed with the catchpenny name freetrade now i am in this difficulty continued the signor still employing the gesticulation he had learned on no account would i offend prince imara prince he is whether he likes it notwhile on the other hand i may be guilty of his death if i stand upon scruples and that would be a very poor requital for i owe him my life and am proud to owe it to a man so great and magnanimous crotchety perhaps as all great men are and sometimes even more than that but take him all round such a man as you wont see in a long days ride mr cranleigh that is the opinion i have formed of him a man of the first magnitude in body mind and character as yet i know very little of him but one is struck with such a rarity at once just as as i might be with an enormous diamond but i am surprised to hear you say that you know him so little i suppose he keeps himself very much to himself down there it was i who arranged that place for him i do not even know whether he has any visitors none from our part of the country i believe but i saw no signs of secrecy about the place it is naturally very lonely and secluded and out of the line of the more important roads and he has as good as told me that he was busy about something that he did not wish to talk about it is suspected in some quarters that his business is the forgery of russian roublenotes no you dont say that what a people we are ah yes ah yes i have been on the continent for some weeks or certainly i must have heard that grand joke and they will make a raid upon him soon with a searchwarrant i dare say oh i would give something to see that tell them to keep the dogs in i know what they are and the policemen would shoot them as soon as look for doing the very duty they have to do themselves only doing it with a little more sagacity dont forget that mr cranleigh i wouldnt have those dogs killed for a thousand pounds there is not a dog to compare with them in england i knew their grandfathers in the caucasus hereupon i told him just to help my case how lucky i had been by a very simple stratagem in saving the life of that glorious kuban from a low beast of a bulldog and he laughed and said capital i should never have thought of that by the by i know something of your brother mr cranleigh he has very nearly made a diamond and he came to me about it upon my word i thought at first that he had succeeded until i threw my testlight on it it was the nearest approach that has been accomplished yet i dare say he told you all about it not a syllable he never does unless it is to try the effect upon me he has the lowest possible opinion of my intellect he has monopolised the brains of the family but he is glad enough to come to me for more substantial things ah yes i see but he will astonish the world some day what amazed me about him was not his inventive powerthough that must be very great of courseso much as the quantity of pluck he showed at any rate i should call it so you would have thought it the turningpoint in a young mans life to know whether he had solved the great problem or failed but his hand never shook it was as steady as mine now and his colour never changed he was as cool as any cucumberthe last one i bought was as hot as ginger and when i said no sir not quite yet he made me the most beautiful bow i ever saw and walked off leaving the work of months with me that is harold all over but he will never do any good he is always on the brink of success but never in it and if he ever does succeed all hell say will be just thisoh any fool can do that and never think of it again however i must not go on about him time is getting on and i ought to be at home again what answer shall i take to missmiss prince imar do you know what dariel is nicolo was smiling in a genial manner at my levity and then he said to crush it in a truly british manner dariel is the heiress to the throne of georgia she has the pink eagle on her left shoulder but there is no throne of georgia now i answered quite uncrushed for she might have been heiress to the throne of all the stars without mounting any higher than she already was with me the russians have got georgia and who shall ever turn them out this will show how i had got up my subject a month ago georgia for all i knew or cared might have been the property of our former george the fourth or still the prize of victory for saintgeorge and the dragon you take things as quietly as your brother harold does ah yes it must be in the family no doubt but i give you my word that it is true mr cranleigh not that her father is a georgian though he belongs to a higher race the lesghians and the highest tribe of the lesghians all the others such as shamyl are mohammedans dariels mother was the princess oria the last representative of tamara the celebrated queen of georgia and she was carried off from tiflisit is a most romantic story i cant tell you a quarter of it but there was some frightful tragedybless you they are always having tragedies thereand the long and the short of it is that imar has incurred the bloodfeud you may be sure that he never ran away from it he has the greatest contempt and loathing for all such horrible heathenism after the capture of shamyl all hope of resistance was over for the mohammedan tribes fell away at once shamyls chief hold over those fierce races had been his position as imaum which confers divine command over those who belong to islam ah he was a gallant chieftain but cruel sometimes ah yes ah yes and your share in these adventures signor you must have carried your life in your hands it seems as if there can be no danger in the world without some brave englishman being in the thick of it jemmy nickols threw his blouse open and showed a fine broad chest which he patted you are right there he said it generally happens so ah i was an active fellow in those days and afraid of nobody but the devil and you may be sure there was plenty of him there ah yes our nation is always on about its sailors but to my mind the landsmen are every bit as good however it was business that took me there and not any pleasure in hardship i had to make my own way in the world and was tired of sitting on a stool in london so i got a commission from the firm to amsterdam my father being one of the partners and there i heard of something which sent me across europe to meet a russian merchant at odessa i found him quite a young man and very enterprising which was not very often the case with them in those days we became good friends and he told me that he had heard from a brother of his a russian officer then serving against shamyl of a wonderful discovery of emeralds they had made among the mountains of daghestan my knowledge of jewels was greater than his and he made me an offer which i could not resist to pay all expenses and give me all benefit of russian protection if i would join him in the search for this treasure and if we found it per cent of all net proceeds this was a wildgoose chase you will say but what young man of spirit is not a wild goose we had a rough time of it and repented every day of our folly but still went on with it the russians had an enormous army spread far and wide and whenever we could keep near them we got on well enough but where we had to trust ourselves to native guides with the help of some interpreter it was scarcely ever safe to close our eyes let me see it must have been in towards the close of shamyls long defence it has often been said that the allies should have landed a large force in western caucasus to help him during our russian war but it would not have done a bit of good he was far away in the eastern chain and it would have been a stiffish march to get near him i can tell you and when we were there we could have done no good people talk of caucasia as if it were a nation i cannot tell you how many tribes there are but for the most part they hate one another and they speak about seventy languages and cannot write any one of their own how could you ever make a nation of them russia might have conquered them a century ago if she had been in earnest about it and it is the best thing that could possibly happen to them now some little law and honesty without any real oppression is ever so much better than a lot of murderous freedom and pretty freedom why in many of the tribes the women have to do all the work while the men lounge about or rob their neighbours my opinion is mr cranleigh that we talk a lot of rot about civilization nature wont have it everywhere and she shows what she means by the way she marks the places and the worse they are in all common sense the closer the natives stick to them well we got a taste of the country and the people that therein do dwell my poor friend did not live to tell of it neither should i but for prince imar it was in a rocky hole where you said to yourself never shall i get out of this and it must have been the devil that got me into itwhen suddenly a score or two of thundering savages jumped out from the solid crag almost and blocked all the horrible place both ways i am not at all sure that they meant to hurt us and i dare say they would have been satisfied to strip us and rob us of our arms and money and send our guides to the right about but unluckily my russian friend lost his head and sent a bullet into the crowd in front i cannot tell you any more than he could now what happened in the rush that was made on us only that my dear friend lay dead upon his back with his eyes upon the little blink of sky above the chasm and that i like a fool fell upon him to protect him when nobody could harm him any more and a big fellow was going to give me my quietus when another man twice his size sent him spinning all the others fell away for he had come among them suddenly and i heard them muttering sur imar no englishman shall come to harm when i can help it this gentleman looks like an englishman he said and i never was more ready in my life to acknowledge that the rest of the lot could not make out what he meant but they put down their weapons and looked at him to cut a long story short he took me to his own mountaincastle and treated me as if i had been an invited guest and i never knew such hospitality in all my life i stayed there a long time for it was not safe to travel and there i saw the most beautiful lady that ever trod this earth her daughter is very beautiful but you should have seen the princess oria if you want to know the utmost that the lord can do in the construction of the human race dont talk to me i said for i could not quite stand this you are like the rest who always talk of the past as superior to the present but i beg your pardon pray go on i have seen a great deal of the world ah yes continued my new friend nicolo and i have come to this conclusion from all the instances within my knowledgeno very beautiful woman ever lives a life of happiness i dont mean pretty girls of course and all the fair women of ordinary charms i mean the exceptional the wonderful creatures of perfect and enthralling loveliness of whom there are not six in a century they are as rare as a brilliant of three hundred carats as yet i have only seen one and that one was the princess oria then how can you argue about them all i enquired very reasonably you mean from history and all that i suppose but what became of that wonder of the world i should have known better than so to speak when he was inclined to be pathetic but absurd as it may seem i was jealous of dariels own mother when quoted against her alas that is more than i can tell he replied without heeding my flippancy i only know that it was pitiful pitiful something to make all who heard of it shudder prince imar was a most cheerful man full of life and spirit even in the thick of blows and danger when i had the honour of being his guest not a sign of jealousy about him introducing all friends to his lovely wifewhich is not the custom with the moslem tribes of coursepleased that a comrade should share her sweet smile and proud that she should be admired and as for her i believe she adored him insignificant as i was i believe that she preferred me to many grander people simply because i was never tired of singing his praises and because i owed my life to him they cannot have quarrelled at least i should have thought so neither can she have betrayed him one never can be certain where a woman is concerned otherwise i should have thought it utterly impossible and yet what else is there that can at all account for it she perished most sadly there is no doubt of that and i dare not even mention the subject before him even dariel knows not a word about it i could well understand that a mans most intimate friend would shrink from such a subject and nickols was not at all likely to be very intimate with sur imar though he might have proved a valuable agent was there any dariel in those days i enquired though i might have concluded from her age that there was not no there was not any dariel yet but there was a fine little chap about a year old and how well he could run i have had him on my lap many a time what was his name oh origen those people save their friends a world of trouble by being contented with one name but now i have told you all i know mr cranleigh or all that can be of importance and of course you will not speak about it to any one every one has a right to his own privacy and our friend insists upon a private life he might have been the lion of a season if he had liked with his romantic history and noble appearance ah yes ah yes but i fear i must hurry you or ask you to call again we hold a meeting at oclock of a syndicate they call ithorrible wordabout a big find in south africa in return for my information i beg you to let me know if anything is threatened down there and to do your utmost if you have any influence to keep them from returning to the caucasus he has plenty of money why cant he stop here and have the sweet dariel introduced at court there is a very great man indeed who would be only too proud to manage it plague them all i cried as he began to fidget how many more great men i wonder but did you ever get those emeralds the plenty of money made me think of this never saw one of them never got so far and what could i do when my friend was killed very likely they are there though i shall look them up some day perhaps if i can hear of that russian officer but most likely not worth finding pale emeralds fetch very little goodbye goodbye dont forget one thing have the dogs chained up for fear of the police making holes in them oh you are not afraid of the dogs making holes in the police i said while shaking hands with him i should be sorry to have to fight kuban and orla with a policestaff so should i but you may depend upon it when they make a raid of that sort expecting a big capture and stout resistance they will not come down without firearms chapter xv sister v sweetheart there had not been so far as i could recollect anything that could be called even a tiffif such a wretched syllable can find its way into the heaven seventyseventhbetween the lovely dariel and myself but on the other hand i had left her rather more abruptly than courtesy would warrant because of the grievous tranquillity she displayed in speaking of a fellow a prince hafer as she called him who possessed almost every hateful merit and was eager to bring it in to cut out mine by some underhand and undermining fraud what had i done to be treated like this was there no claim established on my part was it nothing to have come down the hill that evening at the risk of my neck and old joes as well and then to put up with a strained conscience for a month and then to catch no fish every day for it might be a week of hook and barb and then to run a frightful risk of hydrophobia and then to let my duty and the business of the farmhowever there was not much to be said about that but what had i done that no message came that i should be left to cool my heels without even a distant sigh in token of some little anxiety about me send allai to me tomorrow night i had said as plainly as possible and you shall hear all about young nickols it was no young nickolsthat was my mistake or my jealousy had rejuvenised him but that could not alter the intention was it to be supposed that dariel the gentle and sensible and simplehearted dariel had taken offence at my hasty departure and resolved to have no more to say to me i passed a very anxious and uncomfortable time endeavouring vainly to turn my whole attention to the doings and the interests of other people who certainly had a strong claim upon me but still a certain feeling would arise in my kindest and largest moments that it was scarcely just on my part to neglect with such severity my entire duty to myself who was farmer bandilow who was lord melladew jackson stoneman or even sister grace that i should have no one to think about but them let the whole parish and the county too rush into the union and break stones or be stonebroken by means of this new crack but love is immortal love is lord of all what had i done to make him hold his blessed tongue like this i strode about and strove about and let everybody know that when i was put upon i could stand up against it and my dear sister grace who had ideas of her own such as i had spoiled her into when she was my childhoods pet was beginning to smelloh vile metaphora rat because i would not always do exactly what she wanted and once i had the courage to tell her that there were other girls in the world besides grace cranleigh her state of mind at this was enough to prove to mine that the great truth thus pronounced was a good one for the world and i venture with some tenderness to intimate as much but how much better for me as for every man so placed if instead of using tongue i had plunged both hands into my pocketsa proceeding which puzzles and checkmates the female race because they cannot gracefully do the likeand then had walked off with a whistle which adds pari ratione to their outer insight then i am right said grace catching her advantage as a girl always does before it is even on the hop there is some sly girl without the sense of right to come and ask me what i think of it who has laid her snares too cleverly for my dear brother george my only brother i might say for harold is too far above us in intellect to be counted as one of the family oh it is so sad so sad and cruel to me explain yourself i answered hitting by a fluke on the very best thing to be said to a girl because she never knows how to do it and what had harold done to be set in the sky like that you know what i mean well enough too well george i can see it in your face now can you look at me in your solid old way as i have every right to demand for even you will own that and assure me on your honour that i am altogether wrong that there is nobody wanting to come between us that i am still number onea you used to call me but that sounds like slang and i dont understand the sea am i number one still george let every tub stand upon its own bottom i was not taken altogether by surprise as she intended for i had expected this for a long time knowing how sharp our grace was i could scarcely have said a more appropriate thing for my sister had her stiff linen apron on bustling about with it as she did in the mornings to attend to the dairy and the poultry and all that and being of a noble english figure she had not pulled her waist in as she found it her duty to do at one oclock i am not a tub george it is very unkind of you to use such expressions about me i dont care what you say in fun you know but when it comes to serious talkbut i dare say sheoh you could span her with one hand my dear sister i replied because i saw some sign of glistening in her bright blue eyes and knew that it was all up with me if that should come to drops i have never told you a falsehood and i am not likely to begin harold may have all the intellect of the age but can you say as much as that of him she shook her head and made a face which enabled me to smile at the superiority of his mind well then i will tell youthere is a little truth in some of your imaginations though not at all as you think quite the opposite extreme a great deal too good for me too perfect too lofty too beautiful in every way too angelic it is quite unnecessary to tell me that grace might have shown more refined feeling than this but one naturally wants to know more about such an example to all humanity no doubt but you must curb your curiosity my dear and imitation on your part would be hopeless you have got all this out of me by much perseverance that implies patience which you will have to exercise now can you suppose for one moment george in spite of all your selfconfidence that i would put up with such a thing as this that an abstract idea of some divinity is to be my entire knowledge of my brothers choice i wish it could be otherwise my dear child i replied with a warmth that should have satisfied her just for the present it must be so the whole thing is very strange and complicated with many things most unusual i am not a free agent as the lawyers say if a mysterious thing of some importance comes to my knowledge confidentially am i to pour it forth to everybody you would be the very last i am quite sure to tempt me to anything dishonourable i looked at her impressively and felt certain that such an appeal must silence her she thought a little while and then looked at me and some flicker of a smile which i could not altogether help set her off again as if i were only talking humbug you called me a tub just now and this perfect and wonderful creature that lives in the clouds is superior to all the angels but even a star may look down into a tub as they showed us the eclipse last summer on the other hand the tub may look up at the star but george can it talk about the star come that is a very sound argument now you cant get out of that do what you will you are bound to tell me everything darling george by the force of your own reasoning no other relative but a brother could have held out against such coaxing ways she came and sat upon my knee and touched me with a runaway glance as a child does to a child before any cares come between them and then brought the hollow of her temple into mine as if to sayhow could i run away from you and then with the freshness of her sweet hair falling round me which brought into my mind at once our joyful romps together she knew a great deal better than to visit me with sentimental lips though they were quiveringfor what man cares to kiss his sister except upon her forehead but she being up to all devices found i had a button off and in the very place where it should have been which happened to be very near my heart there she laid her fingers trembling and began to reproach herself instead of me none of that i said with the powers of logic coming to my aid although i defy any father grandfather or uncle to have so got out of it everybody knows how good you are well well do anything you like with me now if it had only been somebody else somebody who never can know everything about you as your favourite sister does would you have called her a humbug georgeto use one of your own sweet expressions or would you have said yes you have a right to know you ought to know everything about my affairs i should be unworthy of the name of man if i kept any secrets from you my dear and then what a help you would have as soon as ever as soon as ever i had told her all about myself how you do mix up things but this curiosity of yours is useless i am compelled to maintain strict silence until certain important events have taken place until why it must be at least a princess grace exclaimed jumping up and clapping her hands and then walking as if she had a tenyard train behind her we must all be kept waiting until the impending vacancy of the throne occurs illustration why it must at least be a princess exactly so i answered for after that bit of impudence and her look of contempt at the ceiling she deserved to be driven to bedlam by the goads of curiosity how clever of you there is a throne in question and one of the most ancient in the world well i never should have thought you could hit the mark like that i wont ask another thing i would not hear it if you told me no no not for joe oh what would have tom erricker have thought if he had heard the dignified grace thus indulging in slang i am not going to have my head chopped off for prying into statesecrets who is the primeminister he was to have taken elfrida into supper the other night but he didnt still i can apply to him not to have my head chopped off george dont attempt to tell me anything more selfpreservation is heavens first law but i dont see how this parish will be large enough for us ha i see it now how very stupid of me that is what the earl of melladew is come for closetedis not that the right expressioncloseted with his royal highness prince george cranleigh for some hours you see that nothing escapes me but i must be more cautious no hope sweet child of putting me into a passion and if nothing escapes you why should you ever ask a question this was enough to floor even a girl of the highest abilities for nearly half a second and as they seldom give more than that time to their thoughts a man may almost calculate upon the skedaddle of his sister unless she has at him again within that period not so with his wife she will stick to her guns having bigger ones and knowing how to work them grace skedaddled as consistency required but with a popgun over her shoulder alas that we should have to watch my dear brother he is so good and softthey will be sure to take him in at this i was exceedingly annoyed so much so that if dignity and triumphant reason had allowed i would even have called her back at once and challenged her to explain her words which as i said before is the last thing they can do however upon second thoughts i found it wiser to leave her to herself which would be a miserable self when reflection which is a liquid operation with every true woman should have set her straight again but thanks be to the lord who has made us real men and given us power to exert our brains without pitpat of the heart to distract them at every pulse although i was not in the calmest mood for thinking because i had never had such a row with grace before and she was a darling soul whenever she let her mind come afterwards nevertheless my road was clear enough before me if i am to be watched thought i and everything is to be put upon a business footing the sooner i assert myself the better i have talked rather big perhaps because she provoked me and i am bound to have something to show for it i will strike a stroke at once i will go and see my princess chapter xvi international elements but alas this was easier said than done like most things in this world of words when i had put myself into choice apparel with hat and tie exhibiting my college colourswhich we should have carried to the head of the river if fate had not swept me from the new college boatand when i had impeached that fate again for not affording me my brother harolds face yet resolving to brazen it out had appeared inside the lower door of st winifreds stronghold which i knew how to open by the owners counselinstead of finding things in their wonted peace orderly picturesque in statuesque repose at a glance i descried a very warlike change there was stepan with a long gun and cartridges enough in the bandoleer on his braided frock to account for all the civic force as well as half of aldershot and behind him a score of fellows no less martial both the gigantic dogs were loose and equally resolute against invasion even little allai was in a clump of trees with a dagger as long as himself in both hands and his white teeth ground against all albion in the name of wonder what could be in the wind just like my luck of course it was at a most important moment to hit upon something far more momentous to the very people i was come to move good stepan i pray thee to communicate unto me the signification of the matters i behold for i knew that this trusty caucasian had picked up a bit of our language and preferred the long bits he rolled his fine eyes which were big enough for millstones and in his still bigger mind revolved the sounds which had vainly reached his ears what are you up to now i amended my enquiry and having heard the milkboy say something to that tune when they declined so much of heaven in his cans he bowed his head magnificently and said all right this is the first consolation found by a foreigner in our language it is courteous to ourselves as well and shows confidence in our country what a fool you are i cried with a britons low ingratitude and then i saw the stately figure of sur imar coming towards me this king of the mountains looked as calm as if he had been girded with ancestral snow there was no sort of weapon in his broad white belt and no menace worse than a hospitable smile upon his large fair countenance he took me by both hands with a tenderness for the left which proved how kind his memory was and led the way to a seat beneath the ivied wall and looked at me as if he liked me i have been expecting you for many days he said and nothing but a little turn of voice just here and there could have led one to suppose that he was not of english birth why have you never come to show me whether i am a good physician i gave him all true reasons that i had been away and occupied with a number of home cares when at home and i spoke of my parents in a way which he approved and then i was led on by his kindness so that i asked whether he was quite at leisure even more than usual he answered with a smile we have stopped our little operations for the afternoon because we have been admonished by a kind friend that some little attack upon our place may be expected well you are a cool hand was almost upon my lips but a glance at him prevented any personal remark he was not the sort of man to be dealt with thus but i resolved at least to be straightforward with him sur imar i must not come here under false pretences the fact is simply this and i wish to tell you first for no blame can possibly attach to her and i have not told her of it but i love your daughter dariel he looked at me with some surprise but no sign of resentment and i met his clear gaze firmly trying at the same time to look braver than i felt for he took a long time before he answered ah you little know what you are bringing upon yourself for the sake of your friends you must overcomeyou must put it down at once before it gets stronger quench it for the sake of all who love you and all your hopes in life you must conquer it abolish it annihilate it you are a man of strong will if i have any knowledge of the english face his tone and manner were of friendly advice rather than of stern forbiddance i know my own mind on this subject i replied and nothing will alter it whatever the consequence may be to myself i shall go on unless there is fear of harming her there is fear of harming her very great fear of it perhaps you have the right to know that depends upon yourself tell me for i am at a loss to understand how long this has been and how it can have happened for surely it is of short opportunity that is true enough and too true for although it had been going on with me for months there had not been half the opportunities i longed for but it has been growing very rapidly sur imar although there have been so few interviews and the first of them quite a onesided one in fact i have had very little chance as yetone occasion i lost altogether and i did not make the best of another oh no i have scarcely had any proper chances yet be thankful that it is so my friend it will be my duty to prevent their increase dariels father smiled at his own words with a sense of humour which i did not share but just have the kindness for i have the right to know to tell me how there can have been any interviews at all my daughter has been brought up in england mainly and resembles in many points an english young lady rather than a lesghian but it has never been any fault of hers at all altogether my fault what little fault there has been but i hope if you dont encourage me sur imar you will take good care not to let anybody else that is rather a surprising demand he spoke so gravely that it was my turn to smile at the modesty of my own request because you are prohibited all the world must be so but tell me how you fell into this sad mishap that i shall never consider it sur imar however hopeless my prospect may be already i feel that my life has been exalted my standard elevated my character in every way i am sorry to hurry you mr cranleigh in the course of your selfcongratulations but some invasion of our refuge may be expected now at almost any moment and afterwards there may not be good opportunity of speaking thereupon i told him as briefly as i could how my admiration first began and how it had become entire devotion in spite of the niggardly occasions it had found and that now i set before me but one object in the world and cared not for obstacles denials scruples opinion of others or perdition of myselfin for it i was and go through with it i would then he stopped me as if i spoke at random did you begin it sir in this lofty manner were all these fine sentiments already in your mind when you peeped through the hedge at my daughter sir you exaggerate that small proceeding and i am not a bit ashamed of it now i replied because of the glorious results it has produced i am a little inclined to think that i hear a thumpingin my heart there was one of the biggest thumpings ever known as i defied him thus and he disarmed me in that manner is it the arrival of your civic force the peelers the coppers the bobbies there they were beyond all doubt and i believe that i shall pay the policerateour tribute to the powers invisiblefor the rest of my life without a growl because of the moment of their knocking at that door stop sir i shouted as the prince was marching off in his leisurely stylefor nothing ever made him hurrythere is one thing i have forgotten fasten up the dogs i was ordered especially to tell you that otherwise the poor things may be shot dogs must take their chance in a conflict of mankind but i leave them to you mr cranleigh i knew not then that the true caucasian is never brought up to love animals and i wondered to find him so unjust if a man likes to rush into a conflict well and good but to let a dog sacrifice himself to loyal feeling appears to me unrighteous on the masters part so i ran for my life and caught kuban and orla who would have rushed pointblank at the muzzle of a cannon and with much difficulty and some help thumped them into their kennels meanwhile the kicking at the upper door and the shouting of hoarse voices and the hoisting of coned heads between the ivied battlements were waxing every moment and so was the ferocity of the warriors inside who had not enjoyed a fight perhaps ever since they came to england the country of policemen who mainly beat white gloves but the master of the place ordered all his henchmen back and made them stand their murderous guns against the peaceful ivy then he swang on its pivot the bar of the door which had been readjusted since slemmick dashed through and throwing it wide he stood among the foes and spoke this is a very great commotion you are raising is there law in this land that such things are allowed we beheld a large force of constables outside as if much resistance had been expected and some of the mounted police were present to intercept any runaway sir there is law in the land and under it i hold a searchwarrant of these premises with orders to arrest all persons here in case of certain discoveries sergeant you will see that no one leaves the place without my permission now sir exhibiting his warrant the chief officer fixed keen eyes upon sur imars face and scanned with stern suspicion the tranquil smile and the very peaceful aspect to the mill first to the mill at once he shouted with some show of temper being annoyed as i could see by the calmness of this reception sir will you have the kindness to inform me why the mill is not at work as usual it was scarcely worth while when i expected you to begin work and then be interrupted you expected me sir what the devil do you mean cried the officer as one in a fury for some little time sur imar answered with one of his most majestic bows i have looked forward to this pleasure but until this morning i could not be sure of the hour most convenient to you but according to a proverb of your country better late than never sir the mill is at your service and all that it contains i have also provided some refreshment for your men not such as i could wish but what you call rough and ready and you have laid it out in the mill the very place we were to have broken up of course you have had time to clear everything away it is a farce sir a farce to carry out our orders now it would be that at any time for you never should have received them there is in this country though the constitution is the noblest in the worldwhich generally means the least corruptvery imperfect communication between the working departments perhaps you will encourage your men to search while i am proving it needless that would be of a piece with your other arrangements that is not your style of business nay but feeding is i perceive that your men have walked far good sir i entreat you to let them recruit their strength stepan bring two more chairs this way gentlemen i hope that you can manage roastbeef cold if the date had been more definite we could have shown more hospitality these things are beyond my understanding said the officer gazing at his men who stood strictly at attention with eyes very right for the great sirloin i have never been more astonished in my life will you give me your word sir that no one shall leave the place then i see no good reason against a little refreshment while you are explaining this strange state of things to me members of the force all fall to ha what perfect discipline i scarcely know when i have been more pleased in my little way of regarding things than i was at that moment to see everybody converted from the track of war as one might say to the course or as might be considered even better when the fork takes its place as the knifes better half the chairsthe comfortable diningchairs of peace gallant as any known soldier on the globe which can show more varieties of them than of soil or climate is the true british peeler in quest of promotion and these were all picked men as they soon began to prove and a warm sense of providence arose within me at the privilege of seeing them pitch into the victuals instead of storming caucasus i am not intelligent of british manners quoth sur imar to the chief officer as if i had the honour sir of belonging to your island but so far as a foreigner may understand your race i trust that they will make progress now like a house on fire replied the officer with a bow and perhaps some inclination to do better with his lips than discipline as yet encouraged sir i understood that you were going to show me something sir in my native land we have a manner suggested perhaps by the rigour of the climate of producing a savoury broil at short notice measures to that effect were taken upon your first application at my door and if you will do me the honour of coming to my room i would ask for the advantage of your opinion on that subject i trust that mr george cranleigh will join us mr cranleigh is this sir harold cranleighs son the officer enquired and a very gentlemanlike expression which had been dawning on his austere features became established there for the rest of the day after you sir after you with a bow that did credit to the force he protested and soon he held his own in a spirited discussion upon the most effective form discovered for a carvingknife well sir what report am i to make he asked in a very proper frame of mind when now there was little left and still less wanted according to instructions made strict search of suspected premises encountered no resistance found nothing in contravention of the law but excellent dinner prepared for us embraced the opportunity according to precept and example of superior officers found no occasion to take any one in charge and know no more than we knew before you shall know more than you knew before you shall not return without perfect satisfaction as to the question which brought you here you have exhibited the commonsense the selfrestraint and the consideration which english officials alone display you perceived that it would be what you call a farce to search the suspected premises when you found that your visit was expected but the gendarmery of any other country would have wreaked their anger and disappointment upon the suspected objects they would have shattered my machinery sir and that would have been a heavy blow to me i have naturally been indignant at the low suspicions entertained of me otherwise i would have routed them by referring your chiefs to the foreign office one word there would have saved all this trouble but now you shall understand this mighty secret and so shall mr cranleigh if he cares to know it with these words our kind host left the table and crossed the room to a large cupboard which he unlocked and took from it a box containing things that jingled this box he placed between us with the cover off and we saw a quantity of small metallic objects of very queer forms and various construction like pieces of a chinese puzzle sur imar stood regarding us with a smile for he saw that neither of us was a whit the wiser those are the products of my mill he said no very portentous secret but it might be fatal to my object if my little scheme were to find its way prematurely into the public press therefore i will ask you mr officer not to enter this in your report though you are at liberty to mention it in confidence to your chief mr cranleigh i am sure will not speak of it at all if i put it to him so now what do you call these little things couldnt guess to save my life the officer replied as he fingered one or two artificial insects spiders tadpoles shrimps or dragonfliesno that wont do i give it up sir imar i know what it is i said not by any stroke of genius but through my brothers workshop it is all of it type of some queer sort but what the metal is i have not the least idea type it is as you perceive but to what language it belongs i doubt whether even the british museum could tell you for the very simple reason that nothing has been printed in that language yet it is type of the lesghian alphabet the first that has ever been cut or cast or in any other manner fashioned our language is a very fine one infinitely the finest of all the forms of speech in the long tract of mountains but nothing in it has been printed yet we are obliged to have recourse to arabic if we desire to publish anything and not only that but the children even of our noblest families have not the least ideaofficer i see that you are pressed for time but if you had leisure to see me work this press not with those castings but the larger form the capitals in fact the coarse capitals which we turned out firstfor we had to feel our wayi am almost sure that you would agree with me i am sure that i should sir no doubt about that i never saw anything so beautiful in my life but we have exceeded our time sir imar thank youwell i will taste a toss of that liqueur upon my word you know the right thing all round sir imar your best health trappistine is not a patch on it beg pardon sir imar for having hit your gate so hard i am not quite a literary man myself but am able to allow for all in that way situated goodbye sir imar and if any one encroaches upon the freedom of the press for the folk about here are not like us just one line to scotland yarda cigar sir yes it will enable me to think and i shall take that young fellows horse back to the station sur imar sat down while i went to see them off and outside the upper door they gave three cheers wonderful old chap grand old cock the officer said to me as i offered him a light english aristocracy not a patch upon him for cooking a dinner or for languages but as mad as a march hare what a pity dont he know what is good though mr cranleigh attend to me a man who can do french things to satisfy an englishmanthats what i call international and no mistake chapter xvii peppercorns before i went away which i was obliged to do without even a glimpse of dariel her father very kindly put this question to me do you really wish to know more my friend of the scheme which has brought me to this lonely valley and kept me occupied here so long in the hope that i may be of service to the race which has trusted and loved me but received from me as yet no better reward than disaster and war you are eager to be told then if you can come on saturday when the work of the day has been accomplished you shall hear not of that alone but of things which have befallen me from which you will perceive most clearly that the greater the distance preserved henceforth between mr cranleigh and all caucasians the better it will be for his welfare and that of all his relations now it is useless for me to trouble anybody even if anybody would be troubled with all the wild thoughts that came into my head and all the sad things that would not let my heart alone as i went with this burden of doubt to bear it must not be supposed for a moment because i have chanced not to touch upon the matter that i had cast away all sense of duty to my relatives in this adventure the home and the farm and the welfare of the family had not been impaired by a single penny through what some might call the distraction of my mind only let every one attend to business as i had never failed to do all this time and what a different place the world would be and as for disturbing my father and mother with any description of what had happened to myself when the chances were that all of it would come to nothingthat would indeed have been a wicked thing to do in spite of all their preference for harold so clear was i from doubt upon that score and all my proceedings had been so blameless ever since that casual peep through the hedgeas dariels father called itthat instead of any squeamishness or selfreproach i had two points to dwell upon of maltreatment to myself why had i been sent to london on a special errand and then deprived of all chance of completing it and again had i been told of that hateful prince hafer and purposely goaded into just wrath against him simply that i might break forth into rude behaviour and so be dismissed as a savage who could not control himself before a lady that supposition was too wretched to be borne with not for the low esteem of me it implied but rather on account of the paltriness imputed to the highest and noblest and loveliest of her sex against all that my truer mind revolted and my own experience did the like but men have a trick of saying such small things about women when the feminine back is turned partly because they think it lofty so to speak and partly because of the poets and sages who have set them this example and partly a very small part let us hope in right of their own experience and these things come into a mans lower mind when depression sinks it in the muddeposits of the heart halloa george cranleigh what a blue study you must be in dont i carry a light at my forepeak and if you cant see it you might smell it it was rather dark as i came near home after that interview with the police and the trees at the back of the hall were thick but i might have seen stoneman and his cigar if i had been at all on the lookout come in he went on i waylaid you because i want a chat with you most uncommonly and they told me at your den that you were gone this way fishing again no rod this time but perhaps you leave it at some farmhouse this man had his little faults and among them was a trick of suggesting a handy fib and then smashing it if adopted the which is not a friendly trick not been fishing eh something better i daresay well come in here i want to show you something good and the wonderful fellow who does it this was as dark as the sky itself to me but i followed him for he was a leading man and in little matters i submit my steps to theirs verily on this occasion i did not walk amiss for when we were in jackson stonemans little crib such as any man of nous with a big roof over his head is fain to keep for his own better moments there was something which no magnificence can bring home into the simple human breast who is the most delightful writer of our race since heaven took shakespeare away in hot haste when his hand was too close on the tree of life the answer although so long in coming comes louder as every year adds to the echowilliam makepeace thackeray that man of vast brain with the fresh heart of a child would have been pleased to see what i beheld and his tender touch only could have touched it off a bright fire was burning in a low plain grate there was not a whiff of smoke throughout it and in front of the red clear glow at a distance nicely calculated stood a beautiful machine with its back to us kneeling on the rug was a longsided man so intent on his work that he never heard the door with a silver spoon once apostolic perhaps in his right hand and a long slender crook in his left what he was tending could not be seen as yet but a glorious fragrance held possession of the air and wafted a divine afflatus to any heart not utterly insensible sur imars broil was not a patch upon it ach it is to spoil everyting dat you are here the artist frowned and grunted without getting up as stoneman introduced me my name is hopmann but dese bairds what will dere names be if i interrupt peeping in over the lid of the alcove which had an enamel lining i saw four partridges hung skilfully from hooks with a swivel to each so that every bird might revolve with zeal or pause with proper feeling as his sense of perfection and of duty bade him while in the tray beneath them some clear brown gravy was simmering with a beaded eddy where the basting trickled in and out among them the silver spoon was gliding most skilfully and impartially administering a drip to each as sweetly and fairly as their own dear mother did it in their happy nest but instead of their dear mother alas it was not even an englishman who was tending them but a german doctor with a very red face gazing most severely at them through big silver spectacles not you look not you come near this gentleman cried as he gave me a push in return for the bow i offered him come in here george said stoneman with a wink at me let him alone and i will tell you all about him he is the best fellow that ever lived but you will never get it out of his head that almost everything we do is wrong everyting everyting not almost but everyting the englishman do wrong the herr doctor shouted as stoneman led me into the next room where a snug suppertable was set out for the three of us rather a queer customer isnt he said my host but i have known him more than ten years now and got ten times as fond of him every year he is the kindesthearted fellow i ever came across and there is scarcely anything he cannot do he is wellknown in london he might be professor of this that and the other but he has not a particle of ambition though he values his profession mightily he is fond of money of course but chiefly for the sake of his widowed mother and two sisters whom he supports you know that old chalker of cobstone hill went the way of all flesh last month leaving a large practice all abroad well i persuaded hopmann to take to it for they were paying him shamefully in london for a lot of work at one of the hospitals he has only been here about a fortnight yet but he is sure to get on he must get on nothing comes amiss to him and i want you to help him wherever you can you need have no fear he is quite tiptoptoo good a great deal for a country practice but he would never do in london he is too honestsees through any humbug in a moment and would tell the patient so though he were of the royal family but you should see hopmann with some old woman who will never say thank you or pay him sixpence that is what i admire in a man and that tells for him too in the end you may be sure but come along he is calling us and he will be in a fury if we let all his beautiful cookery spoil all right hopmann hop along old fellow a metal dish apiece for us piping hot and ze last baird he stay here and keep hot himself and he become ze property of ze first gent zat is ready now mr cranleigh you tell truth you never taste bartrich before for why because you cannot cook them in this land you take away everyting that gives what you call ze flavour that penetrates ze whole system of ze baird ach i will cook again for you you shall see shackson is not half so wise i was fortunate enough to please him and not in words alone for the effect of my bit of lunch had quite worn off in a very short time as happens now and then when two men widely different in their main lines meet our little corners which are the clinging points had fitted very nicely into one another and i longed to know more of the man because i knew so much of him already for who cares to get nearer to a man who keeps his distance hopmann is a queer fellow in his way but in a very good sort of a way said jackson stoneman as we two filled our pipes and he lit his halfacrown cigar which i would not have smoked for halfacrown i am glad to see you enter into each others merits now will you fall in with a little plan which i have conceived for the good of us all my german friend is an excellent shot he can knock a bird over as well as he can cook it he was out with us on the first when george cranleigh would not come two or three swells were inclined to laugh but he very soon turned the laugh on them garrod said that he never saw such a hand which was not very graceful to the man who pays his wages i have not yet found anything that hopmann cannot do shackson there are two tings vot he cannot do he cannot ride very well ze horse and he cannot listen to his own braises never mind he will very soon learn both accomplishments and then he will be absolutely perfect but we have a little campaign in view for the day after tomorrow we have only been round the outskirts yet we have not touched the best part of the shooting herr doctor will you come with your bore that wiped the eye of several of our thundering twelves and show us straight powder on thursday i vill only come on ze onderstandings of beforethat all ze bairds i do shoot shall belong to me to take home you shall carry off and cook with their trails in every blessed bird you knock over and now about you george i have never seen you shoot but i hear you are very good are you afraid to try your hand against this mighty german this put me a little on my mettle as was meant not that i ever cared to shoot in competition for that as with fishing or any other friendly sport to my mind kills the enjoyment moreover i had refused stonemans invitation from a sort of pridea very false pride it might beabout walking by his leave upon land that had been ours and i had taken no certificate this year ill tell you what ill do i said i wont bring my gun for i have taken no licence and i would not shoot without but ill come and work the dogs for you they know me as well as they know garrod and i shall enjoy it quite as much but hopmann has taken no licence either as if any one would dare to ask you about that for shooting round here i should like to see them ask him even when he is with me for me it is to my conscience sothe german had a great gift of winking both eyes through his spectacles with rapid alternation i am not a subject of this realm i make game of ze gamelaws however i was not to be persuaded and when the day came there were guns enough without mine and far too many as it seemed to me for a free beat and small enclosure luckily there was no covertshooting yet but one or two of the dogs had most narrow escapes and i was obliged to interfere sometimes and declare that i would walk them all back to kennel unless the men tried to be more careful one dog was my own a very handsome lemonandwhite setterbitch who dropped to shot almost before you could see the smoke and yet somebody put a shot through her ear though i did not find it out till afterwards or home she would have gone whatever they might think at losing the best of the bunch as one might say for there were six guns sometimes close togethera dangerous affair for a country like that even when every man knows his neighbour and each is an experienced and careful shot most cockneyfied too for the look of the thing and i had a great mind to keep away from them but stoneman would not hear of that he had invited lord melladew so he said purely as a compliment to me and how could i refuse to come with him to this i could make no reply being taken up with my own affairs to such a degree that i was not at home concerning other peoples doings the young earl of melladew was staying at the bellwhich used to be called the cranleigh arms until we went down in the worldand there he had his valet and artistic outfit and all his large ideas in the long room with the magnificent view where our tenant used to dry his onions now i am the very last to say a word against people who have gone up in life by merits which have been denied to us the first peer had proved himself a fine man of business and made an exemplary fortune by lucrative armycontracts during the crimean war if he compressed some dead cows in his hay and compelled his old sheepdogs to serve their time still by posthumous fidelity in the form of muttonas war correspondents on very short commons were ungrateful enough at that time to averall those and greater errors he had redeemed by having a grandson as unlike him as possible this young nobleman for so he might be called had many very excellent and amiable points he was gentle generous and upright more eager to please than is altogether safe except in a very rustic neighbourhood and even less conceited and affected in his manners than a young man of good looks fair position and literary tendencies ought to be for his friends to consider him natural everybody in our village said that without farmer jarge to certify it they never could have taken his lordship for a lord though considering the boards and the hyaenas this and that and the parson that couldnt turn his coattails up till a secondary motion put him into his own chair in the vestry there was no call for any one to feel surprise if the great folk came down and made the little ones go up lord melladew also was enthusiastic as to the delights of countrylife and the glories of british industry and this helped him much with my sister who never could understand why we should be starved by foreign produce when the land and the people and the sky above our heads were exactly the same as she could remember always and there was as much to pay for everything as ever but our young nobleman proved most clearly with an elegant sonnet in the cobham comet entitled sit down to your own desserts that prosperity was to return to our land and the frenchman and belgian be blown away by volleys of grape and apple shot from the bulwark of britain at farmer bandilows farm half a million fruittrees would be planted in october and ten million bushels of apples melons peaches plums grapes pineapples apricots pears c would confront the poor foreigner next august if he dared to attempt a landing my father was scarcely so sanguine but said let them have their try george if rich people find the money things can be no worse and some poor fellows may find employment for the winter perhaps mr stoneman will take it up stoneman however instead of doing that showed an unaccountable contempt and bitterness not only towards the scheme itself but all who took any share in it there seemed to be something in the matter that touched him far more closely than any question of agriculture was it lord melladews long sojourn at the bell and his frequent visits at our cottage even now with this young man his guest for the day and behaving most inoffensively the grim stockbroker marched on in such a manner that i thought it my duty to remonstrate you havent shot him yet i said as we stood behind the others because it is not dark enough but if he gets peppered in the dusk i shall know whose pot it came from stoneman gave me a grin and behaved a little better and did his best to be polite at luncheontime and after the narrow shaves of the morning things went on more carefully for the men who knew nothing about a gun had now learned to be afraid of it until with the sun getting low behind a wood we came to a bit of gorseland having a steep fall towards a valley favourite harbour for a fox in the days when my chief business was such pleasant sport and jollity there were narrow rides cut through the furze down hill and across them tussocks of welted fern and strigs of moots that cropped up again after the fuelling had been cleared why this is the place where the yellow bunnies live said stoneman as he opened a gate for us and we stood on the crest of the furzy slope i know a man and a clever fellow too who has offered a guinea apiece for them he has given up business and set up his staff in a wild part of wales and there he is going in for a breed of these yellow rabbits he has got a big name for the fur and expects to cut out chinchilla with it i have heard of our golden bunnies lots of times and seen some of them once or twice shall we get a sample for him and then offer him live bunnies if he jumps at it all agreed cheerfully to this and the dogs were taken up while the men peeping down the steep ridges got a shot or two at any of the coney race who might be dining carelessly then as all of these proved to be of the common grey sort garrods boy was sent home for a couple of rough terriers to run the furze thickets while the guns should watch the rides for two or three yellow fellows had skipped away unscathed that boy took a long time in carrying out his message and when he came back with his father behind him the dusk of september was settling in the valley while a wisp of silvery vapour stole along the brown halberds of the gorse and the russet clumps of bramble but the hillside now was ringing with the merry yelps of dogs or the squeak of some puppy in a tangled grip while the low covert ruffled or was channelled here and there with the sway of some resolute terrier hot in chase this holiday had been a rare enjoyment to me though crossed with anxiety now and then among so many barrels governed less by experience than excitement most of all as i said about lord melladew who strode along so poetically clad in green velveteen beautifully made but terminating unluckily in very smart buff gaiters short and spruceconcerning him i had prayed all day that he were safe back in the onion loft not that he carried a gun to his own disadvantage as the reckless do neither did he fire at random but was well content in the manner of the public to shout according to the hit or miss shut up all i called out sharply too dark too dark i expect to see at least a dog shot every moment a dog indeed if i had said a man and that man a live earlfor bang bang went the guns just as if i had never spoken and four or five puffs of smoke as if the hillside were on fire rose from the avenues poor bunny had to cross yellow did you see shorje yellow as ze gold is the german doctor shouted as he pointed down a ride shackson shot too but ze rabbit is to me i will have ze guinea ach mein gott instead of a rabbit giving the last kick of death what did we see halfway down the slope but two buff coneys flying ever so much faster than any coney ever flew before each flashing in front of each other as if father fox were after both of them i am blowed if it isnt my lord cried garrod the foreigner have shot him morshial vat you know ze clodshavingtohopbynightaswellasbyday feloe but keep your business good feloe if i have put ze shot in i can pull him out again you shall see guns were laid aside and the doctor left there for he seemed to make nothing of peppering a lord in comparison with basting partridges and down the steep pitch we raced after the earl who with a long start was going like the wind do all we might we could not get near him until he was brought up by a heavy post and rail where the dorking road winds along the bottom there he struck his chest and in spite of being winded did no small credit to his lungs by a power of shrieks that rent the valley what a coward cried stoneman who had kept up with me though we both had gone croppers once or twice he is all there for holloaing at any rate but the worst of the business was yet to come as we drew a pull of breath before rushing to the rescue we heard a sudden clatter in the road below then we saw a wild dash of something dark and a woman lay on her back under a low tree i leaped the rail fence to which the earl was still clinging and there lay my sister grace in her ridinghabit while the sound of the runaway ponys hoofs came clanging round the corner i lifted my darling sister grace and set her against the hedgebank and my heart went out of me as i knelt and whispered to her if it had been even dariel could my terror have been so terrible i pulled her ridinggloves off and found a penny in them the change the dear frugal soul had taken from the last turnpike gate she paid and then when i saw her sweet kind face as white as a shroud and the bright eyes closed and the long black lashes that i used to vow she dyedwhen i wanted to put her in a passionlying upon the waxen cheeks without caring a dump what any other chap might think i lifted up my voice and wept illustration her sweet kind face as white as a shroud shush shush dont be a fool shorje said some fellow pushing me away ze gairl is only what you called shtunned all raight all raight in ten skips of ze vlea my tear i am ze dochtor i went across the road and stood by jackson stoneman who was standing as firm as a rock and pretending to play with the whip he had picked up look here i said she will never pay another pike take a turn with me my dear fellow he replied hopmann will get on better without us my housekeepers mother lives round the corner though the lord knows that if all we want is a woman lord melladew i am so sorry for your little accident you mustnt wear yellow spats the next time you go shooting garrod will help you to your inn and the doctor will come when he has seen to this more urgent case garrod let his lordship throw all his weight on you stop a moment send your boy at full speed to the bell and order their low fourwheeler here he is not to say why for fear of frightening lady cranleigh and let him take that villain of a pony to the bell in less than an hour i had the great joy of hearing that grace was quite conscious and had no limbs broken nor any other injury that a few days would not cure when the pony bolted at the shrieks and kicks and swaying figure of his lordship a branch across the road had swept my sister from the saddle but luckily it did not strike any vulnerable part unless the part that often wounds a man is such in a word it was her lump of hair or what ladies call their chignon into which she was obliged to coil her tresses tight for riding that received the impact of the too obtrusive tree but i scarcely knew what to conclude about the doctor or stoneman himself who had been so uneasy about a young earl hanging out so near our grace when as sure as english words were ever uttered by a german i heard hopmann whisper this condolence to himselfzat was ze graidest shot as ever i did make one fire leetle bepper bring me down two bagients chapter xviii a lovebird thus again without any effort of his own was the clever stockbroker quit of rivalry for although the earl did not leave the village for some weeks he was not in a condition to do much poetic wooing even if he could have found a partner and this was not the only good result from that serious double accident for the necessity of daily enquiry at our cottage became so pressing and stoneman so gallantly rose to this occasion that the stiffness and coldness which had hitherto marked my mothers reception of him could no longer be maintained but glided very quietly into goodwill and gratitude all of us began to forgive him more and more for the crime of not belonging to an ancient county family while the merits of his affluence almost drove us to maintain them against his own indifference you go along i said for i had come to know him now and could talk of his cash without tapping at it you know as well as i do that the first consideration with nine out of ten of us ismoney i am afraid it is he answered as he stopped to make a bow across a thousand cobblestones to my sister who was descending from the sky no doubt to attend to her milkpans and to know of nothing else i am afraid it is with those who have not got it and there is a great deal to be said for them but i should be ashamed if it were so with those who have obtained it moreover it would be contrary to human nature for does any man value a thing that is his own as long as it seems beyond his reach it is all that is lovely and charming but the moment he has reduced the chose in action as the lawyers express it into possession all its glory is gone till he loses it again very well there is your chose in action over there i pointed to the dairy window i shall take care to tell her how you mean to estimate her if ever she becomes your property for heavens sake he cried while he caught me by the sleeve as if i were going straightway to denounce him dont suppose that such impious doctrines apply toto the one exception of all human laws i am afraid that they do and ever so much quicker than they apply to money but once more when are you going to try your luck for he had pestered me perpetually about his feelings now and i had advised him not to be in too much of a hurry i felt that he was further on than i was in acquaintance with the lovely object for he must have had about thirty opportunities to my three counting dogdialogues and everything but he had not done half so much as i had and women are wise enough to take one deed deeper to the dear heart than a hundred thousand words in fact it is difficult to get that out again if done by a man of the right age and manner and if they were sensitive just then with fright the thought of this bore me up against friend jacksons flowing opportunities and made me an impartial critic of his work he looked at me uneasily when i brought him to this point and all his experience in carrying over and contingoes and settling days and whatever else they call it was of very little use to him with such a ticklish stock come in here george he said how am i to talk as if it were a question of exchange and discount when i see her bright hair dancing in the sun like that but let me look dont say a word until she goes away here are two cartsaddles and a pair of blinkers and a truss of clover hay if her young springcarrots can dance through all that they must beat berenices and helens of troy dont be quite a fool jack you ought to know that girls cant abide being stared at with their slops on they have got a finer word for itpeg something in the novels but grace never gets herself up for a rustic surprise like those fashionable dairymaids i should hope not indeed she is nature itself and all nature is sweetest in the morning but there is not a spark of poetry about you george all that has gone into the female line what would i give to see you frightfully in love the piercing glance he gave me completely turned the tables but i pulled him back so briskly that he came home to himself for he was got up very bucklish in some volunteer apparel on his way to a swell riflemeeting and it may be imagined that he longed for grace to look at him almost as much as he longed to look at grace however that was no concern of mine he returned very modestly to his own affairs and sat down where he could not see the window has she said anything about me lately does she seem to have the least idea you know how i have tried to keep myself in the background according to your advice which was most kindly meant but meanwhile other fellows have been making play thank god we have settled melladew i was most afraid of him coronet and sonnets and a head of curly hair foremost of her sex although she isbut no what am i talking of her mind is far too lofty when i behold her in her graceful simplicity like an angel ministering what they get out of the cowsbut allow me to hang that cartsaddle on the other peg george to my vexation there was grace again standing in the doorway with a great spoon in her handfor a type of the greater one not so very far awaygiving a taste of some white stuff to old sally who was stooping a hunchified back to save spilling to see the light poise of the youthful figure and the merry smile while the white froth was tilted carefully into that ancient mouth little would you think that within so short a period all this bright life had missed the grave by half an inch thank god whispered stoneman how little heed we take of their goodness george all men in comparison ought to be killed not a bit of it i answered perhaps melladew ought he couldnt have made more row if he had been kilt as an irishman is being always but perhaps he could not help it for it is his nature to in any other case i should not have blamed him much though it is not altogether perhaps the style of englishmen but one thing we always forgethow intensely some people feel what to others is a fleabite and the ankle is a very nasty place after all though the shot only just broke the skin hopmann says you heard him claim the shot well now he puts it upon me however he is quite welcome for the tale might go against him with his bagients ta ta im off to enquire for my lord and i always let him know where i come from wont hopmann make a fine thing out of this i have lent him a trap and a man to make the most of it the man drives like a fury and calls out to everybody cant stopvery sorrylet them all knowthe poor hearl he is in such hagony hopmanns new letterbox is full already and his hat is a hoarding of turnpike tickets what a friend you are what a friend to have i exclaimed as he jumped upon his highly polished horse for grace had tripped away with a little turn of neck which meant wouldnt you like to come with me and stoneman was hoping to get another glimpse from the saddle over the palings ay and he did so too as the light in his eyes made clear to me a firm friend is likely to be a faithful lover and a true husband when the gloss is off the love but whether grace had any sense of this or even thought at all about him was more than i could say at present quick of perception as she was it seemed almost impossible that she could have failed to observe his attention or it might be called his entire devotion to her yet when i tried her with a lot of little dodges such as a brother must have at command if he wants to keep time with his sisters she never turned a hairas the sporting people sayand she looked me out of countenance sometimes as if i were inferior to the female race knowing what she was i was unable to suppose that there could be any depth in her beyond my understanding so i said to myself let her mind the milk what can a sweet girl desire beyond that to do good to be kind to be always cheerful and to find their happiness in making oursthat was the proper thing when i was young for the rising generation of the better sex of our faults they must have no knowledge but be as hard as possible upon their own and in that particular they had every help from their own sex whose time was ripening into criticism somehow or other they have changed all that and flung themselves far into the opposite extreme nothing could have made me dwell upon such little things unless there had been one of them that was all the world to me and while i was endeavouring to explain my sister to the clearest of my understanding and blaming her for my failure there must have been some other purpose behind which was even more than brotherly i was able to give very good advice to jackson stoneman and he was quite right in adopting it but that masterful inaction did not seem to suit my case what might be going on even nowthat was the great point for me to ascertainin a matter beyond all discretion or cold comfort saturday was come and i had been attending with a grandeur of benevolence beyond all praise to a loveaffair deeply interesting but in which you might call me a spectator only surely my own state of puzzle was enough without trying to make dovetails of another pair therefore as soon as i had paid the men at three oclock that afternoon which was the proper time i saddled old joe and without a word to grace who might think what she likedlet her mind her own affairsoff i set for st winifreds valley where i knew an old shed that would entertain the horse let this old fellow get enough to eat which he might pull from the hayrick and all time all friends any fatherland would be just alike to him the days were drawing in very fast and although the sun was on the shoulder of the hill the sense of autumn and of night impending had taken the cheer and the warmth away and saddened the dignity of the trees my heart was beating fast yet low as i hurried down the slope from the lonely shed fast with some foolish jerks of hope that any corner might show dariel yet low as every corner went its way without any sign of my darling when i came to the ruined chapel and peeped in discovering only solitude so flurried and tremulous was my conditiona most unusual state for methat the lesghian chief if he saw me thus might fairly think that some mischief from the old wound was at work inside to recover myself and appear before him in a decent manner i crossed the brook by a fallen tree and wandered into the gloomy wood where the old approach had lost its way and here i lingered so long that dusk was deepening into darkness when i crossed the lonely stream again fearing that sur imar might suppose me to be careless and having recovered my selfcommand in right of much moralising i entered by the lower door and walked across the grass towards the quarters where the people lived all was quiet dull and foggy darker than the land outside and damp enough to give love itself a touch of rheumatic fever most of the men were gone as their happy fashion was on saturday to fetch good things of victuallingfor no cart came down the valleyand other delights which we are so glad to deny to one another as i passed by a low ruined wall in the fog i heard a click as of some iron latch falling to or flung to carelessly this drew my attention that way and then a swish like the swing of a heavy cloak followed and then i saw a tall man coming from an angle in the wall that had a roof to it at the moment i was walking rather fast and if i had continued at that pace my elbow and the strangers might have struck one another for he was also walking fast and his courseto use one of slemmicks wordswas slantindicular to mine he had not yet descried me by reason of the wall and feeling that he had no right on these premises i drew back and let him get in front of me for i was never at all comfortable about things here since my interview with nicolo keeping my distance carefully i followed that man towards the buildings while i tried to make out enough of him to learn his rank and age and anything else that could be known if he were to turn and resent my vigilance gladly would i have it out with him for a little fight even if i got the worst of it would have been a comfort to my bruised spirit then but the fellow never turned and seemed to be quite indifferent whether there was any one to heed him as for his appearance i could make out very little except that he was not an englishman dark as it was i could have sworn to that whether by his walk or dress or figure or what else i cannot say but at any rate he was a foreigner and i could almost answer for it that on his hip was swung a sword which would have made short work of me had he been so desirous instead of entering the passage of grey flint which led to the households of the colony the man i was following turned to the right where the wall curved in towards the upper door kuban and orla who dwelled for the best of their time in this part of the premises came forth and looked at him without a single sniff and then lowered their tails and crawled away what a villain he must be thought i they know him but would rather not even speak to him but the impression he had made upon them was far beyond this to my surprise they condemned the entire human race for the moment reasoning as we must have taught them to do from the particular to the universal for when i passed and held out my hand not a word would they have to say to me which perhaps was the better for my safety then as i followed with my temper rising and resolved to bring the man to book as he unbarred the door what did he do but with one great vault gain that coign of reconnaissance where the watchdog loved to sit and plunge from it into the world beyond with some strange headgear shown between the battlements and then a clank of hard metal and a heavy flap of ivy i have often been surprised as every man must be who lives to full growth upon this wondrous earth but this time my astonishment went quite beyond its powers every one had always taken me for a great jumper but to save my life i could never have done that i stood and looked up into the darkness of the sky as if for some witness to confirm my doubtful eyes and then a deep conviction of the existence of the devilwhich philosophers in mutinous ingratitude denycame to my aid and calmed me with the sense of duty which his name inspires and now the two dogs breathing calmly again and with their tails highmasted came to apologise for that trimming which even they had learned towards their dearest friend here was something genial and i forgave them because i might have done the same if touched with equal insight i will get to the bottom of this thought i though the scoundrel has put the wall between us for i knew not at all how to open that door even if it seemed desirable with a quick step therefore i retraced my course while kuban and orla came after me sniffing my track with happy puffs to be sure of something wholesome keeping clear of the dwellings i went back along the wall to investigate the corner from which that demon of mystery had emerged what superstition can there be in a winchester and new college man who has eaten for the bar and knows something of stockbrokers and as much as is good of solicitors but it is better to avoid such subjects now both dogs lay down at a certain spot where a narrow track just visible across the grass began perhaps they were forbidden to come further down that way but i went on treading gingerly until i was stopped by a pair of wiredoors it was rather dark still but not so murky as it had been for the moon began to lift herself a little through the mist as her faint light came glimmering over the black wall i began to see what the little structure was and how it was sheltered and protected overhead dariel had told me that she was very fond of birds and had some beauties of her own and no doubt this was where she kept them now if that hateful fellow with the strange headgear came out of this enclosure as appeared too manifest it was equally plain that he must have been inside it and what could he be doing in this aviary so late unless the fair owner herself were there my wrath and indignation knew no bounds if i were being treated in this perfidious way what steps could be too strong or too insidious if they led to the confusion of the traitors though the dogs were as silent as if they were carved in stone i went back to them and threatened them with quick and painful death if they dared to enquire into my proceedings then by a little reconnoitring i found a corner of the netting which formed the outer fence from which i could see into the inner room which had been impossible from the gate i could have opened that gate perhaps but not without noise enough to attract attention and now i could see as well as if i were inside for the wiremesh made no difference at the end of the room which was nearest to me and only a few yards from the corner i had found sat dariel herself with a purple cloak on or a mantle or jacketi never know the proper words and it makes no difference except to women of the colour i could not be sure by that light except that it was deep and rich and grand and her white neck shone forth it like a hyacinth from dark tulips there were two candles burning on a rustic round table and she with her forehead gleaming softly kept her left hand partly closed while the other hand went round and round as if it were winding something slowly upon some little object which i could not see for around it fell the shadowy tresses which had so often baffled me in quest of a sweet glance from her eyes every now and then i caught a glimpse of a very delicate and straight nose the beauty of which has never been surpassed and once or twice there came into view the perfection of a chin a soft harmony conducting from the roses of the lips to the lilies of the neck all this was very lovely and my heart was wild about it though my mind was fierce the other way that none was ever to be mine for whom had she arrayed herself in that homicidal beauty but while i was grinding my teeth and wrinkling my forehead into wirework she softly turned her gentle face and my rage was gone as darkness flies when the quiet moon arises there were great tears rolling and wet eyes beaming and the pity of a world of sadness speaking in the eloquence of a silent mouth also with loves vaticination i seemed to discover terror there and the call for some strong form to shield her from troubles and dangers menacing there has been no flirtation here thought i what a jealous fool i am in this there must be some dark distress how could i think so of my dariel and when i beheld the next thing she did my selfreproach grew deeper for she opened the curve of her left palm slowly and softly in fear of rash release keeping the fingers of the other hand in readiness for repression and there i saw with his green fluff panting in a velvet cradle a small bird of bright plumage with enquiring eyes regarding her he seemed to know her for his best friend and though taken aback by misfortune to trust this member of the human race to do all that mankind could do for him made of hard stuff as i am i do not feel ashamed to say that the pity which is in all of us drew straws from the candle and made bars along the mist when i saw what the girl i loved had done that poor little bird had a broken leg newly broken by violence and dariel had been gently binding the splintered shank together with cotton wool and a reel of silk as i could see on the table and a strip of cane from a chair hard by and now she was shaking one finger at him to let him know that fluttering is no remedy for affliction but why did she cry so she ought to be smiling and looking glad when the little chaps mate flew down so kindly and perched on the reel of silk to comfort him and then fluttered round and round him with her wings drooped down and a tenderness of cooing which almost set him on his legs again for they were a pair of what are called lovebirds of whom if one hops the final twig the other pines into the darkness and dies so at least the story of the birdmen goes although that excess of fidelity may be beyond the faith of other men tell me not that love is blind it has the swiftest of all sight it flies to its conclusion straighter than the truest lovebird i saw why dariel could not smile at the success of her own skill the tears on her cheeks were not of pity only but of anger at human brutality that fellow had done it that miscreant whom even the dogs of his native land abhorredprince hafer had broken the pretty lovebirds leg a rapid conclusion of mine but the right one as became manifest before many days had passed blessedness and bitterness at once possessed me would she ever accept such a wicked beast as that and when should i have the delight of breakingnot his leg that would not be half enough but the haughty head that he was carrying so high i felt the black fury of the caucasus itself rising in a breast of the quiet surrey stock cruelty to anything that lives is loathsome but cruelty to a little trusting pet lent us by the father to teach us lovingkindness and that pet the darling of a sweet and gentle maiden one more look at hershe has put him to his roost in a soft warm corner where he can make no pretence to hop but the partner of his pain can feed him but i must be off for i dare not intrude upon her quiet sorrow and perhaps i had no right to watch her as i did but i meant no harm and the pretty sight has been a lesson of goodwill to me now for her noble fathers room i ought to have been there long ago what will he say to me but whatever it may be what i say of his beautiful child is thisshe is more than any angel she is a tenderhearted woman chapter xix to clear the way the manners and customs of that little colony or settlement or camp or whatever it should be calledfor i never found out the right name for itdiffered from ours very widely some better no doubt and some worse perhaps for instance who could blame them for their rational practice of leaving hard work to occidental races they did a stroke or two when they could not help it just to keep their bodies sound but the chief and commander as we too expect had to carry through with his own hands the hardest part of everything but another custom of theirs appeared to be of more doubtful wisdom for instead of having set hours for meals and accomplishing them sociably as well as with some regularity and sense of responsibility every man was allowed to eat what he liked when he liked and where he liked the natural result was thisyou could never be certain of finding a man with his mouth in condition to answer you how they got food enough to be at it so perpetually was for a long time a mystery to me especially as they dealt so little with any of the farms or shops around not a man of them was ever seen in our village and as for the very few women in the campbaboushka and mrs stepan and some who did the washingnot one of them came out of her white cocoon though brought up very largely as christians this statement is in its place to show why the man whom i revered was still in a position to command my reverence if he had been subject to feminine irruptions to which even the greatest men are liable all his devotion to the highest enterprise might have failed to secure his equanimity but he had contracted upon reasonable terms with a vast universal provider and he only had to pay the weekly totals in advance and send to the place of delivery once or twice aweek according to the temperature thus everybody found himself fed to the utmost of his nature and most of them preferred canned victuals though something more british had been required for our police that evening when i entered sur imars room after leaving his daughter among her birds the first thing i did was to watch him very keenly for any sign of anxiety or excitement such as he might be expected to show if he had been just visited by that abominable prince hafer what right had i to identify the man i had seen with the one of whom i had only heard and even if that conclusion should prove right by what process could i tell that there was nothing good about him yet in my mind there was no shadow of a doubt about either of those points and i looked at sur imar as if he must acquit himself of some contagion before i could enjoy his society but he met me quite as usual without even complaining of my unpunctuality for he was a man of such dignity that he suspected nobody of slighting him whatever he might be doing or of whatever he might be speaking there was such simplicity and largeness and straightforwardness pervading it that one seemed to fall into it and follow instead of doubting and querying and perpending and his gentle and friendly and kind steady gaze brought all that was good in one to meet him and drove away the dirty streaks of our nature to hide themselves under their own mud i have been considering my dear young friend he said as he took and held my hand and i felt ashamed to leave it in so warm a place after all my cold suspicions about my behaviour to you the other day nothing unkind was intended but unkindness is often done without that you told me that you loved my dear and now my only child i should have received that with more goodwill whether it suited my own views or not for my manner then i beg your pardon i answered that nothing in his manner then or at any time since i had known him could be taken by any gentleman as uncourteous or inconsiderate i had told him what was the main object of my life and i felt that i was right in doing so and although i could scarcely hope for his approval being a poor man and of no high rank i had done what seemed to me to be the proper thing instead of coming as his guest upon false pretences i spoke plainly and he answered nobly of rank i have not so much regard as of the man who bears it neither do i think that wealth confers any high condition on its owner in too many cases it lowers him you will believe me when i say that neither of those questions causes my regret at what you told me i live for only two things nowthe happiness of my darling child and the improvement of the noble race to which i happen to belong i have also bitter wrongs and the happiness of my life snatched from me the love of revenge is in eastern blood and a very hard force it is to overcome you of english race cannot enter into that because it is not born in you but i know what the indignation is when the sense of justice rises his quiet eyes flashed as if his heart was roused by the words it had given way to and glad was i not to be the man presented by it in the portraiture of memory why do i admire the british race he continued with his better tone recovered not for their energy and manliness alone not even for their love of freedom and great spirit of truth and justice but most of all because they alone of all the nations i have mingled with are born without this cursed taint of savage and vile vindictiveness if a man wrongs you you have it out with him you thrash him if nature has enabled you you vent your wrath upon him and you go your way the world is large enough for both of you if you hear of his misery and woe and death you only say poor fellow there may have been more good in him than i thought but with us of the eastern and the southern blood that blood is turned to poison by a deep and bitter wrong by the grace of god and the grandeur of our christ i have struggled long against this birth of satan in me but even now i have not overcome it utterly and for ever as a larger mind would crush it but what has this to do with you a great deal if you have really set your heart upon my daughter are you sure that you have done that with true english strength and thoroughness no passing whim no delight of the eyes as a flower or a picture catches them but a power that will last as long as you do and longer than the earthly part of you no fellow likes to be crossexamined thus and to tell the plain truth i had scarcely gone into myself in this awful manner but i soon perceived that he was speaking rather at the prompting of his own remembrance than of set form and purpose for probing me so as the picture arose before me of dariel and her little bird i spared no word that i could think of though none were half strong enough none half staunch enough nothing that came to my lips had any right to go out as if it spoke for me truly i had not been so touched by the piety mystery exalted beauty and lovely maidenhood of my love as i was by the sight of her tender self indulging her loving nature i am satisfied about that my friend her father said when i began to be ashamed as we ought to be of all our higher feelings and i know enough of you to be sure that you have a strong and steadfast mind i have not spoken of your friends because you have never invited me to do so that obstacle if there is one is your consideration more than mine but the obstacles on our part are of a very different nature of english ladies i know not much though i had the honour of being introduced to some of what you call the high society when i came first to this island and they seemed to me to be endowed with virtues well adapted to their beauty but they have to contend with this great dangerthey are allowed to choose their own partners in life whenever the money is abundant before they have attained good intelligence with our daughters this is not the case the parents make a wise selection for them sometimes even dispensing with much revenue when there are great qualities to compensate we never go quite so far as that i said unless the lady behaves in such a way that it is impossible for us to help it but i have been surprised to find he continued with a smile which left me doubtful whether it were of paternal pride or of that quiet humour which he sometimes showed that my daughter seems to take most kindly to the modes of thought and the greater independence which the ladies of this country have permitted to themselves it may be in the air or it may be in the nature but i am often quite astonished at the sayings and doings of my dariel she has been brought up by a lady who is partly of english birth and for a month or two with english children but still her unusual style of judging for herself is amazing and terrifying to our elder women who being of a different rankand that reminds me if my daughter has a fault and i suppose she must have it is mr cranleigh the pride of birth not an ignoble fault but still a very serious one especially as it can never be expelled through her mother she is of higher birth than i am though not of more ancient lineage perhaps as i happen to be one of the kheusurs but all these things you cannot understand even if you wish to do so without a knowledge of my long sad tale which i have not told as yet to any person living even my daughter has not heard it and i hope she never may for it would serve perhaps to do mischief to her young mind with anxiety the lord governs all things on earth all of our race begin to feel that when their little strength is stripped from them but you are too young to see things so and never has the tale of one mans life had any effect upon anothers unless it were to lead him into wild adventures easy to talk about hard to go through be content without them i looked at him with some hesitation would it be kind of me even if i had the right to put him through all these griefs again which had changed him from a bold young chief primed with excitement and peril and love into a quiet exile and a christian moraliser a founder of type with hard blue hands and oh saddest fate of all an experimental publisher no it would be a cruel thing a selfish call upon sad memory a mere abuse of large goodwill and a vile advantage taken of an overtender conscience with these finer feelings i almost said i entreat you sir not to tell me when the spirit that hates the human race whispered to me that there has never been a man and probably never will be one who cannot find pleasure in talking of himself however dark the subject and why should i doubt that it would do him good as soon as he got into full swing the last thing i could desire sur imar would be to renew your troubles there was no humbug in these words of mine as there was with the pious aeneas for as the lesghian chief sat down and leaned his head upon his hands he reminded me of my fathers look when his money came to nothing moreover i saw in his face a large resemblance to his daughters in her sorrow over that pet bird it would be a terrible trial to you but until i know more i am all in the dark perhaps you will think it over and whatever you do will be certain to be right for the more he reminded me of my sweet one the less could i bear to worry him this is very good of you he said most kindly and it doubles my duty towards you i am ashamed of this weak and foolish feeling you have a right to know all my history and you shall if you will come tomorrow it is too late now for me to begin tonight and i have a little duty to discharge on a saturday night we always thank the lord for his care of us throughout the week you belong probably to the church of england we of the kheusur tribe have our very simple forms handed down through ages from the same source as yours perhaps we have our little service at noon on sundays would you like to be with us tomorrow nothing could have been more to my liking and as it happened there was no fear of disturbing our home arrangements for my father was laid up with a slight attack of gout and my mother in close attendance upon him so in a few words it was settled that after attending their service of whatever kind it might be i should be allowed to hear the history of the lesghian chief which was much more than the first promise i received knowing that now i should have full light thrown upon all the strange things which had so long engaged my attention and curiosity and what was infinitely more than that upon everything connected with dariel i rode home that night in a glow of excitement tempered at intervals with nervous dread for i might hear things that would place a bar forever or a gulf betwixt me and my love chapter xx not for sale but when i had fed my good horse that evening and bedded him comfortably as he deserved returning with a hock of cold bacon to my den and a jug of ale which i needed sorely there i found my white deal table just where i was going to lay the cloth covered with a canopy and tissuefringing of gold too bright for the candlelight who has brought this beehive here and stuck it on my table i asked with a tone of wonder and vexation for i had quite enough to do with my own affairs just now did you ever see a beehive of this colour then i should like to know where they got the straw from grace had lifted her head and was passing both hands through the curls of which she was so proud that she cared not what we called them and her cheeks had a rich unusual flush and there was some new brightness in her eyes as well bright enough always now too bright with unsettled weather in the depth beyond the blue i saw that there was something up but left her to begin it george have you taken it into your head not to care a straw for your sister any more this was exactly what i expected but i looked at her with innocent astonishment i put down my bacon and my jug of beer but drew back the cloth to leave room for her arms and then gazed at her with some dignity oh you need not be afraid i am not going to cry over it she exclaimed with the usual ingratitude of girls in fact i feel much more inclined to laugh you have been trying to sell me to sell your own sister can you not imagine george that i am not for sale look here i said for this was coming it too strong you have got into some tantrums some feminine delusions i have not had a bit to eat i dont know when and i must recruit the inner man while you come to your senses poor thing it cannot be so very deep in love or it would be satisfied to live on air but dont they feed you where you go dear george well that does seem inhospitable and they must be rich people or you would not go so often this was almost more than i could stand however i kept up my dignity remembering that the more impudent a girl is the more she climbs down afterwards your very good health my dear child i said and then observed her through the glass which formed the bottom of the tankard now i say that she was a very sweet young woman and a worthy wife for the best man that ever lived not to lose all selfcommand at this for the loveliest creature ever born cannot flatter herself that she looks well thus you want to make me cry but you wont do it and once for all just understand this little point i dont care a rapas you elegantly express itwhat airs you put on to exasperate me because i am certain that you understand me george all the very small things you sayand you have a low gift of walking under your own feetall of themwhat i mean is none of them have the smallest effect upon my poor mind in the first place i am not clever any more than you are and if i were i should only use it to make you more and more fond of me instead of endeavouring to make you feel small but oh george i never thought that you would scheme to sell me all this is abracadabra to me i replied quickly in fear of a torrent for when a girl tells you that she wont cry you may almost always see her fingers getting ready for her handkerchief how innocent you look but just one little question did you not send mr stoneman jackson to propose to me this very evening nothing of the sort and as if you did not know his name i have not even seen him since that day when you were cutting such a shine in the sun as the frugal virtuous and lovely milkmaid that is what has fetched him not your stupid brother i owed her a cut or two as everybody will perceive george you are cruel even more than crafty as if i did anything so low as that but will you assure me upon your honour that you did not encourage him toto try what he has been trying not only that but i did all i could to damp him off so far as such a dry fellow could be damped i told him to hold off while the earl was in the running there was no earl in the running this is too bad of you it was only the walking that lord melladew went in for and i am sure he meant no harm by that well he made the running fast enough when they peppered his gaiters and some one else did the tumbling but i told jackson to hold off for i was sure that he had no chance yet he is a decent sort of fellow enough in his way but what chance could he have against a belted earl and a gaitered earl too who can shriek in sonnets poor stoneman could scarcely put thumb to rhyme with mum and mum he should have been though it is rather hard upon him never mind he can find some other girl when he gets over it i heard of a dukes daughter who was wild to catch him but he is much too hard hit to think of any one for years one of mr errickers tales i daresay said grace with a little sigh of sympathy as i fetched a sham groan for my poor friend about that beautiful dukes daughter as if any girl with any selfrespect would allow herself to be talked of in that way and as if mr stoneman would permit it for a moment however you seem to have thoroughly discussed my case did you settle what my pinmoney was to be oh george george will you never understand how very different we are from you i did think i could have respected mr stoneman but when i find out that he has been to you trying to buy me like a colliery share or not even that for it is all divorce nowto take me on lease like a cottage or a stableoh i see why you took me for a beehive now but youll find less of honey than of sting in me when you buy and sell me by the pound like this what a fool that stockbroker must have been to mention my name in the matter for it was sure to set her off upon this sort of tack however it proved afterwards that she being perfectly calm while he was in a frightful flurry had extracted from him with the greatest ease everything she cared to know till she came with the usual leaps and bounds of feminine reason to the wrong conclusionthat i had suggested and worked up the whole affair now go to bed my dear child i said perceiving how vain it was to argue now i have business to see to and even you can scarcely expect me to be swallowed up in your affairs when you make a point of disliking this man because your own brother likes him that little turn was almost worthy of her own ingenuity she looked at me with a twinkle because it was so like what she herself in my position would have said and then after wishing me goodnight she added but i never said a word about disliking him there has scarcely been time enough for that as yet women very seldom form those sudden prejudices that they leave for the lords of creation as she vanished with this very poor missfire i began to put two and two together and arrived at the conclusion that the stockbrokers case was not altogether hopeless she had not come to care about him yet perhaps but now he would be in her thoughts more often and if he kept his distance and looked downcast and did a lot of good among the poor with strict orders to have it kept secret and caused general uneasiness about his health above all if he could only be bankruptwithout losing his cash which of course would never doi could not see why he should not have a mrs stoneman who belonged to an old saxon family and had gold enough in her heart and head to do without any in her maiden pocket and who was blest with a brother of the name of george chapter xxi voices of the valley in the calm air of the sunday morning with the brook going gently by i came to the entrance of the hoary ruins wherein i had first seen dariel a chapel with lines of grey flint only to show where once the sacred walls had risen and nothing but the soft sky for roof and mortar and moss for pavement stepan as big as a pulpit but more mute stood close by expecting me and led me along a ferny path and dusted a stone to sit upon with a noble quietude but when i asked himwhat am i to do he took it for our national salutation and answered like a house afire sir so i gave it up and resolved to act according to the light of nature and the behaviour of the others when they arrived only if there came a great procession of images as i expected nothing should make me depart from the proper demeanour of a briton however i was not called upon to assert the great reformation a more simple quiet and impressive service i never witnessed anywhere and although there was no roof overhead and little enclosure on either side the view of the sky and the passing of the wind and the sense of antiquity around us were in harmony as it seemed to me with the conditions of humility and mortality and hopefulness the strictest puritan could have found fault with little except the red crosses worn by all the congregation and a few triangles and wreaths of white flowers and the man who can find any fault with these must consider himself too faultless to worship any other being first came the women only seven or eight in number veiled not very heavily and cloaked in cheerful raiment and the last of these was dariel looking as if she had never dreamed of anything uncelestial while the loveliness of her figure gleamed through the folds of her flowing mantle even as the flexure and the texture of an agate glisten through the cloudy pretext of their coat to hide them who shall understand these things thought i there is no one on earth fit to approach her yet the lord cannot have meant her to be always by herself and then i thought of haferprince indeed prince of darkness and nothing elseand i looked about with anything but religious peace inside me however i could perceive no sign of any wickedness high or low and every heart except my own sang a grateful and worshipful tune to the lord even to me it was a quiet and devout proceeding when imar not as one who preaches to a crowd of animals below him but like a man speaking to and on behalf of mennot abject though beneath a cloud began the simple offering of our love and trust and loyalty to me it was grander than it might have been to those who could criticise it for i could not object to anything because i did not comprehend a word nevertheless it did me good inasmuch as it did the others good and if a man lives in himself alone he will not find much good there i fear and when they began their final hymn of high thanksgiving and hopeful trust that our maker will not be as hard upon us as we are upon one another the sound of great rejoicingwhich our christians never indulge infilled the valley and went up the heights such as we are bidden to gaze at while we stick to the dismal hollows i knew that i was only of a dull prosaic order but felt for the moment above myself with the other fellows lifting me however absurd it may appear to those who are always at one level of selfmade dignity andsomething elsetrue it is we all were moved as no formality can stir us stepan had a mighty voice and more than his throat was in it then dariel cast by her veil and her beautiful lips were trembling like a wildrose quivering with petals halfopen over some melodious stream i thought of the time when i had first beheld her and my love was not of this earth alone when all were gone and i was thinking still what prigs we are and cowards too who suppose that there is one way only of getting near our father that humble man who had been our priest came up to me and spoke sadly i saw that he was down at heart and full of doubt about himself and wanting higher comfort than a man like me could give him but i could not guess until he told his melancholy story why he should be thus downcast after doing his utmost for the benefit of others i had not known what the service meant but saw that it had been simple solemn and free from all rant and false excitement and this i ventured to express come in my friend and have some refreshment on sundays all the men dine together he said as he led me inside the door and we will have something with them i fear that you found it difficult to keep from laughing at the sight of such an astonishing set of hats and scarcely any two alike we copied them first i sometimes think from our highest and most fantastic peaks but art has outdone nature in truth they are a motley lot but there is not a false heart among them i had seen nearly all of them before on the day of the police invasion but not as now in their best apparel a strange and interesting sight some of them had wondrous coats frogged and braided and painted and patched and ribboned and laced and leathered and i know not what with coins and baubles and charms and stars and every kind of dangle and two of them wore russian uniforms far advanced in years and captured perhaps in the days of shamyl but their faces though covered with beards and freckles could not be called savage or ignoble and though one or two bore a swarthy aspect some were as fair as englishmen i could well believe that there might be truth in the tradition of their tribe that they were a separate race distinct among the myriad mountain strains having the hot oriental blood refreshed and strengthened from the western founts they regarded their chief with patriarchal loyalty and deference but no servility or cringing it was his pleasant duty to maintain them and theirs to work for him to a rational extent whatever they had was his so far as nature allows such partnership while his property enjoyed the privilege of ministering to their welfare they have done well said the chief to me while i was revolving these things slowly and hoping that his daughter might appear at last to grace the feast they will go and wander in their gardens now and have the pleasure of sitting in their native form which is something like that of a hare i replied without calling to mind that it might seem rude but he smiled for he never took offence unless it were intended which is a most sagacious rule and he proceeded with his inference the fact that they are coming without much pain to the use of chairs and benches when commended to them by a good dinner tends to prove that they are of a high and naturally docile race but come to my room and have a glass of kahiti and then we will go forth into the wood and you shall know all that has come to pass in the life of a man not so very old yet but with all his best years behind him he smiled and i looked at him still in his strength still comely and sweet of temper a man with almost every gift of nature but not endowed with happiness and his smile was not that of a jubilant heart which has tried and can trust its own buoyancy but rather of the calm mind which flows in to level all the tumult and to cover all the ruin i thought to myself that i must come to that if dariel went on as she seemed to do and kept out of sight without a word to me but after a bottle of the chiefs light winea dozen of which would not have turned a british hairi had the presence of mind to fill my pipe and pouch with some very fair tobacco of the mountains and to follow him over a clever little bridge of his own construction into the heart of the grey old wood there we sat upon a mossy log and he poured out his story while the sunshine came in slants sometimes and i wished there had been more of it i cannot repeat sur imars tale with any of his selfcommanding strength much less convey the light and shade of a voice alive with memory of whatever the soul has suffered however to the best of my belief the import of his words is here feebly but never falsely have i set down his remembrances only his foreign turns of language have escaped my memory and he must tell what he has to tell like an ordinary englishman which means without long words whenever short ones serve the turn as well chapter xxii imars talewar that which i have always admired in your nation and that which has made you what you are under the guidance of the lord is your natural gift of selfcommand the race to which i belong has always been very scant of that great quality and this fault has been from age to age the cause of misery and conflict not that we are by any means so turbulent and vindictive as other tribes around us for we almost alone are guided when in our proper state of mind by any sense of christianity most of the others who call themselves of that creed such as the ossets imeritians and barbarous suans have made a strange jumble of the true faith with mohammedanism paganism and even stark idolatry but the lesghians with whom we have most to do and who claim us as of their affinity still are of islam and mainly of that bigoted and aggressive form of it which is known as muridism even so they are nobler braver more patriotic and loyal to their chiefs as well as of finer presence and greater activity and industry than most of their neighbours on the west and south who suppose themselves to be christians my father sur dadian as hereditary chief of the kheusursa tribe now dwindled from its former strengthcommanded for many years their division in the army of the gallant shamyl our people did not share of course that fury of islam and blaze of the crescent which scorched the russians by the thousand out of the dark ravines of daghestan nevertheless we stood up for ourselves with the muzzle of a gun at every elbow of the rocks and if all the sons of islam had been as faithful to their great imaum as the cross was the russian flag would never have waved over guinib in shamyls lifetime the russian plan was to press us hard throughout the summer and autumnal months with ten men perhaps to every one of ours to encourage us most benevolently to sow our land and tend it and then to rejoice and renew their strength with the pithy marrow of our corn and the juicy fibre of our flocks and herds a man loves his country on the very same principle on which he loves his mother but if he can never taste what she is like he might just as well have a stepmother neither was this the only loss of satisfaction year by year our men as i have heard them tell when i was old enough to join them felt even worse than their own privations the rich gain of the enemy to sit on a rock just out of shotas many a dauntless avar told mewith glacier water for his drink and nothing but mast on his tattered lap and to see a hundred fat round fellows who had come into his land quite lean laughing and joking at his own door with the milk of his best cow at their lips and the kids of his flock coming up to them in sniffs from the fires where they were roasting this he assured meand i could quite believe himturned his empty digestion into bile and the love of his native land into a hollow ache and this very feeling in a higher form cost my dear father his valiant life and left me and my sister orphans you may have heard of the defeat and slaughter of an entire russian column under the great prince dorougoff which our gallant mountain forces with my father second in command accomplished most effectually everybody knows what glory and renown accrued to the stout imaum through this but all of our men who were present declared that my father deserved the main credit the emperor of russia had grown impatient and sent impetuous orders that his army should advance at once into the heart of the defiles and crush the rebellionas he dared to call it though we never had been his subjectsat one mighty blow and for ever the commander replied that he would march his majestys army in but never would march it out again and according to that answer so it was our men became tired of slaughter although they had many a long year of suffering to avenge as might have been expected the mountaineers grew careless after this great victory and left many of their passes open for the stubborn foe had recoiled and appeared unable to do anything more until the following season my father went home to see to his affairs and to secure a new supply of rifles for he had brought from koorbashi a score of those skilled workmen of genoese descent who for accuracy and finish can hold their own with the best gunmakers in the world all shamyls best troops were armed with weapons procured from these admirable artisans and the clumsy muskets of the russian force were quite unfit to cope with them stepan has one of those koorbashi rifles which you would find it hard to match in london either for beauty of design or for excellence in shooting but alas they were all muzzleloaders or the caucasus might have been caucasian still karthlos tower where our family had dwelled for many generations takes its name from that same descendant of noah who founded mischel and standing on a mountain plateau with chasms abrupt and vertical cleaving the land to immeasurable depths it is safe against all adverse powers except treachery and famine among the labyrinth of ravines no stranger could ever find his road and if chance at last brought him to the winding access discretion would hurry him shuddering away for many a black muzzle would look down upon him and if he escaped all those a score of yellow ones would confront him at the final crest and of tenfold sizebrass artillery from koorbashi it was growing dark in those cloven depths though the sun was still hovering upon the upper world when my father rode round the last sharp jag at the foot of the ascent to karthlos the survivors of his wardwindled force were only a few yards behind him lounging on their tired horses and scarcely caring to keep up the burden of their homeward song then when their leader was round the point they heard the roar of a heavy gun swinging like a wingflap from wall to wall and departing in the distance like an echo climbing stairs they spurred to know what it could mean and they found sur dadian dead on the neck of his horse i had not seen my father more than half a dozen times so far as childish memory goes but he was always kind and loving and very gentle with us we had lost our mother before we knew her and marva and myself twin children had been sent from home we could not tell when to be educated at tiflis there our father had some old friends and being so seldom at home by reason of this perpetual war he had done the best he could for us i was placed in the german town on the left bank of the kur and under the care of a learned man famous even in the city of many tongues for his knowledge of all useful languages he had several english pupils and admiring shakespeare as the germans do he made us almost as familiar with english as if we were born to it but marva my sister had her education in the school of a french convent on the other side of the river twins as we were and pining long at this unnatural severance the force of events and the power of education drove us further and further apart until the early divergencies of tastes and dispositions became so hardened and widened that our mutual love was vanishing the murder of my fatherfor it could be nothing elseoccurred in the autumn of but it was not known in tiflis until three months later for the city had long been in russian hands and shamyls victorious troops allowed very little communication even when known it was kept from me for some time longer as i have reason to believe by order of the college authorities at last i knew it by a letter from shamyl himself or written by his ordersfor he dispensed very largely with literaturewhich it took me a long time to make out for i had almost forgotten the avar tongue how he smuggled it to me i know not but at last i understood it to this effect young imar the son of dadian the russians have slain thy father in cold blood thou art now the chief of the kheusurs thou art not of islam but if thou hast any blood in thy body come without delay and have thy just revenge upon the accursed heathen shamyl the imaum what youth of spirit and health and strength could hesitate for an hour i had many russian friends at tiflis and all of the higher rank made light of the barbarian tumult as they called it among the distant mountains they begged me at least to wait until the truth of the muridist outlaws words could be properly established for they said that he could outlie a greek or even an armenian but i broke from them all bade farewell to marva and in shorter time than space required presented myself to shamyl that hannibal of the east was now at the acme of his fame and power though not of great stature or winning aspect or even exemplary cleanliness he possessed and exercised that gift of forcing the wills of others into the channel of his own which makes a mans course historical he had piercing eyes deeply set and overhung and a swarthy complexion and strong harsh features enlivened sometimes with a smile conveying a boyish and rudimental sense of humour but let any one rouse his temper and the demon of the mountains who haunts the crags of kazbek could not rave more furiously it was this and not cold inhumanityas strangers to our race imaginedwhich drove him into those brutal acts which disgraced the name of avar whether he believed in his divine mission to restore the glory of islam and extirpate the infidel or whether he laughed in his sleeve at that most useful delusion i never could decide as a christian and a well educated youth i thoroughly disdained such stuff but while contemning the muridist and the imaum i fell more than behoved me perhaps under the influence of the patriot for i was but eighteen years of age and as yet quite a child among men of action though foremost of the students in philology at tiflis and even in bodily strength and activity equal to the best of them my presence at first was of service to the cause only as securing the assistance of my tribe who had no share in islam and would have deserted very promptly without my presence among them but before long i proved myself a valuable recruit and was advanced to a command among the scouts upon whom in that war of surprises and sudden encounters much depended although i hated and scorned the religion of our chief i shared his patriotism and admired his valour and genius while often wondering at the forbearance he showed to an unbeliever this i owed to his sense of honour as i learned long afterwards inasmuch as he had promised my father his old companion in arms that he would never make any attempt to convert me if i were allowed to join him then suddenly he fell in my esteem for i found out that he had lied to me so zealous had i been in military matters and so eager to qualify myself for command that for two years i never went home to karthlos tower the proper abode of our race i never cared for form and fuss and the earthly division of gods children into two creationsthe highborn and the lowborn halffor perhaps there are more who knew their father in humility than in proud estate in my youth i never thought of such things to which convention drives us but simply divided the men around me into hearties who would fight and poltroons who ran away and of the latter there were but few the steward at the tower had supplied me with all that i wanted in those rugged times and in the hot vein of my patriotism a crust and an icicle seemed enough for a soldier to subsist upon but now i was compelled to return to karthlos by a strange thing which had come to pass while i was intent upon war alone marva twinsister of mine and in childhood dearer than my little self to me had defied all authority and when that did not avail had outwitted it and vanished from the conventschool at tiflis and my first news of it was a strong demand for her portion of the patrimony from the man who had run away with her this was the chief of an osset tribe who had never joined in the war but waited for the final issue in which even we who kept it up could have little confidence unless the great powers in the west now at enmity with russia would send us speedy and effectual help and i knew that this osset chief had been a hereditary foe to my father his name was rakhan which is i believe of tartar origin and he showed signs in character and in features too of kinship to that widespread race but his father had been of pure ossetian blood and now he was acknowledged chief of a certain wild and semichristian tribe we had never had much to do with them although their villages lay near us on the west for the russians kept a fortified post between us where their main road crosses the mountainchain and we scarcely regarded them as brother christians though that did not prevent us from having plenty of private feuds with them and now this man of an inferior race and a poor one toofor they throve principally upon goatshad dared to make up to my twinsister and marry her and demand her heritage and this was not the worst of it for as soon as i entered karthlos my good steward kobaduk a very faithful servant told me that beyond any doubt rakhan the osset had compassed and probably with his own hand committed the murder of my father sur dadian i replied that the imaum himself had assured me that the russians were guilty of that crime and this had impelled me to quit all friends and hurry without going home to bodlith but he spat on the ground as our peasants do when they hear of a black deception and soon proved to me that the czars troops were guiltless and not only so but that shamyl the tartaras he was frequently called in contemptknew as well as kobaduk did that there was not a russian within miles of karthlos when that cowardly shot was fired moreover the foremost of my fathers men who had spurred along the defile made oath that he saw a white globe whirl away where the crags broke apart in the distance and he put his jaded horse to the utmost speed all in vain among darkness and precipices now every one knows that no russian soldier and the ossets alone in our part of the range can be found with that hideous headgear flapping a sheepskin puffed out into a ball at the top like a great white onion at the end of a stick and there was other evidence as well as this my twinsister my only near of kin for my father had no other childrenwas i likely although she had acted thus to rob her of a single copek nay rather would not every one of mine be at her service at the same time could any son endure that his good father should be robbed not only of life but also of a third part of his property by a scoundrel of inferior race who had stolen his daughter for that very end thereupon i was compelled to believefor charity is by st paul described as the greatest of christian virtues but he does not appear though a native of cilicia to have travelled in the caucasus as peter did otherwise never could he have retained enough of that virtue to describe ityoung as i was the conviction grew upon me that prince rakhan the osset had murdered my father sur dadian because he had refused him his daughter marva instead of answering the letter therefore in which he demanded his portion i set forth with a few troopers well armed to pay him a visit in his stronghold at zacca near the fountains of the ardon river some parts of our own land are desolate enough but this country where the ossets lived had scarcely a tree to make the world look living and having had no war in their neglected places to civilize them with the passage of guns they seemed to be quite outside all knowledge yet to my surprise they looked down upon our race which we for generations had been wont to do to them and with better reason as all others will admit we rode very fine khabarda steeds which are the best of all the caucasus but we were obliged to leave them in the bed of a little snowriver at last and appear at the entrance on foot as if we expected to be shot at nobody shot at us chiefly perhaps because few of them had learned the way to shoot but there was not one of them who required any lessons in the art of staring and to think that such people looked down upon us all their houses had hideous towers as if their lives were spent in looking out from the tops and my heart went low as i thought of my lively and lovely sister marva who had been brought up like a french girl almost extinguished and deadened among such clods and i had not even the chance of learning how she liked the lot she had cast for herself perhaps she may have seen me from some towerfor they have narrow loops instead of windowsbut she never showed her face to me nor sent me any message we shouted and made noise enough to fling all the rocky echoes into a babel of dispute with one another and if we could have found the butt end of a tree we would have made a rush for it and rammed the heavy gate at last a surly fellow put his head out at a loophole and rubbed his eyes as if we had broken his repose i did not understand their language then though i came to know it afterwards but some of my men made out this deliverysons of the evil one ye shall not rob us the noble prince rakhan is far off but we will fight until he returns ye will be slain by thundering guns unless ye cease this uproar we could not believe that osset robber for the people of the village had told us that the chief and his bride were both at home but i tore a leaf out of my orderbook and wrote a letter upon it and handed it up on the point of a lance it contained no insolence though that was rumoured afterwards but only these words which a man of honesty would have met according to their intention sur imar to prince rakhan if you will come to karthlos bringing with you the relics of st anthony and upon them swear that you have had no hand in the death of my dear father i will deliver to you all the portion of my sister marva and add thereto my own present to her and acknowledge you as a brother this i signed with some hope of better feeling for i knew that they had in this savage place no small piece of st anthony and having three men who could make a cross i secured all three as witnesses and then we marched away from this inhospitable desert but the worst of the business was not over yet for when we returned to the spot where we had tethered our horses very carefully not one of them was there except my own and he was loose but ran to me him alone those ossets had not stolen because he could bite as well as kick and would let none but his master handle him we ran back to the village but there was not a soul there except a few children yelling all these we put into one hut far apart and then set fire to all the rest but being of stone they burned very unkindly and having no time to make a good job of it we shook the ossetian dust from our feet and made off in hope as well as fear of having all the mad savages after us how among a people thus divided could there be any chance of solid resistance to a mighty nation like russia acting in unity and able to replace every man killed with a dozen just as good there was not a tribe among us that would join its neighbour for any other purpose than the plunder of a third and when this was carried off the victorious pair were sure to have another fight about the booty before they were halfway home again a quarrel was now set up between my people and those of prince rakhan which would probably last for generations not so much about my fathers murderfor that was a matter of suspicion only and chiefly concerned his next of kinbut about the theft of those wellbred horses and the firing of that worthless village and when i received a letter of insult in the georgian language from the man who had so injured me the only thing that surprised me was his ability to write it for though he spent much of his time at tiflis whenever he could scrape up coin enough it was not for the purpose of improving his mind even if he had any to embellish that problem however was speedily solved for the writing was my sisters imar son of dadian twice hast thou wronged me thy brother in the lord thou hast robbed me of my portion of thy fathers goods and thou hast set fire to my wealthiest village destroying men women and children though thou art now a great man of battle and strong among the strongest so that thy name is as that of minghi tau yet shall that mighty head be fetched down and those strong hands shall feed the dogs of kektris the only hope left thee of escaping this destruction is if thou sendest to the glacier of gumaran before the snows fill up the valley again gold and cattle and household goods according to the number herein set down which is far less than thou owest me and will not make peace between us for the village thou hast destroyed but this if thou doest i will pray for thy repentance and thy sister whom thou hast robbed will permit thee to look upon her face again rakhan prince of the noble ossets there was also another signature broken and crooked as if the hand had been seized in another and compelled to shape the name of marva then i hoped that my sister had not turned against me in her heart though constrained by her fierce and wicked husband and i ordered the messenger to wait and fed him with dainties that he knew not how to handle while i preserved my temper even against the insult of that address for now i was entitled to be addressed as sur of which we think more than the common word prince for it is a designation of warlike rank imported from the furthest orient and ascribed to none but a chief who has led his tribe into battle with a foreign foe scorning to show anger i wrote thus accursed murderer of my father and serpent robber of my sister thou hast piled up a mountain of lies so vast and of such deadly blackness that the snow of thy guile cannot cover them a man of lower rank than mine may descend into the filth where thou grovellest and strive to vie with thee in vermin but i will leave thee to the lord who heedeth the smallest thing that he hath deigned to make yet that my sister be not a widow one thing i will say to thee let not the right bank of the terek be tainted by thine evilsmelling body lest for the sake of those whom the heaven valueth it be plunged into the bottomless bog for verily there are foul reeks of satan sent by his malice to corrupt the air now this was not intended as an offering of peacethough many people took it altogether in that light not from the moderation of the language only but because i sent not the wonted double dagger with itbut simply as an overture of justice in language not too mealy and an opening for reconciliation for marva my sister i felt many pangs a hankering which i endeavoured to repress a tenderness of the younger days when neither could have the skin broken without a burst of tears from the others eyes but we have to get harder as we go on and the hold of soft love on our little thumbs grows slacker and even sweet twins who have tumbled into one anothers arms and rolled over with rollicking till no one could tell which was which of them must begin to close palm and even shut fist to the kisses of each other and with all this affection heavy on my mind and a good guard left upon the steeps of karthlos i returned for the summer to shamyl chapter xxiii imars talelove perhaps you have gathered from my words already some idea of the character of shamyl an idea and not a perception was all that his dearest friends could have of him because he had no dear friends at all and yet he was a man of warm nature and kept nobody at a distance from him neither was there any haughtiness though abundance of rudeness about him men put up with the latter and even like it when shown to their friends and talk pleasantly about it and the little ruffle passes over every one expecting that his friend will be the next to get it but cold universal arrogance makes the greatest of mankindif such can show ituniversally detested i believe that shamyl was by nature kindthough he did some abominably brutal thingsand that if he had not taken into his head or had it put there by flatterers that allah had breathed into him the breath of mohammed he would have been one of the noblest as well as the purest perhaps of patriots peace be with him for he was at least sincere which cannot be said of all leading minds and he understood other men at a glance though he may not have looked very much into his own man i fear that it may be ungrateful on my part not to speak even more highly of him for he took a great liking to me in his way although i was not of his creed neither did i pretend to any personal hatred of the russians who are generally very kind of naturemore so perhaps than we areand only did their duty in shooting us straightforwardly neither did i pretend to any special love of him but carried out his orders as a soldier should unless they were worse than even war demands in which case i told him to seek elsewhere therefore i was surprised as much as any man acquainted with him could be surprised when he took me aside one day and said sur imar i have an important mission for thee which i would intrust to no other many of my officers are rough and wild and have no command over themselves with women my son is a prisoner with the russians and i have a noble scheme for recovering him and perhaps a hundred thousand crowns to boot but it is a dangerous enterprise and must be carried out with proper delicacy to ladies this was a very high compliment to me being still a young man in the fervour of my days but the captain had heard of stern actions of mine when some of his men had shown rudeness to those who could not take up arms to protect themselves thou hast the best horse in the army he continued with his deep eyes fixed upon my glowing cheeks as the spirit of adventure began to rise and there is not a stronger man among us neither one to surpass thee in activity all this will be needed and boldness too tempered with skill and discretion i would go myself for the work is worthy of me but i cannot leave the camp just now my design is to carry off from their summer encampment all the ladies of the russian and the georgian court not a hair of their heads shall be harmed and we will treat them as princesses but hold them for the ransom of my dear son and a good round sum for the military chest the powers of the west have been stingy to us when we might have done them excellent service but we will make the russian bear supply a little grease for our bullets for the ladies are of the highest rank but the whole scheme fails if even one of them should be illtreated this was the only point about which i felt uneasiness but he gave me permission and even clear orders to shoot on the spot any man who misbehaved and when he allowed me to take fifty of my tribe as well as fifty chosen men of his my only anxiety was to start as soon as arrangements could be made and before any rumour of our plans should get abroad for i knew all those southern stretches of the mountains well and that perhaps induced him to appoint me in command he told me that trusty friends near the georgian capital had informed him that the early summer heat had made the city in the deep hollow by the river almost unbearable for ladies of the north and therefore the wives and daughters of the principal russian officers together with the noblest of the georgian women had been sent to a cooler spot among the hills in the healthy district of kahiti celebrated for its vineyards little expecting any danger there so far from the lesghian outposts they were lodged in a pleasant place under canvas guarded by a scanty detachment of cossacks most of whom had been invalided from the war pounce upon them suddenly and what could they do but scream even this they would not do very long according to shamyls opinion but soon be happy when they found themselves made much of and enjoy the romance of the situation and the high price put upon them this prediction to my surprise proved wonderfully correct for many of the younger ladies permanently added to the beauty of our country and the quality of its inhabitants while those who preferred restoration declared that they would have no higgling about themif their husbands attempted to cheapen their price let them even remain among the gallant men who put them at a higher figure but this is a later matter and i only mention it to show the good feeling we created litters and light carts and other conveyances were sent in advance of us over the worst places with orders to wait in a valley we described and with all the best horses we could procure we set forth at sunrise one summer morning so as to traverse the most dangerous part of the journey in good daylight we rode very leisurely to keep our horses fresh until in the afternoon of the second day we halted in a hollow of the lower mountains to make a good meal and learn more exactly where the encampment of the ladies was here were a hundred of us all good horsemen and accustomed to despise the enemynot for want of courage but for want of wit in courage they were quite our equals for they never seemed to care much about their lives but when briskness and readiness turned the issue the vigour of the free man could upset the bulk of serfs this we had proved a hundred times against the weight of numbers being in command of this dainty enterprise and having to prove that i was not too young which always puts a youth upon his very finest mettle i took all the precautions of an old commander ordering all the others to keep close and having only stepan and the best of our guides with me i proceeded very carefully afoot along the course of a stream from the hills which had worn a deep channel we knew where the ladies ought to be and though a man must not rely too much on that sure enough there they were by the dozen their encampment was pitched upon a very pretty knoll not more than a long eyeshot from the nearest bend of the watercourse we crouched in i put my red plume between my knees and watched them being surprised at the beauty of their dress and the far greater beauty of their figures the proudest radiance of the russian court was there and the softer charms of georgia and i was glad not to see those lovely faces which it would be my duty to bedew with tears so soon having counted their tents three of which were royal and made myself sure of their position i left all those beauties at their tea outside with the sunset casting their shadows down the slope and saying to myself where will you have your breakfasts mesdames stole back with my two comrades to make ready for this prize stepan who was always full of strong ideas and never confined them to himself did his utmost to convince me that the wisest plan was to let all these houris go snugly to bed and then catch them up as they were in their first slumber and whirl them away on our saddles but i could not bear to think of this outrage on their modesty and one figure in a silver pink dress was in my mindthe youngest and the loveliest of all i had descried therefore i made ready to descend upon these ladies before they should begin to retire for the night which they would not do until they had supped well and probably played their games of cards we had little fear of sentries for there were not more than a dozen and no sign of any horsepatrol about and even of the few fellows lounging round the tents and ordered to keep at a proper distance from them we got rid by the old device of sending a boy on a donkey with a flagon of vodka on either side they showed their alacrity by robbing him of these and then retiring to their hut with the officer on duty to take first pull when the moon was up and we rode softly over the sod of alluvial ground the only challenge we received was the screech of a russian drinkingchorus round the corner of the trees without firing a shot or disturbing a dog we surrounded the camp of the fair ones and called upon them to surrender at the same time we entreated them to prepare in silence for their departure with us if they valued the lives of their guardians this exhortation was of no effect amazement and terror quite overcame their natural discretion and we found it impossible to parley with them so great was the outcry that we stood aghast till those faithful cossacks came running or rather staggering to the rescue which restored our power of action we bound them in couples to convenient trees with some ropes we had brought for the purpose and then as the ladies still declined to join us we wrapped all the most important of them in their cloaks and placed them on our horses in this they assisted us to some extent by kindly disclosing the rank of each other thus we obtained all who were of any value from a financial point of view twentytwo of sterling substance and at their entreaty and assurance of amendment we took a domestic for each of them and turned our horses heads towards the glen where the vehicles awaited us my instructions were to leave no room for doubt as to our possession of six princesses whose names i will not give because most of them i trust are still alive and none the worse for their captivity enough that they were of exalted rank and in commandas the russian ladies contrive to beof the commanders of the army opposed to us therefore before we started i stood upon the terrace in front of the tents with our horses pawing the turf which was almost a novel treat to them and the white moon making a picture of us and there with great deference and courtesy i called over from the list provided me the names of their incomparable highnesses the princess o and the princess d c and each of them made answer according to temperament and sense of resignation to the will of heaven then i gave the word to start and remained the last to bring up the rear as in duty i was bound but suddenly a slender and timid figure came gliding as if in the haste of despair from the shadow of a tent and stood close to me it was the lovely maiden in the silverpink attire and she drew her veil partly aside and glanced in the clear moonlight at my face and then dropped her dark eyes and then lifted them again with quivering tears like a suppliantoh captain am i to be left behind lady have no fear i said very gently and half afraid to look again at her you shall not be left unguarded but tell me who you are the fairest and the youngest of so many alas sir i am not worth money now she answered with her white hands clasped together there is none of my race to pay ransom now there is not even a wealthy friend to help or to shelter oria the princess oria the lilybud of kajori the last of the royal house of georgia to which the race of rurik is a mushroom princess oria i do you homage as i made her a low salute which i would not have offered to the czar himself she turned away as if she would not see it and a soft sob made me feel afraid this was not one of your haughty mesdames who let the men fancy that they carry them by storm while they laugh in their own proud breasts with knowledge that they are the masters as soon as they like i could hear the princess d in the distance rating the man who carried her on the cushion provided in front of him and i knew that he had a bad time of it what are the commands of your royal highness i asked with an emphasis on the title which she alone of the proud bevy could claim behold i am proud to be your slave she rose to the remembrance of her childhood when she had been made much of as the last descendant of queen tamara and then her pride melted into a flood of tears and the sense of helpless maidenhood she tried to say something but it only came to sobs trust yourself to me i said i cannot leave you here at the mercy of drunken cossacks i am sur imar of the lesghians not a moslem but a christian by the body of christ none shall harm you while i live there was no time for further adjurations she bowed her beautiful head and drew down her long veil and in a moment the love of my life was in my arms and on the soft pillow in front of me with my horse at full gallop in the broad stretch of the moon like an image of marble she lay before me and i touched her as if she were an image of glass the troopers were astonished when we overtook them but they knew better than to say a word or down they would have gone russian princess and all for i was not in the cue to stand insolence having given my orders i kept in the rear grudging even the moon between the bars of shadow a glimpse at the figure in my precious trust but no man can think of such things and then tell them for they only come once in the nightmare of life shamyl was delighted when we brought him his fair prisoners and he did his very best in his peasant style to be courteous and polite to them as the leader of the expedition i had the privilege of introducing them and it was really a fine thing to see how they behaved to him and he to them he gave himself airs which made me smile and before so much rank and beautyinfidel though it might behe forgot for the moment that he was the prophet of the lord and as for the ladies although they were bound in consistency to abhor him not only did they forego the attempt but all who had rank to make such a claim decent insisted upon having a lock of his hair in a word the princesses were all so happy when by means of a flag of truce they had received from their friends a large supply of raiment and other luxuries that the hope of getting a firstrate figure for them was endangered instead of frantic adjurations and despairing outcries their letters now were full of bright descriptions and gay narratives and proud as we were of their good opinions we could not afford them to that extent it became needful on this behalf to send the fair captives to a duller place to some desolate spot where even a woman could not contrive to see much of the world darghi in the depths of daghestan and far away even from the echoes was a place of so lofty a character that the fashions of the ark were as valid as the latest announced from paris and thither i was ordered to conduct these ladies for the creation of discontent among them the scenery being beautiful but sparsely populated and if the love of nature were by any means as potent in the russian breast as the english ladies now declare it to have grown in theirs perfect happiness should have been the lot of these fair princesses there was nothing to disturb them beauty reigned on every side and beauty should have reigned within but alas that human nature never at least in its feminine state and form finds satisfaction in the outward type among the rugged mountains and with frequent shift and much discomfort these fair creatures had been bright and cheerful and perilously amiable a flag on a rock or a drum at the corner or the flash of a helmet in the hollow was enough to send their active minds into fifty pleasant flutters but here they had no stir of war no delightful dreads to rouse them only the depths of lonely peace and the repose for which they had so often sighed for a day or two they tried to enjoy it and spoke of the pleasures of their childhood and roved about in cotton jackets as if they were longing to be peasants our duty was to defend them only and never interfere with them so long as they kept within certain bounds and we gave them no cause to complain of us but endeavoured to do our duty well as sentries of so many moneybags strange as it must appear there was nothing that irritated them more than this they could not bear to be regarded in that light and being too proud to come out of it themselves what did they do but send their maidsthey may not have meant it but so it came to passto produce a flirtation among my men precautions had been taken as we thought against any process of that sort by detailing for this custody only grizzled veterans who had wives at home and could not understand a single word of russian but this though a step in the right direction did not go quite far enough and several of our villagers beyond the prime of life behaved in a manner more appropriate to their sons so that i found myself compelled in the proper discharge of my office to use increasing diligence from day to day for one of the russian ladies being the mother of two little girls had obtained permission to bring her favourite french governess as lively a girl as ever lived and acquainted with halfadozen languages this mademoiselle de jfor i will show her the same consideration as her wealthier comradeswas perpetually forming little plots of the wildest and most romantic kind for the escape of all the captive band with a view to that she took upon herself to inspect me closely every time i came to a little gate newly put across the pass by my special orders which had created much offence inside there was no other way by which these ladies who now placed every confidence in me could manage to get away at all without perpendicular motion unless it were the narrow winding passage leading into a sombre wood and there i had wolves painted up in great russian capitals so that few feminine eyes had the courage even to look at the signboard and this is how it should be with them for we do not wish them to be like us i was trying to get out of that condition of the mind into which i had been cast by a very few words and still fewer glances from that lovely princess oria whom i remembered as a very little maiden leading some procession when i was a lad at tiflis if ever any boy has any heart to lose when it ought to be gone upon play and mischief mine had taken a sally out of me at sight of that young darling trying to walk in a stately manner as she had been instructed and resolute to bring her soft innocent self to the stiffness of the great occasion how i had longed to lift her up among them and shoutthis is your queen if you had a spark of courage behold the pink eagle on her shoulder but now it was a very different thing the duty of an officer in trust was laid upon me and if the men of georgia would not stand up for their race what had any outer tribe to do with it the main point before me was to conquer foolish yearnings and behave as a figure made of steel and leather and without the interference of that glittering little governess the rapture and the anguish of my life would not have been i came down the narrow pass one evening towards dusk to see to the posting of the sentinels and to receive any message from the ladies concerning their welfare and their general ideas for they were beginning to write very craving letters and entreaties that would move a heart of stone to husbands and fathers who were made of money to rescue them from this seclusion all these we forwarded and shamyl calculated that every letter would be worth to us a thousand roubles on the average but money was not in my thoughts at all and even the sense of duty fled when i saw through the bars not the french woman only but a figure very closely veiled and endeavouring not to be seen in the twilight of a rock poor little soul she will die she will die said the lady from paris with a very light sigh as if with the thought that we must all do that those fat princesses what is it then they are punishing her to the death poor little one but why do i speak to monsieur the commander monsieur the commander will rejoice in that occurrence because the poor little one is not endowed with gold alas it is so everywhere except in france young lady allow me to enter it is my place to see to the safety of you all i have not entered after sundown hitherto but stand aside lady or you may be harmed she saw that i would break the gate open at a thrustfor we allowed them to lock themselves in at night monsieur the commander how imperious he is she exclaimed with a wicked smile as she turned the key i thanked her and then put my arm across the passage as the other young lady seemed about to fly pardon fair princess but i cannot have it thus i said with an attempt to look official i am not your warder only but your guardian you trusted yourself to my care that night a thousand shamyls shall not take you from me can you not trust yourself to me again have i given you reason to regret it i have longed to be with you every moment but have i ever dared to approach you i spoke in her native language which was very delightful to her ears after so much russian speak then with good courage thou silly child tell the brave commander all the insults piled upon thee by the proud and fat princesses alas good heaven there they are calling me again who would not think that i was born to be their slave brave commander the time is now for thee with these words away ran mademoiselle de j then oria spoke without shrinking from me and her voice was as clear as the melody of a river when the winter has released it and the spring is on its banks sur imar thou hast been very good to me if i placed no confidence in such a kind defender never could i hope to be defended any more but now i am safe among all these great ladies i am not one of those who shriek at every shadow to that i can bear witness i answered very softly to remind her of the night when she lay upon my horse but what can i do if the princess will not trust me at this gentle reproach all her generous nature sprang forth like the sun in a tempest she threw aside her veil and came close to me and was not afraid to fix her eyes on mine sur imar is that faith enough she asked as she gave me her soft hand long enough to last for many an hour of dreaming it is all i can ask for the present i replied and she turned away her face but not her form illustration she turned away her face fearing to bring her into contumely among her proud companions whose voices we could hear not far away i retired from the gate with the proper martial tread but not before i had obtained her promise to meet me on the morrow at the foot of the winding passage into the black wood but she was not to venture up the path until she saw me there for truly there had been a wolf prowling near it according to the children of the peasants therefore i had taken care to keep our golden ladies from risking ten thousand good crowns perhaps apiece to the cause of freedom which they were ready to embrace as soon as they knew both sides of it by venturing into those gaunt and lonely shadows where no man could hear them while being devoured in this assurance i had every hope of treating confidentially the position of the princess oria and if that desirable wolf would only form number three at the interview who could say what might come of it but even his youngest cub if he had any might have regarded me with contempt if he had seen the condition i was in while waiting for the footstep of my love for they look at such matters in a less submissive way unworthy as i was of the joy i then attained even the pleasure of remembering it would be justly taken from me if i lowered it by any ordinary words for any one else it seems enough to know that after some talk of affairs in general and trifles we pretended to be full of my beauty my darling my gift from heaven my own and my only love confessedthat i was as much to her as she could be to me at this point the lesghian prince became unable to proceed with his narrative i felt that i should have been ten times worse if i had won and then lost his daughter so i grasped his strong hand which was trembling not a little and hoping that soft memories might subside to gentle sympathies departed with my love for him increased and my reverence not diminished when i saw him next he had gathered up his courage and was a little ashamed of his own breakdown and he tried to tell the rest of his sad story as if it were the sorrow of a cousin or a comrade chapter xxiv imars talepeace happiness appears to me to resemble the black eagle of the mountains more than the fair dove of the proverb restless and swift of wing it flutters scarcely long enough for a hover over any home of ours and even then too high for us to be sure that we have seen it not until it is gone can we believe that it has been with us and we know in our hearts that to look for it destroys the chance of seeing it shamyl was in a rage that oria dared to pledge her faith to me without consulting the mountainlion as his flatterers now called him whether he hoped to make money of her or what other reason he may have had i will not pretend to say but when by means of my good service and without the loss of a single man he secured all those fair prizes and thus recovered his favourite son not to mention an excellent sum in cash and good wives for some of his officers the least he should have done in my opinion was to smile and pour his blessing upon the union of oria and imar instead of that on the very day when the last of the russian ladies left the lonely recesses of darghi he sent a score of his bodyguard without even the courtesy of asking my consent to escort the princess oria to his own headquarters bad breeding here made a great mistake as it usually does among gentlemen for if he had sent his orders to me as the officer to whom he had intrusted the captives i should have felt myself bound to obey him however much against my liking but being treated in this rough manner which the avar chief was too fond of employing i threw off at once my allegiance to himwhich was not that of a tribesman and had been already encroached upon a little too uncouthly for at present he was quite prosperous and seemed well able to hold his ownthough the enemy had begun already their new plan of campaign by which they prevailed in the end against himso that there could be no dishonour in leaving him with his glory if the russians had been pressing on him i would not have quitted him though nothing would have made me leave the princess at his mercy for when she confided herself to me what things i said and what vows i made and what contempt i truly felt for every human being who thought lightly of such loftiness those officers who came with shamyls orders were as faithful as could be to him but ten times as many would not have availed to march my oria eastwards this lady goes with me i said she will be my wife in three days time just when you rejoin the camp i will give you a letter to that effect to the inspired commander my men also will come with me and if as the general he has any need of them hereafter they will be at his service you know that i do not speak in vain they all knew that and many no doubt wished that they also were homeward bound they went one way and we the other and the sons of gloomy islam heard the songs of our rejoiceful faith borne back to them through the mountain passes by the soft air from the west for three or four years after that i led a very peaceful life happy in the perfect love of oria and the esteem of my faithful tribe being thoroughly versed in mountain war we made ourselves respected by the badly armed and undisciplined races to the westward and the north of us if they attempted an inroad as their manner was upon us for their sakes we regretted it but for our own were gratified because instead of plundering us of our honest crops and cattle they always lost their thievish own so that we grew very comfortable and poverty was unknown among us we sternly repressed all robbery and to afford an abiding lesson to neighbours of lax principle we deprived them of the means of outrage placing these under our own control at one time the numerous osset tribes far beyond rukhans rule promised to join him in the plunder of our prosperity but before they could mature their contradictory ideas we passed with a chosen band through their only fruitful places obtaining many specimens of things we cannot cultivate and leaving them so much to talk of that they fell with one accord upon one another so that they were compelled to send a humble petition to us for seed as soon as the sun came back again these little matters kept our arms from rusting and our bodies from torpor we injured no one who did not require it and we taught them to abstain from injury we encouraged literature in every village possessing two men who could read and within ten miles of karthlos tower there were five or six poets growing all this i mention not by way of vaunt but to show how much can be accomplished when the mind is easy but alas before these great reforms had taken solid root with us the final advance of the russian forces hurried us to the war again shamyl the gallant patriot who had for a generation baffled the power of a boundless empire was at last being crushed by weight of numbers and worn out by perpetual blows by forcing his scanty troops together and closing the defiles around them the stubborn invaders now had him in a grip like a wolf blocked in his own den to starve he called upon all who had shared his successes to help him in this last resource and loth as i was to leave my happy home and peaceful villages honour and good faith must not be starved by our prosperity my sweet wife who had never admired the great captain as the russian ladies did prayed and wept and coaxed in vain she brought my two children the boy and the girl to show me that i ought to think of more than mere abstractions innocent flesh of my own flesh and tender bone of my own bone and eyes more bright than any star in all the sky of glory what had the wolf of the mountains done to make me love him more than these i stood at the gate with my arm around her trembling form and my beautiful boy just three years old clung to my leg and kissed my knee and the little baby always wise who now has come to be dariel looked at me through her mothers hair with the sparkle of the brighter world babes come from still unquenched by earth what was pride to me or glory if i could not find them here but love has never yet sufficed to keep a man contented he grows ashamed of living in it and his manhood argues that if he lets his darlings wrap it all in warmth and softness it will soon cease to be worth their care i put my wife and children by with a prayer to the lord to protect them and went to do my duty how often i looked back and thoughtas all i loved grew further offthat a mans first duty is to those who cannot live without him moreover that i should be punished for casting eyes upon and longing for stirring rather than steadfast life badly begun and sadly ended was to be the rule of it at the outset thus our little band familiar as they once had been with every twist of the mountainchain and every tangle of the gorges had managed by living in peace so long to get their memories confused and even when they hit upon the way they found it stopped by cossack outposts at the very points that we used to guard but after many a climb and crawl we contrived to rejoin the brave imaum i was admitted to him at once and saw by the weariness of his eyes and the looseness of his attitude that he knew it was all over he was sitting at a table with the lamp behind him and his shaggy head thrown backward so that the light played down the furrows of his heavy forehead as from below one sees the moon glistening down a wrinkled steep with his usual scorn of ceremony he did not rise but grasped my hand imar thou art a man he said with his guttural voice such as all the avars have now a little tremulous if all had been as true as thou i should not look like this tonight it is russian gold that has conquered us tomorrow i surrender this was such a shock to me that i could not reply immediately not that i cared for the cause of islam to which he had been devoted neither did i detest the russians or dream that we with so many races all at feud with one another could ever form a nation but i felt as any true man would feel a reverence for this dauntless hero who had held his own so long against resistless odds and sorrow at the close of a career so grand i have fought a good fight i have held the faith i have not striven for my own glory but in the cause of god most high if it is his holy will to forsake us there is no more for man to do it was useless of course to argue with him a man at all open to argument would not have done much against russia and when i met my few surviving friends among his gallant officers they told me that his last defence was gone his force reduced to four hundred men and all his inaccessible retreats cut off the enemy had blocked him in his last hole for his own life he cared little as he had proved a thousand times but the few who still remained faithful to him and were ready to die at his side surely it would have been a mean requital to drive them like sheep into the butchers yard therefore must he yield at last we were talking dismally about all this and saying that the mountains would never again be fit for a gentleman to live in when i received another call to shamyls room and had another interview with him he had spent some time in prayer and been rewarded with a holy vision from on high so that his eyes were full of fire and his countenance shone with happiness one would scarcely believe that gloom and ferocity so often darkened that wondrous face i have received the word of the lord the holy voice of allah to whom be all praise and glory imar of the kheusurs it is not for thee to hear it being but an outer infidel it is commanded that thou shouldest depart from among the chosen warriors of heaven that they who bear witness be of the true faith if thou and thy men can escape behold it is my duty to aid thee and verily i rejoice for thou hast been a faithful friend to us if he rejoiced i could tell him of some one who rejoiced a hundredfold to escape a russian jail and exile from his wife and children even if his life were spared of which there was no certainty after the many atrocities committed by my very noble friend perhaps it was not magnanimous on my part to declineif good luck should allow itthe glory of being shot or starved for the sake of the beloved country but a lot of cross tangles came into that question was it my country in the first place if it was should i help it by quitting it so and again would that beloved land show equal love to me when gone by attending to my belongings no land i have heard of has ever done that therefore i showed my love of my country by deciding to remain inside it commander of the caucasus i said knowing that he liked that appellation though he never commanded half of it a revelation such as thine is not to be disregarded but how is it to be carried out by many devices and some fighting we have made our way to thee but the foe hath closed in at our heels our little band could never hope to pass the russian lines again thrice hast thou come to life again when the enemy proclaimed thee dead but this is beyond even thy resources he smiled with the pleasant smile of a man who feels himself underrated imar it is not that i am beaten in the powers of the mind he said but never was there mortal born and filled with the breath of the lord from birth who could vanquish the love of gold in men the son of manoah could not do it neither even our great prophet i who have gifts from heaven also suited to a weaker age am beaten by that accursed power it is gold alone that hath vanquished shamyl believing that this upon the whole was true i left him to his sad reflections but presently he raised his head again and looked at me with his old grim smile he spread out his woolly arms and spoke with a large mouth quivering knowest thou that i could carry off every man of my four hundred left and laugh at the russian beleaguerers this night i would do it and let them smell for us in the morning but to what effect to kill a russian is no dinner all the passes are closed against us and all our villages occupied the winter is nigh we should be no more than hungry wolves upon the mountains but thou art young thou hast a home to go to and art not of our religion take thy faithful fifty and go this night my son will show thee how no more that was the last i saw of shamyl and this much i will say for him he never sent any man to face a peril which he himself would shrink from neither did he fight for his own ambition or hide in his turban one copek the russians behaved very generously and even nobly to him and in the quiet evening of his days he may have looked back with sorrow upon his barbarities against them our little band had never shared in any of those atrocities therefore it would be better for us if we could not escape capture to fall into the hands of the foe as a separate detachment than to surrender with the general and this was my reason for attempting an escape rather than any fair prospect of success in such a situation but strange to say by means of a tunnel in the cliff unknown to the enemy and then some most perilous scaling of rockssuch as englishmen delight in but a native of the mountains prefers to do by deputyand then some midnight rushes through blockaded passes and defiles we contrived with the loss of two men only to regain our own abodes but more than a month had thus been spent after we quitted shamyl in wandering fighting and lying close going out of our way for sustenance and being driven out of it by enemies and tempests with men to stop them not a horse to help them no supplies to start with and no villagefolk to provide them nothing but the fruit the bears had left to keep body and soul togethereven veterans of shamyls training might have been proud to force passage thus alas that we ever achieved it for my mens sake i am glad of course but for my own i would that god had seen fit in his mercy to lay me dead by a russian gun or stretch me frozen on the mountain side chapter xxv imars talecrime it was late of an october afternoon when my heart which had been low with hunger hardship and long weariness began to glow with hope and love as i stood at the bottom of our karthlos steep there was no fusilier on guard and the granite steps and groins were choked with snow but i sent my followers to their homes as was only fair to them with orders to come to a sheepandgoat supper if their appetites remained when they had embraced their families then i sounded the great horn fogged with cobwebs hanging above the lower gate and with only my faithful milkbrother stepan and one other trooper who belonged to our old tower breasted the rugged and crooked ascent how wild with delight will my oria be i thought as i laboured through the drifts for there had been no opportunity of sending any letter how lonely she must have been sweet soul and trembling with hope of a word from me but when we reached the upper gate there was no one even there on guard the brazen cannon once kept so bright were buried in winding sheets of snow and even the terrace before the door which it was a point of hospitality to keep cleanswept for travellers was glittering with untrodden drift we were all in such a ragged and savage state of body that i had ordered my two men to go round to the entrance for the maidens and meant to do the same myself unless my darling met me but now in my fierce anxiety i thrust the main doors open and stood in the hall which was cold and empty no sound of my wifes step no patter of little feet no welcome no answer no gladness anywhere doubt and terror kept me standing there but i shouted in hope of some great mistakeoria my wife my wife and then upon the chance that she might be outorry my little son my boy my call rang along the passages on either side and up the stairs and shook the plumes of mountaingrass which she had placed in the vases but neither wife nor child appeared and in my famished and haggard state i fell upon a chair and my heart began to beat as if it would leap out of me then i saw a tall and stately lady in a dress of velvet and with a serpent of white fur wound beneath her jewelled bosom coming down the gray stone staircase with her eyes fixed on me but not a word of speech my voice failed me as it does in a dream when a sword is pointed at ones throat but the lady came and stood before me and a child was clinging to her dress she looked at me with some surprise and contempt for my ragged condition but spoke as if she had never known a tear imar art thou not in haste to embrace thy twin sister marva the wrong thou hast done should not destroy all memory of the early days when hers was thine and thine was hers i am prepared to forgive thee imar in this time of tribulation to forgive i never harmed thee va i answered using her childish name as i always did in thoughts of her but none of that now where is my wife hath any one dared to injure her weak as i was i leaped up from the chair and it would have gone ill with marvafor what is a sister compared to a wifeif she had showed signs of flinching but she gazed at me with a quiet disdain as if i could not command myself i have not touched thy precious wife i have not even set eyes on her she hath done the injury to me that is worse than theft of goods and cattle yet have i come hither to do the duty she hath forsaken and comfort her deserted husband from his mad adventures while his treasure of a wife his royal princess oria heiress to a hundred thrones is enjoying herself at the hot springs in the world of fashion and luxury with my noble husband rakhan what i said or did or thought i know notperhaps nothing the world was all in a whirl with me and perhaps i fainted in my wornout state it does not matter what i did from the strongest man in the caucasus i was struck to the level of the weakest child even my twin sister with a womans petty spite inflamed by jealousy and bitter wrong had some of the echoes of childhood roused and thought of the time when she loved me it is the part of a fool she said meaning it for large comfort to be so wild about a woman and the phantasy that they call love when i was a child i believed in it and to what has it brought me to cast away my life upon a man who swore that i was all the world to him and believed it perhaps while i was new but lo in a year he was weary of me because i made too much of him hath princess oria done that nay or thou wouldst be weary of her tush what careth she for her lord and why should he take it to heart like this there are plenty of women in the world my brother and the more their husbands make of them the less will they return it i am the one that should lament not thou for i have lost a man but thou a woman only my husband will come back to me when he is weary of thy georgian doll and i shall be forced to welcome him but thou such is the law thou hast it at thy pleasure to be free talk not to me i said for this was salt rubbed into my gashes go and get me food that i may recover a little of my strength and then thou also shalt be free many a time have i wondered whether she knew what i meant by those last words if she knew it she said nothing but marched away in her stately style dragging by the hand her child who had been staring at my face all the time as if he had never seen a man before marvas own servants brought me food and i knew not what it was but took it not for life so much as deathfor death of rakhan the adulterer some sleep as well was needful to me before i could accomplish thatsleep to restore the power of thought which seemed to have left me imbecile as well as the vigour of my jaded body no further would i enter my own house but collected some rugs and bearskinsfor we had not even a bourka leftand was about to throw myself on a couch when marvas little boy came dancing half in fright and half in glee at his own selfimportance with a crumpled letter for me that she should send it by such hands is enough to show how she was changed i saw that it was from my enemy and by the light of the one lamp they had brought me read the words that follow beloved brother imaras thou hast given me to wife a beggar and a shrew to boot it is but just that i should have a share of thine to comfort me she is soft and young and fair and i have taken such affection for her and she for me as the nature of women is that i will not charge thee for her clothes and lodgings for at least a twelvemonth then if she hath a son she shall remain another twelvemonth for marvas child though strong and stout is dumb from birth and cannot be accepted therefore as chief prince of ossets son of dadian this relieves thee of the cares that oppress thee mostthe lust of money which hath made thee play the rogue the peril of subservience to thy wife which overtaketh weak mankind and the fear of having more children than thine avarice would make welcome thou hast robbed me of good substance i relieve thee of light stuff and even that if thou carest to lay claim thou shalt have again without any charge thy sister i leave to thy care meanwhile she hath never had share of her fathers goods and even thy greed cannot deny her meal and milk till her tongue grows mild her raiment is with her and will last until i am ready for her again unless thou dost relax of the robbery thou hast rejoiced in for five years now and givest her the garments of her mother as well as the third part of her fathers goods thy wife sends her duty to thee and bids me say that she likes thee still but loves the man who hath his arm around her and doth not leave her to pine alone we shall pass a month at patigorsk where the hot springs tend to warmth of love and then if thou hast aught to say we shall not shut thee out again after doing this for thy benefit thy good brother rakhan prince of the ancient ossets chapter xxvi imars talerevenge in the morning i arose with all my strength renewed and the sense of wrong as cold as stone and keen as steel throughout me my brother stepan was at my side for he had come to watch me knowing what i had endured and fearing that it might outdo my sense of life i smiled at him and he saw that i would smile until i made others weep not a word was said between us my wrongs were hotter in his heart than in my own for i felt doubts about myself and he had none by the sacred custom of our tribe which is a very ancient one he was bound to hold my welfare even dearer than his own when the eldest son of the chief is born and old enough to shape his lips he is sent round to the nursing mothers of the tribe to suckle whatever babe is placed with him at one breast he at the other thenceforth their lives are more than twinfor twins may often fall out and fight as did myself and marva but never those milkbrothers stepans mother was the first to whom i paid my duty in that tender way and stepans arms were twined in mine and nothing could sever our hearts thenceforth from the allegiance of boy twins as i would not enter the inner chambers where i had been so happy stepan led me to the bath and fetched another suit of travelling clothes and everything i wanted not forgetting a trusty sword and a pair of heavy pistols then we had breakfast and set forth without a word to marva my children even i durst not ask for fearing to hear that their mother had carried them into my dishonour but luckily my good horse ardon who had borne me through many adventures had been left at home when i last set forth and was neighing for me in the road below for none but a mule or mountainpony could clamber up the steep access our vehicles also we kept below using handlitters to the gates of karthlos for ladies or feeble travellers and thus we three set forth on horseback with provisions for three daysmyself and stepan and the other trooper who had returned with me from guinib a faithful and brave fellow who is with me now named usnik others would have joined us in the valley but i would not have them enough of disgrace already the roads or tracks as you would call them bad enough at any time were now at many places blocked by heavy and windy snowfalls for the season was come to the middle of october and winter had set in early any one who sees not much of such things and might be in a mood to consider them would have found no small delight in the grandeur of the world around but all that i could think of was the bitterness and baseness of the human race that breathed therein and when we had passed the posthouse where i kept my troika for long journeys and learned that the princess had taken my carriage three days ago when the weather was fair and ordered the driver to proceed with all possible haste to patigorsk my last hope fell and before me rose only the fury of revenge and then the despair of a desert life to that town whose name was now poison to me where dissolute russians came to revel and vile circassians to sell their daughters the journey from karthlos in the best of weather was a matter of three days and now with the road so cumbered and the buffet of thick snowstorms often dashing in our faces it seemed as if a week was likely still to find us struggling vainly but about noontide of the second day being on the northern fall of mountains and within the boundaries of ossetland we came to a fork of the torrent channel which here served for a roadway and we knew not whether to go right or left as for any guidance the chance was small one traveller in a winter week was enough for such a road as that the harvesting of the tissuegrass between the crags was over the neatherd the shepherd and the goatherd had long driven home their charges we knew not what to do until one of us espied a little drift of smoke among the pinetrees on the ridge and i sent the hardy usnik on foot in that direction while we rested the horses and awaited his return by this time the wind had dropped a little but a white vapour rolled in and out the crags and forest as if a giant lay snorting among them and the air felt like the breath of death stepan strode up and down when he had tied the horses slapping his bosom to keep himself warm but i sat upon a rock and cast my eyes upon the ground i was thinking of what i had heard from an englishman who had been our guest at karthlos he had told me of the savage gaze of prince rakhan at my then beloved wife when he met her at our summerfeast of roses when i had been called away from home why who comes here on this evil travelling day cried stepan turning suddenly my lord will have company i think but not of the kind he delights in his dark look showed me that there was something to be met and leaping to my feet i beheld a company of horsemen advancing towards us by the road upon our left they broke through the drifts by twos and threes which was all that the track in its widest parts admitted but the one who rode first rode singly and he was a big man stern and swarthy the slope they were descending showed us a score of men wellarmed behind him behold they are too many for us let us fly up the other road stepan loosed the horses as he spoke they will kill my lord and then where is our revenge what matters my life to me whoever they are i will not fly but why should they desire to kill us stepan they look not like bandits and they are not russians nay but they are worse than either they are ossets of the karai khokh who go either side of the mountains their chief is dead and they are rakhans children now rakhan rides first in this handful rakhan shall have speech with me i spoke with the heart of my spirit rising as the lord has granted it to rise when he has beaten down the body rakhan is welcome i will salute him the man had been out of my sight so long not only because of my service with shamyl but through his own avoidance of me that i did not know his face for certain till i met his eyes then i felt sure what my duty was as god himself ordained it when he made man to be true to woman and woman true to man and their children to spring of their own loinsthere was no choice left me but to slay this man or be slain by him having this within my mind and being calmer than i can be now in looking back upon it i stood across the narrow track and took the horse that rakhan rode by the head and gazed at rakhan he was amazed at first and the colour of his great black eyes turned paler and he fumbled for a pistol without daring to take his gaze from mine i would not speak but i struck his hand up with a flip of mine the lips that had sullied my dear wifes should have no sort of speech with mine he tried to regard me humorously as a man who thinks woman his slave blinks eye when the question is about her but the sparkle of his gaze died under mine like an ember with the sun on it get off thy horse prince rakhan stepan shouted with his big arm laid across the time hath come for man to man instead of lying with another mans wife rakhan made pretence to smile and to leap from horseback lightly what a stir to make about a lightoflove fool that knows not what a woman is stand back my sons this is not for you the ossets took their orders gladly every savage man loves to see a fight they leaped from their horses and squatted in the snow and filled their pipes and kindled them there was a clear place close at hand with a ring of black cedars round it and room inside for stepping to and fro if life and death required it i threw off my furs and so did he and we stood against one another hold is this what you call fair duel his sword is three inches longer than mine rakhan shouted and i saw that it was just although i had not dreamed of it i threw away my blade and took stepansa common short weapon stout and broad one thing before i slay thee imar said rakhan with his bright genoese on guard and i saw that my sword was as nothing to his young man it was i who slew thy father and now by the same hand thou shalt die before the words were finished he advanced upon me taking the cowards advantage as he hoped of striking me when stricken with that shock but i just drew back for a moment and then when he made sure that he had me and the point of his weapon flashed into my breast up flew his steel like the sparks of a flint and my short strong blade rushed through his heart he gave me one glare and he lay between my feet with a gurgle of blood spouting out upon the snow go home to the devil that made thee i said and commit adultery if thou canst in hell then stepan drew the lids upon those toadstool eyes and gazed at me with terror for there are times when the god that made us takes us out of his own knowledge with the passions himself has placed in us stepan thought that i would have slain him too for doing this ministry to the dead but he did not understand me i was quiet as a lamb and would not have resisted if any one had seized that bloody sword and driven it through my own heart too is there any one among you men i asked coming out into the road before themany milkbrother of prince rakhan who feels a desire to encounter me i am weary now and he will have fine chance or he can shoot at me if he likes but they smoked their pipes and hugged their knees together and glanced at their horses as if they loved their backs how different it would have been with my own tribe in this stir i was forgetting about usnik and his message the first half is finished now for the second i shouted to stepan from ardons back as i spurred him up the track by which the ossets had descended this must be the way to the princess oria for what else could i suppose after meeting rakhan there but the ossets who were departing by the road which had brought us hither said something to stepan and he fetched me back and pointed to the track upon our right hand at the same time usnik returned from the fire in the wood and the result of his inquiry agreed with what rakhans retainers had declared patigorsk could be reached by either road but the one on the left was blocked for wheels and would soon be closed to horses if i wished to follow the course of the troika the road on the right was the one to choose moreover at about three hours distance it passed a summerhouse or huntinglodge belonging to the osset chief but at this time of year unoccupied where if we could get no further as appeared too likely already we could shelter our horses for the night and kindle fire for ourselves patigorsk was the place i wanted and i took what seemed to be the best road to it as we three set forth again with our horses looking consideratefor these are better endowed than we are with knowledge both of sky and grounda little toss of white softness met us harbouring into our eyes and beards the ears and forelocks of our horses pricked themselves with a glittering fringe and then their manes were like a fountain and the bow of the saddle became an arch presently we could see nothing at all but left it to them to find the way which they did without any complaint not even making a merit of obedience i let the bridle fall and wished that i could only submit to god as these good creatures do our will and never even seek for thanks we went on thus with the snowcloud thickening and black rocks or a bough of pine jumping out of the white against us when suddenly my horse pulled up and his chin was striking something he seemed to know it and so did i it was the black rail of my troika in which we had enjoyed so many a summer jaunt in the days when my oria loved me the carriage was standing in the middle of the road but there was no oria in it neither any other human being nor even a horse in front of it the cushions were gone the contents were snow her highness must be close at hand cried stepan leaning over it and yonder is rakhans pleasurelodge god grant that the wolves have not gotten her one wolf hath had her but he will no more i answered with my heart on fire through all the snow that froze my breast thou and usnik hold the horses i will see to this myself then i stamped on the road and shook the snow off and saw that it was red with my own blood where the dead mans sword had touched me and following the shelter of some trees where the streaks of the storm went by me i stood at the door of a house built of logs with plaster slabbed between them thrice i knocked with the hilt of my sword without drawing it from the scabbard while i felt that the crisis of my life was comethe time that comes only once thank god in his creatures three score years and ten how soon thou art back how glad i am this is so kind and faithful of thee it was orias voice and i ground my teeth she expected her new love rakhan then she drew back the bolt and stood before me glittering in all her perfect beauty but pale as a ghost at this surprise my lord she gasped for she was always timid and i said yes thy proper lord her hand went to her heart as if it were failing her in this amazement and she spread the other arm to me but i drew back and gazed at her never touch me more i said and her soft eyes fell before the flash of mine what have i done to enrage thee imar thou hast never spoken to me like this i have left thy roof but how could i help it i have done what women may not do but it was only for thy sakeand oh my lord is wounded yes through thee but what is that i stretched my scabbarded sword across as she with a rush of tears approached thy paramour lies dead for this and what art thou liar adulteress zanska that last is the lowest word that can be used to any woman she gazed at me for a moment with a look that will never leave me and then in a low clear voice she said it is enough no woman of my race must hear that name from her lord and live she bowed her head as if receiving the sentence of death submissively and then walked slowly towards the inner room at the door she turned and waved her hand with a proud and calm farewell to me i knew what it meant and sprang towards her but my scabbard struck the doorpost my feet were cased in ice and snow and i fell on my back in the outer room as a flash came from the inner illustration at the door she turned with a proud and calm farewell to me help help my lord will bleed to death lady oria baboushka the voice was not stepans but kobaduks and i felt my boiling blood run cold what dost thou here what have i done i shouted rising clumsily for my wound had burst forth through the fall old man thy mistress hath shot herself what dost thou in rakhans service nought have i to do with rakhan sur imar knows not what he saith baboushka and i have been with the lady all the way from karthlos till i went to yon village for food for us i fell against the wall and stared at him then stepan stood also in the doorway and his voice was like the moan of death it is true sur imar the troika hath broken down at this gate the princess oria hath never seen rakhan neither came she to see him i laughed i shouted as at some fine joke i see i see my sweet mistake he came not from her he came to seek her ah but he met the wrong one the wrong one it was and yet the right what matter what i did or said henceforth in all my life what matters and when it is over can i be saved if so it will be for orias sake thank god that she knew before she died slain by the weapon which she had brought to protect her honourand rakhan would have tasted cold lead i trow if his miscreant scheme had entrapped herby the mercy of god she knew in that short hour the hellish fraud which slew her the bullet had not touched her heart and she passed away as a flower fades drooping from some inward harm my pistols were left in my holsters but i loaded orias again that i might not be slow to follow her the moment she could not see it done but she opened her eyes for the last time when they seemed to have lost all sight of earth and she tried to lay her hand on mine with deep love looking back upon me through the cloud of death for orrys sake for babes for mine she whispered with her latest breath i pledged my word but how often was it almost beyond my power to keep and one of my pledges was lost already when i got hometo my desolate and wretched homethere was only my baby dariel left to link me to this altered world marva was gone back to her osset tower and it seemed better so for i had brought her husbands lying letter handed me by kobaduk and purporting to come from her to wit an urgent summons for my wife to fly to my bedside and nurse me through a dangerous wound at patigorsk this letter i meant to place on marvas lap and ask if she were privy to it i hope not i pray not for it would be almost too blackhearted too treacherous for the worst womans revenge i hope she believed that oria whom she always hated had left home through her own desire to meet rakhan in that festive town for a woman has not strong faith always in the virtue of other women to her own faith she will be true but she doubts about theirs too shrewdly women of the common sort i mean my oria was too sweet for that chapter xxvii imars taleexile you understand from what i said that my only son was gone as well the eldest born of our fervent love to whom with a pleasant conceit i had given the name of origenborn of oria the other was named from the place of her own birth arriving unexpectedly when we went in the troika to see the great posthouse just built by the russians on their grand new road which cuts the great mountainchain beneath the towering peak of kazbek unnatural it may seem and sluggish and even an abject thing to those who have never lost their courage but when i was carried up the steps of karthlos with the body of my wife on the other litter and the carpenter ordered to remember my length in the boards he was cutting out for herfor we are a thrifty race holding fast the hide when we have lost the hornsand i managed to say at my own thresholdlet me see my babies behold there was only one brought to me and she could not walk nor say dadda as babies of every language do nevertheless without excuse she took my liking as of right lying so and smiling at me with the faith of baby eyes and the beginning of a clever nose and pink lips parted like a berry as if i had a breast for her sweetie it is thy father not thy mother the woman who bore her said and if he hath no breast for thee his heart shall be all the nigher sur imar this is all the lord hath left thee for thy home and heart gather thy life up for her sake i saw the likeness of her mother in her and she came into my helpless arms and laid her soft face in my beard and played with the bandage round my wound and they say that she spoke her first word thus but women must not be trusted when their imaginations move them as soon as i was able to think more clearly i asked for my boy origen they told me as soon as they thought it safe that on the second day after my departure the very day of my fatal deeds the poor little fellow scarce three years old was killed through his own high courage my sister who reigned in the castle now had given orders that he should be kept apart from her own child hafer and in the top rooms where the nursery was with a separate staircase to it perhaps she desired that even in childhood there should be no acquaintance between the offspring of oria and her own but my little orry was as strong and active as an average child of twice his years and he could not endure to be cooped up thus he contrived to get out of a loophole and thence to the head of the outer staircase and so upon the tablecliff behind the house where he ran frolicking among the snow this rock is perpendicular upon all its southern face and the dumb child hafer seeing orrys delight ran out to share it from a lower door while his mother was away upon some business with only two trusty servants soon one of our women heard my boy shouting and laughing at the other child who could not shout and instead of tempting them in with a sweetmeat the thoughtless girl ran after them of course they ran away and before she could catch them both vanished over the brink of the cliff where a crest of snow obscured it and verily she was afraid to go back to the house and tell what she had done she concealed herself behind the corner and left others to find out the loss but it was not very long unknown for marva was coming along the ravine upon her return to karthlos in the teleka which had brought her first and which she kept at the postinghouse she saw the two children lying there after their fall of two hundred feet her own child unhurt in a pile of snow and my little darling on the rocky floor with his poor head dashed to pieces for her bitter turn against me i forgave her when i heard of her tenderness to my poor child it is at such times that the greatness of a womans nature shows itself happily she knew not as yet of my encounter with her husband which must have been taking place just then but forgetting all her grievances against me she took both little ones into her carriage and drove at all speed to the postinghouse there she ordered a private room and allowed no one to come near them except her own baboushka while she sent to a village five miles off for the only doctor to be heard of he came as soon as he could but she had abandoned all hope by that time as any but a woman must have done long since and there was no one to receive him for marva had sent her own child home in dread of the effect upon his little brain and at night she appeared at the gate of karthlos with the baby heir cold as a stone in her arms his pretty red cross and his green velvet dress and above all the billows of his golden hair still flowing from the linen swathes of deathwhen the women saw these they bewailed the child of imar and of oria almost as if they had lost their own before my return he was buried in our little churchyard of the glen and his mother lies beside him i have told you a melancholy tale but when the lord has tried one child beyond his other children and almost beyond the strength vouchsafed to the best of them to bear it something good shall be yet in store and happiness may spring up again though pleasure be but a memory and the soul that has passed through rough affliction and the long cold shadow is led more kindly into the paths of shelter and content with quietude i have done enough of harm my friend i have broken up two households i have wasted half my tribe in war and slain a good few russians these you may slay by the thousand without checking the supply of them you are only guilty of their blood and the tears of those who loved them but my own losses taught me what it is to make others desolate and the rest of my life please god shall go to redeem the wrongs of wrath and war chapter xxviii sanguine still when the prince imars tale was told and i thought of all he had been through i could not find it in my heart or even in good manners to crave explanation of certain points which had not been made quite clear to me for any such inquiry might appear to proceed from a hankering to hear more about his darling daughter he had enjoyed beyond our chance a quantity of romantic love and though he might not be hard on mine remembering his own tender time and allowing for like state in others on the other hand that lesson might have taught him how to look at this before it went too far to stop and it is not in the gift of men or at least of such as i am to be certain how a brother man may take what seems so clear to self but while i was buried in these thoughts he spoke again quite cheerfully and as if he had understood them all but would not blame me for them from what i have said you will perceive that i have now two things to think of the first and dearest is my own child the daughter of the blameless wife whom i lost through my own madness the other is my duty towards the people who have been so true to me who can be raised by one who knows them to a better and more peaceful life and the first condition of happiness the rule of christianity we have had the name for ages but we have never known the meaning of which you too must wait to learn till sorrow has washed the eyes of pride that vile bloodfeud the curse of the mountains the cause of a myriad murders could not exist if we were more than mere ticketporters of the cross therefore i am doing my best without aid of your good societies which would get into trouble with russia at once to print copies of the new testament in the lesghian tongue in a short time now my period of exile fourteen years will expire and the rest of my life will be given up to the spread of goodwill amongst us thus alone can i hope to have done some good to balance my evil deeds but the difficulty of the thing is this not a man in a hundred of us can read and perhaps not a woman of all the race to meet this i am preparing primers hornbooks alphabets all the rudiments and i shall set up a school in every village it is too much for one short life but at least i can begin it and when once begun it will go on for the russians will not stop me the russians have been very good to me and they hate the rule of islam which is warlike and implacable the commander of the caucasus is a man of great humanity if he could have done as he liked i should have received at once a free pardon and as it is my revenues have never been confiscated he knows that i would be the last to attempt or join in another insurrection there never was a chance since time began of a great caucasian nation we are split into about seventy tribes and each loathes all the others young as i was when i joined shamyl the folly of it was clear to me and my father perished not by a foreign but a neighbours hand as usual that may be my fate also especially when i attempt reforms but if so i shall have done my best to redeem a life of violence as i looked at him i could wonder no more that dariel thought so little of all other men compared with him here was a man one might well believe who never knew what fear was suspicion falsehood meanness envy or even the love of money it had been the sense of justice only and no greed or jealousy which had led him to reject the demand of rakhan his fathers murderer whence all the disasters of his life ensued and it seemed to me that if ever there had lived a man of honour and kind heart who deserved the favour of heaven and the reverence of his fellows it was this man long oppressed by some mysterious curse of destiny my voice was trembling with something more than regard for my own interests when i fetched him back from his great ideas which were ever so far above my scope to the matter which concerned me most sur imar i am quite small of mind and would rather receive than do good things and of all the blessings of the blessed world you know the one that i value most he smiled a little for his face was always ready to yield to gentle turns my friend i know what your desire is you want to rob me of my one delight but i feel myself safe for a long while yet i rely upon many obstacles in the first place will your own discretion and judgment bear you out in wishing even if you had my consent to connect yourself with a race of such dark fortunes and sad calamities and crimes as wellfor crimes they are and perhaps there are more before us i have told you my tale to show you this i believe not of course in any heathen conceptionsate nemesis ananche or what not but who can deny that there is an inheritance of evil quite beyond our power to explain that may be so but my one prayer is to be allowed to risk such penalty you speak like an englishman he answered looking at me very gravely other men equally brave would decline through the force of superstition but i have only begun my objections yet for instance what would your own friends have to say about this question you have not mentioned it yet i suppose as nothing was likely to come of it but without that you must know pretty nearly how your friends would take it i answered in so many words that they left me to follow my own judgment now that while things continued as they were it would be wrong of me to forsake them as they could never get on without me but that a change for the better might be expected now with all confidence for england was sick of that farce so ridiculously called freetrade and then the land might feed her sons again instead of giving them nothing but a weedy grave it is the standing joke of europe he replied there is nothing to compare with it in history your benevolence is of the highest order because so purely unconscious but it will require another generation to restore your sanity unless you have a war that blocks your supplies and then how simple that man who can fast for forty days may challenge the nation when war is declared and outlive them all though they eat all they can get but let me not interrupt you what is the loaf compared to love the dealers and the middlemen have the chief pull of the former turn me into a radical if the labourer gets an ounce the more for his fourpence than he often did of old when his right hand stood him in good stead and his saturday night was certain but a foreigner is allowed to show the commonsense which an englishman is hooted down for hinting we shall never be as we were i said we shall always be poor sur imar and i am only a younger son if it is your duty to repel me for that reason i have nothing more to say we will not part like this he answered feigning as every man should do to be blind when another man is moved there are many things in your way my friend but i will not make the worst of them you have my respect and liking which i do not give to every one but in spite of all i have gone through or perhaps by reason of it i have some romance about me still you say that you love my daughter and i thoroughly believe it but does she love you i have no reason to think so yet what right have i to hope for it she is far above me in every way but if you do not forbid mewhy i could tryi could try my best you know it was almost more than he could do to look with becoming gravity at the sadly waning phase of hope depicted on my countenance he smiled because he could not help it and i smiled to keep time with him you are honest at any rate he said and that you have been from first to last of english modes of wooing i know nothing and they are not like ours but this strikes me as an unusual thing though perhaps all you ask is what you would call a fair field and no favour you shall have it as far as i am concerned though i will not pledge myself afterwards but remember that in a month or so we return to our native mountains this was awful news to me and i seemed to have no fair chance left moreover i felt very deep alarm concerning that prince hafer dariels cousin about whom i had heard so much and of whom i had seen too much already was he the son of that terrible woman marvasur imars sisterand that hateful man and horrible plotter rakhan prince of the ossets i had longed to ask his uncle imar for more particulars about him and especially what he was doing here but my courage had failed me on that point alas that he was no longer dumb and if he had fallen feet in his childhood no wonder that he could jump now for nature always strives towards a balance and if he could not jump feet in height which perhaps is more than any man even of the mountains has achieved it was plain enough that he would prove a very awkward customer whenever my sense of the gross injustice inflicted by his presence should urge me to attempt by hand or foot his desirable removal but one thing i might ask as i thought without showing any impertinence or reviving painful memories your sister the princess marva sir i hope she continued to show goodwill and afforded you some comfort before you were banished from daghestan she herself remains there i suppose not in daghestan but in ossetia which lies to the west of the great russian road that marks the division of the mountainrange no i cannot say that she showed any sisterly feeling towards me except the true sorrow for my child of which i spoke and perhaps no woman who witnessed a scene of such distress could have helped being touched but when i heard of her tender behaviour and remembered that old scruples were partly removed by the death of the offender i sent her all that she could claim and much more of her inheritance in goods and chattels but it is impossible for her as long as she continues rakhans widow to show much affection for me though i may hope that she has it in her heart for unhappily that most fiendish and accursed institution which i hope to begin to extirpate by the spread of the gospel and of educationthe bloodfeud is set up between us by marriage she is an osset and among the ossets she holds sway like a petty queen almost although she cannot have any vindictive feelings against me after all her husbands behaviour to both of us she must respect their customs and not show herself too friendly therefore i take it as unusually kind and good on her part that knowing how soon my time expires she has sent her only son prince hafer to congratulate me and to offer an ancient residence or courthouse of the ossets which stands very conveniently for us to occupy on our return till karthlos which is in a sad condition can be put into good repair that i call a true extension of the olivebranch and it is the more remarkable to one who knows as i do that this infernal code for i can call it nothing else is supposed to be doubly binding when it inures betwixt near relatives blessed are they that never heard of it no flight of time no acts of kindness no natural affections avail against it it is horrible indeed i said and nothing can be more unenglish we are the most sensible race in the world as well as the most straightforward have it out and be done with it is our rule no steel no lead no poison but a fight with what the lord has made you also have your brutality i fear but it is not my place to talk of that after all the kindness i have received among you and you are wide awake to all your own virtues so that i need not insist upon them is there anything more you would ask me nothing sur imar and i may have seemed to trespass already on your patience but i have a brother who is wonderfully clever in all mechanical and chemical affairs may i bring him to see your typestamping process and other beautiful devices they are out of my line altogether but he would appreciate all of them and more than that he is gifted as you are with the faculty of languages he is the genius and i the dunce may he come he has nothing to do with the press and will not even talk of what he sees it will give me great pleasure to see such a man my host replied most courteously there is no secrecy about my work beyond thisif your journals spoke of itand they speak of even smaller mattersit might get into some russian paper and my little ideas would be quenched at once russia does not encourage education outside her own narrow grooves but if i could only begin unforbidden probably i might go on for years you see how sanguine i am still and your nephew will be of great service no doubt as his mother is so friendly in his early days he had no power of speech i think you told me but that comes sometimes rather late in life i do not think that i spoke about it because i had no knowledge his father mentioned it in that fatal letter but before i left the mountains i was told that an operation at tiflis had relieved the child of the tonguetie and now he seems to be in many ways a fine specimen of the caucasus he cannot speak your language well though he has picked up a little of it and he is not very fond of your nation but if your brother is a linguist possibly he might get on with him and i should like to try the experiment when will you bring your brother but tell him not the story of my life as i have told it to you it is a thing i never speak of without a special reason you may depend upon me sur imar i know the favour you have done me and the reason for it there are few who would have gone through so much pain for the sake of almost a stranger but i know not when i can bring harold he is a most uncertain fellow nobody can ever tell where to find him he says it is the beauty of his character but i hope that i may come before he does or it will be a bad lookout for me you may come to see me every day my friend and i shall be pleased to see you but if you meet hafer be on your guard he has the rough manners of the mountains still and has not seen the world as i have thus i was obliged to leave it not at all to my liking yet with no right to complain of any one this lesghian chief had laid me under a very great obligation by overcoming for my sake his natural reluctance to recall a past so full of pain and in such bitter contrast with the present conditions of his life as a nation we make little of the debt which a foreigner incurs to the hospitality of england the guest moreover is too graceful ever to inflict on us the pain of seeing him overwhelmed with gratitude but this lesghian chief had formed what was perhaps a romantic view of the greatness of our policy and a liking for us which is i fear by no means universal this i hoped to work with diligence for my own advantage as our government used to do as long as it still subsisted chapter xxix large and long views sur imar had spoken of happiness as resembling a mountaineagle in the brevity of its visits and the speed of its flight away from us rather than the gentle dove whose nest is always near our roof while the cooing of her soft content pervades the summer evening and probably he was right enough as regards his own race and country where all is rugged strong and fierce and a pious life too often means pure impotence for robbery but if he only could have seen my father of a sunny morning sitting in his little room with the red cloth on the table and the drawers of his cabinet pulled out and his choicest coins laid gingerly with their faces tilted towards the light and a chamois leather and a box of powder and a tiny bottle of acid to be used most sparinglythat chief of great stature and still greater mind would have perceived that bliss may come with the downy plume of the dove as well as the swoop of the eagles pinion for here was an ancient gentleman who had never known flash and clash of steel or the rush of hot blood upon frozen snow but had only been damaged by the rapid fall of grain and no longer had the spirit to cry out at that yet in the evening of his days found pleasure in the coinage of the past when the currency failed so painfully often he shouted for his wife or daughter to share some great discovery some new interpretation of his magnifying glass or the lens of imagination over some battered disc resembling the plate which our blacksmith clamps redhot on the nose of a vainly squealing porker then was sir harolds pleasure at the acme and the apex what delight is perfect without something to find fault with and the fonder one is of the poor shortcomer the sweeter it becomes to correct the loose idea this indeed is frightful my dear grace will you never know an old l from a t and how often must i tell you that they run the other way theres a tangle of your hair coming in the light again if you want to be of any use which you never can be do go and cut off at least three quarters of it one would think that girls were made of nothing else but hair show me any mops and frizzles on a feminine obverse look at this fascia ill get you one tomorrow you fetch it round tightly and then you cut off all the rest unless you like to bunch it as a jockey does a horse i shall speak to your mother about it nothing shall be done that you dislike but you see for yourself how becoming it is lovely oh lovely i am wild about it father but the lady has no nose is mine to come off too she has had a nose and as good a one as yours it is the mere accident of attrition but here comes george what can george want now he knows that i never should be interrupted with all these drawers open if any rival numismatisti am sorry to say there is no honesty among them even the people at the british museum when i lent them for comparison kept back three most valuablethe gems the gems of my whole collection well sir i dont blame them it was for the instruction of the nation i knew that my father was even more proud than indignant at this factif fact it was and he had long ago made it one by telling it at least twice aday but i dont want to disturb you sir and i dont often do it only there are two things that i am bound to consult you about immediately if you can spare me a few minutes without having to put more important work aside my father sighed for he hated business as he had good cause to do while grace walked away with a lofty air like a lady denied the franchise finding myself rather nervous i began in a craven manner with other peoples business bandilow wants to know sir whether he may break up halfmoon meadow and plant it with apple and peartrees he says it is the only chance of his being able to pay his rent next lady day but my dear george sir harold replied while he spread a silk handkerchief over his coins lest the atmosphere of business should corrode them does the silly fellow expect to realise a fruitcrop betwixt this and then very likely he does for he has found an apple on a tree he planted not more than two years ago and the society for the promotion of british fructiculture has sent him a coloured print of apples bigger than turnips and brighter than prize carnations and you know what lord melladew did for him they would not advance him any moneyin fact he had to subscribe to thembut for a nominal price they supplied him with a list of fifteen hundred kinds oh i dont want to hear any more about that i should have some faith in it if they put their own money into it instead of being paid for persuading other people to invest in it however it is no concern of mine excuse me sir but i think it is in a sort of sideway at any rate you would not like an old tenant whose family has held under ours for at least three centuries to be robbed by private folly of the little the public mania has left him i know the climate of surrey pretty well and there are very few better in england last may the mercury stood below freezing point at six in the morning no less than eight times and twice it was eight degrees below have we any fruitbloom that can laugh at that you would not like an elderly man like bandilow with a large family dependent upon him to be ruined would you now and he is already in arrears of rent certainly i should grieve at that and throw him off every farthing little as we can afford it but my dear boy you make the worst of things and you are sadly obstinate which perhaps is a family failing men of tenfold your knowledge have proved that the only remedy and a very easy one offered by providence itself for the present starvation of agriculture is to take to horticulture if wheat will not pay at s per quarter fall back upon apples at a pound a bushel and then there is jam a glorious scheme i saw that all reason was in vain lord melladew had got hold of my good father and tiptop prices upon westend counters had been quoted for orchard average it was useless to say another word but who ever ceased on that account if the wheat crop is precarious i should like to know what the fruit crop is two years in three give a fair crop of grain scarcely one in three of fruit if we turned every field into a broom of trees would even the present low prices hold in the years when there was anything on them the fruit might roll on the ground and rot whenever the season was plentiful englishmen cannot live on apples and jam is only fit for children but do as you like sir do as you like george i am guided too much sometimes by the way in which you look at things you have formed very strong opinions and there may be something in them nothing is more wonderful to me than the difference in character betwixt you and harold harold looks at a thing all round and is never quite sure about it but you make up your mind without looking at all and i defy anybody to move you i have made up my mind sir about another matter which i came to put before you and though i am not to be moved from it i do hope that you will take my view but is bandilow to have his way certainly my father answered with a pleasant smile for he had formed the most erroneous opinions about me is no one to have his way but my son george it is only fair to let a tenant crop his land as he thinks best unless he injures it permanently and especially such a man as bandilow who has stuck to us when all the others dropped off and there is another reason many of the newspapers loving as some of them seem to do to stir up illwill among englishmen keep on declaring that the landlords form the chief obstacle to the improvement of land the thing is absurd you might just as well say that if you borrow a hundred pounds of me i must long for your bankruptcy lest you should repay me what landlord would not be delighted if his tenant could make l an acre as these people say i only wish this fruitcraze could last father you are right what a blessing it would be if they could only fetch it round let us hope for the best as they do and now for the other question all about myself and i hope you will take the same liberal views but it is a long story have your easy chair and your little glass of mead that stops the cough well harold did some good in recommending that you never get the cough as you used to have it harold is a very clever fellow my father said after a sip or two if that boy would only stick to somethingor if i could make a blend of you twowell well we cant have everything that is a righteous law for us but it ought not to apply to you sir whose wishes are so moderate for instance i want a thing that i shall never get may i call mother in to hear what it is in this there was wisdom gracious wisdom such as we are inspired with sometimes however foolish we may generally be for whatever opinion my father might form he would have my mother looking at him and then she would be sure to give a glance at me and the experience of years would be belied unless she gave utterance to a conclusion not directly counter but subcontrary hypenantiousif such a word is pardonableto the view which her husband had ventured to form without waiting for her suggestion for they had grown so much alike that both of them doubted about the jointstock wisdom as we all despise homeproduce seeing myself in the right way thus while indulging in all due deference i did my very best to let them know that i had striven after things above me my father was ready to concede that point but my mother could not conceive it and was eager to branch out into a long discourse about all the great people akin to us in body but in mind not as yet awake to it my father joined me in abbreviating thatthough at such a time it was hard measurebut he heard the old grandfather clock strike one and if mother got wound up on that chain the hourhand might go round the dial before he got any luncheon therefore he spoke decisively what we have heard from george is not altogether what i expected everybody knows though he seems to imagine that nobody ever dreamed of it that he had found some attraction among those very strange people that live in the dell who they are or what they do there it has never concerned me to inquire when strangers come into a neighbourhood and desire to keep themselves to themselves no english gentleman would ever think of obtruding himself upon them they may be very estimable and even of very high rank in a foreign way as george supposes but when they pack themselves up inside a wall without even a bell or if they have one with only fierce dogs to answer it all we can do is to leave them to the police or the government or the newspapers the right of asylum is sacred in england of continental intrigues we know nothing and we refuse to be mixed up with them even with a radical government in powermy dear you quite agree with me in every word that you have said my dear but when our george without asking his mother goes out of his way to make strange acquaintance and people who pretend to look down upon us you have no right to say that my dear we must not think that they are so absurd they have the highest opinion of this country as of course they are bound to have except as to our one great mistake and there if i understand george aright princewhats his name mari it sounds like new zealand but at any rate his views do him very high credit he spoke of free trade with very fine contempt i think you told me so george sir he could not find any word strong enough to describe our folly and the testimony of an outsiderbut you never use such language sir no i leave that to younger people who may live to see the worst of it but this gentleman must have great perception as well as much integrity you think that he draws a large revenue and this young lady is his only child my dear you forget how they live out there said my mother who was above lucre and my father as well too superior to show it who can tell how many wives they have and their laws not too respectable i am half afraid upon such points i was very well up in geography once my father replied with a smile at her i could construe some of prometheus vinctus and i have a coin with the rock and the chain and the vulture but the titan has been eaten to nothing by time it is extremely valuable yet the british museum failed to steal it that prince comes from the very same spot it may have been struck by his ancestors george says that they come in a direct line from noahs own greatgrandson in that case indeed who are we to talk of our own children who indeed are we my mother glanced upward as if to watch the whole of creation sliding although to a reasonable mind the heptarchy is as much as one requires to be sure of but i should like to see that girl george stop said my father i am not a sceptic mama you must not set a bad example i had my little doubts about the ark i must confess until so many people attacked it among them a bishop of our church who continued to enjoy his income if he was in earnest he scarcely could be honest and in that case who would listen to him and if the ark rested upon ararat that would be the neighbourhood to know all about it i will not contradict prince maori but it is the girl i care about my mother made a great point of the tempers of young women george is so peaceable and he never argues i cannot risk his happiness with a wife who may be descended fromfrom even the females mentioned in the bible my dear mother what a hurry you are in the young lady does not care a fig about me yet and i am very much afraid that she never never will only i thought that i had better let you know this sort of thing has never happened to you before and that is very greatly to your credit george my father looked stealthily at my mother lest her conscience should involve her in some misconstruction here but we must talk it over first your mother and myself we could have no idea that such a thing was happening on our property i meanof course what used to be ours it seems to be departing from the proper way so much and the practice of the family i am sure there are plenty of nice girls round here i am not so sure of that said my mother rather quickly and giving me a signal to leave the rest to her english girls are not at all as they were in my time they have dropped all their modest looks and delicacy they talk slang and they speak without being introduced and they call one another jack and jemmy and they let young men give them pairs of gloves and they come into a room with both arms swinging and as for their dresses and the way they do their hair your opinion upon all these points dear mother has influenced me beyond all doubt even more than i was aware of but you must remember that dariel is also of the most ancient english lineage gone by quite as much as you could wishcrusaders probably our richard the first and some of his devoted paladins what can be nobler than to carry on a peaceful crusade of education literature christianity they could never do that without plenty of money said my father a man as free from mercenary views as ever tried to raise a shilling and you spoke of some emerald mines i think but we must be careful very careful and insist upon verifying everything quite independently of their reports let me see i have met the russian ambassadorbut no there have been two more since then however i am not without influence altogether he waved his hand for me to go and i slipped off after a good kiss from my mother who always gave way to the sentimental vein when my father fell into the financial and sure enough our finances were of a pensive character just now my duty was clearly to allow my dear parents plenty of time to discuss me from my birth up to the present moment and finding myself just a little in the fidgets and unfit for steady work off i set through the park to our old house to inquire whether stoneman happened to be at home for he had taken his holiday and was come back and so far as one could judge him by his looks and walk he found himself better suited in his native land than elsewhere chapter xxx in the quiet places gone to the city sir said the man who opened the door which i knew so well and it had a few reasons for remembering my childhood impressed or indented upon its lower panels but he wanted to see you particular master george and he will be home by two oclock i was to send down and ask you to step this way by two oclock if you could any way spare the time for he thinks to have a bit of a treat for you how small are our natures i was pleased with biddles for making a he of his master when at every breath it would have been sir harold while we could afford his livery a fine old englishman was this full of pure feeling and in heart disdainful of gold in comparison with rank though compelled by his stomach to coerce the higher organ how is your little bob biddles i asked and it was better than halfacrown to him before i had time to pick more than fifty holes in the stockbrokers taste as compared with our own in came the man himself full of high spirits and alive with that vigour which the sparkling metal gives any man must be a cur who can snarl at a good friend for enjoying the marrowbone which has dropped betwixt his paws jackson stoneman was not without his faults but it would have been mean to make them greater than they were just because he was able to pay for them just the man i wantedthe very man he said as if i was worth all the stock exchange what luck i have had all day and you are come to crown it here you shall have my new dougall and i shall shoot with my old lancaster what a deuce of a hurry you are in i answered for his mind could give me ten yards from scratch at any time i am not come here to shoot i have no time for such trifles i want to have a serious talk with you who do you think looked at me over the palings he spoke as if he had quaffed a fine magnum of champagne although he was a man of very great discretion over the palings my boy and after putting me down so the other day i assure you it has quite set me up again though i am afraid it was only an accident you may be quite certain of that i replied for he wanted a little quenching she went to get the last of the globeartichokes and of course when she heard a horse she looked up old sally looks up whenever any one goes by i tell you there was no looking up about it globeartichokes are as high as any womans head you are not going to put me down about that and she kissed her hand to me what do you think of that if you took off your hat she could do no less to a kind friend of her mother my affairs in that line are not flourishing but i dont want another fellow to be made a fool of jackson cant you try to show a little commonsense grapes sour george well i am sorry but i fear you have not invested well my son what are those foreign girls do you think i would ever look at them with a ghost of a chance of a thorough english maiden when it comes to an english girl you know where you are and no mistake all this is below contempt i answered for he had taken altogether the wrong tone with me let me hear no more of such stuff we are not boys what is it you want me to shoot well that is a gracious way of putting it when i offer you a chance anybody else would jump at guy fawkes day not come and behold three woodcocks marked down in the praycopse i dont believe a word of it they never come here yet the earliest i ever shot was on the fifteenth but if you can swallow it i dont mind going with you well said and back to dine with me at six oclock no scruple about certificate in this though to my mind the woodcock is the best of british game well call for the spaniels at ponders cottage best foot foremost it was a bright autumnal afternoon after a touch of white frost and against the sky every here and there some bronzy leaf would swing and glisten like the pendulum of a clock at winding time but most of the foliage now had finished its career of flaunt and flutter and was lying at our feet in soft brown strewage or pricking its last crispage up where a blade of grass supported it while at every winding of the meadow path which followed the hedge like a selvage how pleasant it was to see afar the wavering sweeps of gentle hill and plaits of rich embosomed valley with copse and turnipfield and furzy common patched with shadow it made me bless the lord at heart for casting my lines in a quiet land where a man beholds no craggy menace black rush of blind tempests bottomless gulfs unfathomed forests and peaks that would freeze him into stone for the people that live there must be in a wild condition always to tremble at natures fury or to shudder at her majesty or look around on all that wraps them up with desolate indifference i glanced at stoneman walking briskly with his gun upon his shoulder and death to at least a dozen woodcocks in the keen flash of his eyes and i said to myselfplease god i will take a gamecertificate next august there is nothing like a good days shooting to save one from bloodthirstiness jackson my boy i said with the refrain of a fine old yankee song arising in my memory you have been over half the world but have you ever been in the caucasus no and dont want he answered shortly get robbed enough in london village but they strip you naked there i hear and send you down a waterfall shamyl did it to some young chap who might have set up against him that is a fiction of his enemies the avar chief was dry in his manner to strangers and who can wonder at it but he never harmed one of his own race i wish we had a few such patriots very well you start the band you are qualifying well with all those egyptian fellows in the valley but george you are much too good for that there are pretty girls in every caravan but we dont jump over the broomstick with them dariel and a broomstick indignation may flash as fast in the meadows as in the mountains you idiot you talk like an utter cad i cried and he being quick of temper too stood his gun against a tree and looked at me i set my gun by the side of his let us have it out was all i said but a gleam of reason came across him he might have polished me off perhaps though he would not have found it very easy for i was the heavier of the two and in tidy rural condition what rot this is he said lowering his hands if you like to have a good smack at me you can but i wont hit a fellow with graces eyes i knew that he had meant business and that there was no white feather in his nature he begged my pardon and we shook hands and i felt just a little ashamed of myself although when i think of what he said i see no misbehaviour on my part without another word we dropped the question and went on to look after the woodcocks we crossed the long pray with the keeper and three spaniels coming after us and whether it was that jacksons hand shook after menacing the eyes of grace or that mine was extra steady through that firm assertion of dariel it came to pass that i knocked over both of the birds that we put up when they were sailing away from jacksons gun the other longbill saved his bacon by keeping it out of human eyes these lucky shots and the pleasant walk and very fine behaviour of the dogswho were children of the animals i had loved and chastened in the better days both for them and meput me into so noble a frame of mind that after an excellent dinner and a glass or two of port wine with the violet bouquet in it i up and told stoneman my own lovestory for i knew that the whole of it must come out now he being pretty much in the same condition though without anything like my excuse for it listened as if he had never heard anything half so surprising and engrossing and inspiriting in fact he seemed to take the whole of it as applicable to his own case though it was beyond my power to perceive even the faintest analogy his was an ordinary loveaffair with nothing remarkable about it unless it were that money which is the usual obstacle by its absence was the obstacle here by its presence but in my case money was the last thing thought of sur imar had never mentioned it and as for me i only hoped that dariel might never own a shilling because then she would appreciate my few halfcrowns and i still possessed her ruby cross and meant to keep it until it should be mine by legal right ah who can spy any chance of that through all the gloom impending chapter xxxi pitapat she didnt say that she could never care about me replied the stockbroker when i asked him what he thought if she had you wouldnt see me here now i should have been off to the real rialto for ive got a firstrate fellow in the avenue now jackson my inquiry was about my own affair i want to know what you think of my chance there i looked at him severely for this inattention was too bad well and i gave you a parallel we are almost in the same boat i should say though yours is a sort of savage canoe full of oriental fishtails no doubt and liable to vendetta and many other frightful nuisances to your young mind all that too probably increases the attraction but to my mature views theres romance enough and to spare in a quiet english maidensweet gentle affectionate firmprincipled and not too sure of her own mind are they to be despised because you can speak a civil word to them without having a bullet through you george there is more romance really where you know how to behave than where you dont cant see it i answered cant see it at all is it poetry to take up your spoon for peasoup poetry be hanged cried jackson and as it was only my brother who went in for it when i never could make a blessed rhyme why should i stand up for the muses who had never deigned a glance at me nevertheless i was slightly shocked for every man is or ought to try to be a little above the common mark when he thinks he loves something even better than himself and to be above the common mark is getting on for poetry you go your own way and leave me to go mine i spoke with that elbowlift of the mind which resembles what coachmen used to do to one another when they met on the highroad and did not want to raise the whip you will see jackson if you live long enough that i shall have a better time than you will for i knew that grace needed a very light hand though girls had not got their mouths just yet half as much as they have now the lord only grant me the chance of it he replied with the happy rashness of young men it was not for me to speak against my sister but i knew all her little ins and outs and i daresay she thought that she knew mine let me come down to your happy valley he continued with that contempt of my ideas which i always leave time to redress and have seldom found him fail to do it i want to see this perfect wonder why shakespeare himself can have never created any heroine to compare with her it is out of possibility my dear george bless my heartimogen portia miranda rosalind juliet opheliano she was weaksylvia helena half a dozen others rolled into one down in that little hole i want to see her that i may learn to despise the best english girl ever born or try to pretend to do it if she wont have me do you suppose i was born yesterday when a man carries on like this you may say what you likethough you are solomons mahatmawithout getting a spark of wisdom into him i longed for tom erricker who could always float on the top of a flood because he was so light and in a weak sort of way i had wanted him often not to unload my mind upon himfor you might as well trust your watch to a floating bladderbut to see him look buoyant when my mouth was full of brine but tom had been summoned by his electroplating parent to fall in love with a very nice young lady whose father made dishcovers fluted in the rough those people had some shooting and tom thought that he could shoot at any rate it was better for him than the bar you shall not come near my happy valleyit would never have done for me to encourage thisremember what you said of the hero who lives there you took him for a forger or a ticketofleave man well i dont care a fig what he is so long as he gives you satisfaction but about gracei tell you i wont wait if she kissed her hand to me is not that enough to showi shall be there tomorrow but you must not let her know not tomorrow jackson why it is her butterday and if she could ever cut up rough i believe it would be the butter at this time of year not a bit of it nothing would ever make her peppery and she is sure to be at home and up in your part of the premises that is where she looks the most enthralling but dont let her know for the world that i am coming it was fair that he should have his own way at last after giving grace a luxury of time to think about him since his offer was made about ten days ago when she put all the blame of her shillyshally upon me see how differently i did everything the following morning i gave her a hintfor my duty was to her first and long afterwards to jacksonthat peradventure somebody in the course of the morning might turn up to have a look at me in the harnessroom but she took the greatest pains not to understand me and even put a particularly simple jacket on of buffcoloured linen smocked with blue and a delicate suggestion of retiring frondsalmost like a landscape of forgetmenot and ladyfern but the shade of it was nothing in comparison with the shape inasmuch as the latter was our gracies own and everybody knows what that means only she herself had not the least idea about any part of it all she cared for was to get on with her work so she kept all her body and arms in motion as if she were intent upon throwing shadows when the butter was coming forth crowned with glorywhich the cleverest dairymaid may doubt about as she has to do sometimes with a little pat or two inside herand the long slab of enamelled stuff for we could not afford white marble was tilted so that every golden patin could crisp itself without encroachment and grace like a miser telling his moidores was entering the upshot upon a white slate hanging by a scarlet ribbon and pondering in her heart with the scales behind her whether she had tried to cheat any one more than the good of the family demanded suddenly a ridingglove was waved inside the door and its fingers went about like bananas on a string because there was no flesh inside them cant have you now joe miss grace cried with a presence of mind that could only be surpassed by the colour presented on her cheeks come again in half an hour i am calculating now as if old joe croaker had ever even seen a glove i wont say a word if i may come in oh do let me come in and be calculated too if i may only sit upon a pan upside down or anyhow quite out of sight in the corner oh what a sweet place i could live upon the smell of it but i wont even go near the laceedging of a pat mr stoneman is it possible this is one of my brothers proceedings that i cannot even finish a few pounds of butter george has done many inconsiderate thingsbut this seems beyond even his temerity miss cranleigh i give you my word of honour that i have not even seen him for the day in fact i came to look for him to say goodbye before i start for venice one never knows when one may come back again you see of course not there are so many lovely things out there the only surprising thing to me is that any englishman who can afford to travel spends so much of his time in this commonplace country but you dont mean that i do hope miss cranleigh that you have not so low an opinion of your own dear countrymen and the dearer ones still your own countrywomen foreign girls are all very well in their way but who with a pair of eyes in his head you have seen more of them than i have mr stoneman but everybody seems to say that they are most delightful and even my poor brother georgebut i forgotforgive me i am not supposed to know anything of that but i do i know everything about it that treacherous stockbroker whispered can any man be loyal to his best friend when in love what a lucky chance that you should speak of that excuse me mr stoneman but i never spoke of anything only when a mystery is dwelling in ones mind about one of those who naturally are the dearest to one and when ones parents do not condescendyou see what i mean though i really mean nothing precisely and with such swift intelligence as yours it is not for me to hint at my own weak ideassuch a thing as that i never do and when no one in the family cares a fig for my opinion it is not at all fair of you to say that grace cast down her eyes and then turned away in the most bewitching manner the stockbroker jumped up from his brown milkpan but she looked at him and he sat down again be careful mr stoneman for i am afraid it has a crack sally says they cannot make them as they used to do but as i was saying both my father and my mother are thoroughly aware of all your goodwill and there is not a tenant on the property i am sure how can i think about the blessed tenants though of course i try to do my duty to them but oh do give me a little taste of butter after that am i a rogue that i should dare do such a thing twentytwo pounds there and not a pennyweight to spare and old mrs ramshorn made a fuss last time after a cigar how can you taste your taste must be very far from perfect my taste is absolute perfection and that is whywhat i mean is why i enjoy this most exquisite result but a coward is ever so much worse than a rogue and to shrink from the test is cowardly i could never have believed it of miss cranleigh very well but you shall pay for what you eat i will take it from one of your own pats that are going to the hall in half an hour but you must not blame me if it is not firstrate slemmick the cleverest man we have says that there is a leaf coming down now which gets between the blades of grass and it is useless for the cows to blow at it for it makes a point of getting into their very finest butter george calls it nonsense but what right has he when slemmick was brought up so much more out of doors slemmick is sure to know most about it a man who has never heard the names of things always knows most about them therefore do let me give true judgment on the butter then you have never heard the name of butter oh dear oh dear you leave one less than a shred of the soundest argument was the reply of the infatuated stockbroker reason would have been the noun to use after a twelvemonth of matrimony now you must understand said grace in the flush of that triumph of intellect that nothing ever tastes its best when taken out of its proper course no metal should ever be used with fresh butter this is a blade of hard white wood i quite forget the name of it but i can easily find out let me run and ask old sally you cant wait very well then i must cut it short and tell you when you come back from venice but to think that i made all of those and the ready money they will fetch she dropped her eyelids just a little and spread one palm above them as if the dance of pleasure in her eyes required veiling and then she finished her sentence it is a lovely place i hear how nice it will be to be there how much you will enjoy yourself you are quite wrong there replied stocks and stones i expect to have a most wretched time what do i care for the stones of venice i am not going to please my very miserable self you know why i am going miss cranleigh mr stoneman how should i know i have not the very smallest idea oh what a dreadful story grace and did you make it better or worse by a blush and quick palpitation of the guilty breast that harboured it then i am going for this cause there is somebody in this country who has got me entirely underfoot and tramples on me every day there is no cure for it but to run away i have no spirit left my eyes are always on the ground indeed well i have not perceived that but if you have no will of your own what else is there for you to do but it seems so unenglish to run away you are not weak mr stoneman my brother says that you are very strong and he would be only too glad to help you he is too fond of what the reporters love to describe as personal violence if it were a man i might have some hope even without such a champion but when the tyrant is a lady and the most perfect of her sex one against whom it is impossible to rebel this does you the very highest credit and it is so unusual a great friend of mine and such a sweet girl quite adores her stepmother but menthough i know so little of thembut i fancied that they were apt to feel a kinda kind of prejudice narrow no doubt but violent it is worse than fifty stepmothers my step is a quiet sweettempered woman and i wish that i saw more of her but she seems to prefer her own relatives now as if you did not know what i mean what did i tell you the other day a variety of things and what did i tell you and didnt you say very clearly that you liked me all the better for my objections no no come that is a twist i said that i respected your objections but thought them extremely romantic and would live in the hope of your trying to get over them may i sit upon this tub and reason with you oh how i wish i was a dairyman my brother george is in love with a lady said grace who never saw the way to miss the very worst of jokes who will want a lot of practice before she can sit down what on earth will he do with her when he gives a dinnerparty this was a thoroughly vulgar error as i have shown most distinctly above poor george what a fool he is making of himself but no brother of yours could ever be a fool forgive me for the moment i was forgetting the great mental powers of your family miss cranleigh you need not call me that unless you wish it i mean at leastyou need not call me that so often after all that you have done for us it sounds so formal bless your kind heart what have i ever done for you but grace is what i should love to call you grace grace and nothing else unless i might add another word beginning with a d all words beginning with a d are bad but there cant be much harm in grace that i know of only you shouldnt say it very often oh dear no not more than every time i breathe very often is superlative and so are you and therefore i am to say it every time i say you so i will am i not a worshipper of the graces you must not say it every time you say me and i made a dreadful slip as you must perceive i wasnt thinking for the moment and surely you would never dream of taking an advantage now come all they that wish me evil all they that against me have imagined a vain thing what else are you doing yourself if you please if you would only allow me one moment to explain in the name of the lord will i destroy them oh mr jackson stoneman she looked at him in doubt of his ferocity or sanity and he in high spirits clapped his heels on the floor and sprang up and began to draw nearer no tub will do for me i must have a throne i am the king of the city and of surrey grace cranleigh has proclaimed it truly you are in a great haste to crown yourself she has never done anything of the kind but if to make an ell out of half an inch is kingly if i did that i will soon put it right let me make half an inch out of the ell now no no i insist upon your staying where you are there is a little door going out between these two pans and unless you are quite sensible you will see no more of me how can i be quite sensible when i see any oh grace grace you cannot conceive what a relief to me it is to be able to utter your name with a joy with a pride with an ecstasy inconceivable mr stoneman you are upon the stock exchange and a certified dealeris not that the proper term very well then you dont deal with any property until you get it dont we though oh grace if we did not where in the world would our business be but i dont want to talk shop now at all i want to talk something far outside of that shopwindows perhaps and then her heart reproached her as it ought to do with one who has made a flippant stroke but he had overdone his hit with her as well and had the sagacity to wait for her remorse i did not mean anything rude she said edging her own tub a little nearer while the forgetmenots on her bosom danced like flowers on a river when the millstream lifts i say things i ought not to saywhat i mean is i say things without meaning them whatever you say is the sweetest of the sweet he answered with a sigh that made his waistcoat keep the tune and it is right to remind me of my distance miss cranleigh because i was taking liberties i defy you to say such a thing to me again you have not the least idea what i am like whenwhen i feel that i have been unkind let me know what it is like he whispered whenwhen you feel that you are getting kind again o grace grace how i do love you she looked at him softly and her blue eyes fell and then she spoke submissively now dont pretend to say it you must not pretend to say itunless you are quite certain shall i tell you why i say it a thousand times and i will spend my life in saying it you know it as well as i do certain indeed but tell me why only that i should feel it very much indeed if i were not sure that it is perfectly true there were tears on her cheeksthe true playground of smiles neither did they look out of place for there was not much sorrow in them to reassure herself she whispered something altogether repugnant to the spirit of the stock exchange silver and gold and even jewels but that blessed stockbroker knew the quickest way to close transactions he swept back a mintworth of ductile gold from the sapphires whose lustre was tremulous with dew and he gazed at them gently tenderly triumphantly yet not without fear and diffidence all this committed to my charge he asked with the other arm defining the flexuous circuit of his future realm it may be a very poor investment answered grace but one thing is certainwhat little there is is entirely a genuine article illustration what little there is is entirely a genuine article chapter xxxii a painful duty it is all very fine for those fine people who can carry on like that my sister grace gave ten thoughts to every pound of her own butter for one she could spare to every thousand pounds of stonemans money a great weight of cash hung against him at first in the scales of honest affection but goodness and kindness and manly conduct and bashfulnessthriving rather shyly in the house perhaps but sprouting more freely in our fine airhad gone down plump against the adverse weight of a metal which we seldom find too heavy yet people should keep their felicity quiet even as a cat whose name may be akin to it should purr before the fire instead of squealing on the chimneypot but jackson went aloft and began to look down upon me to whom he owed everything as he surely must have known he chaffed me about my oriental princess a subject not only too lofty for him but exceedingly painful to me just now for i felt myself out in the cold as it were and with all due allowance for exalted spirits there is such a thing as good taste and there is or ought to be such a thing as sympathy and the deeper a man is down in the hole of love the more should the fellow at the top desire and strive without hooking him in the back to wind him up to bank again however i never let them hear a groan but endeavoured to content myself by meditating on the comparative grandeur of my own position grace was all pity and flutter and excitement and very tender interest about my state of mind and laid down the law like the lord chiefjustice in some very complicated liquidationsuit but when i said to her pointblank very well as you have it all so clear let me drive you in mothers ponytrap and then you will make it all right for me with sur imar and with dariel to my great disgust her answer was i am quite ready georgeif dear jack thinks it proper dear jack indeed i replied with undisguised contempt for stoneman had persuaded her to drop the son or perhaps she had made him his own father at any rate they had found out between them that jack was of higher rank among the novelists than his offspring had as yet attained however that might be he was her jackofall trades now and i who once did everything must be proud of second fiddle that settled all interference of theirs and in truth i would not have let her interfere if a thousand dear jacks had sanctioned it in the flow or ebb of his own affairs let every man paddle his own canoe inspirited thus i made up my mind that if harold did not appear right early the proper thing for me would be to pay my visit without him for the master of the place had clearly said that i might call upon him at any time though that would be of little comfort to me unless i might call upon his daughter too and here i confessed myself quite at a loss being entirely in the dark as to the social usages and the tiptop tone of the caucasus which must be in a position to look down upon ours but i said to myself shall extreme humility bring me to so low a pass that a savage young ossetwhatever that may beshall trample on the british flag that a swaggering bully who scorns noble dogs and breaks the legs of lovebirds shall scare a young englishman from his true love and carry her off and disdainfully treat her as rakhan his father behaved to his mother where is my courage or sense of right or even manly compassion that i should permit such a sacrilege as that not only was i warmed by these large reflections but touched up also by the little prick of thorns which the maybloom hedge of another fellows lovenest sometimes administers to the plodder in the lane so i came to this practical conclusiontake the bull by the horns and have it out with him for this gallant purpose forth i set about two oclock of a november day with a little drizzle in the air but not what an englishman would call a real fog perhaps i may have mentioned though i will not be too sure that a little trifle of a brook arises among the few fields which we still kept in hand and contrives to make its way without venturing upon noise but accepting every zigzag that any hedgerow offers down the trend of land that goes away very mildly until it gets view of a valley and then there are thickets and corners of halt and windings of the little water and flat beds strewn with the seasons leaves where birds of the neighbourhood or of passage find an agreeable change of diet or of rest when their wings are weary and a man with a gun may get a very pleasant shot if he probes this sweet home of theirs warily even the tiniest brook ever seen must lead to something larger but according to the lie of the land this runnel must wayfare long on its own account before it meets the pebblebourne woodcocks are apt to be somewhat capricious birds sometimes we never heard of one almost throughout the winter and the next year perhaps it would come into their heads that there was nothing like a happy surrey coppice this year they had taken that correct view of us and our duty was to make it final so i whistled for my favourite spaniel bess and with my old breechloader on my arm set off for a roundabout walk towards st winifreds if i had the luck to bring down a longbill perhaps a fair creature might immortalise him after a long rough trudge through fern and swamp and briary thicket i heard the murmur of a larger stream which could be no other than the pebblebourne daylight began to fail and the mist was deepening in the valley so i took a short cut towards the ancient walls with my little offering provided a woodcock a leash of snipe and a widgeon were more than i had expected and a pheasant or two would have borne them company if it had been lawful suddenly from a little glade of covert a frightful sound invaded me it was not like the cry of a cow for her calf nor that of a dog with a cartwheel on his tail nor even the fitful palinode of a cat upon the roof suffering deep remorse of love but if there be any organ capable of combining a wail a bellow a shriek and a yell with a howl and a moan and a few other indications that all is not perfect bliss here below that instrument must have been doing its utmost in the dusky copse before me my pet spaniel little bess slank away behind my heels and covered her eyes with her ears to exclude such an audible vision of the evil one but a man alone or at any rate a member of the human race alone could compass an effect so horrendous my blood ran as cold as the water in my boots and if i had stopped to think for even half a second rightaboutface would have been the order but real curiosity must never stop to think with a few rapid steps i was over the low stile and stood in the tangled enclosure like the shrillest fogscreecher that has ever been invented that sound led me unmistakeably until i saw a little dark man struggling for his life against victorious bondage he was corded to a tree no larger in the trunk than he was so that it just filled the hollow of his back his wrists were tied behind it and his feet being lifted high enough above the ground to deprive him of all leverage the publication of his sorrow was the sole resource the last light of day was rolling rather than flashing in his helpless eyes and the cruel distortion of his anguished face might have foiled his own mothers faith in him and his yells were not those of our language which can assert itself even in our outcries my impulse of course was to rush forward and succour this poor victim and i went for it at once although i saw that two strong men sat gazing at him one of them was tall and dark and a foreigner all over while the other was bulky and big of limb and both were jeering pleasantly with my gun on the left arm i pulled out a knife and rushing between them before they could rise cut the cords of the captive and eased him down on my shoulder and lo it was allai he uttered a guttural something altogether beyond my philology and picked up his pet little jingal from the moss and was off like a hare before i could speak when i turned round a man stood on either side of me but not quick enough to grasp my arms i jumped back so as to get the tree in front and cried fair play you rascals if you want to taste an ounce of shot apiece here it is at your service the tall man turned away as if that proposal were not much to his liking but the other stood his ground and spoke as if he knew that i would not fire who are you whats your business here mind your own affairs we were only having a bit of fun well and so am i it is quite as good fun to scare two scamps as to bully a helpless little devil right you are he exclaimed with a laugh which made me think better of him for he could not know that i had drawn my cartridges when i left off shooting but we are not scamps young man we were performing a painful duty you said it was a bit of fun just now at any rate i have stopped it and if you find that a grievance i will put down my gun and meet you but only one at a time mind what an obliging man you are and you stand nearly six inches over me my friend would have a better chance with you but he does not understand the box you have spoiled our days work who are you i have a right to ask that question first i am in my own neighbourhood as you can see but you are a stranger and doing strange things tell me your name sir and you shall have mine fair enough i am captain strogue of the british pioneersnot ashamed of my name and not likely to be though it is better known all round the world than at home you think me a coward for tormenting a small chap it only shows your ignorance of that race it is not brave to torture anybody captain strogue but that is no longer my business my name is george cranleigh well known about here what i have done i would do again and so would any other englishman likely enough but it is unlucky and you may have done a world of mischief however i bear no grudge against you some day perhaps you will be sorry for it but where the deuce is thewhy hang me upside down if he has not vanished the captain seemed eager to do the like and it was not my place to stop him he lifted his brown hat to me and was gone leaving upon me the impression of a man resolute testy adventurous excitable and perhaps unscrupulous as to the other man although he had not presented himself distinctly what other could he be than hafer the son of imars sister marva and now the chief of the osset tribe although i had not seen his face that night when he left dariel weeping neither had i seen it plainly now the figure and carriage and style of dress were quite enough to convince me even in the dark there had been something about that fellowor prince as some would call himand about the moral smell of his nature unpleasant to use the mildest word that i can think of to my plain and simple elements he might be the better man of the two more kindly more trusty more lovable and of a higher stamp in every way never mind i had not the least desire though he were all that to resemble him and providence having made us as we are cannot take it amiss if we are satisfied i shall have a good look at him some day i thought and then i am sure to feel that i was right i can have no prejudice against him merely because he has dared to look at dariel she who takes so long to see what i am is not at all likely to be carried by storm by this fellows olive complexion and fine nose and black eyes and sable moustache and all the rest of it why he is a brute and nothing else however handsome he may try to look i can scarcely believe him to be that noble mans own nephew chapter xxxiii trembling however these great reflections did not save me from being in a rather nervous state when stepan who was most obsequious nowif such a word may be used of such a steadfast heroshowed me into sur imars room and before he raised the curtain he whispered in best english milord me good friend to milord now allai worth dogs dogs all right a hundred dogs i pressed his hand because he was thus cultivating our dear language it is long since i have seen you sur imar began with his kind and cheerful but never joyful smile i began to fear that you had taken amiss something of what i said the other day it is difficult at such times to consider one another but all right as stepan says he is becoming quite an englishman did you notice the fogle as you call it this child of the caucasus has picked up somewhere it is the envy of all our encampment what a simpleminded race we are but that is a material to work upon for good and soon we shall be among the heart of it again what will my daughter think of her native mountains but surely i answered in a melancholy voicesurely you will not take her to that frightful placei beg your pardon to all that world of grandeurwhen everything is frozen and there is not a place to sit upon when there is not a flower not a blade of green grass nor even a tree that is not a hump of snow you may find it very nice but young ladiessur imar have you thought about her constitution my young friend i have and it is as sound as mine there will not be much society but has she any here from all that i have seen of it and i lived some time in london society means pretence affectation jealousy littleness stale slang instead of humour slavish imitation contempt of fellowcreatures and cowardly blindness to the afflictions of this earth my daughter has no taste for such a life as that he appeared to me to speak too strongly and too much from a primitive point of view and all who set up such a standard as that are impatient and apt to exaggerate but it was not for a country lubin to vindicate the ladies and i was in haste to deal with nearer considerations perhaps you will be angry with me i said but you have told me so much of yourself that you will not regard it as a liberty are you sure sir that you do not imperil your life by returning to people so revengeful as certain as a man can be who knows their obstinacy and the power of long tradition and who would wish to harm me now my sister made much for a time of her wrongs about the marriage portion but her wicked husbands public vaunt that he had slain our father and my surrender of all her share as soon as she was a widow must have taken the sting from that and as for rakhan and his death could she prefer a faithless husband to her own twin brother well you know best sir but is there not a son of that same prince rakhan hafer you called him the other day who may feel himself bound by that fiendish law even if his mother rejects it yes and i hope to introduce him to you a young man of what you call a rough and ready nature the natural produce of a rugged land too freespoken perhaps and apt to give offence to those who dislike strong convictions but i hear that among his own people he is beloved and admired beyond all example for his justice mildness and unbounded generosity the ossets are not what you have in this country advanced and experienced christians on the contrary it is a painful fact that the larger half are idolaters and of them and of the christians too not one in ten is far off from a thief this makes them thoroughly worthy of the deepest british interest in going round the globe so much you never care about any race that is beginning to get better your own for instance is nothing to you you can hope for the best about them and believe that the lord who governs the earth for the benefit of the british race will make it all right for the worst of you upon that point you have no misgivings any more than you have about any others when you feel yourselves summoned to improve the world but my duty is upon a very small scale and is limited to my own people great as my reverence was for sur imar it was difficult not to suspect that some adverse influence had been at work with him hitherto he had always expressed a genial admiration of our race which had produced on my part a corresponding respect for his uncommon powers of insight and freedom from foreign prejudice you have taken a turn against us i replied with some warmth and looking at him as i had never looked before time will show who is right sur imar my young friend he answered you are quite mistaken i am not leaving you through my own wish such quiet days i shall never know again and such kind respect for my privacy even with ten feet of snow round my walls for the sake of my countrymen i must go that i cannot do much is quite certain but i hope to start them on a better course for years as you know i have been preparing and my first chance of trying it is come at last am i likely to speak ungratefully of the only land on the face of the earth that would receive me without a thousand mortifications and annoyances why even your taxcollectors have been civil this was a climax of approbation which amazed and by power of contrast puzzled the warmest asserter of national virtue surely you cannot mean that i exclaimed but romantic as he was he nodded now as you charge me with distrust of england and i may have said some ungracious things he spoke with a smile almost as bright as dariels show your forgiveness my dear friend by coming with me into my daughters room we are beginning to put up our little possessions for the journey to a rougher place how many thousand times shall we regret the halcyon days in this quiet little vale but come and have a cup of coffee i am not fit to go into a ladys room i have got about a pint of water in either boot they are warranted waterproof and so they wont let it get out again well soon put that to rights you should wear arabas come into this passage and stepan will see to it and bring you a pair of my sandals i will be with you again in a minute while the faithful henchman was pulling off my boots which was no small tug for even his great arms his mind was evidently in a condition of still more strenuous exertion sheif the higher portion of our composition lays claim to the higher half of genderwas struggling and rolling and flopping about being overbulky for lighter process in quest of some fugitive english word earnestly courted but wickedly coy milord put on more smoke more smoke yes yes more smoke else be too late me good friend to milord now wicked mens come every day but milord smoke smoke smoke he puffed with his lips and panted as if to impress me with the need for a vast fumigation i want a pipe sadly my friend i replied but how can i have it in a ladys room the lesghian stared at me and stroked his beard and shook his head angrily as if he had found it empty stepan fool no say no say he exclaimed as he made off to fetch the slippers but i am afraid that i heard him mutter as he turned the corner inglese dam languidge dam languidge inglese in a minute however he returned with a broad smile lighting up all his battered countenance as if he had found what he wanted in the sandals me know now stepan big fool milord put on shteam shteam shteam go ahead whos afeard wont go home till mornin the gal i left behind me nancy is my darlin milord know now i am blest if i do i endeavoured to reply but he would have no more quenching in the triumph of philology his dignity was lost and i saw that he must have spent at least a day in london is the caucasus come to this i asked and was glad to see my host return stepan stood up and shut his mouth in the curtain of his beard like a casement closed under the ivy and looked at me as if there had never been less than a mile of moral distance between us in the name of the lord where does sham end but i had to do a little on my own account dariels room i had never been in the shrine of my divinity till now and when i was there i could look at nothing except her entrancing presence she was resting upon somethingit might have been a cloud for all that i could tell about it the soft light fell upon the sweetest face that heaven itself ever shone upon and i tried to speak but no words came neither could i look upon her as i longed to do if she had been too much for me out of doors what possibility was left me here my child said her fatherfor she too was silent which emboldened me to steal an ecstatic dream of the petals of a blushrose fluttering on her facemy child i have brought our kind friend mr cranleigh who has placed us under so many obligations to say goodbye or at least goodnight for i hope that we may see him again before we leave we have taken you a little by surprise i fear but it is a pleasant surprise dear father i was a littlewhat is the proper english wordmelancholy no i can never be that with you but sorry perhapsout of spirits is it so we have been so happy in this very tranquil rest it is true replied sur imar as he turned to me perhaps we shall never have so smooth a time again it is like the beginning of a new life to us but dariel knows that we must not think of our own comfort only no but of our livesof your life father what does it matter to me where i go but we are travelling from a land where you are safe to a country of savages where there is no law but everybody burning to kill everybody else a pretty description of your native land it is the air of this country mr cranleigh my daughter has breathed it so long that she believes that there is no other excellence under the sun we know that it has some such effect upon the natives but why should it be so with a little foreign girl dariel my dear i feel ashamed of you oh how much better does he know than that the loving daughter exclaimed as she placed both hands upon his shoulders and her face among his beard whose dark cascade spared a silver rill or two to glisten through the sable of the young abundance and thence she looked at me with a snug composure as if to ask what do you want with passion this is affection if you please this is all that a sweet girl needs and then she very calmly stroked his moustache up and put her lips to his and kept them there till i could almost hope that he might prove to have taken a taste of garlic but perhaps if he had it would have been all the same to her you see what our manners are said the father with a laugh we have not quite attained the proper selfcommand i fear and then i had my revenge for dariel blushed as if she had done an outrageous thing and whispered oh i beg your pardon it was a lucky thing for her perhaps although a sad one for poor me that her father was so close at hand else how could i have controlled myself for being a little repressed she turned the ardent appeal of her eyes on me quite as ifquite as if i had been a member of the family and when i smiled not reassurance only but most loyal encouragement what did she do but glide away from papa and sit down by the visitor oh grace you are graceful enough thought i for yourself and for any stockbroker but if you want to know how to sit down you must come and see dariel do it for she had told jackson and he in his lunacy thought it too good to be kept to himself that her brother george if he got the wife he wanted would be obliged to put her through a course of chairdrill before he could give a dinnerparty how i trembled to find myself sitting at her side indoors unhurried with the sanction of authority civilised waiting for a cup of coffee watching the turn of her exquisite hands nettled by the dancing of the clustered hair which drew a veil always at the most provoking moment over the lustrous speech of those myriadflashing and yet ever gentle eyes as the filigree of some crafty jeweller tempers and deepens the delight within what was there for me could a common sort of fellow with nothing but rough truth and deep worship to commend him dare to suppose that he could ever get in there and be cherished as the owner of the heart that moved the whole i assure you that i made a great fool of myself though such an assurance is superfluous to any man who has ever earned his salt i had just enough sense left to say yes or no with a please in a deep breath now and then and a thank you that took away breath altogether dariel who was as fit as a fiddlehow those low expressions spoil ones most exalted momentssaw with her illtimed serenity the confounded tumult of my system and as she told me in the wiser days felt ashamed of herself for enjoying it ah me it is not often in the little squareround of human life that we get tossed over the boundaries thus with the profundity of misery struggling with the sublimity of ecstasy my dear young friend said the tranquil lesghian who had let his eyes follow the lines of his beard in amiable serenity though there must have been a stealthy smile under it few things are more gratifying than to have ones own productions valued by those who understand the subject and speak without prepossession especially when the producer has departed from general usage and carried out his own opinions you are really sure that you admire admire is too weak a word sur imarmy eyes were still upon the charming result of his system of educationworship love adore enshrine we will put it on the labels of our tins as soon as we have a london agency but only your initials as your friends might not approve i am always at a loss for those strong expressive words of your language which now survive only in advertisements my dear put them down in your tablets i defy any soap to surpass them g c worships loves adores and enshrines the coffee of the caucasus i am not enthusiastic mr cranleigh but next to education and the spread of christianity i trust to the civilising effects of commerce which your nation insists upon perhaps even more strenuously than the other two great agents the russians have introduced the growth of tea and i heartily hope that it may answer but knowing the genius of our people which certainly is not inclined to persistent toil i have come to the conclusion that coffee which requires less constant attention would have a better chance upon our southern slopes where the summer is long and the heat intense i wish i could have seen your brother harold that universal genius about it the preparation which has so impressed you is not from our native berries yet only from the slopes near tiflis but i hope we shall have our own in a few years time and then my discovery comes in for all that i knew to the contrary i might have been drinking bilgewater flavoured with tar and stirred with marlinspikes but i grasped his hand with emotion and said no words are adequate sur imar he must have known as well as i didor what would be the good of his having ever loved his oriathat confusion was far too weak a word and fusion itself not strong enough to describe the condition of my brain till dariel with one precious glance of reserve and soft sympathyas if her father really must not claim to be the only one having any knowledge of mebowed for me to move a little and oh she quite hung over me for being so stupid i had not moved and stupidity gets the prize more often than the cleverest volatility darling i whispered through her hair for her father was gone to his coffeegrinder to secure some more of my adoration and dariel only whispered hush with a quiver but no repugnance father she said with pure presence of mind as he looked round from his grinding my senestra is a little out of tune but mr cranleigh will allow for that he is kind enough to wish to hear me sing and he thinks that my voice is rather agreeable he is right enough in his judgment there but what opportunity has he ever had of hearing it this question made me tremble when i thought of my first offence but the nymph answered very bashfully you rememberthe day dear father when you invited mr cranleigh to attend our little service we all sang in our quiet way and he was kind enough to be pleased with it how could he be pleased they do their best and i am always proud to hear them but my dear friend it is a frightful noise that drowns my childs soft melody englishmen who have travelled among our mountains tell their countrymen that all our voices are harsh and cackling guttural and disagreeable some may be so but not all and in my opinion few of them i am not a judge of music but i think my child sings beautifully oh father you have spoiled it all mr cranleigh will expect wonders and all i can do is so simple only it sounds nice to me becausebecause i feel that i mean it then your voice must be of your own tongue she can sing in english very sweetly but never with the expression which her native language brings to her mr cranleigh says he would like best to hear you in your own language dear though he wont understand a word of it that ancient lay of inkulluk i like it as well as any the words are nothing but the melody has a tinkle like a mountainstream which modern music seldom has we call it the song of the stork although there is very little about them in it if you like it you shall have a prose translation and perhaps your brother will put it into verse for you tell me he has even that accomplishment now try that simple little song my dear the lovely maiden thus exhorted smiled as she cast back her hair and upon the white rise of her breast laid a musical affair of some dark wood having divers strings and curves lute zither mandolin tambourine lyre it was none of those and i knew not neither cared what it was only to watch her swift white fingers dancing like snowdrops inspired by the wind and her lips like rosebuds tremulous the words were nothing but sounds to me yet i knew by the power she gave to them that whoever could bring them home to her would have no coldhearted wife to wed and this is what harold made of it the song of the stork when the veil of the mountains is lifted by spring and the voice of the water saithwinter is past when the stork from armenia plies her glad wing and the ibex lies down without fear of the blast with a heart that is warm as the nest of a dove in the bend of the valley i wait for my love when the splendour of summer makes spangles of snow and lights with red lilies the gloom of the glen while the forest is flushed with azaleas glow and the melody of fountains floats through it again with a heart that is true to its nest as a dove on a lawn of sweet roses i wait for my love when the tempests of autumn have turband the peak and the gray shadows hover above their stronghold yet the fruitage still lingersa faint purple streak and the ripe corn embroiders the breastland with gold though my heart may be quailing at the stormclouds above like the harvest it answers the sunshine of love when the mountains are turned into caverns by snow and the heavens are black with the fury of cold when the spectre of rakhabat stalks to and fro and the gaunt wolf is howling alone on the wold with the icecrags around us and the avalanche above my love shall not shiver in the breast of his love chapter xxxiv rejoicing when i was going home that night a very strange thing befell me which but for the mercy of providence would have left me nothing more to say although there had been very little chance of making sweet speeches to dariel because her father would not leave the room yet her rich clear voice thrilled through me so that i scarcely knew what i was doing and resolved to put all upon the cast at once rather than flutter and quiver and tremble till some swaggering foreigner rushed in modest i was and think no harm to confess it having never had chance to grow out of it by any fat manuring while my roots were young humble i was and who would not be so unless he were fool enough not to know the difference between a mere hulking clodpole and the exquisite perfection of the makers finest work timid too i may have been and who can be surprised when even a stockbroker trembled at our grace but as for my being a jellyfish could any such creature have done what i did i held the hand of my darling as long as i dared at the corner of the passage when her father was looking for a lantern and i said with an audacity which frightened me as soon as i had time to think of it tomorrow i must know my fate will you be in the chapel about three oclock or any time any time i will wait for hours what can make you ask me such a thing she answered and i said dont you know dariel and she drew back and whispered i will tryif my father has no objection now it was the thought of this that sent me in a most exalted yet highly disordered condition of mind upon my homeward course if order is heavens first law as some one says the entire code must be suspended when the human race is in its most heavenly state to me the earth was nothing and the stars alone and the distant sublimity of the sky had any claim of kindred leaving bess who was very tired to the care of stepan with a careless toss i flung my gun upon my right shoulder and strode forth into the darkness suddenly as i was marching on a ridge of moorland about half a mile from the camp i received a most shocking whack under the right ear as if somebody had struck me with a big hockeystick and at the same moment a flash of broad fire started up and then a roar from a clump of bushes just beneath me how i saved myself from falling is more than i can tell for i staggered very heavily and my head went round i cannot remember at all what i did much less what i thought in this frightful amazement though afterwards i tried to make it out more clearly but i must have kept hold of my gun although my right hand was jarred and tingling with it and then i must have leaped into the bushy hollow without time enough to realise the peril and i shouted which was a most stupid thing to do but i know that i shouted because one of the first things that fetched me to myself was the sound of my own voice but there was no one for me to lay hold of or to let drive at with the butt of my gun the place was all silent and empty and i saw a great star shining through the naked twigs from the crown of the ridge i had been crossing and i knew that i had been shot at by the advantage of that star to the inhabitants of a lawless country this may be little to dwell upon but never having been among such crooked lines of action i knew not what to make of it my blood ran cold at the enormity of the thing but without further reasoning i pulled out a brace of cartridges which i ought to have done before entering the hollow and slipped them into my old breechloader then i found that the right hammer would not move and began to perceive what had happened there was no time to go into that question now with the left hammer cocked and the muzzle level and ready for a snapshotthough probably my nerve would have failed me at a fellowcreaturei searched every yard of the thicket and then the gully which led to a little watercourse below the night having only that big star to help it was so dark and baffling that a dozen men might have slipped away without leaving me any the wiser and the only trace vouchsafed to me was a rustle of some bushes at the bottom of the slope where a hedge ran along at this i brought my gun to my shoulder for i might just have peppered a man down there and that would have been a caution to him however on second thoughts i did not fire for by this time i was quite cool again and the blaze might have brought another bullet at me before i could pop another cartridge in so i marked the spot very carefully and hurried home with gratitude and truly when i had lighted both my candles and taken a good draught of ale to refresh me i perceived that my escape had been marvellous and i knelt down and thanked god for it though i have never been able as many persons are to believe myself the main shareholder of divine protection a heavy bullet had been fired at me with accuracy undeniable and it must have dropped me as dead as a stone passing upward into my poor brain if my own good trusty gun had not been on my shoulder happily for me the lead had struck the lockplate just above the trigger and failing to enter the steel of course had glanced upward and passed through the brim of my hat cutting a groove in the crown as well but touching never a hair of my head my right ear was red as a radish from the jar of the stock against it and the spring and tumblers of the lock were jammed but i soon put them to right again what cowardly and coldblooded miscreant could thirst for the life of a harmless quiet and unpretentious fellow thus no enemy had i to the best of my knowledge in all the wide world for the simple reason that i never wronged insulted or looked down upon anybody and whenever i could not get on with a man i let him go his way while i went mineunless he brought a pole across my shins and even then if he was sorry i forgave him but one thing was very clear to my mind when i had lighted an eager pipe and dwelt on it sliding along the gentle slope where a blue cloud routs black vapours that no englishman ever would have crawled like that to pot a brother englishman then i thought of the sneaking shot from the gun of rakhan which had killed sur dadian when he was returning full of joy to his ancestral castle and the thing became almost as plain to me as if the sunlight had been poured on it captain strogue would never have done it a bravo he might be but not a thugif there is any meaning in any mans eyes but the tall dark fellow that son of rakhan who would not come up to look at me hafer who was come to fetch sur imar he was the miscreant who tried to shoot me sometimes i have a deep vein of discretion though nobody else perceives it and i always feel myself below my proper level when i work it but a man who has just escaped foul murder by a hairs breadth and may meet the like tomorrow with the turn of the hair against him mustunless he is weary of his lifetake some thought of his actions and i felt by no means weary of my life but kindly and warmly in love with it when certain glances made it sparkle like a dewdrop in the morning not a word must i say to any one about that dastardly attempt unless it were to the faithful stepan who might cast some light upon it he had warned me perhaps he knew that some one longed to do away with me he would take it as the natural outcome of my intimacy at the camp and now he approved of milords suit and urged him to put more steam on probably he knew why those two villains had lain in wait for poor allai and were trying by torture to make a traitor of him and stepan had clearly some reason of his own for keeping his master in the dark about it moreover he was struggling with the english language manifestly for my benefit with this resolution i went to bed and dreamed neither of thickets nor bullets nor bravoes nor anything else that was nasty but only of sweet dariel singing the song of the stork like a nightingale and coming with white wings to my window where i caught her with a pair of reins by this time grace was in such a state of mind about her noble stockbroker that brother george might have fifty holes in his hat or in his head almost without the loving sister coming to brush or darn or even poultice them of this i made no grievance but went so far as to be unaware of it and when her conscience began to work i showed her that i had bought a thimble and she called me a heartless mollycoddle never mind there are better girls than you who can appreciate me i answered with a superior smile and she flew into a passion such is feminine jealousy they want to love some newcomer better yet we are not to know it or to feel the difference most heartily i wished poor jackson stoneman only half as good a bargain as he fancied he had made of it for the blindness of a man in love is to others quite ridiculous and i knew that although grace was blessed with many of the merits he had inspired her with no one else could think her fit to hold a candle to dariel yet for the world i did not wish to hear any one praise my darling unless it were her father or myself for it was our business only upon my way to the sacred place where my destiny was to be settled being much before my time and longing to divert my mind which made my legs feel trembling i turned aside to search the covert which had so nearly proved my doom in the darkness of the night gone by if i had been as nervous then as now nothing could have saved me for the shock of the blow must have thrown me down and the enemy would have leaped up and dispatched me even as i had been full of glorious thoughts and striding in full pride of strength probably i should have lost my balance if my left foot had been foremost and now in the broad daylight i was half afraid to examine the dingle but i had brought my gun that loyal friend now as fit for work as ever and both barrels loaded with duckshot if that miscreants gun had been loaded sobut those thundering villains are no sportsmen at once i discovered the place where he had crouched and a comfortable lair he had made of it less than twelve yards from the path by which he expected me but the ground being strewn with leaves wherever it was not covered with grass or tangle no footprints could be descried either there or further down the dingle and i was at the point of abandoning my search when a little brown disk like a piece of stamped leather attracted my attention it was hanging on some twigs about a yard from the ground in a line between the lurkingplace and the spot where i had been when the bullet staggered me and at first i took it for a large thick leaf and a leaf it was but not of any tree or shrub that i had ever met with and i perceived that it was streaked with black and smelled very strongly of gunpowder beyond any doubt it had been used as a patch or wrapping for the leaden ball that was meant to send me to another world and parts of it were scorched or singed by the explosion i could even see the impress of the iron cap belonging to the heavy ramrod by which it had been driven down the riflebarrel and on the other side might be traced the convexity of the bullet which had been enclosed what leaf could this be it was thicker and tougher than any english leaf i knew as well as different in shape and texture tearing a fibre from the cleanest part i laid it on my tongue and was surprised by a strong and peculiar aroma after packing it carefully in a letter from tom erricker which happened to be in my pocket i went on my way towards the ruins of the chapel having made up my mind to inquire at kew where i knew a noble botanist what tree was likely to produce that leathery and spicy foliage but this and every other thought of things around me and of myself were far from any mind of mineif mind at all remained to meas i sat upon an ancient stone begirt with fern and lycopod and sandalled with soft moss rosetted here and there with ivy braids all such things are soothing and there also seemed to be a tranquil air proceeding from the memory of holy monks who never pretended to be better than they were because they saw no need of it hereupon i began to fear as a few dead leaves went by me that i should not have appointed this cold and holy spot for speaking of a turbulent affair like love but without another word i was strengthened greatly the very argument against me took my part true love is a sacred thing as the lord himself ordained it and a place of ancient reverence with the sky alone to roof it suited well for that which is the loftiest of the human state perhaps the maiden had some thoughts a little like my own but better larger and less tumultuous i was not in a fit condition to know exactly what she did and i even pretended to know less than eyes and heart brought home to me i only knew that she was there and for a little time i felt afraid to wish for any more than that she to my delight and glory trembled and tried to look away as if she shared my fear but begged me to let it go on a little longer then as i caught her hand and raised it very gently and reverently good manners compelled her to show surprise and to cast an inquiring glance at me dont go i said if you only knewbut i never shall be able to make you know it would not be right for me to go when my father ordered me to come because he knows why and he gave me leave to say what you know already oh dariel what is the good of talking you know all about it ever since that blessed moment when i first caught sight of you through the bushes and across the water or was it when you saved kubans life she looked at me very gravely as if the time made all the difference both both and a thousand times since and it must go on for ever you cant understand it of course you cant but i can understand nothing else oh dariel dont be hard upon me i know that you are the wonder of the world and that i am nothing but a very common fellow not half so worthy to look at you as the shorteared owls in your ivy i am very fond of owls said dariel they are the wisest of all birds but i never saw them sit and look at me then they are fools and ill do it for them for ever but oh if i could only make you see for a moment how i love you dont laugh at me dariel dont do that i am sure that i never laughed at all how can you think that i would be so wicked but i will confess if that will be quite sufficient that i thinkthat i have been persuaded considerably mr cranleigh that youthat you like me like you dariel what a wretched word can you look at me and fancy it no more than that but she would not be taken at any disadvantage though she turned one ear towards me a littleas if ears could hold no agency for heart or lips or eyes now listen to me for a moment i said creeping close to that ear which was a masterpiece of shellwork and filigree curves and chasing tell mejust sayhave a little kindness say whether you think you could ever like me yes i will say i will not conceal i think that i could like you very well becausebecause because what dariel that i may do it again and go on doing it for ever because becauseit is just for this reason all the glory of her eyes flashed on me because you are so much afraid of me am i in a moment she was in my arms and i had the sweetest revenge ever known for an imputation of cowardice and she whether carried away by my love or by her own sweet gratitude looked at me with a glow of light like the gates of heaven opening and drew me into fresh ecstasy and whispered do you love me such a time is the date of life for ever to be dwelt upon but never spoken of unless it be with the only one who shared it and i would never have touched upon it but left all those to take it home who in their time have been so blessed unless i were bound to let them see how much i had to go upon in my obstinacy afterwards dariel loved me who was i to be rapt by such a miracle and who of mankind should take it from me as long as the heavens continued let us kneel and thank the lord my darling said with coy reproach of my impetuous transport here where first you saw me george if he has meant us for one another he will be vexed if we do not thank him i followed her to the place that once had been of holy rite and there she took my hand and knelt upon the plinth of the old sanctuary and made the sign of the cross upon her breast and forehead and spoke some words in some sweet language and then arose and offered me both hands and i kissed her lovely brow and met her loving eyes bedewed with tears and said you are mine for ever she bowed her head as if to say i am well contented with it but when i drew forth that ruby cross of hers which i had kept so long and offered to place it on her breast as it was when i first beheld her she shrank away and her cheeks grew pale and she trembled so that i felt compelled to throw both arms around her what is it my darling my own love what has scared you so i asked drawing the red flash from her sight you know that i am not too wise you do not want me to be wise oh george i have no strength of mind i cannot bear to be taken from you i should like to see anybody do it said i guiding her craftily to a less exalted place but why has this little thing frightened you so when you must have worn it a hundred times because there is a most sad tale about it which i will tell you some day but even without that i must not wear it according to the rules of the family unlessunlessa thing that would grieve you heartily i hope georgeunless i cease to care for you no maiden must have this on her heart when her heart has ceased to be her own shall i tell you a little secret that was why i lent it to you and never asked for it back again as soon as ever i began to fancynot to be too surebut to be uncertain whetheroh you know my signification george when you doubted sweetest sweet whether you might not be beginning to think in your angelic heart of a worthless fellow whose name is george what language to use of such a pair if you abuse one you abuse the other do you see what english i speak now i could not talk like this when first i met you how do you think i learned to do it dariel how should i know your voice would make any language sweet your father has the gift of tongues he speaks better english than i do no doubt it has come down to you and you have been with english teachers yes but they made me speak french more than this they thought that the air would teach me english and my father always talked to me in our own language such as i sang to you last night but when i began to have george in my mind and to fancy that he was getting fond of me i changed all that comprehend you now i made my darling father speak nothing to me but the english and i shall be angry with myself if you have not observed the improvement at this proof of her lovely love i said and didno matter what never since the world began has any man been so beyond himself such things are not to be described and i never would have gone back thus to give any one else an idea of them if i could have won that glory with no anguish afterwards every man must be in glory when his true love loves him he knows that he is not worthy of it and that makes the triumph nobler she might lead me where she liked a man is never like a flowerunless it be a tobaccoflower which only blooms in the eveningbut he has always been like grass and grass if you watch it carefully and mow it very seldom has a gift of turning to the sun like most of us who manage it my sense of beauty was so vast that i could not get to the end of it and strove to teach her every item of her own perfections but she arose and took my hand and said let us go to father a little bit of wisdom will be good among all these wonders but i only wish that i owned them all because they would all belong to you sur imar received us with a loving smile i thought that he had never looked more grand dariel knelt to him while i held her hand and if i could have knelt to any man i would have done so then to him but the knee of an englishman goes down to none except his maker illustration sur imar received us with a loving smile so be it he said as he kissed her forehead may the lord bless both my children chapter xxxv a race of platers of the days which after due allowance made for the little jangles of the sun and moon are the upcast of our livingtime according to the wise man that sage complains that no one produces anything exactly like the produce of its brother one day old if it were so in the almanac of solon what can be expected now when every day is supposed to achieve a long stride in advance of all previous ages clapping their laurels on its own pert head so have i seen a pretty little dear with her hair upon her shoulders dash out in front of the village milerace at half a skip from the winningpost and scream out i have won it to me in my quiet slowgo pace it would have been more than enough if the morrow had been content with its yesterday and backed it up in a friendly style but instead of that it only cared to indorse the safe corollaryall in all a human creature is nothing more than accident accident to wit just out of luck according to the word there used which bears no merry meaning perhaps this on the whole was my disgrace for a friends good luck should be ones own but could i put tom erricker in the most romantic scale of friendship such as the romans cultivated against the heavenly dariel those tusculans knew not such love as ours because they had no such girls to love however let tom have his say beloved georgeyou are my best friend the only one that understands me in this smiling vale of tears you may not have heard from me for some months because i have had the finest shooting i have ever yet been blest with it makes one despise all the partridges and pheasants tame fowl of a lower order grouse my dear boy and blackcocks too and we heard of capercailzie tell old stocks and stones who was so stingy about his rabbits that i blow my nail at him as the poet says but that is not half of it the grubthe grubgeorge you never came across the like i am seven pounds heavier than when i came down in spite of walking off two pounds per diem the wind seems to blow it back into you and you make it up at dinnertime and then you have cigars such as you never put between your teeth and then halfadozen lovely girls all ready to scratch one anothers faces to draw you for their pal at billiards and did not i show them a dodge or two but that reminds me that i had my choice and i chose like the man who put the broom across the walk i might have had beauty i might have had fashion i might have had wit though i hate it in a girl because they soon give you the worst of it and i might have had noble birth but that would never do because she might be nasty about the forks and spoons at the height of the most festive enterprise she was very sweet upon me for as much as three days and my aunt who has l to leave was wild to have a lady frances erricker but my lady fanny made a wicked slip about the new process that the governor has given five pounds for and expects to clear five thousand by it and it was all over with her chance she repented with many tears and i forgave her but could not see my way to put her on again for her outside value was about a thou and she would cost more per ann than that to keep well i was just putting on my blinkers for another trot in single harness when a little thing comes round my nose and looks at me and strokes my ears and by jove it was all up with me oh she is such a little venus george small as all the true sort are but no mistake about her every time you look at her you say to yourselfthis is a girl not an amazon nor an owl nor an owlfaced athene nor even the one who changed her sex every time she struck a serpent i may be wrong about that never mind my loo will never want to be a louis in plain unvarnished fact she is a duck and that is what you want of them swans are not for me nor eagles least of all a cormorant her sweet name is louisa box and i said a pretty thing to her you know my little knack that way i said loo box you have boxed my compass and fetched it all to looward she could not quite take in my point for no girl ever knows north from south but she said oh tom you are so clever while some of them would have boxed my ears and lady fanny longed to do it to cut a delicious tale too short louisa boxwho has l on the nail which is not to be sneezed at with tin going downand thomas erricker of middle temple are to be joined in holy matrimony at a m next saturday and the devil take the hindmost i have been up to london for new togs but could not get an hour to run down to you and i know what a rumpus you are always in this you will excuse of course but i rely upon you mind and if you fail me it will not come off to put yourself into your best array and be best man on saturday you must come by the train which reaches sheffield p m on friday i will meet you at the station and we will have a blowout at the governors and i will put you up to everything and it would be kind if you would call at old puckerpants before you start and bring my vestments with you i have paid his bill so that you can swear at him now my dear fellow this is a solemn matter i feel the vitality of holy matrimony and i trust my old pal to back me up last night i had a spasm in the plaster on my chest i am not so strong as i was at college and i shall never pull through it without you you are a sneak if you desert the tom who has done so much for you any one of lofty altruistic soul or even decent fidelity would vote me a very paltry fellow for doubting what to do in a case like this it seemed an atrocious thing of tom and a pestilent piece of luck for me to take me two hundred miles from home at this very crisis of my lifejust when i meant to compel my father to call upon sur imar or if that could not be done to bring sweet dariel to see my mother whose kind heart she would captivate then i would show her to grace and perhaps at some leisure to jackson stoneman and look what becomes of their pride and their saxon infatuation after that was this and every other delightful plan to be put off nobody knew how long for the sake of a headlong cash and loveaffair concocted by tom erricker i was sure that my sister would agree with me for she always had made light of tom and i vowed to my reluctant self that the decision should be left to her what then was my chagrin and wonder when she said you are bound to go george and i fear that she wanted me out of the way because i would not kowtow to her jack the terrible results of this sudden start have strengthened me for ever in my solid judgment which for the moment i was much inclined to slacken under the arch spell of st winifred listen deferentially to feminine opinion but never let it go beyond your ears until you have a good wife of your own she will know how you look at things and shape her wisdom to suit yours and go beyond your own conviction in the certainty that you are right and then she knows that she has done it all whenever everything turns out well but if peradventure it all goes amiss she is the last one in the world to make it bad for you it is your place then to take the blame on your own clumsy shoulders and think scorn of outside results while you have one true breast to comfort you these thoughts were far beyond me yet for a young man believes himself wondrous clever and airs his conclusions about womankind as a boy blows his bubble or a child upon the grass his ball of dandelionseed and this was just the very thing tom erricker had always done and i had thought it very fine until i met my dariel but now i felt disgusted with him and his loo of l and all that snobbish frippery about his togs however i must make the best of that and him to the life of my life i sent a line as full of love as i could make it with any room for commonsense behind and then off i set for all that humbug show and sham and breakfastspeeches women up to date with tears and men beyond it with champagne lovely bride with lips too sweet for margarine to melt inside them bridegroom in tepid waxwork form and looking for courage to his mother whose mind dwells over his weaning all this was there and a great deal more and it seemed to me that my dear friend who had lost his wit and his wits as well deserved our finest sympathies though the girl was a harmless and good little thing who wondered how her tom could have thought so much of me but if ever there were kind and warm people on the face of this coldcomplexioned earth these yorkshire folk might fairly claim the warmest place among them not for hospitality alone though in that they were beyond abundance but also for solid goodwill without sham and a hearty power of liking any one who met them frankly there was something about them altogether different from our southern style stronger and deeper and more true in the way they stuck to what they said also i found them very eager to have large and liberal views of their own in abstract questions of politics and if they made mistakes it wasso far as i could follow suitfrom contempt of shillyshallying i went among them with the tags of my tory armour tied hooked with steel i ought to say and though they could not pull any of it off they made the whole suit more flexible and airy and elastic alas that i had so brief a chance of expanding under the broadcloth none of them could unsettle me in what i was brought up to but having an equitable mind and being worsted generally in argument i began to see that the strongest principles may go too far in their own strength there was one old man of mighty aspect and immense benevolence who must have brought me beneath his mantle in three more nights of looking at me i felt his influence and feel it now but whether for any good or harm all this was cut short suddenly after tom and his bride were gone with the usual showers after them all the guests and many more came together at silver hall the abode of the ancient tinman as tom in his impudence called his father for why it had been arranged among them to have the weddingdance out there with more room for enjoyment than sir benjamin box could minister and i was beginning to count my time for i meant to go by the midnight train and clumsy dancer as i am there were several very nice girls indeed who did their best in a charming way to make me do my best as well especially there was toms younger sister as pretty a girl as need be seen in a formal mood of the masculine mind miss argyrophylla erricker her mother had paid a poor oxford man a guinea for invention of that name and she was worth it though everybody called her pilla it was a lucky thing for me that i had not seen pilla too early in life for i know not where i might have been this very pretty girl was also of a very romantic tendency which with a little wit to quicken and sweet brown eyes to sweeten it stops you in your course like a double waterjump with a hurdle of furze between it you pause to think and you pause for ever i had heard of her a hundred times from tom but had never imagined that she was so nice for he spoke of her with that fond condescension which made her look up to him as a mighty hero and now i had to take care what i said as she always got back to him at every other breath and a great stretch of verity was needful on my part to respond to her view of his merits but this made me like her all the more and i wished more than once that my sister grace who certainly possessed much more occasion for it were gifted with an equal amount of this lovely philadelphia how many times i danced with pilla is a great deal more than i can say but it was very far from being to the exclusion of everybody else as people were found to say afterwards she as the daughter of the house was bound to pay proper attention to the guest who had come so far to please her brother and would have to leave so early and for my part i could not forget the duty of warm friendship to my dear old tom every time she came back to me i thought that her rich brown eyes grew brighter and i told her how much they resembled toms although infinitely more expressive and she found me improving so fast in my steps which had fallen into sad neglect among the furrows that i feared to fall off again if i failed to make the most of so rare a chance but as to making love to herwhat love had i to make all my rights and dues of that were signed sealed and delivered to another ladyof a different grade altogether but away went all a mans thoughts of homage to anything but humanity when after i had said goodbye to pilla and seen my bag come down the stairs and was casting a wrapper around me while the cabman thumped himself betwixt the doors the sweet little creature ran up to me again and tried to speak but only mumbled and would have gone down with her chin upon the floor if i had not stretched both arms to catch her upon them she lay like a lamb upon a rail with all her body quivering and the helplessness of her slack head thrown against my dancing waistcoat what is it dear child i asked in vain all she could do was to spread one hand towards a big door and then that hand fell and she was all long hair and pink muslin is there a woman here i called out in terror of a fit as i kept her from the floor and a woman of great substance rushed up and caught her and glared at me as if i were a villain poor lamb poor darling the bad wicked man did you see how he swept her off her feet there were halfadozen handmaids now and i left poor pilla to them illustration a woman of great substance rushed up and caught her then seeing how stupidly quick they were i went to the door she had pointed at and with heavy misgivings entered it was a large high room with a lot of gilt about it and gorgeous books sprawling upon stamped leather but the gas was turned down and the light of the fire flickered with gushes of shape and shadow there was another and a darker shadow there a dead man lay in the deep composure of a most luxurious chair his head had fallen back against the rich morocco and the fire that played on his dull wan eyes should warm no part of him any moretheophilus erricker a man who had made his fortune in the rush and kick and pellmell of lifeby fair play no doubt when the rules permitted and with kindness to his fellows when so be it the facts went the right way for him it was strong hospitality and quick heart now which had brought him to this sad extreme throughout the day he had been doing too much for a man of his legs and years and weight as several persons told him but the old man kept up to the height of young time and when sir benjamin box an alderman of substantial yet melancholy order entreated him not to dance so much stout mr erricker challenged him though box was ten years his junior to jump over a diningroom chair with him and thus he carried on for hour after hour dancing and slapping old friends on the back and running about among the pretty girls like a waiter who has to subsist upon tips and ever so much rasher than that man is because he was stirring up his intellect to the same high scale as his body what wonder thenwith his doctor called away to a wealthy confinement and his good wife too busy to frown at himthat he verified the warnings of those who knew but could not at such a time remind him that he had all but created a vacancy in the town council last easter monday through juvenile impetuosity what an awful crash of buffers in the midst of headlong gaiety even to me so new a friend it seemed to sweep aside all thoughts of self and plunge it in the great tide of human fate that pitiless gulfstream in which we cannot even endeavour a course of our own but are whirled along like a dollop of froth or a shred of popweed among other weeds being as a young man ought to be entirely without experience of the sudden tragedies of life perhaps i overdid my sense of duty in a case like this if so i erred on the better side and in spite of all the sad home results i say that i would do the like again whether others would do as much for me or not right or wrong i could not bring myself to leave these unhappy people without any friend to help them my services were but small of course and yet as it happened there was no one in the house to be more efficient the family lawyer had left the town after seeing to the marriagesettlement the execution of the will was committed to tom and his mother tom was away on his weddingtrip and his mother in delicate health for some years had now broken down entirely and left her daughter to do the best she could only on one point the widowed mother still had the courage to insist whatever came of it her son should not be called back from his honeymoon to the coffin of his father he had set off for italy or the south of francei forgot which it was for the momentnothing but a telegram could stop him and no telegram should be sent a miserable time it was indeed the lawyers junior partner came but he was a young man without selfreliance regardful of nothing but legal forms and desirous of nothing but to please miss pilla who could make a flexible stalactiteif such a thing there beof him by every crystal tear and she having therefore little faith in him all he did was to cast the burden of every doubtful arrangement upon me the old man will cut up finely sir was the most practical of his remarks to me no expense must be spared on his funeral under the widows instructionspoor thing you must now act as quasiexecutor the corporation will not be pleased unless everything is carried out a and if i may venture upon a private sentiment it will all tell up sir it will be a sound investment with an eye to the welfare of the business then sir benjamin box came in and put his hat upon the very chair in which the master of the house had breathed his last and spake below breath impressively saddest thing i ever knew in all my life we shall never look upon his like again my dear sir george what a lesson for us but to jump over chairs at his time of life and eighteen stone if he weighed an ounce i who am comparatively activebut we will not reproach him when he cannot reply fine thing for tom though can you give me an idea you are the acting executor i believe i am not an executor at all sir benjamin and i am no sir george but plain george cranleigh i am doing what little i can at the request of the ladies and their lawyer but you are more nearly connected and if you would only take it off my hands no no thank you that wouldnt do at all i never could stand a house of mourning my own heart is ticklish this has given me quite a turn but you are young sir you are young my deepest sympathies to the afflicted ladies he was off with so light a foot that even the ghost of the poor deceased would have found itself too heavy if it ever came to finish the jumpingmatch and then argyrophylla glided in looking like a silver aspen leaf in a coil of black ivy as she took my hand oh mr george what a hateful old man i heard what he said and i saw him run away and my brother has married his daughter cowards how they fly at the very thought of death and when their time of life should make them so glad to know more about it but you are not like that are you though it must be most sadly distressing for you to attempt to thank you would be so absurd and hopeless how proud my brother must be of such a friend if i live to be eighty i shall never forget you but i came to tell you two pieces of good news if there can be such a thing as good news now dr golightly has called upon the coroner and got him to dispense with an inquest as the case had been medically treated before and then aunt gertrude is coming tomorrow and she will bring selina petheril who was at our school at brompton of selina petheril i knew nothing but this aunt gertrude was the relative from whom tom had great expectations and her arrival made things much better and relieved me of some anxiety she approved of all that i had done but i found it impossible to leave the house with any security that all was right until the third day after the funeral i had written to my sister and heard from her once or twice so that there could be no uneasiness at home but of my dear friends in the valley not a word had reached me though among all those dismal duties my thoughts had been with them constantly it is not for me to pretend to say whether i acted well or ill but to one thing i can pledge my honour that no small motive and no tender claims of beauty in distress detained me if pilla had been the plainest girl in the county of many acres my behaviour would have been just the same i never said a word to her that was not of the purest pity and good feeling neither did she think twice of me except as a willing and warm friend there is nothing in me to attract any girl and even if there were any man who imagines that a loving daughter in deep affliction would set up a flirtation with a stranger the same is a bad man and proves it by measuring women by his own low mark however no more of that enough that when we heard by telegram that tom would be at home that night i took the mailtrain to london and got home at breakfasttime on sunday morning having thus been absent just nine days chapter xxxvi gone gone gone a small and wellmeasured breakfastparty with the tea and the bacon and eggs provided to expectation and experience should not be disturbed by the sudden irruption of a rough unshaven crumpleshirted and worst of all unfed young fellow who cannot remember when his last meal happened therefore i only sent word of my arrival and went for a swim in stonemans lake as my custom was throughout the year while sally was preparing me some bread and milk but while i was getting through this and thinking of putting myself into churchgoing gear my sister grace ran in and embraced me as warmly as if i were on the stock exchange oh george i think you are so noble she declared as if she had found me at last too large for her understanding to stay away so many weeksi had not been away for a week and a half but let her have a girls arithmeticsimply for the sake of other peoples affairs without even appointing anybody to look after your own all that long while i thought that i was almost as unselfish as anybody ought to be but i am not sure that i could quite have done all that you dont understand things my dear girl i replied with that superior tone which used to have a fine effect of closure upon the large feminine parlance i knew that hay was going up and that mr joplin would have to put five shillings on to every pound he offered me in october hay indeed she exclaimed with scorn george it is sweet haysweet haysour hay and you have not made it while the sun shone speak no more in parables speak plain english what in commonsense are you driving at there is no hay in the county to beat ours and i defy any rain to have got into the ricks but suppose the ricks are all clean gone oh george how stupid you are at metaphors but if they are gone without letting you knowoh i never could believe that of foreigners even and after all the great things you have felt for such great people out with it i said while my spoon went dribbling you mean to tell me i suppose if plain english can ever be got from a girl that sur imar and his people have left the neighbourhood his people indeed well if you can take it in that lofty spirit you may as well know everything i was quite afraid of telling you but men are all alike at least old sally says sothough what she can know about it the poor old soul when did it happen i asked quite calmly for i wanted no pity about it least of all from a girl who had never entered into any proper view of the question because i never chose to run and gush to her that is more than we can tell they must have packed up very quickly unless they left all their dogs and diamonds behind them but we only heard of it yesterday through slemmick who had it from farmer ticknor that seems a little rude considering that you were to have taken me down so soon to fall at the feet of the lesghian bandit but of course we must not judge them by our own ideas perhaps as we had never called upon them they would not have troubled their heads about that they look at things from a higher level but perhaps they might have sent a boy to tell me if they had found any time to spare my dear child in a quarter of an hour i shall be ready and then we will go to church together let any man tell me what else he would have done and i shall be much obliged to him not that it could help me very much for such a thing can scarcely happen twice to any fellow but that i should like to compare his view of it with what went on in my own mind nothing is easier than to talk when you see the thing a long way off or which is even better only read about it or give a bold verdict without a glance which is the wisest course of all all that i can say about my part is that reason did not count for a halfpenny in the business pride which is often a matter of temper or selfesteem set up to crow but when it arises in a modest nature is the proper power to keep it sweetpride said to me i am well aware that you never stuck up for being humble you hate any fellow that goes in for that because you believe him a hypocrite and so he is ninetynine times per cent the one per cent being a true christian a quantity altogether negligible you are not up to that mark but you are a selfrespecting englishman show it my fine fellow by whistling at people who have not known you better than to snub you i listened to this and it all seemed true as beyond all doubt it ought to be and i went through everything so well that grace who was watching me with tender interest to learn perhaps how the stockbroker would take it if she vanished out of his investments did her best to be pleased for my dear sake and yet for jointstock sake afforded me as cold a kiss when she said goodnight as any man insisting on the abstract woman can hope to receive from the concrete this alone was enough to show me that i was on the wrong tack altogether women are delightful in their talk if nobody contradicts them about their finer nature and purer standard and higher mission to ennoble us all this we acknowledge and should feel it more if they said less concerning it but the worst of it is that if any man regards them as they demand to be regarded he may stand with his back to the wall while they go by now a man however dullwitted he may be has sense enough to know that in any nice point touching his behaviour to the better half of life a member of that half can show him what to do far better than he can discover it nothing could be clearer than that grace despised the haughtiness and the hardness which she herself would have shown in her own case how her eyes would have flashed thought iand then came a vision of other eyes gentle true deephearted eyes sad with some dark mystery perhaps compelled to keep their tears unseen but wavering jiltish deceitfulnever and then i began to recall her kindly and found it very comforting for when the sweet face came before me with the soft radiance of those eyes and the play of those lips that trembled lest they should open themselves unduly and the movement of a heart that wondered whether it wanted itself to be understood and a multitude of other little waverings which a man is too dull to interpretwhen all this came home to me with unknown power because i wanted it and nothing else away with this stupid pride said love clinging to my breast and whispering the power that made mankind made me and ordered me never to be far off in the worst of your tribulations but i must have faith as even he requires in all his dealings with you i have offered you as fair a chance as ever was given to a clumsy mortalthe loveliest creature a child of my own as much too good for you as i am because the wicked one has raised a mist in his loathing of human happiness are you fool enough to be untrue to me and shut your blear eyes and never open them until nothing is left worth looking at go your own way i have plenty of finer fellows to stand by me though he may not have said it so distinctlyand he is not the fellow anyhow that should talk about a mistit produced the same effect upon me i felt myself after a little thinking very many cuts above jackson stoneman and his slippery stuff among the pats of butter his love was as sound as a roach and as merry as a grig and he was welcome to it a thing like a bleak that flits under a film of the water and jumps at a midget and so becomes fit to make pearl of paris when the strikingweight of a clock is too heavy it slurs the hours with such a tug that you cannot even count the strokes and to me with that heavy weight upon my heart time went by untimely slowly heavily and sluggishly if ever i began to count the ticks but out of all proper chronology at periods when i kept no eye upon it moreover i had a number of little things to see to which had been neglected in my absence so that it was tuesday afternoon when i stood at the door of st winifred and wondered whether she had fallen back into rust and ruin once again the old wall fringed with ivy looked like a billow with a ruffled crest before the white comb breaks from it and the slumber of the valley was not shaken by groan or shudder of the waterwheel no smoke was rising from the buttressed chimneys which had been repaired and pointed neither was there any sign of life or sound of the harsh caucasian gabble in which many idle souls delighted in short the settlement which had been so long the puzzle of the neighbourhood and the blessing of the ratecollectors for sur imar paid always every penny put upon him was gone vanished a vision of the distance a pleasant resource for the memory when not too conceptive at dinnertime a fact that would fade into a legend soon and find matteroffact disproving it if i had not been reduced by this time to a meritorious humilitywhich i meant to keep up let it suffer as it mightit would have gone hard with our language to forego one of its strongest and briefest words which the weaker tongues try to pronounce against us but condemn themselves by the effort being of the purest english birth and therefore as even our enemies admit an embodiment of justice i stood still and made allowance for all of lesser privilege they have quite as much right to their own ideas as the largest of us have to ours and it is our power of perceiving that which has made us beloved throughout the world or at least by as many as can understand us or if they be few whose fault is that while i was full of these quick thoughts and exceedingly sorrowful over them lo two streaks of yellow on the darkgreen grass and the selfpossession of albion was wellnigh rolled over in its own tricks kuban and orla as mad as march hares threw all their wild welcome upon me kisses and licks and the hairiest embraces and the most lunatic yells of delight if ever there has been true love here was the prime of it to knock me off my legs any one may laugh at me and all my pride for the whole of it went to the dogs in a jiffy i am blest if i could help a gleam of moisture that made it difficult for me to see the loyal love in eyes that never told a lie you dears i cried you faithful dears and they would scarcely let me say it before they were smothering me again and then they rolled on the ground as if they had got no legs and then they jumped up and looked at one another to be certain of their facts and then with one accord they made the valley ring with glorious shouts of joy and the dead leaves tremble on the lonely trees and behold they had roused a great figure of a man who came from a door where i had trembled like a leaf and put his hand over his eyes and gazed at me as if he had never seen a man before and then a little figure ran almost between his legs and i halloed to stepan and allai stepan showed a warm desire to embrace me which proved that to him i was guiltless as yet while allai put both hands on his head and bowed almost to my gaiters now if i could only make these fellows understand and then get them to do the like to me i should learn all about this sudden flitting for the smallest of the lesghians had always seemed to be in partnership with the greatest but alas what a conflict of languages we had i think it is st james who dwells with great eloquence upon the many miseries we suffer from the tongue he has not however described for us one of its most diabolical conditions when it cannot hit upon the word it wants and flies into a fury of perplexity with itself and indignation at the stupid ear that keeps it so in limbo stepan tried english and that was very bad then i tried lesghian but that was much worse he could see that i wanted to know why his master had broken up their english home so suddenly and without so much as a word of farewell but all that he could do towards telling me was to shake his head and make a great noise in his throat and box the boys ears for laughing at him then something not altogether devoid of true insight occurred to him for he shouted in a mighty voice stepan dam fool and gave allai some order which sent him to the buildings like an arrow something had occurred to me also so often are ideas simultaneous and while the messenger was gone i took that leaf of which i have spoken from my pocketbook and handed it to stepan he looked at it with great surprise and then put it to his lips and on his forehead and then tore off a fibre and tasted it adul adul or some word that sounded like that he repeated frequently and did his utmost to show me that he felt great curiosity about it upon this i pulled out a pencil and drew a rough sketch of myself being shot at taking poetic licence to show the bullet in the air and the leaf dropping from it also i tried to represent a man crouching in a bush and popping at me and although not a glimpse had been vouchsafed me of the villain on that occasion i allowed imagination to indue him with the plumed hat of prince hafer this i had no right to do but surely a little liberty is pardonable with a gentleman who has taken a shot at one in the dark at any rate stepan fell in most briskly with the inference of this costumiery and seemed rather pleased at the confirmation of his own moral estimate and foresight until i began to think i was surprised that he should be so calm about that black attempt to annihilate me but remembering what he had been through i let him take it according to his nature he liked me he approved of me he thought me a good englishman and yet it would have been no more than the finish of a bearhunt to him to have carried me home on the hurdle i jumped when i went to the rescue of allai and i looked at him with some disappointment enemy he said it was the word that had long been hanging in his windcrop and now he was so delighted with it that he said it three times over good englisk dam enemy stepan see allall right dam enemy his wondrous baldric better smocked with cartridgeloops than a parishclerk could show of plaiting on his sunday front in the days when his wife was proud of him bulged on his mighty chest with the elation of this grand discovery and then he said bad man bad man in a manner which appeared to me too abstract and philosophical no doubt you consider it very fine fun i replied with some warmth of feeling but the knowledge that he was no wiser then up ran allai at a speed which made him resemble a hunted grasshopper and i took from his claws a sealed letter and looked at them both in disdain of any hurry this will keep i said very quietly for though they knew not the meaning of my words they might be asked afterwards how i received it and they should have no flurry to report so i put it in my pocket like a briton stepan and allai and one other man not equally well known to me had evidently been left to finish the packing of some of the heavier goods and the bales of books which had been printed and to take them as well as the beloved dogs perhaps by some slower route and rejoin their master by arrangement i knew that sur imar had long been preparing to move when his period of banishment expired but i was sure that he had no intention of departing so suddenly when i had seen him last stepan contrived to let me know that the luggage was going by a smoker in a day or two from london pond as he called it and having no further business there i took leave of him and allai the lesghian giant was dignified and impressive in his long farewell and gave me his blessingas i supposedand his invitation to the caucasus also this comfortenemy gone no more shoot good englisk which was some relief to a heavy mind but little allai and the two dogsi could scarcely get away from them so loving and so sad were they the short november day was darkening as i left the valley where i had found so much wild happiness and so much deep sorrow to humble me chapter xxxvii lovers make moan now when i had read sur imars letter which i hastened to do by the light from the west at the very spot where he had told his tale there was nothing at least to a clayheaded fellow affording definite answer to the questions which concerned me most the first of these waswhy on earth had my friends broken up and departed so hastily and the secondno less of a puzzle to mewhat had i done to give fatal offence all sur imar wrote was this wherein i found that although he spoke our language so well and fluently and with better command of it than i have he was not quite so familiar with the mysteries of our spelling but let that pass unheeded my dear young friendso i desire to call you still because i am old and an old man has learned that he must not listen to everything neither yield without proof to assertions which contradict his own experience my belief is that you are as full of honour as i was at your time of life and it is always most hot in the young until they are taught that justice is the first thing to be aimed at and i have a firm belief from my observation of you that any mistake you may have made was caused by the influence of the moment and without any intention to do wrong i am grieved that i shall have no opportunity of meeting you again in england we are obliged to depart at once having heard of an adverse incident which threatens all my prospects of success probably we shall never meet again and perhaps you will not desire it but englishmen go everywhere even to the inhospitable caucasus and i would try to prove to you that the epithet is undeserved if you would afford me the chance and show that you still think kindly of your old friend imar the lesghian vexed as i was with painful wonder as to the charge against me i could not help admiring the large and peaceful nature of this man he thought that i had wronged his child the hope of his days and the heart of his life and yet not a bitter word did he employ nor even show a sign of scorn not in vain had he passed through the mill of tribulation by loss of faith in womans goodness he had lost all the delights of love of family bliss and home and comfort for the residue of his time on earth and the lesson it had taught him was to doubt of evil in mankind or at least in those whom his friendly nature led him to approve and like oh why was not his daughter of an equal trust and largeness not a word had she sent me not even one reproach which might have told me that her heart was sore if after all her knowledge of me all the proof which her eyes alone must have rendered to her mind one lying tale whatever it was had been enough to scatter to the wind all her faith and all her love then none of it was worth having so i reasoned and yet in vain the stronger my conviction grew the less was i convinced of it my heart was all with dariel still and let the mind argue as it would had logic ever looked at her any cold dribble may be crystal clear but the current in the veins of man should be warm and red and glowing under that sudden cloud could i rest without looking up to inquire what it was all i could do was to guess and guess but i had no guilty conscience which is the quickest of all conjecturers if for one moment of charm or caprice any lure of the eye or bewitchment of a smile i had gone astray from my one true love the memory would have come up at once and suggested to my shame that i was served aright but there had been nothing of the kind i had only done what seemed at first the simple duty of friendship and after that sunk my own delights in the stress of deep affliction if for this and no more than this i was to be treated as a scoundrel i had a right to know who had put that twist upon it therefore on the following day i took an early train to london and a cab from the terminus to hatton garden and found signor nicolo finishing at leisure a delicate and skilful breakfast he received me very kindly and unpinned the napkin from his italian velvet coat and offered me a glass of something fine which proved a great deal too fine for me my impatience seemed to please him and he was in no hurry to allay it and his first words seemed to me to contain some rather impertinent assumption the great point is to be calm mr cranleigh to be quite calm and look at things quietlyah yes i scarcely know what you refer to mr nickols what is there to prevent my being calm i am simply come to ask about some friends as aas a matter of business you were kind enough when i was here before come come now this wont do we are not having a deal for a diamond i know all about it as well almost as if i had been in the thick of it ah yes but you find yourself bothered dont you certainly i dont like it much i answered as his black eyes flashed at me and a merry smile lifted his long moustache i did not expect to be treated thus and i was strongly attached to sur imar and to kuban and orla ah yes i see and to stepan and allai and all the rest what a pity there were no ladies there you might have become attached to them as well i call it very kind of you to spare me so much time i answered rather stiffly for i would have no vulgar chaff about dariel i was almost afraid of encroaching upon business duke of k at eleven oclock serene highness of l at twelve king of the malachites at halfpast and a bigger swell than all of them put together to a devilled bone at therefore we must touch the point you want to know why our interesting friends have bolted so suddenly and still more why they did it without tata to you that last point i am not clear about though i have some shrewd suspicions but i think i can tell you why they made a brief adieu to the neighbours who never came near them you will acknowledge that they could not be expected to stand on ceremony there you have got the stick by the wrong end altogether i broke in for the sake of justice we let them alone for the excellent reason that we knew they wished to be let alone no englishman ever endeavours to push through a gate that is always bolted our neighbourhood took no notice of them because it was known from the very first that they came there for that purpose and living in a wilderness of ivied ruins you appear to have turned against them even more than their behaviour warrants but for all that sur imar is a really great man he looks at things differently from you and me and it is not for us to judge him for like all men who go in for what we dont care about he is set down as a crank a dreamer a man with a tile off a fellow you would like to toss for sovereigns with and everything else that a cad of the gutter pities and sucks up to but i can tell you that the lesghian old man as the idiots would call him at fortyfive may defy a polish jew to cheat him for i dont call it cheating a man when he knows it and lets you do it because he scorns you and the cash alike when you cheat him you are like a man who steals his housewater from a horsetrough and you deserve to get glanders for it but what i call fine cheating is to get twice the value of a thing out of a wiry old screw whose money is his life and his life all money oh yes there is some joy in that signor nicolo rubbed his hands and then put them into the feeling of his pockets with a warmth of some rich memorynot very old i daresay but you would never do such a thing as that i asked with a little doubt quivering in the question you would be far above all such ideas would i of course i would when i couldnt get the chance and i would never get the better of a real friend beyond twentyfive per cent at maximum and he would make seventyfive on that at the west end but when a man i hate with a fine religious strength comes here to get the best of me screwing up his mouth and looking righteous and as cordial as a stewed spanish onionoh dear how lovely a little flat in the culetwould be perfect but for that milky spot below the zone and so on for what did the almighty make a man except to chisel such a curmudgeon ah yes i have done it a hundred times and hope i may be spared to do it a thousand more it is not for the money it is the intellectual triumph everybody knows what i am come to me fairly and i treat you fairly must have my living wage of course but no more unless you try to rob me then you have got the wrong pig by the ear and its the very same thing in love mr cranleigh have you tried to take a rise out of dariel this would have made me very angry with at least nine people out of ten but i knew that i had a queer character to deal with and that he meant no harm but only to get to the bottom of the matter so i told him that if there was anything of that sort i thought it was rather the other way and then i was quite in a fury with myself for putting it as if she could have done a shabby thing and i praised her ninefold and could have gone on for an hour you are all right he said that is clear enough you are as infatuated as a goddess could require we have all been so some time or other but you should have seen her mother ah yes ah yes signora nicolo cannot bear to hear her name though she ought to be grateful for it kept me good and plunged me i do believe into matrimony a sweet woman never knows the good she does any more than an impudent flippant one can measure her own mischief for the sake of that noble oria as well as of sur imar who saved my life i would go anywhere and do anything to be of service to dariel and for her own sake too i can tell you for she is a most charming creature though a little too soft like her father ah thats where the mischief will come in how can you save a man from himself after all the lies he has suffered from and the wreck of his lifei know all about it now though i didnt when i saw youwould you believe that he is spoonier than ever about doing good to those cursed fellows saving their souls why theyve got none or if they have what are ours to be called as different as quartz from opal which are much the same thing though in different form and as for their bodies they are big enough already and dirty enough and as hard as nails let them all kill one another is what the lord intended and nature does her best to help him why the country ought to belong to us we could do some good with it it should have been ours long ago no doubt of that i replied for that seems to be the duty of every land i knew that sur imar meant to go and for years he has been preparing to civilise his people but what has made him go so suddenly well i think it was through a tall young fellow who has been prowling about for a long time prince hafer he calls himself prince of the ossets who are nextdoor neighbours to these lesghians when they have any door at all i mean i wont pretend to know much about him but what i have heard is rather shady he bore a most wonderful reputation among his own niggers if i may call them so for the ossets are rather a dusky lotnever had there been such an angel seen too good too benevolent too holy but apollyon the prince of this village of ours has been too many for our mountainchief and he has carried on rarely at the hotel celestial and other sparkling places if he had not been a prince they would have had him up at bow street but he talked about russia and they thought he was too big moreover our noble policemen saw that there was nobody likely to interpret him so they took it out in coin according to the custom of the country he paid for a mirror and three electroplated pots and with mutual esteem they parted but what a fiend of a temper he must have for he never gets drunk to make us sponge him with our tears that is most unjust on his part i have seen him twice and nearly felt him once but never mind that i shall square it up some day i beg pardon for interrupting but how can sur imar ever listen to him when you are as old as i am mr cranleigh one thing alone will surprise you to wit that you were ever surprised at the folly of the wisest of mankind but i have no time for a homily you want to know how i have learned these things have you ever heard of a certain captain strogue yes and i have seen him and i formed a strong opinion though all my impressions seem worthless now that captain strogue is a man of honour in his own way i mean and according to his views not a man who would try to pot you in the dark i believe that you are quite right so far strogue is a man of honour according to his lights but alas an inveterate gambler and that saps the foundations of honesty god made honesty and man makes honour and shapes it according to the fashion of the day strogue has been here he has sat in that chair with his head in his hands and shivering for he is also a very hard drinker i am well known all over europe as a purchaser of fine diamonds strogue had given an i o u the night before for l which he could not redeem he had been fleeced and he knew it too well by paltry little allround dealers hucksters at the very bottom of the trade who have only one test for gem from paste if your brother harold were a bit of a rogue he might have a fine game with them but strogue had the wisdom at last to come to me poor fellow he has a very fine nature he absolutely burst into tears when he saw all the value he had thrown away signor i am very hard up he saidwhich is just the right way to begin with me though the very worst with any other in the trade this is the last and the best of my jewels a good judge has told me it is very fine unless i can raise l today i shall have to put a pistol to my head how much will you give me for this affair i examined it well though a glance was enough then i tested him as to his ownership to keep him on the tenterhooks as he richly deserved and then i said captain i will take it at a thousand pounds but only upon one condition you should have seen his eyes it was a lamentable sight to discover such joy in the face of a man who had done such wonders in his better days my condition i proceeded for he could not speak is that you shall sign a pledge prepared by me anything anything you like he answered and in two minutes he had signed an undertaking upon his honour to abandon every form of gambling whether he will keep it is another question but so far he has kept it and i think he will hold fast that is what i call doing good and the stone was well worth the money i thought that it would have been still more beneficent if the stone had not been worth the money but who could expect that and of whom signor nicolo looked for praise and i gave it warmly but you did not pump him on the strength of it i asked and meeting an indignant glance i qualified my question what i mean is you did not exactly endeavouryour duty towards sur imar and your desire to protect him from the schemes of that other fellow did not induce you to inquire i suppose what this pair of rogues could be driving at i am not sure that i should have let him go without that to a limited extent perhaps i did signor nicolo answered with a candid smile not that i put any temptation in his way to make him turn traitor to his master but simply that casually as things came about he cast away in some degree that cowardly veil of caution which is always so abhorrent to our better feelings nine people out of ten would have crossexamined him but i did nothing of the sort only from some things he let slip i gathered a fair general idea of the game those two are playing or rather that other fellow for to strogue it can make no difference unless the bargain isno play no pay hafers game is to get possession of the lovely dariel as you must have suspected long ago not for her beautythose fellows out there pitchandtoss for that kind of thingbut for the start it will give him in the universal race of robbery you must not be mild enough mr cranleigh to suppose that you have seen any sample of the caucasus in the noble sur imar and his sensitive daughter or even in the model henchman stepan if the camp in your valley had been of the general type you would not have had a sheep left long ago much less a cock with a crow in his throat ragamuffins is the proper name for most of them and although these lesghians take them all in all are about the pick of the basket you would be in the wrong box altogether if you took them for sweet innocents they are simply under their chieftains thumb and by ancient tribal law he can chop off their heads when he pleases this keeps them in order and they pay for their milk instead of lifting cattle prince hafer however is not under any fealty to sur imar so far from that his great aim is to be lord of the ossets and the kheusurs too and karthlos tower which is a noble place and might defy an army for a twelvemonth hafer is cunning but has too much temper and worst of all he has not steered clear of the many traps set by civilisation for a young savage with his pockets full he has fallen among a bad lot a company of young rakes contemptuous of women and yet thoroughly in their power what would he venture near dariel after being in such vile company we have heard that he was almost too good to live she gave me so grand an account of him that i thought it was all up with my poor chance but what a falling off is here the prince of all virtues the paragon of modesty the hero of all chivalryand now he wont even sham can you explain it mr nickols no thats no business of mine nature does it but i shall hear more about it soon and get a flood of light let in in london you never know anything well from hearing such a lot about everything but it is not quite the same in the caucasus you dont hear much there but you attend to it and now you will be surprised to be told that after so many years of hearing next to nothing of that part of the world and never seeing one of their celestial peaks except in a dream i am likely to know more about them than when i lived there ah if i hadnt got a wife and three daughtersand i have let out so much like a jolly fool that they wont have french stuff on their birthdaysi should be ready to be off again though i could never do the djedje now and the love of sport is not in me as it is in all trueborn englishmen he looked regretful and perhaps remorseful against his mingled parentage for there was a vein of the israelite in him which saddens and deepens the outlook without showing any sport except a gold disc to shoot at never mind i answered him though sorry to have to do it you get your little excitements in your way and although they are not like ours altogether they pay ever so much better in the end let us come back he said thinking in his heart perhaps that he could do very well without my sympathy my proceedings only bear upon your case in an odd sort of way which may come to nothing you remember that i told you of my russian friend whom i met at odessa twenty years ago or more through him i first went into those savage parts where he lost his life and it was a narrow shave that i survived to tell of it for which i have to thank sur imar you may have forgotten but i think i must have told you that my russian had a brother an officer in the army then closing round the forces of shamyl very well who should call upon me a few days after i told you about that but the very same russian officer now second in command of the caucasus division general stranglomoff himself he was in london about some military business and knowing my intimacy with his poor brother he did me the honour of calling to hear some particulars of the sad occurrence i described it as well as i could and then he said brushing up his english as i brushed up my russian whenever there was a gap between usi am not a jeweller signor and of precious stones i have not any knowledge but place thine eyes upon this is it good he wore a white glove of soft ratskin and upon it was the rich green light of the finest emerald i have seen since i was at warsaw plenty plenty twenty fiftyten a thousand i pray you to accept this pebble signor for my brothers sake he said with a very graceful bow he was taken away through these and i desire no advantage of them and with that he shed a tear which made me think how much we undervalue that fine race there is no kinderhearted man on earth and no more perfect gentleman than a russian of the highest order well sir i sent my own nephew outjack nickols a wonderfully plucky fellow not much eye for a stone but sure to stick to his orders and tell you the truth if you cant be satisfied with that goodbye to your chance of keeping anybody very long for the sharp ones will soon begin to rogue you jack is as good a bit of english metal as you could pick up from the lias to the granite and not too clever in fact mr cranleigh you remind me of him at every turn i bowed very deeply at this lovely compliment with a glance which i meant to be ironical but signor nicolo was too busy with his thoughts to perceive the stern justice he had done me emeralds are going up he proceeded as if i were one of them and i should not be surprised if the true grassgreen became the rage for the next few years there are only three gems that will always hold their own diamonds rubies and sapphires the rest go up and down according to the fashion and emeralds have been unduly in the shade but now they are worth looking after again and my nephew is the boy to do it hit or miss he will do his best and we have made an arrangement with the russian general under which he is bound to back him up jack is not very strong at letterwriting and the post is not too brisk out there but he has been on the spot for some time now and he has made a very good beginning all this to me was little more than cold and cloudy comfort here was the winter close at hand the winter of the frosty caucasus the friends i loved become strangers to me and lost to my sight among savages my own fair fame in some mysterious manner assailed and blasted and the only hope of further tidings or redress yet visible lay in the chances of a roving jewellers commission nickols might take it all quite calmly his heart was set and cementedas one might almost sayupon precious stones and hard enough as it seemed to me to grind them for trade purposes but in my impatience i wronged him there you must try to make the best of it mr cranleigh he went on as if he understood my thoughts you have been horribly slandered no doubt and the sweet young lady has swallowed wicked lies all the more readily because she is a sweet young lady and for that reason credulous and jealous but there are a lot of things in your favour still if you will let me set them before you i have not the least idea what you are charged with any more than you have but whatever it may be the charge will grow fainter and the faith in it weaker as time goes on and the inventor of it will become more hateful probably hafer has invented it and even while she listens to it her heart will turn against him i know what a good woman is because i have had to deal with them a man who runs women down is either a bad lot himself or a most unlucky fellow moreover she dislikes that cousin of hers if he is her cousin for his violence and roughness and haughty ways all that will increase when he gets home again and contrasts all their hard and uncivilised life with the luxuries and joys of london she will turn against him more and more and her father will never compel her to marry against her wishes moreover there is likely to be some time yet before his schemes come to a head my young savage has overthrown his cast or that of his mother marva in his urgency to get them back straightway to the land of the mountain without the flood he has sent them round by st petersburg he insisted so much on the peril they were in of losing all their lesghian rights that sur imar resolved very wisely as i thought to assert them at headquarters so stepan and others were left behind to take the heavy goods straight to poti perhaps this was a floorer for prince hafer and he gnashed his teeth which he dyes yellow for he is the devil and no mistake when he cant have his own way you dont consider me a suspicious man mr cranleigh do you a little too much the other way as is the case with all fine natures i replied according to my thoughts for he was evidently taking my part now in that case listen to my firm belief i am not at all up to the tone and style of what those mountaineers do now and of course i may be as much behind the age as sur imar wants to be in front of it but to my mind men are men always and you cant improve them suddenly a lot of sham comes in with some races but not with stubborn chaps like these sur imar may print a million copies of the sermon on the mount but it wont go down with them or it goes down and never comes up again you may as well pour gold into a cesspool my firm belief is that this prince hafer intends to get our noble friend out there marry his daughter and then shoot him and combine that heritage with his own ah yes nickols had a very quiet and even pleasant manner of imparting the most atrocious thoughts that could ever drive another man out of his mind i looked at him to ask whether he could mean it and he smiled and answered you may take it for a fact but his own sister his twin sister the darling of his childhoodmarva how could all such wickedness go on without her knowledge it is impossible to imagine that she would allow it she sent her son to england for that very purpose mr nickols replied in a tone of deep conviction it may not sound sisterly but it is true there is the bloodfeud between them that they have been in the womb together only makes it deadlier i know what i am talking of if he didand he spoke as if it were an ordinary matteri can only be certain that i did not my brain was quite stunned with such horrible ideas and i almost felt as if dariel herself would be too dear at the price of any connection with such vile and bloodthirsty savages then i felt bitter reproach at blaming a sweet gentle darling for what she could not help and after providing for quick communication i hurried away with my heart in a whirl chapter xxxviii black friday in whatever condition a man may be placed under the will of heaven there is generally something to alleviate it if he seek perseveringly and always something to aggravate it without any exertion on his part in my present trouble i had several consolations and the best and sweetest of them was the kindness of my sister grace she had leaped without looking for any signal or even any ground to jump from to the solid conclusion that her poor brother george had been treated most cruelly shamefully shockingly and if there be worse than this put it on the pile and yet she never spoke of itnever at least to me though she may have filled the world with it to her beloved jacksonbut let me know her sympathies by a silent lift of cover as a large and capable hamboiler doeswhen a tin saucepan would have blown its top off a man loathes sympathy if he is of english race nothing irritates him more than for other fellows to come prying down into what goes on inside him even to his dearest friend he does not stretch out his heart like a washerwomans line what may be inside it is his own concern and like a gentleman he must not be too curious about that so long as it leads him into nothing mean all i can say is that i never felt inclined to be savage towards the female race because one of them had disappointed me and the beauty of it was that i could not hold one spark of rancour against her the great generosity of love was in me and all the fault i had to find went abroad among her sex but never touched herself so do jilted poets wail about all other women but acquit the one they love but grace showed her sympathy more delicately according to her sex and education what pleased me most in her behaviour was that she never brought her own little whiffs of loveand lovers are always having either whiffs or tiffsinto her placid pretty interviews with me she even broke out against her own sect now and thenfor the women had begun to make sect of sex even then as they feign to do now altogetherand expressed a contempt of them which any man would have been extremely rash to acquiesce in she meant it for the best and i was much obliged about it but not the faintest fibre of my heart was put in tune by it then all of a sudden it became the duty of my life to comfort her one evening getting on for christmastide i was sitting in my beloved den after a rather hard days work as glum as a briton can wish to be but soothed by my pipe and the smell of saddles when in came grace very quietly and kindly but without saying anything at first as if i were too busy to notice her she began to sweep a trifle of tobaccodust which had dropped on the table contradictorilyfor i am a wonderfully tidy fellowinto the pink cup of her palm and then she went and put something straight that was straight enough before for any man and then she pretended not to hear me when i askedwhat is the matter dear for i knew as well as a thousand sighs could have told me that she was in trouble and being up to every trick of hers i was sure that her eyes were full of tears although she would not let me see them butter returned on your hands again i suggested in a feeling tone for there was an old lady quite a double patent screw at the further end of the parish who was never tired of boastingas old croaker told us more than oncethat her butter was made by a baronets daughter yet sent her such messages as no duchess would think of sending to her dairymaid returned on my own hands grace seemed to mutter and i let her take her time unable as i was to make this out then without caring properly where she might be in the narrow little room she hit upon by force of a gleam from the fireplace that very same cracked and spotted lookingglass in which my friend tom had admired himself with infinitely better reasonhowever feminine and waveringgrace cranleigh might have regarded herself and defied any one except dariel to peep over the snowy shoulders but instead of pride what came i know not only that i flung my pipe away and had my darling sister in my arms where she cast away all pretence and would have spoiled any waistcoat that was not worn out hehehe she sobbed and i saidwhat he and she answered him as if there was only one man in the world though he might go into fifty cases jackson i asked but she would not have it even at such a crisis my jack she declared looking up at me as if every george was rubbish my own jackwill you never understand and when i was getting so fond of him getting indeed why you have thought of nothing else for at least three months you have made too much of him with the usual result i daresay oh dont touch me dont come near me no wonder your dariel ran away you have not the least sense of noble things what have i done to have such a brother there must be a crack in the family i said as she cut away into a windsor chair and fixed all her soul on the fire as if it were the only warm thing left on earth wonderful wonderful i pursued my own reflections till she should come round and you dont even seem to care to ask what it is he has done to me grace began to show her pretty nose over her left shoulder while i snuffed the candles and began to fill a pipe though you know the high opinion i always have of your opinion you had better not say a word about it i answered in the kindest manner no doubt it is the usual thing you told me that all men were alike till you made such an idol of poor stocks and stones now you see that he is just like the rest of us i have long ceased to hope for any greatness from you but i did expect some fairness my sister spoke as if i had not allowed her to say a word all this time you know that i cannot argue george or at least you pretend to think so which comes to the very same thing with a man then how thoroughly ashamed of yourself you ought to be as soon as you can spare me time to tell you the simple truth mr jackson stoneman the gentleman you with such admirable taste and such lofty humour call stocks and stones is not tired of me as you kindly imagine in fact he thinks more of me than ever if you had only seen his face dont cry my dear child now dont cry any more i am very sorry if i misunderstood you but how could i help it you do take such a time what can be his reason for behaving in this manner because he is rururuined she never was much of a hand at crying but this terrible word and her effort at it served as the cord that brings down the showerbath hoohoohoo she went and it was no good for me to say anything oh that dariel were crying for me like that was the thought that came into my selfish heart i should not mind being rururuined if i could only hope for that then grace got better as girls always do if you let them have their cry out what makes it soso distressing so heartbreaking is that the whole of it has been through methrough me whom he chose without a single pennyme who had nothing more than poverty to bring him poverty and faith and a very ordinary mind and then not content with that i must do my best to rob him of every farthing of his noble fortune perhaps one of the wealthiest men in the world until he set eyes upon unlucky me oh george it will never be in your power to understand my pure contempt for money yet you ought not to rob anybody of it and i have robbed the noblest man that ever lived of every penny every penny in the name of the forty thieves and morgiana and the man they cut into four pieces how can you have done all this i asked being certain that there never was a girl more reasonable yet remembering how the wisest of them love a little speculation to anybody but you george it would be too selfevident to require any explanation why will you drive me to a thing so painful do you mean to say that he does not love me better than his life i believe and better even than his money but how does that bear upon the matter they dont quote love upon the stock exchange oh george and you think you are a business man grace smiled gloriously through her tears possibly through her triumph over me probably through the joy of my assurance can anybody do two things at once could my jack attend to ups and downs keep his whole mind intent on argentinas contangoes fundangoes holdovers and holdunders and even unspeakable turks with fifty wives when the whole of his pure heart was down here why he only went up about once aweek if he could get me to go out nutting with him alas i see neglected business left understrappers and dashing young clerks and trusty old codgers with pens behind their ears to stick to the stools while he made sweet hay but there must be something more than that you turn everything into vulgarity george and you are capable of laughing at the most sacred things but there was more than that and a great deal more than that you may have heard him speak in his grand confiding manner of a man named franks who has been with him many years he has promoted him from place to place and trusted him with almost everything and i do believe that franks had no intention of doing anything crooked and he spoke in the most enthusiastic terms of me though of course they never mention such a subject in the office and when black friday came as you know it did through some very stupid error of the government jack only laughed at first except for the sake of some dear friends of his who were hit rather hard it appeared so ridiculous to suppose that a firm like his could be affected but there proved to be something i cannot quite understand it although i keep my books so clearly that i know every farthing owing to me something some involvement some terrible affair which will force him to give up the hall and the shooting and the pedigree butterfly cows and even me dont let him do it dont hear of it for a moment you will never get such another fellow i exclaimed as she turned away to wipe her glistening cheeks hell come round as right as a roach in the end you didnt let him off on that tack i hope as for letting him off dear george is he a trout that i should treat him so he is not like a slippery fish for a moment but a deephearted truehearted wonderful man why his conversation is as different from yoursbut i will not depreciate you unless you go against me only i should like to know how i can help myself when a gentleman saysi am truly sorry but i cant have any more to do with youoh dear oh dear what can any lady do lay hold of his coat and say none of that nonsense i am the best judge of that question and i have settled it the other way unless you put up the bans within a month you must favor me with the address of your solicitors dont laugh at me i have never laughed at you i did tell him over and over again that the money could never make any difference to me and indeed that i was very glad except for his sake because then nobody could ever saybut he talked of the duty of a man and so forth and the crime of allowing me to sacrifice myself and a cranleigh the wife of a bankrupt and i dont know what else for i broke down then and he was obliged of course he wasany amount of physical sustentation as the reporters call it but leave it to me my dear where is he now too late for him to go back to london i should think but i wonder he didnt come to see me he did but you were not to be found oh george i am thinking of every one of us what shall we do the hall will be thrown upon our hands again at a time of year when you would as soon live in a hearse and harold has made another of his great hits which always cost a hundred pounds and never produce a penny how often i wish that i were like old sally without any pedigree butterfly blood and allowed to go and rout my husband up just as mrs slemmick is she routed him out from the roothouse last week said i being glad of any frivolous turn that might bring the dry colours into the rainbow she believed that he was gone for ever without leaving his wages in his sunday waistcoat pocket and snowdrop violet hyacinth just wheezing into the whoopingcough but no she underrated the nobility of man he had tucked up his legs on a big flowerpot with a pipe in his mouth and his heart was so full that he was going without breakfast are women alone to be considered faithful you mean that i am worse than mrs slemmick girls never take the moral of the proverb aright very well i daresay i am but i will never tuck my feet upon a flowerpot and wait to be coaxed home when the tea is getting cold there is something very large in the character of slemmick and he shows it by his confidence in feminine affection at the same time it does appear a little small of you to quote mother slemmick against me she is married and cannot help herself hear hear i cried leaving her to put the point to it which she did with a blush and a very cheerful smile then she gave me a kiss to make up for little words and i set out to see what i could do for her i found the poor stockbroker looking stockbroken and sitting on a hard chair with his long legs crossed off for the mediterranean i asked and he saidbay of biscay or bay of fundy going to the bottom anyhow rot i replied with less elegance than terseness dont try to make me think that you would ever throw the sponge up i know you a bit better than that jackson stoneman illustration rot i replied with less elegance than terseness would you like me to be a thief george cranleigh if i choose to be a thief i can slip out very lightly but if i prefer to be an honest man there is very small chance of my doing it he told me in a few words what his position was owing to a panic which had ended in a crash through the roguery of a few and the folly of the many and how his own firm had become involved in thoroughly unsound transactions mainly through his own inattention and his confidence in a very clever fellow who had cut things a little too fine at last as very clever fellows nearly always do we must lose a quarter of a million he said even if we pull through at all which is more than doubtful all depends upon tomorrow but it is not for myself that i care george it is for your darling sisterthe best and the bravest and the most unselfish girlwhy she wanted to stick to me through everything she behaved as if it could make no difference between us i should hope so indeed i would disown her if she did otherwise did you think that she was going to have you for your money jackson i am not quite so bad as that you may be sure still you must excuse a modest fellow for thinking his money the best part of him here i was glad to see one of his old dry smiles but the point of it is this as you know well enough without my tellingi can have nothing more to say to grace who was worth all my cash and my credit and ambitions and everything except my conscience to me that is all very fine and very lofty in its way i answered with a superior smile which refreshed him as it was meant to do and among city people it may hold good or the big world of the clubland but no sound englishman takes it so you dont suppose that my father approved of your going in for our grace because you then were a wealthy man i should hope i spoke with strong confidence but perhaps the strength of it was chiefly in my voice god forbid he replied with horror while i tried not to doubt that god had forbidden no i am well aware that sir harold disliked it from the first and lady cranleigh even more it was nothing but the goodness of dear grace and that makes it such a frightful thing for me why that angel was ready to stick to me likelike a brick if i only would allow it a man who knows the world would never believe it for a moment then he must know a very bad world and be a worthy member of it what do you suppose i would have done to my sister if she had been mean enough to shy off because of your misfortune how can i tell george you are one of the most pigheaded fellows going but you could not have been angry with her for not being quite as stubborn as you are jackson this is what i would have done i would have taken the manescissors that hang above my mantel and shorn off her great crop of hair to her ears no gold for her there if her heart were all pinchbeck stoneman looked at me with outraged feelings not even a brother could do that he said brutal as brothers by nature seem to be but without any humbug george do you really mean that you wish it to go on if i did not i should be a wretched snob it was not for money that you wanted grace and you insult her by fancying that she wanted you for yours all this is very pleasant doctrine and an edifying parable for little boys and girls the stockbroker had a peculiar trick of showing his keen eyes as if in a gable when his mind was puzzled or excited but it would not hold water george either in a court of honour or a council of wisdom grace is entitled both by birth and beauty and i am sure that i might say by intellect as well to a position which high rank alone or wealth on her husbands part can secure high rank i cannot give her wealth i could have given but the prospect of that has vanished and with it vanishes all my hope of her oh that she had only thrown me over i could have got over it then but not now now look here i said as a briton always calls attention to the knockdown blow he is delivering all that would be worth listening to if it had anything to do with the matter but as it happens my sister grace doesnt care a flip about position any more than i do or you or anybody else with a haporth of commonsense we value the opinion of good people and we like money for the comfort of others as well as ourselves but as for that mysterious affair you call positionthe more you poke your head up the harder cracks you get on it grace will be contented with whatever pleases you that holds you together and you never slip away people who have only got a lawn enjoy it a thousand times as much as a lord enjoys his park and a man who loves his wife does not want to lose her among a thousand men and women he has never heard of all pushing about to please themselves and sneering at them both by way of gratitude you will make a fine domestic character george if you only act up to your theories i shall never forget your true friendship and noble behaviour in this matter i shall take my own course however as i always do i know what is right and you may talk for ever there is only one voice that could move me and that one shall have no chance of doing it even if desired for her own sweet sake but everything will depend upon tomorrow if things are as bad then as they have been today there will be no escape for me grace shall never be a bankrupts wife if her sense of honour urges it mine forbids and it is not only honour but commonsense my friend your family has fallen in the world too much already it shall not be dragged lower by any connection with a defaulting stockbroker his face showed no sign of emotion now and i owned to myself that from his point of view no other course was possible for a man of honour whether his point of view was right or wrong is quite a different question but in spite of all my reasoning i have very little doubt that i should have done as he did chapter xxxix frangi non flecti jack is getting on like a house on fire signor nicolo wrote in an envelope enclosing a rather grimy letter which i received on the following morning he has not had a classical education and so you can always make out what he means specimens to hand confirm his opinion perhaps i shall go out in the spring could not stand the cold there now come and see me whenever you think fit when this was put into my hand i was ready to start for london having promised to meet stoneman outside the exchange at one oclock this had been my own proposal for one can never be certain how a man may take great ups and downs of fortune and although i had not much apprehension as to stonemans fortitude it seemed to me that a good friend should be at hand and do his best for him so i read the letter of young jack nickols on my way to londonbridge and found it very straightforward and simple and who cares for spelling after that the rising generation gets on very well without it and a thousand schoolboards do their utmost to destroy its memory never did see a place so mountaniousthis young fellow said where i first began to read for the signor had kept the first page in his pocket or leather bag or steel safe so far as i could tellyou never get up to the jag of one knifegrinder before you have got to fetch your wind and grind your bones for another the alps is nothing to it they goes up gradual and is ever so much smaller to my mind and you dont get big chaps here to shove you up and keep you straight these fellows cackle at you with a horrid voice and they squat in a ring and stare at you if you want to go up any clumsy sort of peak and they tell one another that all englishmen are mad but they are as sharp about the rhino as petticoat lane crossed with a new cut costermonger and you cant bring them to book as you can a thief at home you have to do it all through a chap who knows their lingo and you cant make out what he is saying to them and you cant be sure without your revolver ready that they wont stick their skewers which they call jingles into your spine without letting you look round i had a poor time of it at first but they seem to be getting now to make me out when you come to know them you might find worse fellows for i cannot call them treacherous exackly they would skin you to your sparerib if you let them have the chance but they wont stick a knife into you until you aggravate them i am getting rather thick with some of them by making out a little of their crackjaw words though there seems to be no end of them but talk about jaws i need not tell you as you have seen too much of them there was a man in yorkshire about fifty years ago who could get through a lamb and then three quarters of her mother but one of these fellows would eat the whole sheep first and then take her little ones for desert but you must remember that their sheep weigh less than ours and i like to see a man make a hearty dinner but it is hard lines to pay him for the sheep and then let him come to dine with you as he must do so that you never get a taste of it however i am not complaining the country must be beautiful when the snow lets a fellow look at it and you think the more about it because it is out of sight tell rosa that the girls are not a patch upon her and she would laugh to see how they put their hair up the men are not refined enough to think much of the women but make them wear swabs upon their faces and the insects are tremenjious in the summertime we have got more than we can do now to keep any road clear to get at the pocket where the stones are just a soft place between two tremenjious rocks down comes the snow again and you could scarcely find it out unless you leave a black tarpole sticking up and then you must fix it wonderfully firm or you wont find it in the morning for the wind does blow i can tell you we shall have to knock off for three months i am afraid and where am i to go to all the time the russians are not half bad fellows only some of them too pious when you come to know them only you may be glad of that sometimes because when they go to say their prayers you get the best place by the fire i dont care for quite so much tea myself and i have not tasted a good bit of tobacco for a month but everybody says that when some great man who has been living for several years in england and i do believe i have heard you speak of him when he comes back they say he will change everything all the thieves of the mountains will begin to say their prayers and nobody will stick his best friend for nothing if this can be managed it will be a true excelsior but you remember what the people said the year we went to yarmouth and it is out of the question for me to say what i would give to be there now they said and you could not deny it when you wanted a bloater before they came insir we lay ourselves out to oblige all the gents that come from london but we cannot make a red herring swim i could not see exactly how they meant it but it is just the same thing in the caucasus for a long time i could not see my way to be sure of not being struck at any moment but i got over that idea as we must if we mean to get on anywhere i will not say that my life is sacred now as people express it in london but ever since the popular opinion began to identify me with the devil through their ignorance of english manners i have had a much better time of it tell rosa that in spite of uncommonly rough victuals i weigh seven pounds more than i could pull when she came to see me off at woodgreen station nobody ever weighs anybody here for after all they are not cannibals though i told her so to make her kiss me but the steelyard i brought goes to half an ounce and has saved me a lot of money and tell her if you think that it wont be too encroaching under the peculiar circumstances that i am not quite turned into the devil yet though she might say so if she could see me and even if the climate had done it an angel like her need not be afraid of him hoping to come home with a sackful of emeralds believe me dear uncle james your most affectionate nephew john nickols at the bottom of this very vague and disjointed but as it proved afterwards too true description signor nicolo had written in pencil rosa is my eldest daughter but i shall have to put a stop to it my noble countrymen as sur imar used to call themit would take a long time to fetch them up to that mark according to this english boys account and the enthusiastic chief could not begin too soon it appeared to me that as many generations as he could trace from karthlos would scarcely be enough to restore them to the level of antediluvian culture no wonder that he was in a hurry to begin and if i am doomed to wait for the completion of his task erit altera quae vehat argo there will be another ark on the top of ararat and sure enough here is another babel to begin with for in the absorption of the thoughts above recounted i found myself caught in the whirl and crush and uproar of a crowd as wild as any savage land could show a crowd not of paupers but welldressed people roaring and raging and besieging the portals of the stock exchange battered hats and coats in tatters fists thrown up but unable through crunched elbow to come down again faces black with choking wrath wherever the brown mud peeled from them grinding teeth and cursing lips and chests that groaned with the digs they took without any chance of returning themi thought of lord melladews father and the bullock compressed into his cloverhay only let me keep outside the pack of the central squeeze if possible for once in there no strength of man could get me out or let me out so i put up my knee which was a dangerous thing to do for if i lost my feet goodbye to me when a gentleman with whom it would have been a joy to dineso comely and wellliking and welltodo was hebeing unable to get at me with his fists let out at me with language i had never heard the like of i attempted no retort for he had already got the worst of it and without any knowledge how it came to pass except that there must be more luck than wit in shoving here i was with my clothes still pretty sound outside the drum of squashed figs and squealing pigs but another poor fellow was not so lucky let him go slide him on hell be dead in half a minute serve him right no no howd you like it dont tread on him more than you can help it was a solid man upon the ground but likely to be hollow before ever he could be an upright man i had got a short knobstick in my hand which i always carried since my faith in human nature had waned through that dastardly bullet and in the most blundering and selfish manner i set the knob against my breast and the stubend foremost and charged into the lump of figures across me considerable yielding and heads running into heads and yellow waistcoats sloping like sheaves of wheat in shock and big boots toeing up at me and a hail of blows in flankit is impossible to say how i got on but there must have been a hollow place somewhere in the mass for they fought into a lane and allowed me to lay hold of a pair of yellow shoes or at least they had been yellow and tow out the prostrate body on its back and feel it for the signs of life or death aint dead yet said a hoarse and husky voice never fainted in my life and dont mean to do it now i admired the pluck of this poor fellow for indeed he was in a frightful mess and another halfminute must have silenced him forever with the help of a bystander who only cost a shilling i was able to get my trodden friend across the street and into a double doorway where a score of people came and stared at him well if he aint a tough un cut the poor blokes collar stand him on his pins and blow to him give him a drop of brandy advice poured in on every side more freely than assistance dont you know who i am you fools the injured man sat up with the aid of one hand on the stones and gazed defiantly all over the world ive been but never saw such cursed idiots captain strogue sir of the british pioneers he glanced at me with hazy eyes which told of many strong waters and would tell of many more if heaven permitted and then he tried to bow but a pang in his chest took the grace from that salutation all right down the alley three doors to the left he shoved away all who pressed forward to lift him but allowed me to help him with his knees still hanging to the place he had indicated and sure enough everybody knew him there the captain the captain the bold british captain he have been in the wars and no mistake out came the landlady and the barmaid with tears in their eyesfor he had promised to marry bothand an ancient potboy with all his wits about him brought a rummer and a teaspoon and stirred up something hot thats the physic maam he said and the lady smiled and offered it and met with no refusal in a word captain strogue was in the right place now and after helping to bestow him snugly upon a horsehair sofa in a small back room i was at the point of leaving when he put up one hand and stopped me owe you my life he said not worth much now but has done a deal of service to civilization near st pauls aint we thats where theyll put me know your face very well but cant remember he seemed to be dropping off into a doze having finished his strong potation but i told him my name and where i had met him for i was eager to be off to keep my time with stoneman dont be in a hurry sir you have helped me and i can help you strogue pays his debts somebody else will find that out his eyes shone fiercely and he pressed his knuckles to his side widow lazenby knows what i amdont you ducky oh captain and at such a crisis the landlady murmured after looking round to be certain where the barmaid was but sir he have described himself wonders he have done without wondering at himself it is a righteous thing that men of such achievements should have their reward where it is sweetest fame they may never get for that is all a fluke gold they scarcely ever gain because they are no grubbers love they cannot stop to grasp and see but savage frames of it rank they laugh at having found it the chief delight of black boys but to get his grog for glory and his victuals for victory is the utmost any english pioneer can hope of england cranleigh you can go said strogue for his manners were not perfect you are involved in this little shindy and you want to know all about it these thieves shut shop at one oclock on a saturday some one told me but if you will come back by two i shall have set this rib by then and have rumpsteak and oysters join me without any ceremony i owe you a debt and you shall have it i had seen too many strange things now to be surprised at anything as i might have been six months ago and it was plain that this companion of the hateful hafer meant to do me some good turn at a private opportunity so i promised to return by two oclock and hurried to stonemans business place avoiding the crowd that still was yelling at every approach to the house of mammon bless you sir it is nothing at all compared to what it was yesterday ah that was something like a row a big policeman told me there was fifty taken to hospital and the barriers snapped like hurdles why there aint been halfadozen ribs today you cant call that no panic neither did i find any panic at jackson stonemans offices a stolid old clerk was putting things away and evidently anxious to get home to early dinner he told me that his principal had been disappointed at not meeting me and concluded as the train had been in long enough that something had occurred to stop me and so had departed on his own account when i asked how things had gone that morning old peppersall eyed me with some indignation as if it were impossible for anything to go wrong with a firm so stable and majestic well how did the senior partner look i asked and peppersall replied he was a bit put out about a sixpence that rolled off a desk in room no till it turned up under the wainscoting youll do i said rather rudely for this rebuff was not too courteous and he stared at me as if there could be any doubt about his doing that is the sort of fellow for a businessman instead of any new young managerwas my reflection as i strode with good heart towards the rumpsteak and oysters captain strogue had been sponged and darned and brushed and polished upso far as he was capable of polishby skilful and tender hands and was sitting in a brown armchair as bolt upright as if his ribs had thickened as a barnfloor does by the flail of many heels upon them keep em like that he said for about two hours and fill up well inside and it stands to reason that they must come rightcant help themselves doctors none of them for bat strogue the only doctor i ever knew was any good is down your way now a queer german cove say grace for me and carve for me and fall to my son take me for your guest and you might have a more squeamish one chapter xl twain more than twin in spite of all anxiety it was impossible to be anxious for the moment in the company of this extraordinary fellow doubt is the most hostile and hateful element to all human pleasure and doubt was at once kicked out from the society of captain strogue certainty stood in its place as firm aswell i might say as firm as strogues own nose for i can think of nothing firmer short and thick and straight it was like a buttress to support his bulky forehead and keep his bright and defiant eyes from glaring into one another for they had a little cast towards it certainty also in the strongest point of allthat whoever you might be or wherever you had been never till now had you come into contactor collision if you liked that sort of thingwith a member of your race so far above all little weakness and yet so ready to participate in it if you would pay the bill for him as your new but true friend bartholomew strogue imar is an exceedingly fine chap he said as he lit a long clay pipe after a dinner which impressed me with the truth that the more a man sees the more he feeds you are too young friend cranleigh to have any powers of reflection but you may take it from me that there are only two ways now of being fit to consider yourself a fine chap of course i dont talk of nincompoops who think themselves wonderful always what i mean is in commonsense and there you can only be above the ruck by despising the human race as i do or loving it as imar does i have found nothing in them to admire though i have seen the inner side of many celebrated men and as for loving themwell i suppose the lord puts that into you and bungs up your eyes the man who can do it is the happiest of his race and a great deal too good to be left among them no fool can do it for a fool always goes by facts sur imar is the largestminded man i ever knew i broke in upon strogue with some indignation he looks at the best side as all good people do he likes human nature because he judges by himself contempt is at the bottom of it amiable contempt if you like to call it so the contempt of an equitable mind that knows the faults of its owner and loving them makes allowance for the like in others bless your heart cranleigh i like people well enough but i despise them because i despise myself come now that is fair play i am not argumentative no man of action ever is but that view of the case is a puzzle to you not a bit i answered with a smile of modest triumph you despise mankind because you think they are like you sur imar loves them because he thinks they are like him bravo i like a man who tries an honest rap at me bat strogue never takes offence at truth because he very seldom gets the chance but i did not fetch you here to argue with you i believe that i can be of service to you very good service such as you have rendered me though perhaps you would not have pulled me out if you had known who it was you got hold of yes i would and with all the greater pleasure i thought that you were a decent englishman though i saw you in very bad company that day a decent englishman one of the most celebrated travellers of the age such is fame wait until my book comes out i might have been the lion of the season if i liked what are s and g and l what have they done in comparison with me however let them have it for the moment bad company cranleigh you are quite right there many scurvy tricks have i been played but none to come near what that blackguard has done the fool the besotted fool he must be i was told you were far away in yorkshire and engaged to be married to a lady there nothing of the sort if i had known that i would have come down to see you he thinks he has got everything his own way and he has thrown me over on the strength of it much more than thatmuch worse than that oh what a pretty mistake he has made nobody ever fooled bat strogue yet without paying out for it things are gone far very far my friend but we may be even with them yet i see things now that i never dreamed of but tell me first of your own share in them i told him briefly what had happened to myself how after winning a pledge for life from dariel and the approval of her father i had been suddenly called away to the wedding of my oldest friend and had been kept there for several days by the sudden distress of the family then as soon as i could get away without inhumanity i had hastened home and been utterly astonished to find the valley empty and no message left for me except that cold letter from the man who had been so kind and then i told him also what i knew from signor nicolo and his black suspicions as to hafers object it is impossible for them to be too black strogue replied with an ominous smile sur imars life is not worth the lump of sugar melting under this glass pestle hafers heart is vile enough but a viler heart and a brain ten times as resolute and as deep as his are set upon poor sur imars death i see it all now with the help of what you tell me i took it in quite another light before there is one thing still that i cannot understand i fell out with that miscreant first because i found that he wanted me to lend a hand to get you put out of the way as if i were one of his tribesmen what puzzles me beyond everything is that he never tried it he did try it and a very narrow shave i had it was the very night after i saw you with him then i told strogue the particulars of that cowardly and coldblooded attempt and stepans conclusion about it it is impossible to doubt it the murderous sneak one thing i can tell you young man that marriage of your friend has saved your family the expenses of your funeral two days more in that part of the world would have sent you to your last account he would never have shot at you again such is their superstition that he believes you invulnerable by bullet but he would have put a long dagger into you springing from a corner in the dark at that game you would have no chance with him even if you were on the outlook you are stronger than he is i daresay but he is the most lissome fellow i have ever met and i have handled a good many twisters and skippers in the way of savages and to think that i should be almost trodden into dust like the emmets in a hymn i used to learn by a trumpery lot of common cockneys it was contempt of the enemy that did it a thing that generally ensures defeat none of that now that wont do now cranleigh we shall have to do all we know and the chances are that it will never be enough it is not for hafer so much as that fiend of a woman who stands behind him one of the worst that ever walked this earth and that is no small order i can tell you a bad woman is blacker than a man as many shades as gastar is than stockholm pitch but who is it who is it you have hinted that before what woman in the world would hurt sur imar who looks upon them all as angels in the reaction from his great mistake i will tell you who it is byandby and you will be surprised a little but first a few questions and very important the luck has been terribly adverse most of all in this that i should not have known until it was too late to stop him the scoundrelly schemes of this hafer and his abrupt cutandrun but if i have made a mistake so has he bat strogue is hard to beat young man though he thinks so little of himself but now first of all is there any chance of catching stepan he is a thick of course as all faithful servants are you could not make head or tail of him but i know their scabby lingo do you know what ship he goes by not i the fact is that i was quite upset and felt that being so thrown over i had no right to pry into their arrangements all the heavy goods were going by some cargosteamer blackwall was on the canvaswrappings that is all i know about it then we are too late for that those heavy boats sail on a thursday but the one point in our favour is that sur imar goes first to petersburg he has good friends there but in spite of that if i know anything of russian ways it will take at least three months for him to get a stroke of business done and he will not want to take his daughter to her new surroundings when the furious winter rages there his enemies thought to settle him this side of christmas and have three months to gorge him and hide the spoil while all the passes are blocked with snow but they have overplayed their game and they never dreamed of that stroke of his which may give us time to save him he has no idea of their plot of course but has acted with his usual simplicity one more questioncan we obtain any idea of what goes on there through nickols or any of his jolly miners i am sorry for them what a dance they will have on kazbek with frostbitten toes but they cant get away now thats one comfort how can i tell i know nothing about communication with those deserts that is more in your line and you know the country there are not many countries beyond my knowledge the british pioneer replied with a gaze as if the whole world lay before it but even i cannot always quote all the breaks and jerks of wire and post however i can easily find out they were laying a line to kutais i know but i dont know whether it is working and if it is it wont help us much when all the tracks are impassable one more question young man excuse it but are you still nuts upon that lovely girl who is too good for any but an englishman i dont hold with matrimony mind so you need not mind saying if you have slipped off i wish she were equally nuts upon me i replied with a glance of contempt which should have pricked him but she has vanished without even a good word i shall never hear anything more of her stuff rememberfaint heart etc she has been humbugged with lies about you and i know the pride of all that race you shall have her yet if you show pluck and you wont be like yourself if you fail there but you want to know who the dark enemy is the one who is resolved to have sur imars life as well as everything else that belongs to him very well it is his own twin sister marva what marva the widow of rakhan that rascally prince of the ossets whom imar very justly slew so justly that even he felt no compunction marva who knew of her husbands falseness thats the woman and a nice specimen she is i know one or two fine things about her from what hafer her own son let out ah she is a deep one it is a lucky thing for imar that she sent hafer instead of coming to manage the whole affair herself you forget one thing captain strogue i interrupted for this view of the princess did not tally well with sur imars own account she pitied him there can be no doubt about that after his terrible calamity though as yet she did not know the worst she pitied him and proved it by her distress at the death of his little boy origen and when a woman once lets pity in there is no room for malice in her breast i read that the other day in a very great writer i dont know anything about that i only know that she hates him all the wreck of her life she ascribes to him because he would not pay her portion she has been brought up very differently from him you must remember and when she was so kind about that poor little devil she had not the least idea that her husband that very day had fallen by the hand of imar very likely she loved her husband all the more without knowing it herself for his behaviour to her some women do there is no question about that and there is queer morality in the caucasus she hates imar with all the power of her heart which is anything but a weak one and even if she loved him she would be bound to kill him for the bloodfeud is between them you talk of it as if you were counting coppers whereas it makes my blood run cold cold and then hot as if it boiled with a shudder ah but i have seen the world said strogue very well then tell me this in the name of commonsenseif such a faculty is known among such bruteswhy did not hafer put a bullet or a dagger into imar as he has had fifty chances and more of doing instead of taking a steady but unlucky pop at me explain that captain if you can nothing is easier friend cranleigh in the first place he is not the one to do it without ruin to their scheme for though he might marry dariel after that there would always be something between them and what would make it useless for him to do it is that the blood must be shed as you might say for the sprinkling of the doorstep to kill him in england would not count because nobody would be sure of it hafer might have made a hit but he could not have scored it and the revenues would not have fallen in for years it makes me sick to hear you talk i had no intention of being rude but to see this man making balance of lives as a grocer puts chocolates into the scale was beyond my gifts at present strogue you make me hate you my dear boy you should not do that i admire fine british indignation and i had a lot of it at your age i am not free from it now by any means but it must be governed and guided when we deal with inferior races a frenchman never discovers this and therefore he cannot colonise he lets out his natural ardour at brutality while we accommodate ours and fetch it into better purpose you must not suppose that i sympathise with a savage because i do not shoot him i begged his pardon for i knew nothing of such things and he made allowance for my outburst while i thought that i would rather play the french than the english part in such a casewhich was far from my usual sentiment you need not make a fuss he said all these things are an allegory the wisest of men has been young and green at some time bat strogue is not the boy to sing for starch in bibs and tuckers cranleigh you may look at me and some day you will tell your grandsonah you should have seen bat strogue an englishman of the old sort he was fortysix inches round the chest and not a lie to be found in him give me your hand young man i like you it occurred to meso mean our nature isthat the brandyandwater which he quaffed like milk was beginning to perturb a spirit even so ubiquitous but his gaze was clear and bright as it had not been in the morning and his voice impressive you have only to go home and wait i have a friend who is on his way at this moment to st petersburg i shall telegraph to him tomorrow to keep his eye on sur imar he will have no trouble about that the man being so conspicuous i shall know when imar thinks of leaving and then we must look sharp indeed you want to save him so do i and more than that to blow to pieces the plans of this vile hafer he has treated me infamously i will not bother you with that now he little knows what bat strogue is i might have starved but for jemmy nickols just for the present i am in cash but money never sticks to me if the sinews of war fail i shall not scruple to ask your help though i know that you are not a millionaire george cranleigh but i am a man of honour sir though not a swell i am no sponge and i have some chance of a good windfall which is keeping me in london now never say die is my motto sir and if i get what i ought i will lend you a hundred pounds as soon as look at you strogue is of yorkshire family sir and a yorkshireman always does what he says but that hafer is a cur as mean a cur and as fierce a cur as was ever begotten by cerberus he made a scoundrel rob me of five hundred pounds by false cards as i found out just too late and they split the swag between them a burglar is a trump in comparison with them and he has taken out young petheril instead of me cranleigh do you ask me why then ill tell you in two words because he can get him cheaper sir and because he has got no principle strogue must travel like a gentleman as he is by birth and behaviour and all that strogue maintains his rank sir you try to shove him into any skunky corner to save a few copeks in passagemoney and he lets you knoway you soon find that out and you wont forget it in a hurry but this fellow petheril thats his name he would make any skunks hole skunkier and you wouldnt care to touch him with a pair of tongs and another reason i can tell you too petheril doesnt know the little things about that beauty of a marva which have come to my ears though i never saw her shows what my reputation isbartholomew strogue the world would find me from any postoffice in it though when you send me a hundredpound note it would be as well to be more precise but i am not proud of that it is a nuisance to me i open a hundred letters when i find myself in the humour and there is not a penny in one of them but they all want me to do something fearing that he was becoming inclined to go off on the rove as great travellers must and being in a hurry about stoneman and grace i asked him to say in a few words how prince hafer came under his charge in london simply because of my taking a little turn into the caucasus captain strogue replied as if he had gone off into a sidewalk in some hampstead villa garden i was tired of the monotony on the northern side of the caspian where the people are too much alike with plenty of barbarous customs but when you have seen one you know them all there is not the variety which can be found in the mountain regions only in a very rugged land the human race cannot get so confoundedly chummy as to take the variety out of them like peas in a pod perhaps a thousand miles long the caucasus is quite a small affair compared to the andes or himalaya or halfadozen other mountainchains but it beats them all in this that it was peopled earlier or at any rate more thickly and there the fellows are no two lots at all alike and if it was the cradle of the human race as the ethnologists used to tell us it was lucky that we tumbled out of it mind i dont run them down there are some of the noblest samples so far as the body is concerned that you could find on the face of the earth and many of noble intelligence too but with little chance of increasing it as a rule they hate work both of body and of mind and without proper work we all relapse into monkeys or advance into devils you say strogue then which are you you were longing to ask it but too polite very well cranleigh i am neither i have done as much hard work as any man living and i hope to do more if my life holds out although my joints are getting rickety but my rule iseither work or play and i never mix the two together but i inquired to bring him back to the point for he seemed to be rather fond of talking about himself what was the reason that hafer if he was sent to fetch his uncle back was not despatched to the camp at once the old place in the valley i mean where his countrymen had taken up their abode that would have saved all the london expenses and the need for a guide and interpreter and a lot of other trouble as well as kept him out of mischief true my son but it would have ruined the whole scheme hafers nature would soon have shown itself for his temper is simply horrible kinjals would have flashed in the surrey sun and no dariel would there have been for him even as it was he contrived sometimes to make himself unpleasant to her you remember our catching your little friend allai and putting some strain upon his loyalty that was to learn a few useful facts from him especially one about the lady and her father and some points as to your proceedings if you had not interfered we should very soon have succeeded for there is no great power of endurance in them no no his mother knows too well what hafer is to quarter him on a quiet gentleman and he never would have stood it he came here to have his fling quite as much as to carry out her plotand a jolly wild time he has had of it there is no steady love in a man like that any more than there was in his father rakhan foul scum of the earth low blackguard how dare he come near dariel for the moment i lost my selfcommand how can i wait strogue am i to sit and count the time while imar and his daughter are going to their doom why not set off for petersburg and try to keep them there or at any rate warn them and go back with them if they must go and face that wicked woman and her despicable son that seems to me to be the better plan by far it would cost a lot of money but i would beg borrow steal wont do you must follow my directions in the first place you forget what a cloud you are under probably sur imar and his daughter would refuse to see you if you followed them or if you got over that difficulty would they listen to your story you know nothing about marvas scheme except through me and i have no proofs it is all suspicion or inference from little slips of hafers and so on and what i have heard since he departed mind you i know it as well as if i saw it but there is nothing i could lay before imar to convince him that his sister intends to have him murdered and to make her son the master of karthlos and chief of that branch of the lesghians be in no hurry my good young friend i shall prick you up quite soon enough it is the jerking that spoils everything we were a nobler race five hundred years ago than we are now because we took our time to think and mind kept time with body these fellows also take their time they learn it from the way the snow falls and they know that the snow tells a deeper tale than fifty thousand thunderstorms in the caucasus a tragedyand they have no such thing as comedygoes into ten acts at least and lasts for generations chapter xli a crooked billet once i saw the solid keeper of a wellknown elephant a grand mass of sagacious substance gentle good and amiable try his hand among the monkeys creatures in their way as worthy but of different fibre these too knew what kindness is and had their sense of gratitude but could not stop to dwell upon it and let it ripen in their hearts the keeper accustomed to slow ways and leisurely though deep emotion exerted all his charm of eye and benevolence of whistle and offered baits to cupboardlove and even deigned to winsome ticklings of places not too hairy to be touched by human tenderness he gazed with zoologic pride at the manager of the monkeys who was putting a new lash on his whip then his glory flew into a shriek for his thumb was bitten in twain and a jabber of general joy endorsed it so it is too sure to be with any man who drawing reason from her higher sources applies the product of his skill even in homoeopathic doses to that irrational creaturelove strogue had no idea of the meaning of that word a traveller gets toofar abroad too loose and large and vague and shifty shallow with glancing instead of gazing skimming the world instead of letting it cream therefore to me there was scarcely a crumb of comfort in all his assurances and the only thing to stroke the long anxiety the right way of the grain and smooth its tissue was to keep on steadily with the labours of the day and when these can be carried on out of doors under the sky and if so i may say with the eyes of the lord smiling down on them it is not to the credit of any young man if he kicks about under his blanket and groans when the night makes all things equal unless he has bodily pain i meanwhich is another pair of shoes that can never be unlaced by any effort of our own moreover to see ones dearest friends escaping from some black distress and coming back to their usual cheer and jokes and pleasure in the world around takes or ought to take a lot of lead out of our own handicap although my sister had never been by any means painfully sympathetic with my misfortunes in the way of love i was candid enough to feel that this might be because i had never asked her such an affection as mine was far beyond her understanding a thing too holy to be discussed by any girl with yellow hair in love with a member of the stock exchange but i quite forgave her all shortcomings the moment she fell into real trouble and i wiped her eyes almost as softly as if they had been dariels and this renewed our deep attachment which had lost perhaps some little of its warmth when she took to finding virtues in that marvellous jackson stoneman which she had pronounced a hundred times to be sadly deficient in her brother however they revived and flourished now and i was not so mean as to ask how they came back but was proud of their possession let us take all the credit we can get from people who are fond of us there will scarcely be enough to plug the holes our other brethren pick in us stoneman too having turned the corner by the narrowest of shaves with the paint shorn from his shaft and felly but his box and axle as sound as ever was much improved for the present by the increase of humility or perhaps it would be more correct to say by the birth of that quality within him for if it had existed heretofore it had been so true to itself as to recoil from all recognition except of course in his first lovetime for if a man cannot be humble then lucifer is no match for him it is needless to say that the losses of the firm were spread from mouth to mouth at any figure that occurred to the imagination long before the senior partner himself could lay a loose measure along them but he managed to stick to the hall and the park though he gave up his yacht and the hounds and other enjoyments now too costly and at graces urgent order clave to moneymaking all the week and left the love for sundays there was even some little talk about my throwing up the plough and harrow pitchfork flail and stablebucket and quitting in despair the land that had now become too honest to maintain mankind to wit i was to join our jackson not as a partner for the solid reason that i had no capital but as an agent an assessor or i forget what they called it my father wished it and so did my mother and every one except myself and i was doubting whether the sense of duty to my relatives ought not to outweigh my own tastes and wishes when all my thoughts were upset again and all my mind unsettled by a letter just as follows dear siri must seek pardon for neglect or carelessness about something but it did not enter my thoughts at first that the letter enclosed belongs to you or perhaps to the lady to whom it was written and we have been on the railway or at sea so much and in strange hotels that i could not procure it from my boxes i hope that it is of no importance but i now perceive that i have been guilty of a sad want of attention which may have caused blame to fall on others if so i beg to be pardoned by them for i had no intention of retaining what could never belong to meyour obedient servant dariel daughter of imar the letter enclosed or rather the note was one of several little billets in which i had answered questions from tom errickers sister argyrophylla during that most melancholy time when there was no one else to support her she behaved all through that terrible period in a faultless manner such as even dariel herself would have found it hard to equal argyrophylla was just as mournful just as trustful in the lord and the depth of heartfelt sympathy just as determined to overcome her own feelings for the sake of others as the nicest girl that was ever born and therefore has to deal with death could be any man who could be cold to her with her father just dead and her mother scarcely more than alive enough to moan deserved to be screwed down i say and find no one at his funeral but i never care to defend myself it is clear enough what any one must think of this being told that it was all about some crayfish soup which was more for the lawyers delectation than for mine my most kind and thoughtful pillawhat matter for such trifles now remember that all i care about is to be of service to you it would have been a weary day but for that consideration do exactly as you feel inclined but how happy i should be if you would come down to dinner this i only wrote that i might try to make her eat a bit because she would not even take her gruel for the sake of the many who love you think a little of yourself if a heart so unselfish has the power you must never speak as if i wished to be elsewhere unless your desire is to grieve me you shall hear what the lawyer has done for us byandby but his chief wish is to please us you know quite well what mine isever yours george cranleigh p sthe canon most readily promised to officiate now that such a simple letter written when the cloth was laying and the room grown shadowy yet full of thoughts of dinnertimefor pilla through her tears took care to keep the kitchenjack alivethat a few kind words like these of mine should start up as wilful enemies is a proof of that which men like strogue might take into some dry coil of brain having filled it more with the study of mankind than with converse of their maker to wit that whenever any human being yields to the goodwill towards his fellows which has been implanted in him he is making a fool of himself without doing a bit of good to his brethren let strogue think so if he likes and prove it by a thousand instances he will not get me to believe it or at any rate to act as if i did and here you will find if you go on that it was not so even in my own case at first it looked very bad indeed and i made a grievance of it as any but a perfect man must do and him i have still to meet with how on earth could that hasty note written only for comfort in profound distress and with the warmth one feels for affliction have fallen into the hands of some vile enemy who had used it to destroy my dariels faith in me over and over again i read the words i had scrawled in a hurry and the more i pored over them the more distinctly i saw what they might mean to dariel one most unlucky reference too would quench any doubt she might try to cherish in my brief account of that sad affair at sheffield i mentioned or should have done so that mr errickers old and trusted solicitor was gone from home at the time of the sudden calamity and his place had been supplied by a junior partner a peaceful young man who would never take the lead his only anxiety was to keep within the possibility of mistake and this as the widow was so ill and entreated me to act for her compelled me to be content with legal sanction rather than counsel but dariel knowing nought of that or of the affliction in the house would naturally conclude that the lawyer was come to arrange for my marriage with poor pilla well this is a kettle of fish and a kettle of devilfish i thought but one great joy there ismy darling has not thrown me over through a tossup all my love which had never been away longer than i could live without my heart came back with a rush of double power and a wild condition prevailed with me that cold letter of dismissal bore no date of time or place and afforded not a trace of the writers whereabouts or intentions except that it bore the postmark of dresden and a date now four days old sur imar had told me more than once of his love for art and deep regret that his stormy life had allowed him no acquaintance with it also he had shown me a very ancientdaub i should have called it but for the subjectsupposed to be a portrait of our lord on panel which according to legend had been brought by st peter when he came to preach in the caucasus although he was not sure of that tradition the lesghian chief attached no small importance to this heirloom and was anxious to compare the face or as much of it as could be descried with some of the first presentments or conceptions to be found in europe he was gifted very richly as all great men are with the power of moving slowly not only abstaining from all attempt to rob time of his forelock but also offering that old robber plenty of leisure to tug his own thus the father of dariel might stray through many a gallery museum and cathedral before he reached the russian capital and wherever he was there beyond a doubt would be his beloved daughter with this belief i lost no time in going to see strogue again at least to hear what he had to say though i expected little comfort the place to which he now belonged though it seemed more truly to belong to him was that ancient tavern the london rock so called perhaps in transcendence of the london stone which was not far off an oldfashioned overhanging house with windows like the sterngalleries of a veteran threedecker and a double door with big brass fittings and glass panels glancing the whole withdrawn as with an inner meaning and prim sense of private rights even from the organgrinder who dictates to the alley and the babies who tripudiate with tongues that can keep time whenever dirty feet are weary strogue had seen all the world almost and was come back to the beginning of it smiling at the glee of childhood through the majesty of a placid smoke you never could take that man aback perhaps because that sort of thing had been done to him once too often he sat in a hooded chair of state with a long pipe casting garlands of the true nicotine forgetmenot like a floral crown for his emerit head but his legs were in front of him as they ought to be and the day being still in its youth no car of bacchus had begun to jingle through the calm realms of baccy or at least there was only one cool tankard and the crown of froth was gone from that how is the rib i asked in my usual stupid way for all enquiry was out of place in a paradise so tranquil and then i proceeded still more ineptly by begging him not to be disturbed what rib enquired strogue with as much surprise as he could reconcile with his dignity why the rib that was broken the other day i answered with some sense of trespass on his constitution i remember now and i call it very kind of you to think of it but i understand my own inside and can very soon put it right again how are you getting on with your loveaffair my boy i did not see my way as people always put it now when they dont want to do what you want of themi did not see the fitness of discussing dariel in this draught of echo and with the bar in the background clinking pots and mumbling chaff hold my pipe while i get up the captain said magnanimously for his feet were on a legrest and it was very good of him to move i never take anything so early in the day but i dont judge the juniors come along and bring my pewter when he had led me to an inner room which appeared to be his sanctum i told him what had happened but could not by any means bring myself to show him dariels letter and he did not ask for it with all his bluffness at heart he was a gentleman cut up rough of course he said would not have been worth her salt if she hadnt only two things are added to our knowledge one that they have been at dresden and the other that hafer has been at work with that muskrat of a petheril he sent him to sheffield after you that is plainer than a pikestaff he could not have gone on his own hook for he knows nothing of english ways and very little of the language he found that i would not do his dirty work and so he took up with that blackguard and cleaned me out sir cleaned me out that is where i shall never forgive myself until i cry evens with him would you look for any green lines in bat strogue a tyke who has been round the world he stared at me so fiercely that i could scarce help laughing then he laughed at himself and said all right byandby you go and see if jemmy nickols has heard anything i can tell you one piece of good news i told you what i was in london about it has turned out ever so much better than i thought those confounded lawyers would not let me have a copper but i put the enemys lawyer at them and by jove sir i expect to get five thousand pounds not in a lump mind that would be too good for an unlucky son of a gun like me but a thousand by the end of january and the rest when some business in yorkshire is wound up so i need not come down upon you for a penny and more than that my boy i will pay the piper and you can pay your share when your ship comes in we will have a grand time among the niggers dont thank me or ill never forgive you you have done me a good turn and ill repay it bat strogue is a christian because he backs his friends up but he doesnt hold with forgiving his enemies he will have hafer by the hip and you shall see it stop a moment you know some great swells dont you one or two people of title i know but none of them are in london yet i could write to them of course if that would do as well that never does as well but they will soon come back parliament meets rather early this year and we must not expect to stir a stump till march my friend at petersburg is not a great gun of about my own mark but not of my distinction bless you i can go to court anywhere and plenty of bowing and scraping but a tankard of malt is worth all of it if you could get a line under cover from a friend to our ambassador at petersburg he would pass it on to sur imar when he gets there and you might make it right with your ladylove i suppose that never occurred to you strogue knows the way to go to work what do you think of that my friend i think it is a very good suggestion and very kind of you to think of it if i had not been in such a hurry i daresay it would have occurred to me not likely but nickols might have thought of it and i daresay he knows great guns too all those diamondmongers do you will manage it easily one way or another and the sooner you do it the better it will put a spoke in hafers wheel but not the one i mean to put ask nickols what sort of a winter they are having out that way it might make a great difference to us they very seldom have it as ours is generally the very opposite we are having it mild so the chances are that they have got a stinger all azof was frozen up and a good bit of the black sea the last time i came that way and in london and paris there had not been one days skating however you keep ready this was the very thing i meant to do as soon as ever i could get the chance and pick a little money up for it was not likely that i would let the captain bear the charges with many thanks to him i took an omnibus and had a short conversation with nickols as soon as he had heard my story he approved of strogues suggestion and quite agreed with him that we should both be ready to start as soon as we could do any good at the same time he said that there was not much chance of any mischief for the present and he doubted whether hafer had even returned to his native country yet it was much more likely that after his taste of the sins of high civilization which must have gone far to destroy the zest for dull caucasian villainies he would hanker for another sparkling draught before going home to be frozen up and now he had petheril with him to guide and interpret all sweet baseness petheril where have i heard that name not only from strogue but somewhere else i exclaimed but could not remember for the rest signor nicolo knew little except that his nephew jack was getting the rough side of british enterprise his last note was short without any sweetness unless it were a waft for rosa to whom he was all the more faithful while frozen all been snowed up ever so long he was tersely graphic with his middle finger blue nothing to do and less to eat how i wish i had only stopped away saved our lives with a goat that was frozen to death but had to eat him stiff for the fire was frozen too tried to think of mutton at simpsons in the strand but imagination not warm enough snow is white and emeralds green shall never see anything green again unless it is gangrene in my toes but you know that i never do complain true enough said the signor as he warmed the letter that he might not take a chill from it my nephew never does complain but sometimes he exaggerates and that made my daughter like him i shall not let her know a word of this or she might put some of the blame on me i know that it is sure to be cold out there when you go too far up the hillside however let us poke the fire up you look rather chilly mr cranleigh rosa knitted him two pairs of mittens but perhaps he put them by for keepsakes boys are so confoundedly romantic but the wind has changed since yesterday strogue is the only man i know who understands the weather he would warm poor jack in no time you had better send him out with another pair of mittens i said with some natural indignation but the signor had a pleasant gift of deafness to anything that twined against his twist i shall see strogue from time to time he continued very comfortably there is a great deal of good in that man when you get over his little oddities and i am heartily glad to hear of his coming into property probably he will not drink now so freely because it would be his place to pay for it i know a fine fellow who was saved like that when you would not have given twopence for his life however your course is clear mr cranleigh patiencewhat is it about the mulberry leaf you should certainly write to st petersburg at once your brotherinlaw the earl of fitzragon is sure to know some one who will do the needful for you or if not i think i could manage it you have been very lucky in falling in with strogue a man of great natural powers in his way and very wide observation allow me your coat is a little on the twist you shall hear from me if anything turns up ah we want a little frost to kill the slugs though we dont want to live upon frozen goat chapter xlii farewell smiler in proof of the critical exacting and thankless nature of the noble briton my father used to tell a little story savouring perhaps of the fable three excellent gardeners and botanists representative of our three islandsas a learned frenchman calls themwere searching some torrid mountain slope as travellers for a great london nursery when ready to drop with heat and thirst for they had missed their supply of water they chanced upon a vine in a sheltered spot bearing three fine bunches of ripe grapes like good men and just they tossed for choice paddy coming last as his destiny decrees his bunch was gone in no time skin stones and stalk while john bull proceeded with a calm and steady munch sandy however stood contemplating histhe finest cluster of the threeholding it against the burning sky with its dewy purple glistening like amethysts of ice arrah then why dont ye ate it cried pat if ye cant its meself that knows the bhoy as can hoot toots mon a was joost conseederin the scotchman replied as he held it out of reach what a bonny boonch she wud a been gin i had only had the loock to come along aboot twal weeks bock wi my theening scissors perhaps i was not quite so hard to please as that but instead of being grateful for the many strokes of luck vouchsafed in my present strait i did nothing but grumble at all that went amiss and growl at the heavy roll and everlasting lurch of time however let every man act according to his nature or his own perversion of it but i was not going to be beaten thus it would never do to leave the chance of obtaining some news from st petersburg to a casual traveller like strogues friend i must try to learn a little more about that therefore as i would not go to lord fitzragon it came into my mind that really i owed some amends to lord melladew not for the peppering of his spats for i had not even used a gun that day but for my tolerance of such a stupid business and the absence of wrath in my sorrow for it the earl had employed his lame time in writing a fine poem upon russia which had received a little private circulation and a cultivated russian who had seen the poem pronounced it the finest thing in the english language without going to that extent i knew that his lordship was now a persona grata which means properly a welcome mask at the court of the northern universe when i met him at his club by appointment for he was still in some terror of his mother he showed himself as cordial as any young man who operates mainly with his intellect can be we never have muttonchops here he said glancing along me as if i were a hedgerow with the sidelook that comes from living always in a street but the view from the window is pleasing george and i can show you spots quite historical much obliged but history is no good without age and our own affairs are no good when they get it he saw that i was going to be a plague and he sank into a gimcrack velvet chair which was handicapped too heavily even with such weight as his and he waved his hand for me to do the like but i found a thing like a musicstool having more satisfactory understanding how i have longed to be down your way conversation with him reminded me always of holding a skein of tissue silk for a lady to wind while you bob your thumbs any sign of spring george willow catkins elderleaves no nor yet younger leaves i answered gently lots of frost to come yet i daresay lovely time for fruitgrowerscut their noses off in may i hope not that bugbear must have been exploded if i come down to see the budding year dear george could youi mean could you tell me where to go i want to write a paper for the rhs i began one on the kentish pear and apple bloom last year with a county council lecturer who came down that he might be certain which was which but the wind chopped round suddenly and we got snowed up and naturally all the fruit failed that season but the year before that there would have been a splendid crop except for that gale on the st of september i daresay you remember it when i went to make an estimate of the saving to the country by growing its own fruit with my usual luck i could find no proper specimens the walks were so strewn with green fruit that my feet were too tender to get along among the heaps without two men with brooms in front of me and even so i could scarcely get upstairs that night but how is our good friend bandilow becoming rather nervous i am afraid his family did their best to keep it from him about that other poor grower towards godalming who made that frightful application of his gooseberryknife but poor bandilow had a sharpish tiff with his motherinlaw as he could not see his way to keep her and the cruel woman sent him full account of the inquest with the lunatic doctors evidence and the balancesheet of several years jamboiling underlined in crimson ink he told all the parish at the belltap on friday that the only plantation he should ever make now must be in a box and grow up into a stone i hope not i trust not most heartily said the earl brushing his eyes for he was very tenderhearted but let us turn to more cheerful subjects i feel sadly upset about it let us have a glass of port after that he appeared a little stronger and gladly undertook to forward any letter of mine to a friend of his who was attached to our embassy in russia and he felt no doubt that as soon as sur imar appeared in that capital it would be placed in his hands without losing an hour i wrote my letter and left it in his charge for there could be no harm in being too early whereas it would be fatal to all my hopes if i were even an hour too late my letter was short and not too cordial for really when one came to reflect upon all the circumstances my lesghian friends had scarcely allowed me fair play or so much as a chance to right myself no man can be sure what he would have done in a case which has not hit him in the breast although we are very fond of talking so nevertheless when i put a bit of spirit into my own consideration of myself i could not help thinking that i would have given any one who fell into a sudden cloud of dust with me more opportunity to clear the dirt away and a fairer chance of asking from whose chimney it had come for weeks and weeks i kept on waiting looking out for anything that might throw light on the whereabouts of my wandering friends but obtaining disappointment only the mildness of the winter continued here but a bitter frost prevailed in eastern europe and the danube was frozen over at the iron gates strogue heard from his friend at st petersburg that the ice on the neva was six feet thick and they could scarcely keep the railways open and signor nicolo was compelled to hope all he could about his nephew jack and comfort his daughter rosa with tales of a cat who lived three months in a snowdrift and the horse who got into a hayrick near durham and ate his way out again when the thatch began to drip but he told me in confidence that he never was more pleased to have a bad leg than when jacks mother came to see him for sweethearts being young may shortly take up with another but a widow with one child has locked up all her reason in him however there was this advantage in the long suspense and waiting that it gave me time to make all preparations leisurely and get the money ready for a costly expedition the cash i could have had from several quarters nickols strogue tom erricker and stoneman now beginning to recover from his troubles all in the kindest manner offered to advance me a good round sum but wonders when they once set in are like boys playing leapfrog over each others back they vault and then down they drop with hand on knee for a taller one to top them and surely now came the tallest one that ever rolled in at a tithebarn door or struck the lintel of a giraffehouse hitherto i have felt throughout that every word must be believed exactly as i tell it not on the faith of my character only but from internal evidence this has made me careless perhaps but now i mean to be very strict confining every vocable to its first intention and every numeral to its precise notation for if any other person had related as follows my interjections probably would have made him knock me down the days were beginning to pull out a little and the wind was gone round to the eastas it always does when too late to be of service for skates or wild ducks or golden plovers but in good time to kill all bloom and foliageand having had my bit of bacon in my privy council office as grace now called the harnessroom i was dwelling on my bad luck than which there is no messuage more insanitary for any man to inhabit when in came my brother harold with his hands in his pockets and his usual slouch and soft melodious whistle i had wanted him many times when i could not find him especially to show him to sur imar but now i could see little chance of turning him into any value not fool enough to want a fiver i suppose he said without offering to shake hands for if ever there was a careless fellow about forms here you had him to have one to spare is what you mean to say if a man is a fool who wants a fiver i know a very clever fellow who is a great fool always but he cant get it out of me nulla bona george said my brother in that slurring tone which means that any care of pronunciation would be wasted on the muff before you you can have some if you like but dont let me force it upon you george there are several other fellows after me in that case i answered simply for his benefit not my ownfor i did not expect to see anything worth counting that old tobaccojar is empty out with it and let me put the top on is it from the sneezers and the local board who ever got a penny from a local board if i could invent a machine to do that i should beat the great man in america my sneezers as you call them will be household words when reason has a voice in sanitation but this new discovery is of a million times the value because it is for the destruction of mankind it will kill a thousand men before they can call upon the lord and there will be no pieces left for the devil i had scruples at first because of the wholesale carnage and some of the victims might deserve to live but the kindesthearted man alive and the chairman of five or six humane societies ridicules that objection and has taken shares at the first blush it may seem too strong a measure but when you know that it puts an end to war you are reconciled to a few harsh moments there is a certain sound enjoyed more often by bankers and brewers than by delvers of the earth a silken harmony of thoughtful notes silvery and sensitive suggestive also of golden tones yet mellower seldom alas do we find it thrilling through the music of our spheres once heard it is never forgotten and now i heard it murmuring in my tobaccojar as it flowed from the lyre of my brothers fingers hold hard i shouted what the deuce are you about you villain you have been forging i was sure youd come to that but i doubt whether even freetrade makes it honest nice gratitude he answered when it is all for you one would think that you alone had the gift of making money but it would take you a long time to make that my boy now help yourself dont be shy harold you have worked hard for this as i spoke i regarded my elder brother with respectful sympathy such as he never had inspired until now and i cannot perceive that i have any right to make a hole in your hard earnings do you think that i would do anything so mean but how much do you suppose you have dropped into that jar if you heartily desire to make me a little present perhaps there may be about twofifty there they got up a company you see to work my patent slaughterball that makes everything straightforward the investors throw in to get other peoples money and it is their own lookout about keeping their own but peg away george peg away you are indeed a noble fellow i spoke heartily and generously when the facts come to this between two brothers how can there be either grudge or greed but you would only run through every penny my dear brother the wisest thing probably would be for me to secure for you some fiveandtwenty you had better take larger views but i leave you altogether to your own devices he jerked a chair over and put his heels upon the hob and whistled to the modest fire with his back toward me fifteen twenty twentyfive i said thank you heartily my dear fellow i call it very kind of you he gave me a nod without stopping his whistle and that made me look into the jar again well there does seem to be a jolly lot i have a great mind to go a little further down in all probability you would only waste it harold he gave me two nods this time as if to sayi will not deny it if you take that view fifty would be quite as well while one is about it forty fortyfive fifty ah you may not see me again for months my dear fellow even if i ever come back alive i am going to the most dangerous part of the world where they stick a thing into you they call a kinjal harold we have always been fond of one another although we are so different well fifty then but only as a loan mind i tell you what he said turning round and looking at me with resolute authority i am your elder brother george and know more of the world than you do in fact you are nothing but a farmer and even the government stupid as it is can make game of a farmer now if you dont take a hundred pounds as a gentleman and a brother should you may go to the devil and how shall i ever see you again while you are there so take your choice and have done with it illustration i tell you what he said turning round and looking at me with authority how could i part with him on such terms and it struck me suddenly that if he were going to knock over all the human race or at least the nonbritish branches of it nothing could stand him in better stead than to be able to say that the firstfruits of his discovery had been used to set a true briton upon his legs with a grateful heart i left him at least a hundred and fifty pounds of his money reminding him at the same time of that duty towards our parents which he alone now would have the privilege of fulfilling he promised to leave at least fifty pounds for that and then he went into particulars about his astrapebolia as he called his discovery for visiting mankind with a human touch from heaven this i could not understand and therefore make no pretence to remember it for my brain is not mathematical only i know that he pleased me by a promise that he would always keep behind the guns when he sent them into action he went away suddenly as he came being always of the comet order but as lovable as the eveningstar whenever you could get hold of him and when i had clapped a patent padlock on the first product of his genius a dark terror seized me that my only brother so endeared to small people like me by his largeness might be tempting providence too far and meddle too freely with fulminates just as they began to pay i longed to write to him upon the subject but no post ever knew where to find him then i was suddenly called away from vague apprehensions to perils at armslength and even closer than thatblows eye to eye and cheek by jowl and tooth to tooth such as a peaceful englishman would never face if he could help it but must take as the will of the lord when they come sith it will no better be he is sorry for himself and does his best to make his enemies share his dejection in token i need only say that when i was going on peacefully sore at heart with outraged love but too proud to allow it to be mentioned and girding myself for the work of the spring and that duty to the earth which a farmer must discharge even in despair of recompensea dirty yellow envelope was put into my hand as i came home with two faithful horses as tired with dragging as i was with guiding but all of us ready for the manger i leaned against smilers sweaty chest which looked as if lathered for shaving and read the words which took me away from all smiling operations almost forever sudden news fear to be too late all gone crooked tidal train tomorrow meet me at charing all packed bat strogue short notice indeed for so long a journey and not a word said about passports but i concluded that the old traveller would see to that matter for both of us and having long since prepared my friends and arranged homeaffairs for a sudden departure i was almost glad to exchange suspense for even headlong action my father was kind enough to say that he would do the best he could without me and stoneman would even have come with me if his business could have done without him my mother was just what a mother should be faithful tearful hopeful and my sister grace implored me to forgive sayings and doings on her part which i had long ago forgotten everybody went on as if i had no chance of being seen alive again and yet expressed a world of confidence in the care which heaven would take of me chapter xliii the land of medea in the days of yore whenever any new pestilence or distemper fell from heaven upon the sons of men the first thing to agitate the human mind was a strong and bitter controversy chiron the son of philyra and melampus of amythaon instead of attacking the common foe fell pellmell upon one another maintaining or spurning their various doctrinescontagion infection epidemism conduction by water by earth by winduntil they were driven to run away headlong or lie down forever such questions surpass our understanding but one malady there is contagious infectious endemic also as well as epidemic grandly contemptuous of pill and bolus sticky as a limpet while as slimy as a slug and the name of this blessed disease isthe blues and the beauty of it is that everybody who has got it believes that he alone of all the people in the neighbourhood is free from every atom of a symptom of it as his luck or perhaps mine would have it strogue was in the blues when he came to charing cross he received me with a grunt and would say nothing except to be down upon the cabman and the porters and shove his way along as if there were no english language this is a very useful way to go to work whenever you can be quite certain that you are the biggest fellow in the place with no one to try to think otherwise but unless there is money right and left behind it at a big railway station it does not succeed you are not among the niggers yet i said being always polite to everybody and indignant at not being allowed to speak while his voice rang along the glazing but he deigned me no answer not even a glance but shouted out third class where the devil are you driving to have you never seen the chairman of this line the porters were too wideawake to do anything but grin and touch their caps ironically and then he said first class whereupon they all believed him not a word however would he say to me though we had all the carriage to ourselves at starting so i took him at his humour and went to the other window and drowned all my anxieties in the money market possibly his heart was heavy about the landlady of the london rock or the barmaid thereof or the daughter of the boots if a maiden there were in that capacity or perhaps a traveller even so wellseasoned could not bid adieu to his native land once more without emotions honourable to his head and heart alike then the contagion of his low spirits began to spread around me like the influenza vapour and if he had tried to talk i should not have cared to answer such tacit respect and mutual affability of silence do more to endear two heavywitted britons to one another than a folio of flippant words strogue was kindly pleased with me and i thought well of strogue when our lofty regard for the seasick passengers as we had a rolling time of it opened as with one accord the valves of communication give us a light old chap said the captain as he clapped me on the back come out of the sulks and talk a bit after all the temper he had shown this was rather ludicrous but i let him put his own interpretation on it for he was in this predicament for my sake quite as much as to please himself but strange as it may seem we both avoided all important subjects until the question of route compelled us to consider them then i told him that money need not stop us only mine must be put into proper form in paris and then we discussed the whole question it seems that he had ordered this sudden start by reason of something that came to his knowledge only on the previous afternoon in st pauls churchyard he encountered quite by chance according to his view of it a man well known through his travels in central asia and most interesting account of them strogue took him back to the london rock and there entertained him hospitably for a traveller has generally acquired the power of feeding upon any wayside bench by and by the two great wanderers came to a subject pretty sure to be handled by them but never with unanimity strogue thought highly of the classic charms of the fair ionian ladies but sir robert b called them a brown and skinny lot and declared that there was not a girl of any hellenic race fit to walk beside a maiden he had seen at athens not more than a month ago and who was said to be of old caucasian lineage knowing that the ladies of the caucasus are not much addicted to travel the captain began to enquire into this and although he had never met dariel and had seen sur imar at a distance only his friends account left him in no doubt whatever that the pair he had been so vainly seeking by letters to half the capital towns of europe were in athens at the end of february not only did the description tally with all he heard from me and nickols and that scoundrel of a hafer but also sir robert while making enquiries about the beautiful stranger had been told by some facetious greek that she was worthily named indeed the daughter of himeros of love of passion of delight and yearning and again he had learned at the hotel where they were staying that their journey to st petersburg had been prevented or at any rate deferred through the extreme severity of the winter surpassing any season within memory this i could well understand for i knew sur imars dread of bad weather not on his own account but lovely dariels father and daughter were still at the ancient centre of civilization when sir robert left it and their intentions were unknown to him but he was inclined to think from certain purchases which he saw them making that they were more likely to be on their way home than to proceed to russia now and if so there could be little doubt that they would make their way first to constantinople therefore it seemed to be our proper course though beset with much doubt and perplexity to betake ourselves at the utmost speed to the turkish capital and try to intercept them there or if too late for that to follow them for everything now would depend upon time in a few more weeks the golden sun would have captured the mountain parapets and begin to swing open with summer light the bars of the steepest citadels and then if sur imar were a day before us what chance of overtaking him and his foes were not likely to hold much parley when once they found him in their hands out upon it who could imagine such a crime overlooked by the power that rules the world a loyal confidence possessed me for a while that heaven would protect its noblest produce the few who ever think of looking up to it from the venom of its abject spawn it will never do to take it in that light said strogue though he always attributed his own escapes which had been manifold as well as narrow to celestial perception of his merits no you must never trust to that cocks fighting sometimes it will and sometimes it wont and where are you then without your revolver and one thing you overlook altogether setting aside all holy motiveswhich those fellows take revenge to bewhen a savage wants your property does he dwell upon your character then they ought to be all exterminated what are the lives of a thousand savages in comparison with that of one great good man who lives only for their benefit if you kill them what good can he do them strogue asked being always more captious than logical imar is in front of his age and the age makes martyrs of fellows of that kind and leaves the future to make saints of them if their ghosts turn up within memory our business is to act and not to argue now look to your luggage my boy and the most important part of it is firearms so we took our course along the chord of europe by abominably slow lines whenever there were any and at last without any line at all it gave an englishman the tingles to see everybody crawling as if time were a tortoise with the gout and the hours the produce of a coprite beetle which he slowly travels backward to bury the slowest man on our farm after eating two days dinner was a swallow with a nest to feed compared to any one i saw throughout the east of europe there was a little more vigour at constantinople and plenty of fellows with fine pegs to stir if they could only see the use of it but as for any briskness and punctuality and eagerness to get a job and do it the loafer who stands by the horsetrough on the green in any surrey village would have his hands out of his pockets and stand on his head before their eyes were open and yet we are told every day of our lives that it serves the british farmer right to starve because he has no activity we had spent two days without any possibility of avoiding it in paris and but for strogue it would have taken me twice as long to make the needful arrangements and now we lost four days in the city of the sultan making search for our friends in all probable quarters and procuring what was indispensable without obtaining any further clue we set forth on the th of april by a poor little steamer very badly found for a place called poti at the mouth of the rion one of the four chief rivers of the caucasus formerly known as the phasis whence the bird whose lustre shames the glories of the golden fleece strogue had shown in very early days the quick force of his genius by running away from school and defying pursuit and beginning earnest life in a wherry you are picking up the lingoes very smart he said as we churned the muddy waters but i cant stand affectation george and i wont have the old ark called the argo besides she never came here in her life she drew a deal too much water she went to pieces on ararat i tell you and satan took her upper deck and put it on top of elbruz why why that people might go against the bible as they are only too glad to get an excuse to do and he put about a story that she grounded upon elbruz which she could not have done from the shape of it no no holy writ is what i stick to and as long as i do that the lord will always stick to me i wont hear another word about it however though he would not have the argo even mentioned he made no objection to the golden fleece in fact he confirmed it having seen some gold in the upper waters of the rion and as for medea when i told him all her story her treachery incantations murder of her brother and even her own babes he became quite excited and vowed that she must have come to life again as the princess marva upon that i begged him to tell me all he knew about that extraordinary lady for i had never understood from her brothers description that her nature was particularly fierce and unforgiving though she certainly behaved in a cold and distant manner when she informed him that his wife was gone but that might arise from nothing more than the sense of the wrong she herself had received through her faithless husband rakhan and would a ruthless woman feel such emotion at the casualty to another persons child not knowing cant say the captain answered in his favourite short style but you must remember that i have not heard that story as he told it and another thing he was not there to see it for he was far away settling that other fellows hashand his own too by being in such a blessed hurry but i have got a very shrewd suspicion my boy you will laugh at it i dare say and there certainly are some things that pretty nearly knock it on the head what do you say to this suppose it was her own child that was killed and that she contrived to change them fearing that she would never have another and so would lose her position altogether for among those ossets as i have been told the childless wife of the chief must eat humblepie at every corner and is apt to be superseded after six or seven years and she might have other motives too for getting imars heir into her possession the idea is ingenious but most improbable i replied after thinking for a moment not that she could not have done it for there was no one to observe her except her own nurse whom she could easily silence but her own conduct now proves that it cannot have been so shows that she had not gone for that game i mean they may be a lawless lot everybody says so but even your medea would never send a man to marry his own sister i hope not it is too horrible to think of though it might be part of her hideous scheme for revenge i tell you cranleigh it is but a very stale thing to say that a woman of the lowest depth of womans wickedness is as far beneath any mans deepest pitch as a good woman is above his highest stretch i dont go by what they tell you in the books i have seen a big lot of men and womencivilized as they call themselves and savage the latter on the whole more trustworthy and you know that i never dogmatise only a fool does that and though i am an ass very often especially when i yield to my feelings about right and wrong you cant call me altogether a foolnow can you captain strogue i answered warmly perceiving that he asked for it fools are always numerous enough but if you are one i wish that they were universal and in saying this i was no hypocrite there is not such a thing as a wise man now he proceeded after one quick glance which showed that he liked my testimony we dont want them they would never suit the age and so the lord abstains from sending them the two or three last who pretended to come spent all their energy in scolding which shows that they were not the proper stuff but about this medeais that all you have got to say to show that she is not trying on this little game no i have a much stronger argument than that no one could imagine for a moment that sur imar the most benevolent man on earth could be the father of a hateful spiteful lowminded scoundrel such as hafer is you have put it fairly no one would imagine it and therefore it is the very thing that may be true i am not a scholar but such things have been and will be again while the world endures from bodily likeness you may reason more than from the greater things you cannot see i have never seen imar close at hand but they are both tall strong men straight wellbuilt and active imar is fair you say and hafer dark that proves nothing it is a vile idea and i will not listen to it i replied with some inward sense of outrage on our race i have never seen hafer for a close examination and am not sure that i could swear to him if he stood before me now but from the glimpses i have had of him i know thishe is as different from the grand sur imar as a blackberry bush is from a muscat vine yet the one may be grafted on the other i believe the difficulty is not concerning that george cranleigh the difficulty is about the womans motives prove that it would suit her purposes to bring such a horrible affair about and the horror of it is no obstacle to the fact what makes me doubt my own suggestion is that i cannot see how the scheme would work for the benefit of madame marva all other objections on the score of human nature or what human nature ought to be are as nothing to the will of such a woman remember that she has a double objectto make herself the queen of both the tribes and to avenge her husbands death wicked and ruthless and inhuman as the sister of that lofty and nobleminded man might be i could not bring myself to believe her capable of any such horrible design but the misery agony and anxiety for the pure and innocent dariel and her father already so cruelly tried by the dark decree of heaven also my deep and abiding fury at bloodthirsty treachery and the terror of being too late for the rescue all together these drove me to the verge of madness when the rotten old hulk they called a steamer yawed to this side and to that and quivered and rattled and groaned and the decrepit engines panted and the craven crew fell upon their knees and wept and it was announced in three languages that we had done miracles of daring and must tempt the lord no longer but thank him for saving us from our own valour the rion was in such high flood that we must cast anchor and wait for three days outside the bar till the rush of snowwater subsided chapter xliv the land of prometheus there are thousands of people englishmen especially and germans universally who would find terrible fault with meif they ever heard of itfor the absence of calmness and selfcommand which i ought to have helped but couldnt taking myself as it ought to be and always is in theory i must have gone out of it without asking leave or even knowing that it took leave of me others who have been in the like condition and perhaps they may be counted by the million will freely allow for all i did and all i saidwhich was a great deal worse even strogue though acquainted with many languages and tolerant of all their excesses admitted at last that there must be a power in our own beyond all foreign scope you never use a wicked word he said to me or at any rate none that could be scored against you by any angel that understands our tongue and yet you contrive to put things in such a way that i would rather not stand by you in a thunderstorm that of course was rubbish for i spoke most mildly and if ever i used a strong expression the sound of my own voice hurt me i was trying throughout the long trial to be of the large mind which i admired so much whenever to be found for certain in any human beings within my knowledge and these being unsatisfactorily scarce i went back to the many i had read of in my early days at winchester and did my utmost to believe in them and shape myself accordingly but this was of very little help to me epaminondas timoleon even the grand aristides and the roman who sacrificed his own son were nothing but shadows on a cloud while i was the shivering form inside it strogue himself was limp and grim and could not see how to get out and it was not in his mouth to talk of angels unless it was to give them more to do he might say what he liked but he tried my temper a great deal more than i trespassed upon his moreover he had made a very serious mistake and one which would probably prove fatal if we had only gone straight to odessa instead of losing time at constantinople we might have been at kutais a week ago supposing we had caught the proper steamer this he could not for a moment deny and all he could say was that as i knew so much more about it than he did although i had scarcely heard of this part of the world before the best thing would be for me to command the expedition and conduct it entirely in the english language but i pointed out to him that my remarks must not be distorted in that manner and that all of them were intended as compliments though he had not for the moment perceived it upon this he came out of his anger and said that every allowance must be made for me and that if he were fool enough to be in love he should have carried on worse than i did at the same time he announced when at length and at last we had got our podoroshnoor something like that which cost a lot of money at potithat from what he was told about the condition of the passes his plan of the route must be abandoned and we must go first to tiflis though far to the south of our proper course there we should get into the great russian road which cuts the main link of the mountainchain and find a course open in almost any weather and vehicles of some sort to be had for hire moreover it was not at all unlikely that our lesghian travellers might be there waiting for the spring to tempt them home for people in haste and having baggage any railway however vile and utterly profane both in itself and all its consequences is better than the best carriageroad or horsetrack likely to be found in the same direction or anywhere near it so we took to the new line the wonder of the age to all oriental intellects and made as nature requires by englishmen and instead of leaving it as strogue had first intended at kutais or further on we followed its rugged course throughout to the city of languages as the world calls tiflis until the weather becomes too hot this is the usual residence of the commanderinchief of the caucasus and strogue suggested that we should call upon him so as to start well with the authorities in case of any violence being done or suffered by us among fierce tribesmen who might not look at things as we did for what could two men even though of english birth avail among so many strogue himself spoke russian very fairly and even i could make out a little by this time after taking much trouble and undergoing a crick in the hinges of both jaws for in certain conditions of the human mind nothing seems too arduous his highness prince l received us most politely and at the captains request allowed us the privilege of a separate audience for if it should once get wind among the tribes of the upper terek that we were coming to meddle with their affairs they were likely to show us nothing more than loopholes studded with riflemuzzles the prince who was a very fine and handsome man listened attentively to strogues account and then after telling us that he feared sur imar was already in the net and beyond our reach he took a course which puzzled us altogether and made us look rather foolish gentlemen he said with a pleasant smile observe that i do not question the accuracy of your account in fact i believe every syllable of it and it confirms my own opinions but unless you have brought me attested depositions or are prepared to make them from your own knowledge and recent presence on the spot i have no power to do anything have you any such evidence to lay before me strogue shook his head and i was compelled to do the same we did not intend to apply to your highness i said in the best form i could muster that was only thought of afterwards lest we should do anything against the law it is fortunate for you that you have applied he answered not unkindly you are doing nothing against our law by entering the country with our passports but you are defying tribal laws and outraging all their customs by interfering with the private affairs of their ruling family have you at all considered what the result of that is captain stronger you have travelled on those mountains did you find encouragement to treat the people thus your highness the conclusion i arrived at wasthe further i keep away from all of them the better it was wise it shows your great abilities the same conclusion is mine and i regret that we have been obliged to embody them but if we had not done so it is certain that you would but for years we must deal very carefully with them all we endeavour is to keep some sort of order and encourage them to try to live without much thieving work they will not even for the four months which is all the time many of them could work if they tried gentlemen your sympathies are wasted in such quarters your highness i should like to shoot them all and probably in your position we should have done it strogue had not travelled for nothing and he held up his thumb for me not to contradict him you are the great civilizing power as england begins at last to acknowledge we did not come here with the audacity to think that your highness would help us in a private matter which does not concern your authority but we know that this lesghian chief although he was compelled to side with shamyl in his boyhood and has paid the just penalty by long exile is now the warmest friend of your great empire the object for which he has returned is this to bring the barbarians into peaceful ways and make them good russian subjects able and at the same time glad to pay good taxes this gentleman with me of the highest english family is an intimate friend of sur imar and he will confirm every word i have said speak up sir george and tell his highness what you know how many times more am i to be sir george i muttered to myself in english and then as the princes eyes fell upon me i said very bravely it is so your highness for everything was true except perhaps about the taxes and will the commanderinchief allow cried strogue getting stronger in his eloquence a faithful and fervent russian subject to be murdered by barbarous ossets the most cantankerous and antirussian tribe remaining in the caucasus the captain made a true hit here the gorgeous decorations rose on the ample bosom of the prince and his strong eyes flashed as if in battle but a russian of high rank keeps his head and he answered rather formally as i said before i cannot interfere but in case of any savage tumult i will give you a letter to the officer on duty in the kazbek district which you will not present unless needful and now gentlemen i wish you well you must bear in mind that you go with your lives in your hands and we are not responsible there is a little band of your countrymen on the northern side of kazbek who hold our permission to quest for minerals two of them were frozen to death last winter through their own imprudence but that has not prevented more from coming in the manner of your country you may find them of service to you in the matter of supplies farewell we took our leave with many thanks not daring to put any further questions although we concluded that he knew more than he saw fit to tell us an officer brought us the promised letter and looked at us very curiously as if we were even more insane than the english race in general i wanted strogue to question him but he said that it would be a breach of etiquette and might set the commander against us so we made our bows and went back to our inn which was one of the queerest places ever seen and this reminds me that i may have been expected to say something about the many noble and wonderful sights of our long and tedious journey but the plain truth is that they passed me by without leaving any clear impression or even creating the interest which at any other time must have swallowed me i looked upon the grandest scenery of the world without even thinking of its grandeur caring for nothing but to leave it behind as another obstacle gone by scarcely would i even lift my eyes to the majesty of giant tau or peak that towered in dazzling white like the hand of god spread on the heavens or the sombre awe of mountain forest deep with impenetrable gloom yet in after times all these came gliding along the slides of memory and now and then they stand and hold me when i want to think of something else but what we had to think of now was to get along the roadless roads from tiflis into the black abysses and white steeps of the mountain range many of the passes still were blocked although the strong sun scorched our skin and the road was swamp or flood whenever it was not crag or boulder strogue being accustomed to such doings took them with grim philosophy and i cared little what they were except for the delay they caused the prince most kindly sent a couple of cossacks for our escort and we had four men with their hired ponies as well as an interpreter for strogue might often be at fault even with the lesghian tongue and we might visit places where that and russian were of small avail so bad was the season and the ways so roundabout and rugged that not until the d of may did we enter the deep defile which leads to the foot of the crag of karthlos we threaded the narrow pass and looked up at the fearful heights from which those playful children fell when frisking on their little legs among the treacherous snowdrift and then we saw the rocky elbow of the dark ravine where imars father dadian fell to the stealthy shot of rakhan the lonely gorge where a man felt half afraid to provoke an echo seemed to be formed by nature for the darkest deeds her sons can do while the pale slant of declining sunshine webbed with quivering vapour here and there came partway down the walls of rent and jagged rock but nowhere reached the bottom there was not a sound to make us think of life in this unfathomable grave even the cossacks shuddered mutely under the gloomy chill of awe thank god cried strogue when one of our horses less romantic than the rest or lulled by power of contrast into a dream of clover set up a lively neigh which rang like a peal of bells along the chasm my son thou shalt taste oats for that this old hole never used to frighten me the london rock must have spoiled my nerves for rocks that have got no chimneys here we are george let me see if i can blow i used to know how or you try if you like you are more of a huntsman we had stopped at a place where a steep narrow channel cut the north wall of the gorge at right angles and a battered old horn of great size hung from a staple at the rocky corner i made a sign to him to blow and blow he did to such effect that the tattered grass hanging here and there on either side of the chasm shook as a matted cobweb shakes when a stagbeetle tumbles into it in the midst of the solemn desolation and my own profound anxiety i could not help laughing at the captains face as his great cheeks puffed with the rush from the lungs and his fat chin went into ploughlines and his grizzled eyebrows into gables over his wet projecting eyes laugh at me he said then do it better but i could not do it half as well and we all looked vainly up the steep ascent whose winding hid the house from usno one came neither any answer nor sign that we had moved the air suddenly it occurred to me how poor sur imar had stood where we were standing and blown that very same horn in vain with the flush of bright hope and the glow of home on the day that broke his life in twain some men are content to accept the tricks of others and of fortune not from their own want of power but because of their contempt of it strogue who was not by any means of this too lofty order glared and stamped and shook his fist at all the void magnificence from which he could get no response up we go he said at last if the mountain wont come down to usbut keep your revolver ready one of the cossacks came with us according to his orders the other stayed with the horses and their owners in the trackway the ascent was easy enough for any one not encumbered with four legs though the rope that skirted the worst places was cut away or worn out by time and then we mounted some big steps with a slush of snow upon them and struck a heavy ring of brass upon a great gate of some dark wood the mansion or tower or whatever it should be called rose large and lofty before us gazing with a dull and ancient aspect down a wilderness of craggy clefts for about a third part of the year the scene must be all majesty and for the rest all melancholy even with life inside it but now it appeared as if it did not care for any outlook winter or summer good or bad could not matter much to it nobody at home they dont keep bailiffs in this part of the world said strogue or i should think some of those lovely fellows were having their steak in the kitchen down george down behind the parapet or youll never wear a hat again like an accomplished traveller the captain ducked his head out of shot but i was too slow and stupid and had caught the despondency of the place fire away i said if you can strike a light i dont believe that you can hit me want of faith is infectious and the silver mop behind the rail on which was resting a long brown barrel arose very slowly and behold it was the uncovered head of a very ancient man long white hair flowed down his shoulders and over his breast and i heard a hollow sigh blow me if it isnt old kobaduk cried strogue who was taking a cautious peep dont be in a funk george he knows me hold hard old fellow and keep your powder dry the old gentleman seemed to be in doubt about his eyes till the captain went down a flight of steps and round towards the kitchenentrance where the ancient watchman stood then a few words of lesghian passed and kobaduk leaned his gun against the rail and flung his wrinkled arms round the thick form of strogue is he coming will he never come again that much i could make out among his many trembling words is old kobaduk to die without seeing him without ever hearing his voice again then he tottered to the corner of the steps and spread his hand over his brows where the sunset struck through the glare of snow and he leaned on the ramrod which he had picked up and gazed with his wrinkled eyes casting forth a bushy sparkle down the lonely passage from the road below take it easy old chap shouted strogue and he answered i am too old to take it easy thereupon his long beard fell lower on his breast and his lips which were far out of sight behind it mumbled some sadness which we could not understand and he shuffled his feet to be sure that they were there and made off for the kitchendoor without another sign to us hospitable i call that said strogue the poor old beggar doesnt know what he is about but we must put up here willy nilly for the night we will make him rout up a bit of grub and stir the dregs of his ancient brain chapter xlv among the gems the cossacks had discharged their duty now after seeing us into friendly hands and in the morning they rode off to rejoin the detachment at tiflis we sent a letter of thanks by them to the russian prince for although we had not been molested we owed our exemption in all probability to the presence of the uniform we had passed through a district especially delightful even among their many happy huntinggrounds to the heart of the only men among these mountains unless it be the foreign gunsmiths and a few of the timberdealers who have a profession and practise it with any decent diligencei mean the gallant brigands but they must not be quoted as a real exception to the rule of sovereign indolence because they are not true caucasians otherwise they could never get through half of the robberies they accomplish the rest of us spent a whole day and two nights at the poor deserted tower partly to refresh our horses which were sent to the posthouse down below and partly to consider our plans after receiving from the ancient steward the feeble light he could contribute although he had recognised strogue so suddenly and with such affection he forgot him entirely and with equal speed until we began to talk in english and then he broke forth with the declaration that our language was sweeter to his ears than the murmur of a hive of bees breathing their last among their honey or the first music of the waterfall that has broken the chains of winter when strogue translated this to me i felt some gratifying surprise for our language is not so wonderfully mellifluous or melodious though our voices are not such a cackle as theirs but the old gentleman soon revoked his claim upon my gratitude by explaining as interpreted by strogue that the words indeed were strange and hideous like the sound of a saw on a flinty rock nevertheless he loved them always because they brought to his mind the years that had unrolled day after day as bright as the rising of the sun and as smooth as a lake at the foot of the mountains where no wind comes blowing i could not quite see what his wits were driving at but strogue who had very little reverence for anything from seeing too much of all things sang out signor nicolo and kobaduk took it to his heart which works much longer than the brain does and came up to us and touched both of us with a shrivelled finger upon either chest it is the name of the happy time the time of the beautiful lady and the noble lord and the lovely babes and nothing to do but to laugh and eat and sleep i suggested in his own language and that completed his round of perfection for he sent up the roots of his beard in a grin and said thou hast hit the mark and then he sat down upon a swab to do it very fine old codger but beyond his time strogue gave him a tender poke with a stick to make sure that he was not shamming we used to have faithful stuff like this in england but education has vanquished it he is sure to have a wife about twenty years old let us go in and stir her up the wives are nothing but headservants here they are not sentimental but they can cook which is the highest duty of the female my feelings were shocked but i left them so because victuals alone could relieve them the faithful retainer had overdone himself by that sudden outburst of decrepit hope but he had got a young wife which i thought too bad until she proved the contrary by making us very comfortable with a number of hot little barleycakes and some grilled kid flesh which put a shine upon our faces then she poked her ancient husband up and he came and fed and played the host and made runaway knocks at the timeworn gates of his memory the worst of it was that we could not be sure how much truth and how much fiction or at any rate confusion issued from that antique repository the older the thing was the more it might be trusteda truth which holds good with the bulk of modern work whenever we brought him to recent affairs and the state of things now existing he shook the silver tissue over his bright black eyes and stared at us kobaduk forgets too long ago was his chief perception of yesterday however we fetched him nearer date by speaking of the princess marva then the old man trembled and turned his head away and his fingers which looked like empty beanpods fiddled at the cartridge loops which hung like the smocking of a surrey parishclerk on the quivering of his sunken breast for the sake of god who made us all he mumbled and although he had been feeding well his wife offered him some brown bits in vain let him be said strogue perhaps hell have more pluck tomorrow but it did not seem to be so at all he went up a ladder to bed that night in a loft that reeked of onions and he dragged his old gun after him but how he got his crooked knees up the rungs and how he failed to shoot himself in the stomach were difficulties not to be explained even by the miraculous powers of habit the old cock will come down like a lark tomorrow strogue prophesied as the trapdoor banged but larks are more famous for going up and the captains prediction was about as correct as his reference to natural history what a set of funks these people are is there no one here to tell us anything we exclaimed almost with one accord on the evening of the following day the only one we spent at karthlos we had asked at the posthouse where sur imar used to keep his horses and we had tried mrs kobaduk the fourth and a grandson of the steward who hung about the house and a woodcutter who came home sometimes and a fellow called the huntsman and everybody else we could come across most of them sat down and stared at us and feigned not to understand what we meant and then when we put the interpreter at them all they would do was to shake their heads and stretch their lazy hands westward as for old kobaduk if he was like a lark it was one who has a skewer through him and all we could get him to do was to show us where the princess oria and her baby lay alas what an end for the loving and lovely the passion of a warm life cold in dust and the sad shadows creeping along the sadder grave but i knew a heart in which she lived still and a life as lovely as her ownwere these to share her fate or have a doom yet worse and not even be restored to her in the silent home of death ill tell you what we will do my boy strogue said to me after supper that night and after we had puffed and spat and stamped at the noxious vapour of the native weed which we should have to come to in the end unless our own end spared us that the frightful stuff grown badly and cured worse which they dare to call tobacco this is a very grand place in its way and the tradition of good victuals lingers still about but the fragrance of the past is not enough for a man getting on in his forties hardships i have endured by the hundred and could do it again like elijah though he only went forty days which is nothing to my record but you must understand my son that the fun of it is not so evident when a man has got into napkin ways and wants to lean back in his chair and think of the things he has done instead of doing them dont be in a wax george i am not thinking of cutting the expedition bat strogue is made of too good stuff for that and he means to have his little revenge as well only he must keep his headquarters somewhere within hail of the jackspit that sound has become of importance to him and his nature is not ungrateful the world is not made of love alone or precious little there would be of it listen to the words of wisdom men who work hard must live well miners work hard therefore they must live well i never learned logic but that sounds square very well i am not going to controvert your logic but how does it bear upon the present state of things thus thou woodenheaded saxon nicolos fellows are at work again that much i found out yesterday and you know the prince as good as told us so kazbek is their diggings a pretty large district but not so extensive as elbruz it will be easy enough to find them out then we hear a civilized tongue again and get something civilized to put upon it here we can learn nothing there we may get news in the morning let us start for kazbek i was only too glad to have it so for although not belonging to those upanddown natures which are either at the zenith or the nadir i found myself many pegs below the proper mark among all this great breadth and vast height with nothing to touch or lay hold of anywhere if strogue was lost in sentimentality of stomach which had been regarded with an excess of feminine tenderness at the london rock i could feel for him heartilythough nobody might think it through the affection of an organ of my own which is not so far distant as the poets do imagine so i said you are right we will start again tomorrow this we did and our spirits began to rise as we left that grand but illfated place behind from a rise of the mountaintrack we saw it magnificent in its dark command and vastly improved by the distance and then we struck into the great dariel road the causeway of the caucasus this we followed as far as the russian fort where we presented ourselves and our letter from the commanderinchief and were entertained most hospitably the colonel was as kind as man could be and showed no reserve or reluctance in answering most of our questions my experience is too small to be of any value but strogue who had seen a great deal of russian policy and management in the vast tracts added to their empire always maintained that the common talk about their grinding tyranny is jealous exaggeration though they can be very stern and hard when they meet with savage treachery even as we ourselves have been and now this officer a very capable active and intelligent man told us plainly that his orders were to hold himself entirely aloof from all the private feuds and quarrels among the mountain races unless they revolted or refused to pay their very moderate taxes or were guilty of open violence or outrage upon travellers he had heard of sur imar as still the legitimate chief of an important tribe for many years an exile now but regarded kindly by the government and still in receipt of the larger part of his revenues through a russian agent who had been appointed upon his kinsmans death but of his return or present whereabouts he knew no more than we did then we asked him about the princess marva and he smiled mysteriously we dont talk of her so freely he said as strogue still pressed him she is a lady of very strong will and has given us some trouble but we hope that she is improving now and her son is a pattern of excellence if he would only take the command which according to his rights he should have done long ago but he is mild and submissive though endowed with great abilities many of the village headmen are indignant that she does not retire for he is beloved while she is not but we never interfere in such matters we let them settle their own successions only in case of absence such as that of imar but hafer himself has been long away i interrupted him in some surprise and with faulty words which made strogue smile but the russian was more courteous he has been for months in england of that i was not aware the officer answered after some reflection but the winter has been the worst ever known and almost all the passes blocked except those we kept open but gentlemen as i said before we do not interfere in private matters you are going on you told me to that place upon the mountain where certain englishmen with our permission are in search of minerals they may know more about such matters for i believe that the lady has demanded payment from them and does not recognise our licence though kazbek is not within her boundaries or certainly not that part of it if you will take my advice which i offer simply as a private friend and one who admires englishmen you will trespass as little as possible upon the domain of madame marva i hope for the privilege of entertaining you upon your return from the mountain this was plainly our dismissal and his horse was waiting at the door for him so as the sun was still high in the heavens and the weather very favourable we resolved to try to reach the mine that night or rather i should say the diggings for it had not attained the dignity of a mine and was not very likely to do so we took a young goatherd for a guide and leaving our horses at a hut set forth in search of the emeraldhunters although we had no very great height to ascend for the diggings were far below the summit and there was a fair track nearly all the way and a rope laid along the worst places it was close upon sunset before we reached the magnificent gully where the miners had their camp they were just leaving work for the day and marching almost like a squad of soldiers to the cells they had scooped for their dwellingplaces under the shelter of an overhanging crag each of them carried a rifle on his shoulder as well as a strong iron rod with a crook at the end and a tool something like a spud and a hammer with a long peak of steel the captain or master or foreman came last in the file with nothing in his hands but a deep tarpot and he proved to be mr jack nickols a sturdy young man with a round red face active resolute and profoundly contented with his own endowments halloa havent you got a word to throw at a brother englishman strogue was sadly short of breath but still capable of indignation as these twelve or fourteen men regarded him with some suspicion and not a token of hospitable emotion kindling in their bosoms we are not come to steal your dirty stones or to set up shop against you we are of the highest english birth cousins to two dukes six marquises and a good round dozen of earls and what will touch you up more my boys if you are driven against nature to be radicals we have got three pounds of fine tobacco left and if you are good you shall have half of it this was an outburst of altruism as the people who ought to be in bedlam call it which found no echo in my breast because we were beginning to smoke our ashes but set up an irresponsible rubadub in theirs with one accord they all turned round though bound for their suppers as their mouths would have frankly declared if sure of having more than they could do with still they proved their higher value and their sense of the fine artssuch as we cultivate now with pictureframes on sundayby stopping and pulling out empty pipes and dropping their thumbs from the barrel to the bowl plenty of time said captain strogue who was up to all those little things fine fellows all of you but you dont get a whiff till i know more about you the laws of great britain hold good all over the globe because they are righteous you may shout in vain for bacco as the heathen gods did in their time i am not a man of many words we have had to smoke a lot of poison ourselves and not a blessed son of a gun among you tastes a shred of the genuine weed till i have got all i want out of you i thought that they would have turned crusty but such misgivings showed that i did not understand my countrymen an englishman can put up with everything but humbug bar that and he begins to think of you i want a young fellow called jack nickols the nephew of my old friend jemmy nickols strogue went on with louder shouts as he saw that the men were taking to him you are a rough lot and you know it but i have been round the world seven times and take you as you are i would rather have you than any other fellows i have ever come across you are no wonders mind you but you know whats what and more than that you do it this was rather vague though it sounded so precise and i whispered to the captain you are as good as john bright but he shoved me with his elbow while his eloquence went down then the young man with the tarpot came up mildly in the presence of a larger spirit and said captain you must be the celebrated traveller and strogue looked at him augustly and said young man you are right after this it is impossible for me to tell the glorious night they made of it they had spent all the time when they could not work in making themselves more comfortable and all the starvation they had been through was avenged upon itself by its own power i have seen a good deal of eating and strogue had both seen and done a great deal more and the voice of travellers is unanimous that the caucasian native acknowledges no superior in that line it is not for me to contradict them but the impression i formed that night and with my own mouth confirmed it was that the british settler can in that as in less important matters adapt himself to his environment the sheep of the mountain are but small and we furthered natures ordinances by making six or perhaps i should say seven of them smaller still for the valleys were spread with the verdure of spring and it covered their saddles with sweet white fat one little slice more jack nickols said this is the best of the batch i know what would we have given for a cut out of him last winter but we were obliged to leave this place altogether forty feet deep the snow was here and not a bit of firing to be got for love or money you heard that two of us were frozen to death but we never lost a man we set that story going and it did us a lot of good and choked off another lot who wanted to come here we have got it all to ourselves at present and mean to keep it you saw my tarpot capital plan an invention of my own we have scarcely gone underground at all as yet we scratch the crannies and the dribbleplaces and i stand by and watch every fellow wonderfully honest and all that no doubt but just as well to look after them every bit of green they find i drop it in the tar they cant get it out again even if they could find it without telling tales on their fingers nine out of ten are not worth keeping but we have got a few real beauties there is one stone i wouldnt take a hundred pounds for and a lot worth more than fifty ill show you some of them by daylight its the flaws the flaws that murder them we dont know anything about stones replied strogue and i would rather look through a good green bottle than all the emeralds that ever came from peru or wherever they get them what we want to talk about is quite another pair of shoes and i know you will help us if you can we gave you that letter from your uncle he will be out here this summer if he can but we cannot wait for that we must set to work at once when the rest are gone i will tell you all about it we will go outside if you dont mind i can show you a very cosy place where we do our cooking and the ashes warm the rock all night let us have our pipes there and leave the tagrag here we followed him gladly to the open air and sat upon some bearskins in a snug alcove of rock with the stars shining on us and the embers of the fire doing better service still and here we told young jack nickols all our story a great part of which he must have known already you will never go home alive he said if you are going to meddle with that woman let her have her own way she always does what right have you to conclude that she wants to murder her own twinbrother it is likely enough mind from what you say and in fact i have little doubt about it but for all that you dont actually know it and if you did you are not the russian government let her alone for gods sake we told him that this was the very thing we had sworn to ourselves we would never do and that he must stand by us like an englishman and like his uncles nephew stand a long way off more likely he replied though i dont call myself a coward and i hate that woman but i will try to contrive something and let you know tomorrow chapter xlvi queen marva discovering nothing of any kind concerning sur imar and his daughter after they had quitted athens we made up our minds that the proper course was to pay a visit to the princess marva and try to get some inkling of her plans it was not very likely that a couple of clumsy fellows like strogue and my humble self would prove a match or even a serious check for a subtle and ruthless woman commanding a reckless tribe and probably well informed of all the plans of her unsuspicious victims so that if we appeared in our own characters or even let her know that we were here our days in this land or indeed in any other visible except to the eyes of faith were likely to be brief indeed but for the sake of those who mean well and desire fair play on the whole whenever it leaves a chance for them providence has been gracious enough to lay down one universal rulethat every wicked person has some special weakness some nick in his black shell for the oysterknife of justice so that a simple and straight mind like strogues and mine may find its way through and turn the whole to righteous uses i have hit the mark jack nickols said when he came home to breakfast with his tarpot when the sun comes up these rattling peaks instead of down over them is the time to think i could not see things clear last night though you know how little i take captain compared with anybody else about but when the sun came up from under to me my brains which are bright now and then began to work i thought of you snoozing in the ashes and i resolved to do my best for you go on my son said the captain kindly with the tolerance of a gentleman who is offered lagerfroth instead of solid bass there is no doubt that you have fine ideas a man who turns out so early picks up something then what do you say to this cried jack you might roll over fifty times till nine oclock as old gentlemen do in england and yet never find it occur to you that clipper of the mountainscleopatra was the word in his mind perhapsis a terrible oner for money they say and we have had a tip or two to that effect till we paid her toll though it is robbery downright a bullet used to come from some black corner and my very best hand had a sample through his hat one must expect that sort of thing of course in an outofway part of the world like this but luckily they have never been at wimbledon i came very near the queens prize once but i told you all about that last night these beggars wont give me a chance never mind it will come some day but they havent tried to pot us since we paid toll now why shouldnt you go upon the same tack go to her majesty as an opposition company and offer a premium over our heads upon my word you are a clever fellow said strogue looking at him thoughtfully i fancied so when i saw the tarpot but jack my dear boy is there any foundation anything for us to go upon yes there is and we can make much more of it i can promise you an interview with the tigress if you will offer to put stripes of gold on her you know what those confounded germans are no sooner do they hear of any english enterprise than they want to go one better and collar it they come in and hoist us out and get the cream of all our sweat there was a tremendous man of science herr baddechopps or baddechumps or some such name poking about here with spectacles last autumn i have got his card and you shall have it we put a rope round him and two men at either end and swept him down the hill faster than he came up and we promised him the loop round his neck if he came back for i cant stand their jealousy of everything we discover you go and tell marva that we have got the place too cheap that it all belongs to her and you will pay three times the royalty take a notary with you but sign nothing george i am up for trying it if you are said strogue what is the name of her placegomorrah doesnt sound very inviting does it but the lady wont hurt us if we leave our cash behind we can get there in three days you said last night let us beard the tigress in her den i have never been quite in that part before there is no such thing as a road of course all the better for that sometimes nickols advised us to take no horses lest we should be murdered for their sake but to hire a guide and a tent and halfadozen of his men whom he would try to spare as well as our own interpreter and a tartar or two who were always hanging about the russian fort thus we should be ten or twelve in number all wellarmed and capable of giving a good account of some thirty ossets if they took our expedition roughly for they are not good shots and their guns are very poor we spent that evening in consultation receiving many hints from our young friend who would have been glad to join us if the state of his work had allowed it but his mate as he called him was away and so he could not well leave the diggings moreover there would have been some danger that he might be recognised which would prove fatal to our case at once yet he promised to help us with all his force in any great emergency if we could only give him notice in good time and this was of no less value to us than a troop of cossacks meanwhile he would send to make inquiry at vladikaukaz the chief town on the north which travellers from russia would be almost sure to pass whether our friends had been heard of there and so with many thanks we left him for the present and spent a day at kazbek village preparing for our visit to the princess marva against so fierce an enemy and with so good an object our stratagem for obtaining an audience was fair enough but to use the german professors card seemed to me far beyond the most elastic stretch of honesty so i threw it into the fire to save argument for strogue took a different view of the case you may take the lead and you may call yourself a german i told him resolutely i am a silent partner and it does not matter who i am the lady speaks better french perhaps than you do and certainly much better than i do you do all the talking and i nod my head cator is drawing up the rough agreement which we submit for her consideration the beauty of it is that if in her greed she even gives a nibble at the bait we can dangle it ever so long before her and are sure to find out something of what we want to know cator must put it as vaguely as he can and leave the royalty blank for us to fight about cator was one of jack nickols men a sharp and welleducated youth who had been in a lawyers office but found a lack of bracing qualities in the air and left his stool in search of them and now we gave him a double fee to prepare a document and enact the lawyers clerk at our interview for men of law were almost as rare as men of medicine in these parts a formidable deed it was with halfadozen seals to it and we wrapped it round a straight black horn from some sheep or goat of the mountains the roads were bad being overmetalled by the melting of the snow for the roads are the rivercourses and when nature lays too much water on it is not easy to get along them even the right way of the grain and our course now was against the grain towards the head springs or mother glaciers of the river terek which would have conducted us when in a proper mood but now knocked us back again with a gruff and grey adversity neither was there anything for the eyes to spread their rims at and make light of all the discontent of legs and back all was dry rock except where it was wet with dribble or dirty with reek of thaw and there was scarcely a tree to wipe the air or show what way the wind came nevertheless we strove along following our guide who cared much more about putting his own feet right than ours for these men are not like the alpine guides whose loyalty is more to them than money at length on the third afternoon we stood before a strange place which i cannot describe nor even give a rough idea of it unless i may compare it with a great pile of big dominoes set at any angle some on end and some on edge on the top of a black pillow boltupright and this was the fortress of the osset queen we sounded a trumpet but received no answer and then we made a rubadub on a goatskin drum which was hanging on a stump for visitors and when we left off we heard a screech of metal going rustily and heavily upon its hinges then a muzzle as big as a small church bell came out and we thought it was all up with us but strogue like a brave man waved a white handkerchief on the screw of his ramrod and we pushed the interpreter foremost though it required three men to do it what he said was beyond me altogether though crowded with illustrious but anxious words and if words were ever known to afford relief it is fair to acknowledge that they did so then the great muzzle which commanded all our bodies so that to fly was hopeless sank upon its pivotor whatever it might beand a ladder which had been out of sight behind a buttress came sliding down the base to meet us one man first was the order from the loophole and every one of us quite admitted his friends claim to precedence can die but once cried strogue here goes upon which i felt my cheeks burn and said let me but he answered no you shall come next my son the captain went up heavily with the scroll upon his back and the fourchambered bulldog in his left breastpocket and we saw two men receive him on a narrow parapet and he waved his hand to us to indicate all right then he vanished round a corner and we waited for some minutes having found a little shelter where it would take some time to shoot us we assured one another very strongly that if anything happened to captain strogue we would not be satisfied with avenging him but would have the whole place down and a british fleet in a position to rake all the caucasus when to our great relief he appeared again at the head of the ladder and shouted three more fellows may come up now this time i was the foremost to run up not that i was really afraid before only that i waited to know what the others thought as a man of modesty and deliberation does when the circumstances are unusual cator followed readily and so did another of jack nickols men but the interpreter said that we should find him more useful at the bottom of the ladder she is a stunner and she has got a stunning place strogue whispered to me as he led us through a dark passage into a long low room she beats the begum all to fits what begum he meant i could not tell having heard him speak of several whose hearts he had broken in his early days but if he meant some regallooking woman he was not beyond the mark in his comparison for i had never beheld one so stately and grand as the lady who now received us with a slight inclination reflected by the polish of the black walnut table before her she was sitting in a chair of purple velvet with a leopards skin thrown over it and her dress was of soft maroon brocade with white fur trimmings at the neck and wrist and a gold chain flowing upon her full broad bosom there was not a wrinkle or a spot to mar the shapely column of her neck or the firm sleek comeliness of her face and her eyes if there had only been some sweetness in them would have been as lovely as they were splendid her complexion was darker than sur imars and the lineaments more delicate so that her face excelled his in perfection of form as the feminine face should do but as to expression the gentler element was by no means in its duty there for the aspect was of one who scorns mistrusts and repels all fellowcreatures and sees the evil in them only these then are the members of your company herr steinhartshe addressed herself to strogue after one flashing glance at each of us as we entered and her french pronunciation was a little too good for me to follow all of it though she did not infuse much nasal twang and it is your opinion that i am deluded by those who are working my mines at present my mines indeed how grand i thought what would the russians have to say to that i never speak ill of the poor replied strogue and we must make every allowance for the british audacity your highness all cannot afford to pay as we can for the reason that they have not our enormous capital at command we always find it the wisest course to treat the landowners liberally we make no pretence to be better more honest or more generous than those englishmen your serene highness although so young has had sufficient experience of the world to know that all men are by nature rogues my faith but it is true how seldom though have the men the good manners to acknowledge that rather do they not put the fault upon the more simple and righteous sex your serene highness strogue answered gravely seeing that this title was not ungrateful the ladies perceive at once that they are grossly wronged but they are too magnanimous too regardless of gain to remonstrate you for example how much do you care you have ample revenues from your sovereignty and things that occur on the back of a mountain are of small account to you nevertheless the right is right and it ought to be defended and the right shall be defended when it is my right said the lady i am not accustomed as you well observed to the smaller business herr steinhart but those who defraud me suffer for it make your offer if you please more intelligible this was the very thing we did not want to do having no offer of any kind to make but strogue had gone far enough and wide enough to know that a question is answered best by another question is it possible that your serene highness will oblige us with the amount which those arrogant englishmen have been in the habit of contributing to your lofty revenues we are a wealthy company but we cast away no money it is just she replied and my desire is for justice this is what they pay me now but they would have to double it for the coming year the trumpery sum of two hundred roubles with you i will not treat for less than a thousand and for one year only at that price your highness is very just and moderate said strogue while i turned away to hide my indignation and sadness that a woman so magnificent should stoop to such a lie for i knew that jack nickols had paid her only twenty roubles to last for two years as she had no title there whatever but your highness will pardon me for mentioning that we have heard a rumour perhaps an absurd one that a brother of yours a great lesghian chief who was banished by the russians is now returning to his country and may claim his rights over that desolate spot and finally establish them in that case our lease from your serene highness might not be so valuable as we were led to hope a deep colour flushed or i might say flashed into the clear dusk of her cheeks and a brilliance into the darkness of her eyes then she placed the long oval of her smooth plump hands which reminded me of dariels but were half again as large on the black walnut wood before her and gazed at the captain till he scarce knew where he was then she turned her eyes on me with contempt subduing anger illustration gazed at the captain till he scarce knew where he was if you think to defraud me by such pretencesas she spoke she rose and her head towered over the dumbfoundered strogues and cators alsoit would have been better for you if you had remained at the foot of my hospitable ladder as to the chances of sur imars interference you shall have the evidence of prince hafer his signature also you shall have i will produce him to you with swift yet dignified steps she left the long gloomy room and we stared at one another better cut and run if they have left the ladder there strogue whispered for several men now occupied the doorway it is all up if hafer sees us i made sure from what they told us that he was miles away whats the good of four of us they can shoot us all the easier if we run i said let us have it out here if it must be this thundering walnut table makes a grand breastwork after all they may not want to fight us we can settle at least halfadozen of them cators eyes shone with legal pugnacity four englishmen can lick a score of ossets not if they are like that man said the fourth of us tommy williams pointing to the door which was not a door as the old joke has it neither could it be a jar but looked more like a bedcurtain the lintel was appointed for men of good stature and i had passed beneath it without much bend but the young man who made his entry now was above any moderate stature of mankind as he promised in breadth to outdo them in a flash of thought sur imar stood before me as i first beheld him has that woman killed him and is this his spectre i asked myself as i fell back and stared dark as the room was another moment showed me the excited wandering of my wits this was not sur imars face but one of similar comeliness without his resolution behind it a gentle pleasant large and kindly countenance as his was but with very sad placidity and no strong will to enforce its lines the face of a man who can be trusted to do you no wrong and never to stop any other man from doing it like that of the friends we value most when our little world goes smoothly he came to the table behind which we had posted ourselves for a desperate stand and there he bowed very gracefully to us and then looked round for his admirable mother as if he were quite at a loss without her strogue in his polite way asked in english who the devil are you sir the young giant looked at him and shook his head like a stranger to our fine language no fear he wont fight the captain cried to comfort us and we all took our hands from the triggers in our pockets his golden curls were waving stillfor he had the finest crop that i ever did seeand he was looking at us calmly and as we thought with a sweet and hospitable intent when back came the lady almost with a rush and tokens of fury on her too expressive face she had not meant her son to come in without her and we smiled among ourselves as we thought how he would catch it by and by at any rate if not in our presence however she controlled herself and introduced him grandly gentlemen this is my son prince hafer who will add his signature to mine to remove all your hesitation if the terms you propose should be suitable also he will confirm my declaration that my brother sur imar will raise no claim to the valuable mines you propose to rent from me the prince is capable of speaking french though not perhaps with my facility your concession which i have perused is in french but the amount of your payment is not yet stated it will be useless to say less than one thousand roubles five hundred of which must be paid in advance herr steinhart i am not a lover of money but i must insist upon my sons rights do you consent to the sum i mention strogue looked at me and then at cator intending no business but only a sham for the purpose of seeing the lady and hearing something about her brother he was taken aback at this close issue especially the demand for a large payment on the nail moreover his mind was in sad confusion and so was mine i must confess about the existence of two prince hafers while we durst not even hint at any explanation but cator was quicker and more ready with a quiddity your highness he said as the legal adviser of this wealthy company i may say that we shall not object to the rent you reserve nor to the prepayment which to us is a trifle below consideration only i should take a note of guarantee from your highness and also from prince hafer against interference on your brothers part that will have to be embodied in this instrument which moreover has not as yet the necessary stamp you have already given us your full assurance if the prince in my presence will add his according to your proposition i will put them into legal form bravo cator cried that stupid strogue in english did you speak sir asked the princess your serene highness i am afflicted with a cough the captain replied with his hand before his mouth my son said the lady looking steadily at hafer oblige me by sitting down in that chair it is one of my afflictions gentlemen that he is not always in strong health but he is the delight of all our tribe so amiable so just so generous now she continued with her back towards us so that we could not see the expression of her eyes assure these gentlemen my dear son of your certain knowledge that prince imar will never set foot upon kazbek again i have no knowledge i have never seen him his doings are unknown to me i cannot affirm at all where he is as the prince spoke in french rather worse than my own he began to tremble violently and his eyes turned away from his mothers face we saw her place one hand below her solid breast and then she said coaxingly as we thought the poor dear what an affliction it is but my son you can give us your firm belief that he will never tread the mountain of kazbek any more he will never tread that mountain any more the young man replied in a low sad voice and then he broke into a torrent of tears excuse me gentlemen it is most grievous from a child he has suffered from these heartattacks oh the unfortunate mother that i am as she spoke she was leading him out of the room and we drew aside respectfully before we had time to discuss this scene her ladyship returned with some tears in her eyes which made her look strangely beautiful i thank you for your most kind sympathy she said and will not detain you any longer if you will put all into proper form for even in trouble such things must be seen to and return with the roubles and the deed if it may be this dayweek i will grant all your desires till then farewell with silent salaams we took our leave and were shown forth not from the rockfront of the castle but through a narrow passage or gallery cut in the crag and provided with iron doors and the ossets who conducted us could not be tempted to open lips or to make a sign chapter xlvii wolfs meat thus far cator the attorneys clerk had proved himself the most sagacious and quickwitted of our party though captain strogue would have been amazed and indignant to hear me say so and now when we had rejoined the rest of our little expedition and all were recruiting the inner man or the middle man perhaps he is body being first stomach second and mindwhen found third portion that sprig of the law came up with a bone between his teeth and begged the captain and myself who were feeding from the outside tops of our hats to go a little further round the elbow of a crag there he asked us what opinions we had formed and when we had taken our seats we said none at all except that we are all bamboozled no doubt about that but how and why he answered with a mysterious look which we were inclined to smile at not having known him long enough to be sure of his prophetic gifts a lot of things have occurred to me which may be very absurd of course and it is not likely that all are right but i am pretty sure that some are shall i tell you and hear what you think of them we lit our pipes and nodded to him and smiled at one another to begin with then i suspect most strongly that her majesty the devils wife for so she deserves at least to be has got her brother under lock and key somewhere snug enough and at her mercy if she owns such a quality did you see what she touched when she went to gag and at the same time to cram that poor young fellow whose will she has crushed out of him by years and years of bullying perhaps you could not see where you stood and she did not think that i could but i saw the tips of her long fingers playing with a key which was in her belta mere household key of coursebut enough to remind her unlucky son where his poor uncle was without much chance of ever coming forth but in his coffin and i caught a glance of his which proved that he understood her meaning and might soon have the same thing for himself and then you saw how he broke down for he is a very tenderhearted youth by jove it sounds uncommonly like it i was so taken aback said strogue at seeing another prince hafer in the field and so different from my simon pure that i could not notice small things much and perhaps it was the same with cranleigh there is some abominable villany at work and we shall be too late to stop it i would like to insure friend imars life for ten thousand at five thousand premium go on my son thou speakest well another thing according to my lights he is not in that queer old place at all gomorrah castle or whatever they call it although there are plenty of black holes there enough to starve a regiment man by man no he is away to the north at present perhaps on the other side of the mountains you saw the big window that faced the north more like a door than a window it was well every time her brother was in question and especially when she was fingering that key she gave a quick glance through that window very likely without even knowing it people who gesticulate much often follow it up in that way when they speak of a distant thing they glance in that direction if they can see it or anything anywhere near it and there was a great doublepeaked mountain covered with snow like a white mitre stuck against the sky in the north and if her brother had been in the castle dungeons she would have made us go down the front ladder again instead of getting a wink of back premises upon my word this boy is wideawake considering how little he has seen yet of the world cator like cato thou reasonest well go ahead my son we hearken thee you see captain said the young man feeling abashed in the presence of such renown and doubtful about some chaff in its palm you see i should never care to offer you advice it might be in place with mr cranleigh here because he is only a young beginner but you know whats what i should say ever so much better than i do but as you tell me to go on i will her serene highness intends to make away with her twinbrother on monday next come now come now i can stand a great deal cator and none of your butterscotchno you are a shropshire man you say whatever you are it wont make that go down why old moore and zadkiel would be nothing to you captain i will tell you what i go by and then youll be able to judge for yourself whether i talk bunkum or good sense i have been in these parts for a twelvemonth now and i ought to know something of these blessed natives there are no two lots of them quite alike any more than two mountains or two valleys are but there is not a pin to choose among them in the matter of laziness poor beggars they can scarcely help that i dare say frozen as they are for half the year and roasted for the other half well about here the manner is to keep three holidays friday saturday and sunday just as if they did anything on the other four days these ossets about here have no religion of any sort worth speaking of some call themselves christians some mahometans many are simple idolaters but all are full of superstition as such people must be all they do in the religious way is to stick to their fasts and festivals particularly the festivals and their great festival of the year finishes up next sunday what the deuce has that got to do with it strogue enquired impatiently for the sun was beginning to slope along the valley and we had ten miles to go to the next covered place everything if you will hear me out that festival goes on for three weeks and during that time it is not lawful to follow up even the bloodfeud but on monday it will be the proper thing to stick and stab all who are waiting for it and what makes me think that this little game is on according to institution is that we have not seen a living soul except an old woman and a child or two in the miserable villages we have come by why for the very simple reason that every noble savage who can swing a dagger is off for this great act of faith on monday to see the death of the head of the clan avenged i wont believe a word of it i exclaimed meaning no rudeness of course to cator but scouting the possibility of such fiendish abominations after all i had heard of the great mans lofty hopes and pure ideals to me it seems likely enough said strogue i have been among fellows who would eat their mothers and serve up their own babies for a garnish we have none of that sort to deal with here and the men of these mountains taking them all round are an indolent rather than a cruel lot quarrelsome of course and hot of blood but most loyal to their chiefs and very generous sometimes it is the bloodfeud that makes devils of them but how can they help that it is their test of honour ever since they came out of the ark with the raven what we have got to do is to act exactly as if all our friend cator suggests were the fact thursday today there is little time to lose even if we can catch it up at all we shall want every son of an emerald of you and you must fight like sons of the emerald isle by jove what a ripping turnup it will be right about face quick march for kazbek it was all very well for him and cator and the rest to take things lightly thus they could not be expected to feel much concern for the lesghian chief or a lesghian lady even more adorable and as for strogue his main object was less to rescue sur imar than to wreak his own vengeance upon haferthat is to say the london hafer the one who had leaped the ivied wall and shot at me and robbed the captain by some blacklegs process of l but i with my warm affection and deep pity for the father and passionate love of the daughter could see no adventurous joy or fierce delight in the issue impending i wanted no revenge no compensation for anything done against me hafer the genuine and hafer the counterfeit might settle their claims to the title as they pleased even that most malignant and awful womanif she were as black as she was paintedthe princess marva might live her life out and give the best account of it when her time came if only she could be kept from harming her relatives so innocent there must be in her motives something more than we could see revenge alone for the loss of a husband with whom she had lived on the worst of terms and who had wronged her on the tenderest pointthat and the timeworn grievance about the refusal of her marriageportion were not enough to drive her to such a horrible and unnatural deed asunless we wronged her most shamefullyshe was now in cold blood designing there must be some other strong motive too some great temptation of selfinterest some of that stern sour stuff which drives us out of the hive that should be sweet to us no man knows what he does or thinks unless he can keep himself separate from the thoughts of all around him which requires a wonderful nature when his legs go along with the legs of other men and he has to swing his arms accordingly there was no sort of march among us for we had never been even of the volunteer force except myself and that only made me critical without any help in it and if we had wanted to show the caucasus any sense of drill we could never have done it even if we had known how by order of the rocky way or of rocks without any way among them we could never march two abreast or even three in file with decency all we could do was to get along and admire one anothers clumsiness then we came to a place with a sudden gap in front and nothing but the sky beyond it a cleft in the crown of a rugged ascent with spires of black rocks right and left and there on the saddleridge that we must pass a gaunt and wondrous figure arose whether of man or of beast and wavered against the grey mist of the distance and swayed two long arms like a gallows out of gear or a cross that has rotted with its weight struck up and having been severely tried already we were much at a loss what to make of it there was good light still and we were not to be frightened as we must have been after sunset but the interpreter being always nervous turned round and exclaimed she has sent the devil the devil himself to stop us while he spoke the long figure fell down on its knees and swung its lank arms like a windmill hold hard dont fire strogue shouted sternly as some of our men had brought their guns to bear idiots it is nothing but a poor lost man a fellow without a bit of food inside him george let us go and see what he is up to i was ready to go anywhere and do anything in my present state of mind and when we came up to him our poor brother mortal fell upon his face and put his hands upon our feet he muttered some words which we could not understand and then he opened his mouth which was very large and pointed down it intelligibly to the slowest comprehension he may be the devil but he wants some grub strogue shouted back to our company who were still looking towards us doubtfully for people become superstitious without intending it in these wild places then cator came up with a barleycake in one hand and his rifle in the other the unfortunate starver took no heed of the weapon in his extremity but stretched his shrivelled arm across the muzzle and tore the cake from cator in a moment it was gone almost without a munch and then he stared at us with sunscorched eyes projecting from their peel like a boiled potatoand groaned for more crooking his fingers like prongs of a rake we shrank from him so that he might not touch us but for the blood he was covered with we should have taken him for a skeleton and but for his groans and nakedness we should have passed him as a scarecrow dont be in such a hurry old chap or youll do yourself more harm than good strogue suggested reasonably but even if the other had understood it would have made no difference he spread his face out in such a manner that there was nothing left but mouth as a young cuckoo in a sparrows nest when his stepmother cannot satisfy him squattles his empty body down and distends himself into one enormous gape then tommy williams came up laughing with his hat full of broken victuals and the captain who understood the subject said not too fast or hell fall to pieces and pour down a little whiskey to soften it when the poor fellow came round a littleand flat enough he had been beforeto our surprise he proved himself an exceedingly brave and wellintentioned man in fact if he had been otherwise we should never have found him there a barbarian he appeared at first but that was appearance only and under the stress of misfortune although he belonged to a race which is the most barbarous of the caucasus when through our nervous interpreter we began to understand him we soon perceived that it was our good luck as well as his own which had brought him to us and much as at first we grudged the time expended in this humanity we soon came to see that it had been well spent even for our own purposes after such a fast and then such feasting prolonged in even more than due redress it would have been most unfair to expect many words from him prematurely we clothed him a little for he was stark nakedand so hairy a person i never beheldand then we cut the tight cord knotted round his waist from which even famine had not freed him and then we made a litterfor he could not walkand carried him to our nightquarters luckily there was no foe in search of us or that miserable sufferers groans and snores must have told our whereabout to every echo he surprised us again by an eager call for supper but none would we give him until he had splashed for a quarter of an hour in the glacier stream then we fed him again and clothed him fairly and a decent and reputable man he looked though going down the vale of years and his tale was interpreted as follows chapter xlviii usi the svan i am usi of ushkul in the country of the svans usi the bearslayer was my name as long as i lived among them the custom of the country is that as often as a female child is born any youth of the village who looks forward to his need of marriage may come to the cradle and hang his own bullet around the neck of the infant and from that time she is pledged to him and he must marry her when she is old enough when i was a stripling the wife of our priest produced him their fourteenth child a daughter and i was the first to go in at his door and bespeak the young creature for myself but as fortune ordained the damsel proved deaf and dumb though in other ways quite useful and i very justly refused in the presence of all the village to marry her and this i did when she was ten years old allowing her plenty of time for others who might esteem it to their pleasure and advantage to possess a wife without a tongue but the very next day when i was watching the maize a bullet came through my hat and lodged in a tree behind me and when i dug it out behold it was my own with the fancy pattern on it with which i had betrothed myself ten years before to that i need not have paid much attention but that the priest had nine wellgrown sons and it would be the duty of all these nine in succession to lie in wait for me and endeavour to shoot me through the head the eldest had been too near the mark for me to believe without rashness that the other eight would fire in vain so i took my good mothers advice which she gave me with many tears and left my native place for lifetime neither was it safe for me to dwell in any of the villages for miles and miles around because we people of the svans had suffered from want of food for the last two years and had been obliged to take all the loaves and corn and cattle of our neighbours within three days journey and so we were out of favour with them on this account i was compelled having borne a strong hand in those forages to keep myself away from spots where i would have settled gladly at a distance i saw beautiful maidens over the tops of the raspberries but whenever i desired to draw near them there was sure to be a father or a brother whose cow or whose sheep had been beef or mutton to me and those people bear such things in mind not being generous as we are and thus i went along the valleys feeding on the fruit wherever the bears had left a tail of it then going further towards the rising sun which is the strength of all of us i came upon a man who carried a kinjal on a gunmouth in those days i could jump as high as i could put my hands up and being surprised by his pointing at me i did it to give him time to think this made him think more of me than i deserved and instead of shooting me he asked in what land men could jump so i could not understand at first though he did it with all his fingers because we had kept ourselves apart from other people whenever we could live without our neighbours goods but i was always considered the foremost of the young men for understanding and i contrived to make out what he meant and to do a thing which is much harderto make him know what i meant he was a soldier of the great imaum desiring to shoot russians and as soon as we made out one another he showed me the notches on his gun and i counted fortytwo and he said every one was the good corpse of a russian this made me long to do the like though the russians had never shot at me but my own friends had and my soul arose to look along a gun at any stranger even as it had been done to me others came up and when they found how straight my barrel was and what it was famous for doing among the bears the captain said thou shalt do it my lad with the bears that eat our people and so i was put into shamyls army and for many years enjoyed myself i have shot three russian colonels and small officers by the dozen and i could have shot the commander once but his daughter was by his side and i stopped my finger when it was on the crook with my mind upon my mother twelve years i fought under shamyl and did so much good that as often as a great man came on the russian side it was my place to put a stop to him if you come across any of our old men now and say to them what about usi the bear you will see their eyes sparkle and hear them say not one among us could compare with him for sending a cossack to the devil threequarters of a verst away alas that i shall no more do it the times are not as they used to be then there came a man who was the noblest of all the sons of men to look at that ever the red sun shone upon imar the son of dadian master of the western lesghians stronger than an auroch bull and gentler than a suckling woman his father dadian had been mighty and a lord of men but imar was as the saint christ that stands in gold among the images of clay though i was not of his tribe i craved to be put into his troop and whatever he did usi was never far away until the war came to an end and all who were not shot or starved went home to their own mountains but i dared not go to ushkul yet and had forgotten how to live without a rifle in my hands then imar the son of dadian took me and beholding in me an honest man and the surest with a long gun of all whom he had proved in battle he appointed me a little place on the northern slope of kazbek to keep the wild beasts from the crops and the wolves who had thriven by means of the war from eating the helpless children as long as he reigned i had a hut in the forest and twentyfive kopeks a week and all the timber i could cut and a wife who behaved very softly to me and bore me several children then the russians spread their hands along the mountains and the valleys when there was no longer any power of men in arms to stop them and they put a tribute on every house and they sent away all the leaders of the men who had fought against them and among them the lord imar to a little island in the west which had never been friendly with them my money was cut down to ten kopeks but i had my cattle and sheep and goats and all the things that i could grow or shoot until that princess marva came the widow of rakhan houseburner and claimed the command of everything i would not rebel against the sister of the man i had loved so much and she said that she sent him all the money to keep him in his exile and for a long time people believed her until a great man of authority was sent to us from russia to see to the forests and the revenue and he told us that the lady had never sent a kopek to her brother but that the russians very justly allowed him most of his revenue because he had friends of clever voices and power in high places then the princess said that i defied her although i had never said a word of lies and she sent fierce men to turn me out but i had a little powder left and my eye was straight though my hands are old and i made two of them fall as dead as bears and the rest flew away like the shadow of a cloud when the wind is blowing but a week after that my house was burned while my wife and i were fast asleep and i lost the gun that shoots so straight though i think it must be in the ashes still my little daughter nine years old died in the stream we put her in to relieve her of her deathpain and the other damsel and both my boys were hurt by jumping into the firtree the hair of my wifes head was scorched so that i had to put a sheepskin on and the doctor said that if i had been a smooth man i never could have worn a shirt again but people were good and i had shot a bear which was hanging on a tree unmelted and when you have such fat to rub you you can cure anything outside ossets and lesghians and such races might think none the worse of marva for treating them in that kind of way but svans such as i am have never abandoned their bodies and their goods to the authority of any one since the time of the great queen tamara none of us can tell how long ago and although i might not be a true svan now yet the nature of the race abode in me then while i was thinking i heard a thing which stirred me like the trumpet of the great imaumsur imar himself was coming home to take his proper place again and do good to his people great joy was spread among the lesghians but the ossets went against the thought because he had too much strength of law and had grievously wronged them of the many goods flowing in to their dwellings from robbery for the short time he governed at karthlos it was said moreover that queen marva as she loved to hear herself called would now have no chance of holding fast her manifold encroachments fruitful valleys which she had stolen and flocks and herds and timbertrees and cragsides where some strangers pay her for hunting stones which they can change for gold now i will tell you a little thing and it is the wisdom of the wiser days there are two sorts of bears which prowl and devour in the cornland and the forest the big brown bear called michael who destroys the crops and the fruittrees but is glad to run from an unarmed child unless his body is wounded and then there is another bear not so large indeed but black with a white frill to its bosom this animal we call michaina and a wise man flies from it unless he can slay it at one shot because it will rush upon him in the dark and tear out his intestines and our fathers have left word for us through many generations that the brown bear is the form in which bad men on earth have been condemned to come back to it and see the harm they did when some of it has been stopped by death but the black bears are the wicked women still going on in wickedness not so often met with as the evil men but a hundredfold to be dreaded being black to the depth of their hearts and souls and this black bear queen marva is i had no house in the forest now and no place left me in the world better than any other and it mattered little to my flesh what became of all great people i had my wounded children or as many as remained of them to carry on my back sometimes or sometimes to run and pull me on according to the power of our courage and my wife when i grieved about her hair which had brought men in office to admire her said that without it her head felt lighter and begged me not to accept another woman with no hut of my own to bring her to and no meat to put into her why she asked me such a thingwhen i had never thought of it and was going along in a steadfast way with a child on either shoulderbladeonly the lord who made most of the women for our good can tell us sir and honourable gentlemen who have saved my life upon a hair when i was a boy my teaching was to believe in the devil only and to pray to certain images that knew the way to appease him but now i have been among wiser people who look up to the sky and think that it was made for good as well as evil and whether that be true or false i have found the people who think thus a great deal better than the dark believers at this point the poor svan broke down and shed a flood of tears after a long sad gaze at the mountains as if he had no home now and at the sky as if he had no hope there we gave him a little more nourishment for we saw that his tale was coming towards us now and then he wiped his eyes and set them sternly and cast selfpity into the fire of his wrongs chapter xlix the eye of god seven days agone i was seeking in the woods together with my wife and little ones with the worst of the winter past behind us and kind roots shining above the snow which had smothered all of them for months and pith of growth as good as corn to be found by those who are used to it for the desire of our hearts was only to keep a spark of life in them until we might get to places where mankind grows corn and grinds it for i had heard of an ancient friend the best man i ever knew to fight when it came to axe or kinjal though he never could shoot afar like me and his name was stepan the lesghian for a number of years he had been away following his masters fortunes but lately he was come back they said bringing household goods to prepare for him then in the dark woods as we crept along weary and hungry and trying vainly to comfort one another we beheld a company of wellfed people riding in the timbertrack below which we had been afraid to occupy by the white sheepskins upon their heads we knew that they were ossets men of queen marvas bodyguard whom she had chosen from all the tribe even as the great imaum had riders of the avar race continually faithful to him at the head of them rode the young prince hisar as wicked a young man as ever drew breath and behind them came a score of footmen rejoicing in cruelty and haters of the lord go you on my child i said to my wife rhada in the morning i will be with you by the great red pine so i left my family in the hands of god and putting dust upon my head like an old man seeking alms i fell in with the rear of that sprawlyjointed troop and none of them knew that it was usi when a man calls for alms in the name of the lord his brethren are happy to escape expense by letting him walk with them as if they heard him not and so i went on with them till night for i wanted to know what their wickedness was and i sang them sweet verses which they could not understand and they gave me some scraps to keep me quiet then from a boy who was pitiful to me perceiving how much of the world i had seen when the fleshpots hung upon the crooks and bubbled i learned what the meaning of this armed troop was they were coming with a strong force by order of their mistress to make a hearty welcome to her brother and his daughter upon their return to the native land from the place where the russian steamroad ends at the northern plain of the great mountains all had been settled that sur imar and his daughter should come from vladikaukaz in a hired troika and be received by their loving sister and aunt at a place appointed and there they must leave the great dariel road and be conducted by her to karthlos with great rejoicing and affection kindled but why were all these men thus armed not as for travelling only why did they carry ropes and chains why was there not a lesghian among them and why was there no sign of the princess eager to embrace her kindred loving sur imar as i did i resolved to go on and understand these things on the following day the ossets drove me from among them with many blows but i cared not since i had renewed my strength with plentiful waste victuals and a warm sound sleep for i could watch them none the worse for being outside of their wicked troop and by this time i well knew what they meant so i followed them to the great russian road towards which the forest track whereon i found them led and there they encamped on either side there were steep rocks around them full of black caves and crannies and without much risk i crawled up into one of these so that i could see all these warriors and the road beyond them without any risk of their seeing me before i had been there very long a threehorse carriage came up the road followed by two carts piled with goods and the young chief rode to meet them and much salutation might be seen and the carriage and carts were unloaded and sent back again so that only sur imarfor i knew his gait and stature even at that distancewith a young lady and two attendants a man and a woman stood in the road hisar no doubt had assured them that the princess was close at hand with vehicles well prepared to conduct them home but it seemed to me that the prince and the lady were looking to this side and to that and gazing at every corner as if they expected some one who ought to have met them but was not to be found and suddenly i thought that they were looking out for stepan imars milkbrother and most faithful friend and i wished with all my heart that he were there or could even be advised of his lords return sir and honourable gentlemen i will not deceive you by speaking as if i had seen the shameful things that happened almost before one could think of them to the great chief and his daughter for they were led very politely into a dark narrow valley that slopes from the road and cannot be discerned at all from it and a torrent that rushes along the lower end goes by with such an uproar that an army with drums might scarcely be heard at the mouth of it they were led there perhaps on pretence of a hospitable meal such as i would with joy pursue but in sad truth it was to overthrow them by means of ropes and loops and trees for sur imar was known to be the strongest man in all the great army of shamyl and although he might now be unarmed and defenceless it would be easier to master him by fraud than force and although i saw not the doing of it the old head sees more than young eyes sometimes according to an ancient tag of ours the grey bush looks round the corner they came not back into the wide strong road for fear of cossacks or other gapes but went along the forest ways of rock and slough and waterfall and through my old experience in the turn of warfor shamyl was fox wolf and lion in oneit was easy enough for me to keep in their track without giving them any smell of me they had my old commander strapped on poles across two horses which must have been great pain for him and would have torn a loose man in two but i never heard him speak a groan although they passed through hollow places where the misery of a man sounds loud the fair damsel had not her senses with her being of softer substance and cruel as they were they bore her gently upon a litter of slender wood not desiring to hurt her yet and having perhaps later occasion for her some of them jested about her beauty till the violent young man rode back and sent their loose mouths sprawling on the rocks he means to keep her for himself i trow when the sun was getting low and but for my memory of honest warfare and the love of an old soldier for a kindly leader i must have dropped away through weariness the feet of their horses struck on softer ground and behold they were entering a fair green valley on the northern breast of kazbek where the sun strikes not from on high but twinkles along the rocky passages when the slope of the earth invites him in the morning and in the evening time like a low flight of arrows such as i have seen when the svans were mighty bowmen wherefore this valley is never parched up as they are on the south of the mountains but is covered with moss like the breath of night and soft with trickling moisture and the learned men say that an ancient race who had come through the gates of caucasus having conquered the whole world all around set up their last pillars here and desired to go no further and the masonry of giants is there to prove it such as no man can make when the world grows old here that troop of brigandsfor such a name is almost too good for themopened a narrow door in the cliff which cannot be seen from every place because dark rocks encompass it what they did there i cannot tell for i durst not set foot down the valley and there was no getting near it in time from above so as to look down over them i could only discover that some went in stepping as if with burdens while others were left on guard outside by and by i heard a clanking like the swing of an iron door and presently all or as i thought all the riders came back and with laughter and singing and the young chief hisar at their head made off by the track which leads home to their village then i did a very foolish thing which has all but cost me my life without being of any use to sur imar if i had counted the men on horseback which i might have contrived perhaps to do though it would not have been very easy i should have learned that they were not all gone but that two were left on guard descrying no horses tethered in the valley and knowing that the prisoners could not escape i concluded rashly that all the ossets were gone at least for the present and that i might safely spy all around and perhaps even try to let sur imar know that i would do my best to save him so i hastened with some care but still too boldly along the foot of the cliff which rims the valley so as to endeavour to approach the door for the shadows were wiping out the shapes and colours of a man or a bush or a rock standing still while the soft moss and herbage took away the fear of sound looking out winkingly in all directions like a man of the chase who has espied the tur at the end of the valley in the clouding of the dusk i beheld a company of little rocks jutting from the soft land and standing in jags like an old mans teeth across the buttend where the dungeon began in and out of these i crept going very stealthily as if i were dealing with a cossack outpost but the mischief of it was that i had no gun only the dagger that everybody has and this one was more like lead than steel having come to me cheap in my distress from some city in the west called brummerum by breathing upon it many times i was doubtful of its temper but never thought how much it would betray me among those jags of rock i stood watching the face of the cliff beyond and the deep withdrawal of the iron door set in the granite masonry of some nation as old as noah and i said to myself that with a good ashtrunk and stepan and myself and a score of strong men to charge at it like a batteringram stout as it was it would perhaps give in there were loopholes also on either side to give air and a little light sometimes and i ventured a low breath of whistle in a soft and friendly tone to ask whether anybody might look forth though there was no width for a fox to squeeze through but the whole of my wisdom only proved what a fool an old soldier is sometimes for a loop was thrown over my head from behind and then two strong men had hold of me i managed to twist with one arm free and struck with my dagger at one of them but instead of making any hole in him it came back on my wrist like an osier having met with his metal cartridgebelt and then they pulled me off my feet and i lay like a sheep with his legs tied i thought they would have cut my throat outright for my head fell back the right way of it and one of them whipped out his knife to do it but the other cried out about the holy season and then put his arm across so they satisfied themselves with binding me with cords that cut into my flesh and they carried me through the night shaken up with pain and i knew not where i was till i came back to myself through necessity of lying to queen marva but as my evil fortune fell there happened to be among the ossets another old soldier of shamyl and one who had never served under sur imar this man knew me and told the queen who i was and but for the holy time she would have crucified me then and there religion forbids us to slay the wretch said marva with a glance of blackness but doth not forbid to make wolfs meat of him three days ago i was fastened to a rock with the big rope round my body and my wrists and ankles corded so that if any wolves came by they should have no trouble with me but the lord commanded only one wolf to come and he was overtaken with great wonder at the sight and i had the courage to keep silence and gaze at him as if demanding what he meant by being there seeing me naked and so hairy he could not understand such an animal for i could no longer stand upright then as i never flinched nor moved he sheathed his teeth and turned his eyes and his tail began to quiver i kept my eyes fixed on him steadily and my face as firm as the crag behind until with a little whine of doubt he drew in his nostrils and dropped his tail and trotted off to consult his friends and perhaps he has taken his family to look for me this evening a monstrous wolf he was in truth and as hungry perhaps as i could be for two days i had been numbed and parched and struck by the sun and the moon so much that instead of any brave time of thought i had only leaped and raved and yelled and dashed myself about in vain tearing my skin in strips and cutting gashes into my purple flesh and making holes all over me but the moment that wolf was out of sight i was seized with a cold and shivering dread so that i could see the naked hairs of all my body quivering death i knew that i must have and death had seemed a reasonable thing when i gave it to another man who was trying to do the same to me but to see myself being crunched alive to feel those yellow fangs pulling my strings out and that long tongue lapping up my bloodlet me die before he came again surely i must have strength enough left to burst the veins of my neck and die were there any rocks within my reach so rugged and sharp that i might fling one of my leading bloodpipes down again and again till it should burst i flung out my legs and strained my length like a chained dog clawing for a bone out of reach in search of some blade of flint keen enough to saw my gullet or windpipe through but what did i descry wedged firmly in a little cleft among them a long brown eye which i could see into curdled with coils of different colours as regular as a bulb crosscut centred with vaporous waves and hooped with rings of white as the rind encloses some dark wood then a spring of hope like the sparkle of a star flashed into the clouding of my mind for this is the stone which we call the eye of god it is stronger and keener of edge than any flint luckier to man than mothers milk and harder than steel of the genoese instead of straining twisting and wriggling to release my corded wrists which were lashed to the rope at my waist so tight that i could not fetch teeth nigh them i began to saw the cord below the clench of my thumbs upon the stone of god the agony of it was terrible but at last i rent my hands apart and as soon as the blood returned to them with teeth and flint i contrived to sever the rope that strung me to the rock and to hobble to a brook to drink the rest you know three days have i borne of agony starvation and the stars and sun the lord godif there be one in heaven to look down upon his own wicked worksspit my blood into that womans throat footnote probably the agate chapter l two old friends the svans are a strange and peculiar race declared indeed by the few outsiders who have ever seen them and come back to be the most original of mankind and usi proved at least that much by showing some rudiments of gratitude although he had managed to tell his tale with failure of words and gasps for breath and rolling of his eyes when the agony came back poor wolfsmeat was not fit for much except to be laid in a soft and shady place consoled with tobacco and cordials and continually asked how he felt now we soon understood what he wished to say even without the interpreter for he had picked up small pieces of divers tongues by being so long among the mountain troops more than once we feared that he would never bear up from the pains and privations he had undergone but he said that he should be unworthy of the name of a shamylid or son of shamyl unless he could starve for a week without showing immoderate signs of hunger if the signs usi had manifested after only three days were moderate no wonder that the big wolf turned and fled from a countenance so expressive strogue and cator and myself who might now be called the three leaders sat late into that night discussing the story of this patient sufferer what chance had we of being in time even if we could raise force enough to prevent the murder in cold blood appointed for next monday all the fighting men of this tribe of ossets in the upper terek and the ardon valleys would probably be mustered there to carry out the execution cator had often heard of the place so clearly described by the injured svan and he told us that these wild folk called it the valley of retribution from usis account it was plain that marva was making a tribal revenge of it her brother would be tried and condemned by the tribe in expiation of the death of their former chief prince rakhan him she had hated and scorned perhaps for she was not of the sweet kind of women who look at their wrongs with dewy eyes but according to the osset creed her duty wasblood for blood and soul for soul strong in her own dominion now she might drop all that if she saw fit and cry bygones be bygones every man of the tribe being in his heart most loyally afraid of her would have joined all his cousins in lamenting that the days were not as they had been that nobody had the courage now to keep up good old customs and yet however right ones own mind was what could one do but as the others did and then to sigh and cast a glance at heaven that forbears to fall upon us and light another pipe with some remorse but plenty of sentiment to make it draw this was not for us to do in a state of things beyond all understanding of any man not in the thick of them and a thousandfold worse for him if he is there nothing is more pleasing than to hear a man tell the story of some touchandgo adventure he has been through if he is an englishman he is sure to be selfashamed about it and describe himself as much more frightened than his slow system gave him time to be but whoever he is you may depend upon it that he will put into the narrative a lot of things which never occurredtill afterwards and i am afraid that i shall do this when i try to tell how we went on though i mean to tell everything word for word which ought to be the same as fact for fact but lo at the very outstart indignation cripples one we know that it is sure to go too far and to put things into darker colours than clear truth has cast into them in dread of this a truthful man draws back and takes too weak a brush all of us were put upon that sense of wrong which stirs us up to think less of our own poor lives and more of that great power which the lord has planted in us though he has not always worked it out to show that we are something more than the brute creation round us the sense of justice and good will and love to those of our own kind and hate of all that wrong them even if sur imar had not been the man he was and dariels father i would gladly have risked my lifeif time were allowed me to know what i was aboutrather than let such inhumanity triumph among human beings strogue and cator were of the same mind and the rest of the miners found that a little excitement would not be amiss the worst of it was that they were inclined to underrate the enemy to them it seemed sound argument that a dozen englishmen could larrup almost with their neckties thirty or forty of such fellows as they were like to meet with even if there had been truth in that and it would be most ungrateful on my part to disparage them what would they do if they had to encounter perhaps a hundred men all well armed therefore we must increase our force and that without loss of a minute to call for russian interference would be vain for they had no brigadeeven if they would have used itthat could be brought up in three days time we must act for ourselves as the rule is laid down generally for poor englishmen because they are so few yet always called upon to meet so many strogue struck the proper note of savage people i knew nothing save of incometax commissioners who charged us twice upon our landonce for our crime in owning it and once for the profit which they alone were able to make out of it but the captain said these men will fight and they fight quite as bravely as we do only with more passion in it to beat them we must have man for man or something very near it the only plan is to find your friend stepan and all the fellows he can bring that poor beggar who is groaning in his sleep seems to know where to find him he will not be able to walk for days but he can tell us where to go we had searched in vain as i may have said for any sign of stepan near karthlos that was one of the things which made us sure that treachery was at work for if he had travelled with the heavy goods straightway home as his orders were he ought to have been at karthlos long ago in spite of the terrible winter but no one seemed to know where to find him although a rumour was spread abroad that his master was returning there was however every prospect now of discovering him and those other retainers who had been with the chief in his exile for usi could not have been so long the forester or huntsman of that district without knowing where to find all the principal members of his adopted tribe what could be finer justice than that a fiendish plot of fratricide should be discomfited chiefly through the brutality of its conceiver if that tortured victim could but recover the use of his swollen limbs we might push along towards the lesghian valleys in time to rouse the tribe on the saturday night but to carry poor usi was a sad slow drag and to go without him would be useless even if humanity allowed it bears grease was his perpetual moan oh that men valued the precious bears grease if the good lord would send me only half a pound of bears grease i would leap like the ibex and dance like the tur then as if to show that heaven itself had taken a turn in our favour a most unusual thing came to pass although at the time i was very far from being at all surprised at it but those who knew the country said that such a thing scarcely ever happened and all of our little company might live to be ninety and keep eyes like twenty without ever seeing such a thing again however i can answer for it and was not at all disturbed by it we came walking heavily yet tenderly and like men who if they were in england would go to their chemist and ask him whether he had tried his celandine on his own feetwe came about the middle of that dayfriday it was and a critical timeto a corner where two torrents ran into one anothers arms with as much noise as two frenchmen make there were no trees not a leaf to break the sun everything was either hard or wet and the light itself seemed to come in gurgles as if it were almost giddy with the shining of the water and the staring of the rocks in the loose spread of it below the rush of the two streams into one anotherboth being buxom with snow on the melt which affords them a thickness of suetthere i saw a great sprawling thingsprawling at least it appeared to be and at the same time splashing i happened to be foremost of the file yet for the life of me i could not make out what it was till cator spoke over my shoulder thus motherly shebear carrying her cub economical father wants to kill itthey always do at this time of yearmother takes a different view she will land in a second aim behind the shoulder the kid is fine eating if you feel like missing let me do it for you get away i answered i came firstwhat have you got to do with it i put up my rifle but when she landed with wonderful care not to hurt a hair of the baby in her clumsy mouth and then looked at it so proudlythough it was but an ugly little lumpand began to lick the holy trickle from its newly opened eyes such a touch of nature went into my heart that i would rather have shot myself almost fire you stupid keen cator cried and fire i did but not at her for paterfamilias came down raging with his coat thrown back on his body and his little eyes rolling and his hairy chin poked out in fury at his wifes selfassertion my bullet behind his open shoulder told him that there might be two opinions about paternal duty and he rolled like a log into the swirling torrent and was washed up on our side a hundred yards below then usi the svan in a glory of excitement rose from his litter and told us what to do and we cut him out the fat that lies along the kidney part and he scrabbled it into his stringy legs and fell back again and smiled at them in less than half an hour he could walk and we had all we could do to keep up with him that night we slept in kazbek village which is on the great russian road and we laid our plans for the morrow cator was to make rush for the mine which he could reach before nightfall and implore jack nickols to spare us every son of a gun who could handle a rifle while strogue and usi and myself and others made every hour of daylight tell for our race in quest of stepan we feared that those vile ossets had a short cut across the western mountain from their village to the valley of retribution which would bring them in front of any speed of ours and unhappily so it proved indeed and they must have carried usi by that track when they caught him spying in their valley although they gave him small chance of knowing what was time or where was road for the mighty mass of kazbek lay betwixt the osset villages and the vale which had been for ages hallowed to their horrible revenge at daybreak on saturday we set forth in the midst of a miserable drizzle which would have made the way as hard to find as it was bad when found except for the knowledge of the land which usi showed that son of shamyl as he loved to be called was of infinite service to our cause very seldom did he care to speak unless he was consulted and the bronze cast of his rugged face beneath that hairy thicket showed no more life than the juniper scrub which we saw on the cheeks of the mountain but the quick blue flash of his eyes whenever we caught them unexpectedly was like the point blank spark that comes when the lightning is over ones own lawn let me not be in that mans blackbookswas the first thought of even the boldest mind as strogue said more than once to me presently this bearslayer showed us that he deserved the name of straightpipe which he had received from shamyl for while we were halting in a glen to feed gators rifle stood against a rock we grudged every moment and were eating against time when one of those great black eagles which are the grandest of european birds came soaring above us at a mighty height searching the earth for lamb or kid or perhaps a nice babe fast asleep beneath a rock with cators leave usi raised his gun and he must have been as quick as light for the crack of the rifle and the heavy flop of the dead bird on the track before us were the first i knew of the matter although i was standing within a few yards of him thats a grand shot i couldnt have done that although i am not a bad hand said strogue but the svan was not satisfied with his work i struck him too far behind he said my own pipe would have done it better i must get time to search for it among the ashes but we could not spare him yet for he alone could show us the men we wanted how it may be in the winter i know not and perhaps no one would care to know much about it then but to me who was used to very reasonable weather sometimes dull and sometimes fickle but scarcely ever furious and generally comprehensible the style of this caucasian sun whether as he asked his way among a crowd of pinnacles or whether as he mounted high strong and hot above them or even when he meant to be compassionate and genial in looking back at his long days workall i can say is that to a man of surrey who lives out of doors nearly all day long and can tell you the time within half an hour whether it be cloudy or whether it be clear the climate was incongruous at home you could look up at the sky and after making wise allowances for the way of the wind and the manner of the clouds and the inclination of the quicksilver you could generally say something which could be explained away when a little incorrect but here the only wisdom was to shake your head and say the developments are complicated pressure variable and conflicting local showers not improbable thunder not impossible as our scientific staff begins to waver after predicting rain every day in a drought of three months duration that saturday evening the sun went down so far as we could get a straight look at him through such ins and outs genial bountiful a great globe of good will squandering gold upon a maiden world of snow which it blushed to accept and yet spread upon its breast the weather at any rate is on our side was my cheerful remark to captain strogue if we can only find those fellows we shall be all right dont you be too sure he said there may be a hurricane tomorrow travelling eastward all that day we had passed the foot of karthlos long ago under usis guidance for to climb the steep would be waste of time as there was no strength of men there now then we descended into another valley and usi blew upon a horn and listened we heard no reply but he heard something and led us as the yellow light turned grey into a hollow place with huts around it and out rushed two enormous dogs and behold they were kuban and orla chapter li the root of evil the amazement of those dogs at sight of me was beyond anything i ever did behold they had seen so much of the world by this time including a good deal of england that they had learned to doubt all the evidence which untravelled dogs wag tail to they pulled up suddenly and looked at one another with the tawny curls of their ears in a tremble and the hackles of their necks thrown back and every hair to the tips of their tails quivering with incredulity then like a fool i pronounced their names and the word that brings down the avalanche would have been a wiser utterance they flung their great frames and golden crests in one shock of delight upon my breast like a harvestcart dashed against the rickyard post luckily i expected it but even so was glad to be backed up by a rock and there it was impossible for me to speak all human emotion being swallowed up in dog however they soon made amends for that and the roar that rang from crag to crag brought every living being out foremost of these was our old friend stepan carrying a mighty gun with allai peeping through the loop of his elbow and four or five more who had been in our valley staring at us over the packingcases i shouted to them with the old salute which they had taught me at st winifreds and they made their salaams and sang their welcome while stepan enfolded me in his capacious arms and allai hugged my knees and wept say nothing till we are inside i whispered to strogue who could speak their language somehow it was high time to be prudent now as well as prompt and resolute for it seemed as if the enemy had in every way outmanoeuvred us and now if our project should become known the case would indeed be hopeless not a word to any of these people until stepan thinks fit to tell them but i need not have been so particular for they are as true as steel to one another and above all to their chieftain stepan told them even before he heard my story out because swift runners must be sent that very night to other kheusur villages for every fighting man within reach to join the muster at the foot of karthlos and that muster to be of any use must not be later than noon of the morrow which would be sunday then i told stepan our side of the story with strogue to make it clear to him and usi without whom we could have done nothing recounted all that he had seen but scarcely spoke of his own woes at this i wondered for the moment but knew the reason afterwards stepan listened with arms folded and his great grey head as still as a rock while his eyes were harder and less expressiveas it chanced to occur to methan the agate which had saved usis life and i noticed that the wall on which he fixed them was not half so sound and solid nor the room itself so neat and cheerful as the old stone ruin occupied by sur imars men in england is that all he inquired at last and strogue replied yes and to me it seems enough the lesghian dipped his unshorn chin upon the wooded cataract of his breast and nodded courteously meaning clearlysir you have been through us but not to any purpose among us and i as a young slipin comparison with him though old enough now to stand up for my growthmarvelled about dry roots and trunks that are all bark and so on hearken to me and i will use few words said the loyal lesghian slowly with strogue explaining for my benefit i am getting old and i have my daughters for the lord has granted me no son and the babes whom my daughters have brought forth while i was far away to dwell upon i am growing old and my strength is only in the standing combat now i cannot leap down from a rock and alight with both feet together and my arms like willows of steel twined round the enemy it has been ordained that a man as his years increase upon him should increase also in bulk and weight if permitted by fortune to feed well all the men of our tribe feed well because they are just and remain with their wives who know how to cook the cattle of their neighbours none of those would we ever take if we could trust them to leave us ours for not only are we righteous but we endeavour to make strangers so when their wickedness is not good for us for my part i have been in foreign places and learned much of foreign language sometimes increasing in wisdom thus but as yet i have not found a country fit to be placed by the side of ours not only for the fairness of the land but the goodness of the inhabitants but as a man of truth i will admit that it is not so with our neighbours they on the other hand are breakers of the laws of righteousness seeking only the ways of evil eager to slay all who set them example not convenient and now they are in dread of the return of our great chief because he brings justice and virtue with him their desire is to slay him and to rob him of his goods and to rule over us who belong to him me who am his brother by the mothers breast and bound to give my life for his and all that i possess they have deceived and cheated by many lying tricks and beguiled me as the mother fox tempts away the dog to discourses of soft affection while her children prey upon the tender lambs behold when i landed from the great smokeship after many weeks of rolling on strange waters there came a man to meet me with a letter in a stick which he said was by order of the prince himself and i and all my company must obey it what the tongue says the ear can swallow and render to the mind for consideration but that which the hand has shaped in many forms of crookedness cannot come into the mind through the passes of the eyes without long teaching and toiling through a forest full of twists and turns which can only be endured in childhood therefore i went to a learned man and paid him ten kopeks and he made it to me the same as if sur imars voice pronounced it and thereby i was commanded to stay where i was with all my companions and all the goods for the passes were already blocked with snow until i should receive another letter as soon as the spring flung back the gates between the frozen mountains the winter was very long but at last another paper came to us through officers of the government as the letters are sent in england and i paid another ten kopeks so expensive is such learning and was commanded to come on by way of kutais and hire waggons and get to this village which is not my own but not to go near karthlos yet because it was full of workmen money was also sent to me in a note for a hundred roubles and i was ordered to shoot both these dogs if i had kept them still alive i was sure sur imar had not said that because his daughter loved them so and that made me wonder and begin to doubt and i said to myself they shall see their master and plead for their own lives with him also i was ordered to remain here almost as if i were to be in prison keeping away from my own village and all my old friends and obtaining food only from the people close at hand until i should be sent for and the reason was that if the russians heard of all the goods we had they would send an officer to take toll or seize them altogether this i thought might be true enough until the people here declared that the russians never do anything like that and again this made me doubtful we who are of the true and never to be called in question faith of christ even as the english are do not observe these heathen fasts and feasts and rites of superstition but keep our own most holy seasons as ordained by the lord himself yet so noble are our minds that we blame not those of smaller knowledge but rather abstain from meddling with them during the days which they keep holy although they be not the right ones for this reason i remained here yet resolving to set forth on monday when their profane days will have returned and to ask among them the meaning of these things which i am ordered not to seek among our own tribe but woe is me to have learned it thus with haste and peril and helplessness it must be the wicked prince who has plotted this vile plan having taken it straight from the fiery lips of the evil one it is not by any one to be believed that the sister of sur imar born at one birth with him should be as a cauldron of the pitch of hell while he is in an alabaster box of manna for the food of the faithful in the wilderness by many generations it has been said that a woman who has not been made of milk and honey must have been fashioned out of gall and venom and true it may be yet how should such things descend from the mother of imar tell me then for now we speak as i would that we had spoken long ago in words that pass into the minds of one another tell me what advantage can the princess marva look for from doing that which none of the women of our tribe would wish to do or even if she wished it under the influence of the devil would dare to keep in her mind as long as a bakingshovel in her hand as yet we had not dwelt much on this the design being manifest as we believed the motive did not concern us much and in all the hardships perpetual effort and weariness of travellingsuch travel at least as we had to facethe body was always too hard at work for the mind to be very active except in attending to it strogue looked at me and i at him and each left the other to answer friend stepan knows all the ins and outs of these tribal politics and family arrangements the captain opened his mouth at last ever so much better of course than i do no doubt her ladyship expects to suck some benefit out of this murderfor i dont see what else you can call it although there may be a mock trial but even without that i always understood that the duty of the blood feud would compel her even if she loved him the best on earth to hunt him to death with alacrity you know that although the law is not in your tribe or at any rate you are free from it by marriage she is an osset and with them it is most sacred i have not forgotten that our host replied looking doubtful as became him when even near the verge of argument but even if that tribe kept up its wrath at the death of its chief so many years the lady as i have heard even in england can do as she pleases among them now it is not right it is not just it is not as the lord intended the woman should never rule the man but she will do it gladly if they lift her upon the stool instead of keeping her to the oven but when she gets tired of salutes and praises and humble words which ought to be like ripe figs to her what she begins to yearn after is money and life will be short for those who have it when she thinks it should be hers my good friend my great friend stepan cried strogue with the stem of his pipe in the air as if he never cared whether he sucked it again you have hit the mark better about those blessed females than i should have ever dared to try to do at the london rock it is just the samelandlady or barmaid makes no difference or the little girl that wipes the glasses all eager to go for a celebrated man but wont put a tear in the corner of their eyes till theyve peeped into his pockets on the hook inside the door that is why none of them can catch me a man who has been round the world three times finds the black women truest to their colour to me this was such hateful doctrine so low so coarse so cannibal that i jumped up with a strong desire to send the captain down among the packingcases but he gave me a sly wink meaning clearlythe object of this is to fetch that fellow out and stepan came out with a dignity scarcely to be expected from him some of his words were beyond my knowledge but upon the whole he spoke like this i have not been round the world three times and that man is the wisest traveller who goes through his own self the most but in all the countries that i have seen the women are better than the men according to the gifts of nature of money they are not half so greedy and they have more compassion usi the svan will tell you what the father does to the female babies when he has too many of them in the country of men and women straightpipe what does the father do then in the noble country of the svans he places the little one on her back the bearslayer told us looking at the floor as if he were watching the domestic process and he makes the fire burn brightly then when the little one opens her mouth for the nourishment of nature he takes the spoon from his bowl of soup and fills it with redhot embers and pours them into the infants mouth and lo that child calls for no more food hast thou ever beholden a mother who would feed her infant thus stepan asked the captain who looked as if his pipe had grown too hot for him and the captain knocked out his ash and said give me some cold whiskey lo the moon is shining on the white peaks now and the light will soon flow along the valleys it is time for me to go said stepan and allai will come with me i have told the headman what to do but the men here are as nothing gentlemen you are weary the lord give you good rest tonight for tomorrow we must travel fast i will bring every faithful son of the tribe and meet you by noon at karthlos chapter lii still in the dark at midnight we stood by the door of the hut and watched the broad bulk of stepan and the slender slip of allai sliding away into white breath among the black jaws of the mountains i thought that i had never seen so fair a night so lovely soft and kindly offering guidance of bright stars among the pale blandishments of the moon opening avenues of lofty hope compassionate to mortals with such glory full in view and the grandeur of unknown realms beyond how could any of those who have so short a time to dwell below spend it or spare a moment of it in the trivial wormcasts of rank and money which cannot even slime the scythe of death if farmer ticknor had been with usthat ticknor i mean who had proved himself so trenchant a micaiah to the official zedekiahperhaps we might not have entered into this rapturous view of the heavens or perhaps it was that we required a lesson but whatever the explanation is the fact came far in front of it when we tried to get up in the morning there was nothing to get up by except time who sheds no light but spends the better part of himself in quenching it laden as we were with sleep whose freight we had not yet discharged we said to one another that a special relief was granted us it was manifest that human skill in the record of time had been overruled the powers that govern day and night could not be set at nought by watchmakers we blew out the matches we had struck and rolled on our backs for another snooze submissive to the will of heaven how far we might have prolonged our snores we never grew wide enough awake to say but the soft folds of darkness fell around us still and we closed our eyes beneath them as a child submits to the kisses of his mother then a mighty bellow and a cackle and a stamping and a shovelful of cold slush thrown into our faces made all of us jump up and stare about and splutter and every one swear except as i heartily hope myself it was the old village starchina or starost or whatever his dignity may have been in a state of mind so furious that it was true bliss to be no linguist strogue made out some of his compound curses but was too wise to interpret them or even to accept his own version until that most venerable and profane of men saw little advantage in cursing himself he flung down the shutter that served as a window and poured about a sackful of snow down our necks this might be the manner of the country but we resented it all the more for that and spoke harshly of the place and of all born near it until strogue sat up on his very hard board and stared with his eyes as close as burning glasses at the old silver watch which a man could work a ship by and exclaimedby jove he is done for now george we ought to have been at karthlos by this time however he is safe to go to heaven according to your account of him even cowardice is sometimes less contemptible than flippancy but i made no answer my rage with myself was too deep to fly off into sparks against others what could it matter to strogue or starost or even to stepan himself compared with me with me the snorer if the noble man who had treated me as his equalclumsy clodhopper as i wasand his daughter the model of all love and grace were butchered by savages tomorrow upon whose head would their blood lie upon minefor my accursed laziness selfindulgence wicked gladness to believe the thing that i desired then i went out and looked for the sky which had been so blue and the earth which had been so green wherever it was not brown rockiness beholdthere was nothing to beholdas usi the svan might have said of itbut grey thickness fleecy softness multitudinous whirl above and vast whiteness promiscuous glare and slur of dazzle around us and below not what the puzzled world is wont to call a blizzard and fly shudderingfor that only comes with a bitter blast and is a mass of pointed particlesbut a genuine downright heavy snowfall such as we get in march sometimes when we are sowing the peadrill big flakes thick flakes like a shower of daisies flinging their tufts in feathery piles and smothering one another it cant go on very long like this says a man who has lost in halfaminute the pattern of his coat and trousers certainly it could not in surrey or in kent but here in the caucasus it proved that it could go on long enough at any rate to bury all the trackways and turn jagged rocks into treacherous white rollers if we began in our credulous greed for rest with failing to know the time of day we went on with losing the way and what was worse if possible we lost the better part of our strength through sprains and strains and stumbles in the drift mishaps of the like sort had befallen the party recruited by stepan although they had not overslept themselves as we did and instead of prompt muster to start together at noon from the foot of karthlos we found that it was almost four oclock before every one was ready to do any good we must travel all night said stepan as he swung his heavy pack upon his rifle to travel all night on a turnpike road is all very well strogue answered but who could do it here my friend and sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander if the snow stops us it will stop the other fellows i had indulged in this hope too but the lesghians words were against it no man can say till his eyes give proof but the storm came from the east and they seldom travel far in the summertime like enough there was not a flake on the western side of the russian road ha kobaduk art thou coming too thy old limbs will tire we shall have to leave thee even though thou hast that colt we had not climbed the steep to the tower because time was so short and the old steward could not be of any service to us therefore it was a great surprise when he slipped among us from a snowy corner leading a rough unsaddled colt with a strap buckled over his loins to which a sword was attached on one side and a rusty old musket on the other an english crowd would have gibed i fear at the menacing aspect of this feeble ancient and even strogue made no attempt to hide a grin but the lesghians glanced at him kindly and made room for him among them and he plodded on resolutely without a word like a fatalist come to look fate in the face even in a small lot such as we were and consisting chiefly of hardy fellows there must beaccording to the varicose vein which runs through all humanitythree or four at least of softer pith or eruptions that arise to the occasion or some thing or other that goes amiss and not having one leg too many among us or i might say less than half the legs we wanted our hard fortune was that the briskest shank among uswhich was not my own though i did my best and in surrey would have challenged any of themwas obliged to stick fast when it got too far ahead and disguise its own gratitude for a thrill of rest by turning on its heel disdainfully in a word nearly all our most excellent men brave and zealous and brought up from childhood to a good stroke of speed after other peoples cattle had lost the best part of their training by compulsionunder russian tyrannyto attend to their own flocks and herds instead of lifting their neighbours thus it was that we came at last to an elbow of the great russian road which is a noble work but not by any means such as we should make if we had the opportunity and there we found a sample of what human nature is having surmounted by wonderful endurance and perpetual rivalry with one another obstacles that seemed insuperable surely we should have gone on with double spirit when we came upon a christian highway instead of that every blessed man sat down and thanked heavenor in truer truth thanked himselffor having got along so famously it was dark as dark as one could ever wish to see it down in this gorge of magnificence with the river roaring sleepy thunder and the snowclouds spent and the stars looking faint i thoughtas an englishman thinks by instinctthat men of our own race would not have stopped at any rate if there was money in it and shut up in this sudden style however there was more excuse than help for it and stepan and myself the two who cared most deeply about the issue tried to cheer each other so far as our mutual misunderstandings reached then by a lucky chance the gallant miners whom we should have missed perhaps if we had gone on at once came into our camp with light hearts and merry songs delighted at the prospect of a lively brush for so they all regarded it jack nickols himself had been unable to resist the fierce temptation and gloomy would be the outlook for any foe who crossed his skyline though i cannot recollect just now his celebrated score at the running deer it was terrible to me to find these fellows taking things so easily not through any callous inhumanity or indifference but simply because their own private interests were not immediately involved for instance the way in which nickols and cator and strogue discussed the situation was enough to sponge out of my heart a great lump of that affection for the human race without which a man becomes miserable weary as they were they found it needful to hold some little council while they smoked their pipes after supper having settled that all should take four hours of sleep if they could get it and start again when the moon arose i sat in a corner and listened to them refraining from all interruption though a great part of what they said was new to me for if i had spoken some heat might have followed my words and done mischief to all of us strogue i have always had the credit of seeing as far into a hayrick as any man that ever sucked a coral but this fiend of a woman beats me hollow i cant make out what her little game is nickols well i cant see any difficulty about it she wants her brothers property and to be the lady of the other tribe too which she would be as dadians daughter if her brother imar were done away with she will have him tried for the death of her husband or get him shot without trial then she has discharged her duty according to the rules of the bloodfeud and she steps into poor imars shoes to me it is plainer than a pikestaff cator all that looks straight enough but it wont hold water you forget the pretty girl imar has a lovely daughter and she would be the head of the tribe not marva when his goose is cooked nickols thats true enough but a woman with such a strong mind wouldnt make much bones of that or rather shed make bones of her in no time i am very sorry for that pretty girl she is booked for a share of her fathers grave strogue naturally i look deeper into things than you young fellows can the real difficulty has escaped you both the woman is bad enough for anything i know things of her that i wont tell at any rate for the present but as for making away with her niece there are two good reasons against it in the first place the russians would be almost certain to punish madam heavily though perhaps they would not interfere if imar alone were tried and condemned according to the usage of the country and then again even if they let it pass the lesghians who are a very loyal race would never accept marvas rule when she had slain their chief and his daughter you have got the wrong story altogether according to my view of it her game is not quite so clumsy though it is a very bold one nickols captain you are one of those men who get the right tip always dont be shythat would scarcely become you but tell us exactly what you think although it may be hard to square it with the higher moralities strogue you speak like a fool as all boys do but there is no time to boardschool you and you are getting too old for that rot even now listen to what i have to say though beyond the present range of your intellect i have not dwelt among this mixed lot of savages i have simply passed through them in my usual course you might live among them till your hair grew white and know less than you did when it was green why you are sharp enough in your way and if you had started with a humble mind and kept it open you might win knowledge but that is not fine enough for you you start with your poor wits already ingrained and casehardened with the grease and suet of selfconceit and nothing ever sticks to you nickols and cator and i in the corner with unanimous surprise captain strogue is the humblest of mankind and therefore the most omniscient strogue it is true my friends a great hometruth and you shall gather the fruits of it i have penetrated this ladys scheme and deeply regret that so fine a woman one of the handsomest i have ever seen should not behave with equal beauty having sent her brother to a better world she will bring his daughter to the altar as the bride of her noble sonnoble indeed to look at but unable as yet to say boh to a goose he will be the master nominally of all imars fair dominions which are as lovely as any in the world when the snow allows a sight of them the real master of course will be a certain ladyfriend of ours for you can see that from his cradle upwards she has cowed that uncommonly fine young fellow so that he dare not call his soul his own upon my word i should not be surprised when she has united these central tribes if she threw off the yoke of russia and proclaimed herself queen of the caucasus like a modern tamara all that is clear enough but the one thing i cant make out for the very life of me is why the dickens did she send us that scamp whose real name is hisar under the name of hafer she would not send the true hafer of course lest when he had been away for months and seen the ways of the polished world and how absolutely the children rule their parents he might be seized with emulation and resolve to be master of his own domains if not of his own motherthough i am sorry for anybody who tries that now tell me ye who flatter yourselves that you can see further into a milestone than strogue who has beheld so many what induced this artful schemer to send hisar to england in the name of hafer when for all that we can see he might just as well have gone in his own name nickols i was never any hand at crooked dealing though there is plenty of it in our own line of business but none with tiptoppers like my uncle and me we have a high character to sustain even supposing we would stoop cator stow that jack we know it all by heart but i can tell the captain one good reason why the ladys ambassador should be called hafer sur imar was bound to receive his own nephew when he might have refused to see a stranger and to take him into their confidence and let him know their plans and so on all of which has enabled them to make fools of his faithful retainers and prisoners of himself and his daughter strogue with half an eye open i saw every bit of that but it does not touch the real difficulty dariel is to marry the true hafer very well let her if she likes hes a young man of grand appearance and that reconciles the women to a lot of disadvantages but if she was meant to belong to him why let another fellow get the start with her though women of decent age know better a girl is sure to be romantic she piles wonders of imagination upon the first goodlooking young fellow who suggests how lovely how lofty how divine she is she keeps him at a blushing distance and looks as if she had not the least idea where he is and would turn her head away if he came up bless their hearts i know them all though i never let them see it i could have had fifty mrs stroguesfor they love a man who knows the worldsome of them too with cash and houses but none of that for me till i want nursing halfadozen miss strogues here and there some white some black and some the colour of an orange or a good mocha berry that you cant get nowand they behave all the better to you when they know that you can do without them simple truth gentlemen i am not romantic this was too much for jack nickols who was truly in love with his rosa too much even for cator though he had no love as yet to hold him young englishmen know right from wrong though they do the wrong very often but they cannot bear to hear it boasted of but to me with dariel in my heart purifying and ennobling it bad as the time was for a row i should have deserved no better time if i had been afraid of it so i marched up and laid my hand upon him sir i said without a sign of angerfor such stuff was not worth itwhat you deserve both of men and women is to die in a workhouse with mrs gamp and betsy prig to close your eyes bad women there must be as well as bad men but tell me which has made the other i know you better than to believe that you really think such wicked nonsense as you talk for the sake of seeming clever bartholomew strogue is a better man than that i should not be much surprised if he was the captain answered pleasantly and he can allow for babes and sucklings who are the happiest people after all but come my friends i hear the sounds of sleep the grinding of the mill of slumber how those gallant lesghians snore if the caucasus is the true cradle of our race sleep must have lost its silence before language was invented chapter liii a ruthless scheme while these men were arguing thus failing with all their ingenuity perhaps to hit upon the true state of the case a scene which they would have been glad to behold was taking place some twenty miles away and not far from the banks of the ardon here that river on its way to join the terek below vladikaukaz rushes through a rugged and desolate country on the further side of kazbek where the fall of the land is towards the north and the long shadows lie in snowy stripes even to the suns of midsummer this was the melancholy spot where rakhan owned that huntinglodge to which the poor princess oria had turned for refuge when the snows of autumn blocked the track here it was that imar furious at her apparent guilt found her most unhappily at the very moment when the faithful stewardwhose presence would have proved her innocencewas gone to the nearest hut in search of provisions and help to clear the road and here it was that she breathed her last slain by her own hand according to the ordinance of her ancient race to expiate the intolerable insult of the man she loved and worshipped but now the woman who had caused her death or led up to it so cleverly by her own malevolence felt no misgivings about that betwixt twins even of the kindest nature and clinging from their birth to one another a fungoid growth is apt to spring as it does in a tree cleft down the centre but not allowed to part in twain either member of the impaired union believes that the other belongs to it and both are ready to close the grip against all who would divide them but as years go on and diverse attractions draw them more and more apart each begins to form and thicken cuticle against the other at least if they are of equal strength and then the stuff that vainly came to close the gap grows venomous jealousy like a yellow toadstool sprang up in young marvas heart when her brother dared to love another woman better than herself she had fallen away from the twinship first by giving herself to rakhan without a word to her brother and sacrificing to passion all the tender ties of kindred love none the more could she endure that her brother should do likewise and she would not believe although she knew it that her lover had murdered her father then when her husband made a grievance of imars just refusal to pay marriageportion to that murdererunless he would come and take the oathshe made a grievance of it too more and more bitter as rakhan began to make more and more spite of her poverty and so it went on with the crust of sullen temper thickening year by year and the faith of married life turned sour by her husbands faithlessness until her brother slew the wretch who had ruined him and outraged her fair fight it was and if ever one man has the right to stop another from his evil deeds below and give him chance of mercy ere his black account grows blacker the one might plead that right and the other accept the relief with gratitude but reason is less than a drop in the ocean of a tempestuous womans heart marvas illwill towards her brother deepened into bitter hatred and nothing but his exile saved him from her brooding vengeance and now she had found a chance of wreaking her wrath upon him to hearts content and with the same blow satisfying her lifelong thirst for wealth and rule therefore now her black device was on its last bound towards success and we who rejoice in lawful acts and tricks that can be justified by solid legal argument must bear in mind that her scheme was well in accordance with the local law to save all risk of being late for the ceremony of the morrow she had quitted the stronghold where she allowed us the honour of that interview and crossing the mountains west of kazbek by the ardon watercourse had put up at this huntinglodge as the only suitable dwelling near the valley of retribution about seventy armed men of the tribe and a dozen village elders had been despatched to the roman jail to keep guard and prepare the trial while she had only a few men with her including the gentle hafer and the thoroughly savage hisar but the lady as yet had no suspicion of our rapid counterplot which we never could have formed without the tidings and the help of usi the bearslayer whom she had corded to the rock for wolves and if we could only have foreseen her sojourn at this huntinglodge what a dash we might have made with the mining force alone and held our haughty captive as a hostage for her prisoners but as yet we knew not where she was and as to what may here be told it is scarcely needful to observe that it came to my knowledge afterwards and often on our road we doubted in spite of all we heard of her whether that any woman in her right mind and acting with cool intention would compass a crime almost beyond the conception of a man soever vile although it was not for the sake of the horror but an indispensable part of her scheme that her brother should be slain by his own and only son hafer she said to this noblelooking youth who believed himself the only son of her injured husband rakhan at last the time is come for you to vindicate your father tomorrow his murderer will be condemned by the verdict of the elders of our tribethe men who were faithful to your father the great prince rakhan of the ossets your father died as you know too well in the assertion of your mothers rights your uncle imar my own brother was gifted by heaven with no sense of justice he was not content with robbing me your dear mother of my rightful share in my father dadians inheritance but when your own brave father rakhan vainly made suit after many years to obtain a small share of my rights what did your uncle imar do you know you have heard it a thousand times he slew your father in cold blood taking mean advantage of superior strength he left me a widow a helpless widow with you my only child almost a babe instead of remaining like a man to face the consequence of his crime and trying at least to make compensation he fled to an island in the west called england where all malefactors are sheltered and fed there he lived in luxury for many years receiving all the revenues which of right were mine now he has returned without a word of sorrow to me to rob me of the little i have tried to save you know how hard i have striven against fortune labouring to keep the scanty relics of my rights and to take charge of small affairs that have chanced to lose their owner even you i have been compelled sometimes to deprive of enjoyments to which your birth entitled you is it not the truth my child mother it is indeed the truth i have often been ashamed of my desire for more food and yet it has been a pleasure to me to behold you never famishing a barleycake has been enough for me there are some who can so deny themselves but justice comes to those who wait and bear their sorrows patiently the murderer of your father has even through his own bad designs fallen into the hands of those to whom he owes so long a debt we have him beyond all power of escape tomorrow he will be justly tried by those who know what he has done the elders of this noble race the race of the white sheepskin will have him placed before them he will be forbidden to poison the air with any lying speeches his sentence will be death and youaccording to the law of agesyou are the man to execute it the young man fixed his large and gentle eyes upon her face in doubt whether she could mean in earnest to enforce such a cruel task even the worst of tyrants threatens a great deal more than he means to do and when it is a female tyrant deeds can scarcely equal words however strong the whole may be this youth had received enough of boththe blast of words the lash of deedsand a heart that was both just and tender had confused the brain by pouring vain emotions into it the lady met his eyes with more than the everyday contempt in hers it was not in her nature to make allowance for the result of her own work studiously from his infant days she had crushed all freewill out of him and yet she scorned him for having none as fine a specimen of manly growth as could be found in all the world was towering over her dark head tall and stately though she was she hated him for doing that and she scorned him for doing it in stature only am i to speak again she asked with a gaze from which his mild glance recoiled i have set your duty before you hafer if you are coward enough to refuse it another will discharge it for you and according to the ancient laws you will be imprisoned and starved to death what will become of lura then she will love you if you are a man if not she will turn to hisar who is longing to prove himself more worthy and all her beauty will be his what has hisar to do with this he is always seeking to supplant me you speak as if i were a coward because it is not my desire to shed blood of man or beast those who have done no harm to me why should i do harm to them neither do i take heed of words being brought up with reproaches daily which it becomes me not to answer but of hisar i have no fear it is the feminine voice that scares me because it has always held dominion and is too rapid to contend with you have never allowed me to obtain any skill in weapons such as a fullgrown man should have neither have i desired to fight which is worthy of wolves and dogs and hogs but if hisar thinks to take my place in the things which he is coveting hisar is of ignoble breed let him come and make trial of me and let lura come and see it if her gentle nature does not shrink hafer tossed his golden curls and tried to look fierce but nature had not gifted him with that expression neither had practice supplied the lack and then he smiled at his own attempt having much of his father imars vein no woman worthy to be called a woman could have looked at him without admiration and pity for all that he had suffered to take the bold spirit out of him but the woman who had crushed his life was enraged at this slight outbreak something more than vaunt is needful to establish claim to courage hisar is brave the maidens admire him the fighting men are afraid of him if thou art too liverhearted to avenge thy fathers wrongs a braver youth will take thy place and do thy duty for thee it will not be worth while to starve thee hafer and to listen to thy craven shrieks on thy forehead we will brand coward and expel thee from a tribe of men hisar shall be the lord of ossets with lura for their lady for the lordship i care not thou hast done thy best from my birth to make me what thou art nota woman hisar is more to thee than i am though he is but a stranger but he shall never be lord of lura for i know that she hates him and he would grind her into dust for her sake i will do this thing loathsome as it is to me since it must be done by somebody but remember one thing if i am forced to thisnever more will i call thee mother poor fool does he think he will have the chance she muttered as he strode away repenting already in his soft young heart of words that might have been too harsh child of the detested oria better for thee to have died than led my own dear little one to his death thou hast escaped the precipice but the russian mines shall be thy doom hisar where art thou my son heardest thou what that spoonpap said this hut shall have a golden door and walls of lapislazuli within it oria slew herself and within it her firstborn has sealed himself for siberia hisar came forth from the inner room so fateful to sur imar and for once his surly face looked bright since his return he had thought scorn of his native land and all therein but he durst not show his mother that madam it is nobly designed he said and all in strict accord with law pedrel first he shall have his wages for which he has dared to follow me hither and to plague me about marriage with his sister then to see that pious imar fall by the hand of his sanctimonious son to explain to that sweet saint what he has done and then to deliver him to the russians to be tried for parricide it is high time to be quit of him he begins to show cheek as the men of england say i could have stabbed him yesterday if it were not for spoiling your noble scheme oh mother the eagles of rakhabat alone can have brought thee such counsel from the clouds above i am clever and full of great devices but never could i have invented this my child it is but one of many that have entered into my swift mind when i was a girl among the nuns to pass the winter nights we used to relate delightful stories far more ingenious than this the difficulty is not to think them but to do them to make a great success of them this we have not accomplished yet but i see not how it can slip from our hands so far things have worked well for us even the weather has taken our part that spy of a svan is wolfs meat ere now and there is not a lesghian this side of karthlos no fear of that meddlesome briton i trow or of stroke the drunken traveller who threatened to come after thee would that i could catch them in our valleys mother george the farmer would have small chance then of swinging his gun and singing psalms with the angelic dariel how i scorn and hate soft women and they love me not all love and liking hath gone to the meek and milky lesghian hafer as thou hast chosen to call him therefore to the russian hell with him but of one thing i would warn thee much admired and beloved mother when we have torn the red cross down and cast it beneath the white sheepskin and filled our belts with the gold of imar not long will i tarry in these dens of rock fit only for the hermit and the huntsman of selina i am already weary and soon as my heart is weary both of dariel and lurasince the ancient law allows us twain which is less than the wisdom of the moslemi shall leave thee to command this savage race and take their tributes for me yearly will i come to see thee and my two devoted wives when the harvesttime is on and cities are too hot to dwell in but london and paris paris and london will be the delight of hisar the princess had heard this more than once and it did not distress her she had none to love or plot for now except this savage hisar her own but unacknowledged son forsooth when rakhan proved himself both brutal and faithless to her and quitted her before the birth of the genuine osset hafer and wandered with a lightoflove the outraged wife took her revenge according to the manner of the country by encouraging a khabardan chief a bold and haughty mussulman hisar born of this transmontane sally about two years after the true hafers birth but before his death at karthlos was of necessity kept from sight during every return of rakhan that strongwilled savage like many others allowed unlimited action to himself but passion only in the passive form to those who might have saved his soul if there had been any heart behind it thou art not fit to govern men the princess marva looked at hisar with a smile of mild contempt which would have been anything but mild to any other womans son but there is time enough to learn all that fierce enough thou art and that is the understreak of all government all the needful frauds will flow into thy noble spirit when thy truest friends and warmest loves have shown thee what the onyx is chapter liv the valley of retribution usi the svan came up to me in the first gleam of the morning when the valleys were spiral snakes of white and the peaks were horns bedight with rose as in a roman sacrifice we had struggled and scrambled by stepans guidance under the weak help of the moon until jaded legs and burdened arms were like branches that droop with their own weight strogue most of all after resting so long at the fountain of the london rock felt need of refreshment beyond the supply and found tumbles less cheerful than tumblers however whenever we could stop to feed he was as brisk as the youngest of the party then usi as i said came round a crag with the light step of a mountaineer and touched me on the elbow i followed him into a piece of thicket and there found our interpreter a man of many accomplishments and perceptive of their value the bearslayer carried a long dull gun of ancient make and heavy substance with the barrel stained by smoke and fire and the carving of the stock turned black waving it proudly he began to speak and what he said was rendered thus though interpretation was growing needless as between his hits and mine i am a man of piety not common among soldiers and never yet heard of among the svans for this cause hath the lord preserved me from wolves and daggers and marva and not only me hath he preserved but also this long pipe of shamyl this instrument of justice renowned for laying low the sinners who have persecuted usi from the blazing of fire and the hands of thieves the almighty hath restored it for a holy purpose i will not boast that now remains for the young man or the coward but i have seen in a dream of the night the proud eyes and the swelling breast laid low i have a scheme of my own devising by which perchance the lord of christians the greatest officer of shamyl and his dear child may keep their breath know you not that the murderers will guard their dungeongate in force and as soon as we assault the valley they will rush in and slay the prisoners of what avail will it be then for us to pour our strength in after them rather let the captain and his brave men lie dark at the mouth of the valley until the chief who hath justice in his eyes is brought forth for the death pronounced meanwhile if there be any man young and strong and fearless to whom the lives of the prisoners are as precious as his own life let him descend and lie hidden in the valley between the murderers and the prisongate with an implement such as i have seen but know not how to handle for it was not discovered in our wartime a firearm which contains the death of four men in close combat also let two men of straight pipesi myself will be one of themlie in the wrinkle of the cliff which is behind the prisongate looking over it and up the valley i know how to get to that hole unseen for every crag is known to me also we two at the crafty minute can lower from the rocks the man who is to hide in the valley if a man can be found bold enough i have spoken to this young son of the west because he is strong and nimble a lover of sur imar also and a worshipper of womankind but if his courage abide not with him to go down into the place of death there is a young lesghian of better courage ready to encounter it but he is not well skilled in firearms with wisdom have i spoken as befits a son of shamyl the danger thus foreseen by the veteran sharpshooter had long been in my thoughts our attack upon the rear of the enemy far away from the dungeon gate would avail the prisoners not a jot and only cause their instant death if the savage horde rushed at them first as their leader would probably command some one must be there to face them at the first signal of the fight for the straight course of the glen which resembled in shape a drawnout horseshoe was nearly a quarter of a mile in length and our appearance at the further end would leave plenty of time to stab those inside but one man hidden in the glen itself and two upon the cliffs above might check the rush for a minute or two until our main force dashed up behind yet to have six rifles on the cliff and six revolvers in the valleyhow much more effectual would that be as well as so much safer is there no room for more than one to lie concealed near the prisongate and for more than two upon the crag above when the interpreter put my question usi shook his head and turned his back upon me as if he cared to hold no further converse with a craven i would go myself he muttered if i had ever been taught to shoot with pipes that are no longer than the honeycomb hearken unto my words i spoke in the style of his own oration o slayer of bears the english heart hath as much endurance and contempt of peril as ever was bred in the lesghian or the untamed svan from this adventure i will not turn back by reason of terror or the love of life do thou consider these things apart while i hold counsel with the captain of brave men fortytwo of us there were in all without counting old kobaduk or the fluent interpreterthe one disabled by length of years the other by prolixity of tongue time had failed us to muster more than twentytwo caucasians and eighteen british miners with strogue and myself to make up the force but a match as we thought for twice that number of ossets or any other savage tribe and we had the advantage of knowing much more about their proceedings than they could know of ours for usi who had left us the day before to search his burned hut for the celebrated gun had made the best of his time in other ways skirting the highlands round the valley at a prudent distance and learning from a goatherds boy what the proceedings of the morrow were to be all these things i put plainly before strogue as the commander of the expedition and he fell in at once with the bearslayers plan while jack nickols as the best rifleshot among us and a firstrate climber volunteered to be usis partner in the dangerous enterprise among the cliffs so we three nickols usi and myself made every preparation we could think of and set off with a quick step right early in advance of the main body in some of his tempers strogue was a very provoking and irritating fellow and he knew it i think or he must have known it whenever he looked at bat strogue in the glass but now i thought more of him than i had ever thought before because he behaved so kindly to me for it must be remembered that i had not always put up with his brag and his cynicism and contempt or pretended contempt of women and many other little ways that rasp the quiet briton let jack nickols go dont you go george he said to me i daresay a dozen times what matter if he gets a prod through the lungs take a lot of gabble out of him if he ever came round again if he didnt one coxcomb the less he does think treble x of himself while you are always so ready to learnits a pleasure to hold a conversation with you and when a man comes to know you george he finds you not half such a fool as he thought that is my experience at any rate although i have seen too much of men to pretend to know much about them but nobody need look twice at you to understand you thoroughly i am wanted here of course but let that cockheaded young nickols go nobody would ever miss him captain i replied with emphasis for i knew that he loved the titleall the more perhaps as being of homegrowthshould i be worthy of your friendship if i allowed a young fellow quite a stranger to the case to undertake my duty well well god bless you i shall never see you alive again but ill make a rare example of the fellow that runs you through dear george i wish i had bought a sixshooter in london however the lord be with you be sure you kill four of them before you drop that sham hafer belongs to me mind after all the tricks he has played me this was not encouraging but there seemed to be no way out of it neither was there any genuine pluck in my volunteering for as a mere question of selfishness dariels life was worth to me a hundredfold as much as mine another thing was that i had never felt sure whether nature had afforded me a decent share of that british pith and presence of mind and calmness of which the father reads in the despatch and says thank god we are not going down the hill yet while the mothers eyes run over and the brother wonders whether he could do the like if the pinch came to his own short ribs some people declare that dreams will tell us when we can remember them what our genuine nature is if so i have been told both ways in some visions running like a niddering in others standing firm as a pyramid and now i found myself quite at a loss although my mind felt firm enough whether the body would toe the mark stand steadfast and act to orders happily there was not much time for dealing with speculative terrors for we had to keep on at a rapid pace to do any good with our ambuscade the sudden snowfall of the sunday morning had not been so heavy on this northern side but the track was very rough and crooked as well as steep and slippery so that nickols and myself were ashamed to find the supple vigour of youth no match for the wiry endurance and practised precision of that ancient mountaineer then at the crown of a terrible defile he looked back and ordered us to lie close while he crept down a narrow channel flanked with trickling combs of snow we were glad to have a breathing time and nickols proposed a quiet smoke but i would not hear of it for the vaporous curls might be seen from below wonderful old buffer jack whispered with his hand to his mouth i believe he could outwalk us both i shall take to bears grease when i grow old but i would like to shoot a match with him for his best bearskin if the amazon has not burned them all by george i shouldnt like to be that lady though with the long pipe bearing upon me have you seen how his eyes flash and his lips twitch at the very name of that woman i do believe he has arranged all this for his private satisfaction but there goes the signal we are to creep on carefully mind you dont send a stone down hill taking our caps off and stooping low so as not to jut out against the skyline we descended the shallow seam of rock until we stood in a stony and briary hollow as long and as wide as a sawpit at the further end brown usi lay flat on his breast and peered securely through a wattle of budding bush into the depth of the glen below we joined him and found ourselves in full command of the whole of the savage solemnity a heavy stone chair was planted near the middle of the valley with a black tent just behind it on either side about a dozen dirty but distinguished greybeards were squatting upon blocks of granite wearing the sheepskin headdress and the smock with fluted crossbelt and holding long white rods as if in trial or in council there was no one in the high chair as yet but a young attendant stood on guard smoothing now and then the pile of leopardskin thrown over it further up the valley i could see a lot of osset warriors lounging in their usual way some even squatting down and smoking and scarcely any two dressed alike reckless fellows and rough as wolvesit was difficult to count them but at a guess i set them down as from eighty to a hundred gallant men no doubt but looking better trained to rob than fight take it all in shape it all to know every inch of it in your mind jack nickols whispered kindly now is your time george cranleigh it may save your life when it comes to the rush did you ever see anything more lovely very fine for the fellows who are safe up here i answered less politely and knowing without advice of his how much i had to think of but even in that nervous state one could not behold without thinking about it the strange way in which the hand of nature had cut and shaped and almost furnished a theatre of the mountains here the sides of the glen were of yellow rock or rather perhaps of a dun colour nowhere less than a hundred feet in sheer height or beetling over while the level spread of the bottom was like a frame drawn by a tapestryworker soft and rich and tissued smoothly only of the brightest green shot here and there with play of gold like a carpet woven of lycopod usi said that the people told him snow would never lie down here neither would any coarse weed grow but only moss and the dews of heaven for magnanimous heroes who slept below and he said that the grey rocks standing forth at the broad end we looked down upon were tombstones which had sprung like mushrooms where the captains of those heroes lay imar and the lovely maiden he said as he struck his heel on rock and nickols told me what he meant are a hundred feet beneath us now if you could drive an iron down it would pierce the roof above their heads but lo one man has been slain already condemned in the holy weeks and kept till now a traitor and an extortioner by the black stake driven through him the corpse is out of sight from the judgment yard though i can see it plainly by the dress he was of the western races such as you yourselves are but a small man weak and of no account perhaps an english slave purchased for his own use by hisar now see my son where that horn of rock stands forth when the wise men put their heads together by this rope we will let thee down if trembling cripple not thy strong limbs the fighting men will not behold thee because of the folding of the crag the heads of men that are white with wisdom will be bowed into that of the wealthiest while they whisper to one another death and the woman will abide unseen within the tent therefore do thou quickly thus as soon as thy feet are on the moss cut the rope stop not to untie it fall on thy breast and crawl into that holemy finger shows it nowwhere slab of stone leans unto stone and the body of a large heart may lie hidden i saw it in the twilight before they caught me but like a fool i went not in within twenty yards thou wilt see the iron bars where sur imar will be shackled to receive the death keep thy head below the brim even as the salesman scrimps his bushel and thine eyes as deep as his when he seemeth to heed nothing thine own strong head and heart will guide thee when it comes to stabbing at the sight or the sound of thy downstroking we will shoot and the captains force will rush up the valley bear in mind that thou hast chosen this and death comes only once to man and by the god on high thou shalt be avenged on the wicked men that slay thee this ought to have been warm comfort to me according to all great writers and the general practice of mankind but it failed to kindle one fibre of my system and i dropped my eyes that the heartless slayer of many bears and men thrice as many might not behold the affliction in them which he would be sure to take amiss it was not terror i would wish to think so much as pity for my father and dear mother and grace and harold and the farm and the horses and the dogs i loved and most of all for dariel also a good deal for myself who went hand in hand with her in every thought of mine but the less i thought and felt the better for the time was now to act we crept unseen to the spur of rock which usi had called a horn and there they made the rope fast around my chest and i passed a handkerchief round the breech of my revolver and slung my kinjal and toorak securely for i had taken kindly to that native weapon made of the long horn of a mountaingoat laden with lead and bound with leather then at the proper moment when the judges or the jurywhichever they werehad gathered in a ring to consummate their farce from the lip of the cliff i was let down softly and lowered so skilfully in the buttress corner of a crag that i reached the bottom with both feet ready and only a little skin gone from my thumbs there i cut the rope and fell flat among the moss which grew to the very plinth of cliff and wormed my way with the slab for a screen until i dived into the hole at its base here i rubbed my knees which had received a bruise or two and began with great caution to survey the scene for the little pit into which i had crawled was scarcely more than a yard in depth but protected at the top by a smaller slab of stone which rested with a wide slope against the upright rock as the spur of a wooden fence is reared above the ground and splayed against the post to steady it at the lip of my refuge a grey plant grew with woolly leaves something like mullein and although it had not got much growth yet it afforded me precious shelter when i raised my head to peep around for it partly closed the threecornered gap between the upright and the sloping stone it is not in my power to make a list of all that i saw being in so quick a terror but the things that i was able to twist my neck to were enough to make me sorry for the colour of my hair in the buttend of the cliff which i had just dropped down i beheld a wide door of dark metal and the gleam of it was more of bronze than iron what the metal truly was no man would stop to ask himself but rather stand in wonder and be overcome by the solid mass and magnitude and the strength of ancient times all the sons of caucasus might have come together and done their very best for a centuryif nature allowed them such length of strengthbut even with the genoese smiths to help them they could never have built such a door as that a door i call it though i may be wrong others would take it for a gate perhaps but being all in one plane and flat and having no frame in sight to me it was a door and a marvellous door beyond our power to make or even to break open on either side of it were two long loopholes like the lancetwindows in our church at home but carved in the solid rock too narrow for even a child to squeeze his little shoulders through and i knew that in the chambers quarried thus by roman steel eighteen centuries ago waiting for their doom were the chief whom i admired and the lady whom i loved there was nothing more to be made of that not even a sign that sur imar knew what the savages outside were doing but as i thought of him labouring for years girding up the slack folds of a life from which all the gladness of the world was gone simply for the benefit of these wretchesgenuine indignation filled me and i longed to shoot a tribe of them this it was and no true courage which enabled me to regard the whole with a calm heart and a solid head like the oak which is our emblem chapter lv at the bar how long those ragged elders carried on with their pretence of trial is beyond my power to say i only know that my joints began to stiffen with cramp and to ache with crush and my brain to hum like a factory wheel even the relief of descrying usi or jack nickols on the bristly brow of cliff a hundred feet over the dungeongate was more than they dared to afford me now though i tried to persuade myself once or twice that i espied the glint of metal there neither was there sound or sign of life within the rocky jail so far as watchful eyes and ears could learn while the cackle of the greybeards some fifty yards behind me resembled a drone of bagpipes enlivened by a cherryclapper at last i beheld a stately woman advance from the cover of the private tent and take her seat in the chair of law to receive the verdict of her puppets then some hypocritical farce ensued as if she were shocked and pleaded with them and mourned to find them so inexorable my heart burned within me and my fingers tingled to pull trigger at some of them such a fierce and dirty lot were they but i said to myself let hisar come the fellow that broke the lovebirds leg then as if the scene that could not be avoided was unfit for such gentle eyes the princess with a bow of resignation retired into the sable tent i lay close and drew my head in while four or five of the fighting men followed the hoary villain who had acted as chiefjustice to the door of heavy metal sunk in the dark embrasure of the cliff the old man drew forth a key as long as a toastingfork and much bigger and with brawny arms thrusting in both directions and a screech as if from wounded rock the valves of the door slid back into their bed as the damper of a furnace slides but one broad bar of metal spanned the opening horizontally about five feet above the iron threshold the osset warriors stooped their white headdresses under this heavy bar and disappeared in the gloom inside that they would not slay their prisoners there i knew from usi and from stepans tales presently they appeared again with a figure in the verge of sunlight towering over their woolly gleam i saw sur imars noble face as calm as when he smiled on me and blessed me with his daughter his hands were roped behind his back his silvery curls uncovered and his broad white chest laid naked except that the red cross hung upon it in which he wore some of his dead wifes hair two of the men stretched spears behind him as if he would shrink from the steps of death but he walked as if he were coming to welcome some expected visitor bowed his head without a word and laid his breast against the bar there they cast a broad shackle round him and made it fast behind his back while a pompous dotard stood forth the door and read or made believe read the verdict of his brother idiots as he finished my pistol muzzle lay true upon the foremost of them the man who first put hand to kinjal would never have put it to his mouth again then to my surprise they all withdrew cackling in their crocksaw throats while that old fiend showed his gums like a rattrap grinning through his rheumy scrub and the sound of tongues up the valley ceased and the blowing of horns and the shrilling of fifes and the only thing that i could hear was the slow beat of a sheepskin drum to call the savages to the death and the rapid thumps of my own heart listening for the fatal step i fixed my eyes once more upon the bound and helpless victim perhaps to reduce his wellknown strength or to lower his high courage the affectionate sister had kept in his body just life enough to last till he should be killed his ribs stood forth and his cheeks were meagre and the eyes looked worn and sunken but there was not a sign of fear or flinching no twitch or quiver in the smooth white forehead and not so much as a palpitation in the broad breast laid against the bar like a fool i raised my hand a little and tried to attract his notice but he kept his calm gaze towards his foes until a low heartbroken wail from an inner cell of the caverned rock told of a sorrow beyond his own then for a moment he turned his head and spoke some words of comfort perhaps or of love and long farewell to the one who could not come to him or perhaps not even hear him and i hoped in the lord of mercy that she could not see her father at the thought of that possibility even hot as i was my blood ran cold could any woman exist who would set such a sight before a woman suddenly a glow of deep amazement shone in imars haggard eyes with a wrench of his mighty frame he shook the steel bar like a ribbon the shackles on his chest gave way a little and his grand face issued from the gloom of granite into the testimony of the sun then the strong aspect and vivid linesas firm as the cliff to confront their doomrelaxed and softened and grew bright as if memory forgot its age and went back upon its years to have a play with tender visions oria come at last he cried with a smile to tempt her nearer my oria sent to call me home the god who has done this for me will take care of my daughter before him stoodbetwixt him and me although i had heard no footstepsa tall young figure in a long white robe timid as a woman and as graceful but with supple strength quivering for the will to man it on the left hip hung a heavy sword but the right hand had fallen away from the hilt and the shoulders lay back with the sudden arrest my son my son it is just cried imar slay me as i slew thy mother then the shackled man turned his head away that his eyes should make no plea for him and natures dread could be seen in nothing but the quiver of his long arched throat but the young man stood as if carved in stone with both arms stretched to his father unable to take another step unable to do anything but wonder but betwixt their gaze a dark form leaped quivering with fury and wild for blood too ravenous for slaughter to have formed a proper plan of it and this was a very lucky thing for me for while he danced between them thus with his hateful face on fire in the voluptuous choice of murder there was time for me to leap out of my hole and get my cramped limbs flexible not a moment however for any kind of thought and whatever i did was of instinct what it was i know not nor does anybody else it can only be told in a whirl as it befell hisar i think made a jump at hafer before he saw me and smacked his face as if he had been a child and tried to snatch his sword but was thrust back and then drew his own and flew with it at the shackled imars heart but another was therethank the lord in heaveni caught the flame of hisars eyes on mine as his blade went straight for imars breast and dashed it into splinters with my toorak then he hurled the stump at me drew his kinjal and sprang as if he were made of wings at my breast i stepped aside quicker than i ever moved at cricket and as he passed me he ran against so hearty a whack upon his wicked temples that no more sin was concocted there down he went like a thistle at the ploughshare and threw up his long legs and lay dead with a tuft of bloody moss between his teeth i took the stump of his sword which had struck me in the breast and cut sur imar free and hurried him inside for he was lost as in a vision and stood with my revolver in the doorway ready for the onset of the fighting men these being taken with astonishment hung back as if they had none to lead them until the great lady appeared from the tent to receive the tidings of her brothers death marva came forth in her majestic manner having turned away her face perhaps with sisterly compunction sweeping her black robe along the ground and framing her handsome features to the proper expression of regret now the desire of her life was won paramount of the eastern ossets and the western lesghians quit of the brother who had thwarted her and his son whom she had stolen for revenge and guile nothing remained but to make her own son the heirfor he was born in wedlock though not of itmarry him to the lesghian heiress and herself enjoy all the power and the wealth while he took his pleasure in the western world she despised all the ignorance and superstition round her too loftily to act down to it and perhaps looked down upon herself a little as she took her seat in the chair of stone none the less she did it with a royal air more impressive to us from a woman than from man to recover my breath and be ready i drew back in the shadow of the prison entrance where hafer was standing by his prostrate father and much as i longed to see all that happened for the moment i was out of it not that i should have been much wiser even in the midst of them knowing nothing of the osset tongue which sounds like a chorus of bullfrogs bagpipes pigs under a harrow a cock in the roup and a hooter at the junction even when the men are calm and keep the women silent however those who understood them tell me that they reported thus oh lofty lady mother of thy tribe widow of the great prince rakhan the sentence hath been given according to thy will and carried out even as the heaven hath decreed wise men speak not of any will of mine whatever hath been done is good and righteous to establish justice and avenge the wrong the barb of the arrow of the lord flies straight never can it fail by any crookedness of men yet the great prince who has fallen was the nearest of all flesh to me i will be content with your testimony i cannot gaze upon him butbut we know not how to say it so as to mingle truth with pleasure oh lofty lady it is not our enemy imar of the kheusurs who is dead rather is it sorrowful indeed for us to speak would that the lord had made us liars when he hath cast the truth into the breast of evil wise men what is it or am i to call you fools if ye could not even execute your own decree aright it is no deed of ours it is a spirit from the tombs the tombs that were made before the world itself let the high lady come and see she was girding up her long robe while they spoke and the jewels on her shapely feet flashed forth with a gesture of disdain she waved the old men back but a score of wild warriors followed her as she strode towards the dungeon to see her brothers corpse instead of that she stood before the body of her son and a loud shriek proved that she was still a woman from the gloom of my shelter i saw her proud eyes aghast and her arms thrown up and her tall form quivering then she controlled herself and looked around to weep byandbyto avenge him first she shouted as they told me afterwards and such is the power of anothers passion that i felt like a murderer and went forth with an impulse of shame to surrender myself for i had never slain a man till now idiot get back cried a voice from the cliff the voice no doubt of jack nickols slay himshoot all of you shoot shoot slay him the lady called out and herself seized a gun shoot him though it be through my own body this order was beyond my understanding but i saw at least a score of muzzles looking at me and i had not even the wit to move which will first reach me the sound or the bullets that i should thus ponder shows clearly enough that fear had overcome all sense of terror now then cut it short i said according to jack nickolsthough i cannot remember a word of itand the fellows were surprised and drew their clumsy fingers back and went down on their knees with superstition but the princess marva drew near to me and the butt of a gun was against her hip she saw that i stood unarmed and nerveless and she could not help playing with the joy of her revenge to be shot by a woman i had no power left i could only stare and wait for it but i know him i recognise my dear friend she exclaimed in french while she fingered the trigger with the muzzle not two yards from my breast it is the gentleman desirous of my emeralds ah thou shalt have them how many ten to prolong my agony she began to count with glittering eyes and a courteous smile tapping my time on the trigger and would you believe that i could not stir and could only keep my gaze fixed on her then as she cried seven a white spot leapedas it seemed to mefrom the palpitant surge of her bosom her dark robe opened and her musket dropped as the roar of a gun rang overhead and the princess sank with her lips still smiling as dead as a stone into lowborn arms usi the svan hath his revenge a shrill cry from the crags proclaimed wolfs meat hath choked the queen of wolves fear fell on all of us as if the sky had opened and the warriors grounded their guns upon the moss and crowded round one who had an image on his breast then with one accord they began a mournful howl of a quality to come from the bowels of the earth or send all her inhabitants into them my presence of mind was restored by this and with scarcely a wound i leaped back into my shelter recovered my weapons and determined to die hard chapter lvi hard is the fight what right had i to be out of breath after standing stockstill no one knows how long like a cardboard dummy to be shot at but there seemed to be a hollow where my heart in its duty should have been staunch and steadfast and my brain having never been wrought up like this must have lost its true balance and standard otherwise could it have shocked me to know that a career of cruelty and wickedness was brought to an ignominious close marva is dead i kept on saying the greatest woman of the age is dead not the best not the purest not even a true woman but how grand was her attitude and how she disdained me and now a wretched svan has shot her let any one despise me as he likes with reason on his tongue and humanity in his eyes for the world at large it might be better to have such a woman stretched beneath the turf but a man with his heart in the right placewhich the muzzle of her musket knew too wellcould not help feeling for her grandeur however it was not for me to lay down the law or even to stand up for it against this crew of savages to keep out of their way was my one desire and at first there seemed to be some chance of it with their leader a corpse and superstition frowning at them from the dungeongate hoping thus i stood back in a niche of granite while a bullet or two sang along the vault and i strove to recover the spirit of a man by thinking of my country and the luck we have in turning the corner of situations where others would lie down and breathe their last the bar to which sur imar had been bound was still in place but he was not in sight neither could i see his son the gentle youth sent to assassinate him then i heard the sound of heavy blows and concluded that the younger man was striving to release his sister while the father lay halfconscious still from brutal cruelty and want of food there was none but myself to guard the entrancefor usi and nickols had not appeareduntil our friends at the valleys mouth should have time to come to the rescue glad was i to think as i did at first that the savage warriors scared and puzzled and without a leader would now hang back as they had done when the lesghian chief brought their prince rakhan to account and so it would have been by their own confession but for the ferocity of one young man karkok the brother of lura and the chief friend of that hisar whom i had struck down karkok cannot have been stirred up by love or loyalty or any other noble motivefor who could have regretted hisarbut by ambition of the meanest sort and a dash at the mastery of the tribe for he was now the last relative of rakhan this upstart fellow brought the fighting men together and they laid aside the bodies of queen marva and her son in fear of their being trampled on and then with a screech that must have set all the teeth of the flintiest echo aching at the prisongate they rushed and the valves being back there was only my poor body between them and the helpless inmates when i saw those fellows advancing upon me capering and flinging hairy arms about and tossing white sheepskins and flourishing long muskets beyond any denial i was frightened and would have given every penny i was worth to be in my own little saddleroom once more my hand shook so badly that the blue revolver revolved without any mechanism and the prudence which has been implanted in us all suggested that the bravest man must value his own bacon when a friend assures me that i was gloriously brave it would be a rude thing to contradict him but what a different tale my conscience tells in a word just presence of mind enough was left me to show that i must fight it out to make a bolt of it was useless for whither could i go anywhere across the cave would bring a bullet into me and as for slinking along the dark wall where would that take me even if i could contrive it into the very arms of dariela truly sweet refuge but not for a coward all i could do was to say to myself that the lines were hard but the lord had made them so and i must trust in him to deliver me whether it were faith or sense of justice or the love of woman or something far lower than any of these the brute element inborn in the sons of menno sooner did i see hateful eyes agoggle with lust for blood glaring at me and great mouths agrin for a grab at me than the like spirit kindled in myself blood you shall have but it shall be your own first i shouted in english and leaped at them from the mouth of the cave like the demon of kazbek they took me for that great power and fell back while a ball slit the tip of my ear off and before they could rally there were two as dead as stones with bullets in their heads and two more fell upon them with their skulls cracked by the swing of my toorak want any more i asked having two charges left and many of them showed the better part of valour but a kinjal was thrown at me down a lane of cowards and stuck in my breast and that rallied the crowd three or four made at me from behind and i know not how it was but down i went from a terrible whack on the back of my head at the very same moment that i shot their new chief a very lucky shot and one that governed all the issue but of that i knew nothing until weeks had passed my latest sense being of a white flash across me and a plunge into a bottomless abyss of some one who might be anybody there let him lay as a great poet saysand never would he have stood up again if his skull had been of norman growth but a mighty champion just in time had rushed into the thick of it and scattered a storm of swordflash as the lightning fires a forest two ruffians poised for the final stab at my defenceless body swung backward with their arms chopped off and the blade that should have drained sur imars blood revelled in the gore of his enemies for the fury of the mild and gentle hafer now that he had learned his wrongs and guessed his fathers swooped on those sheepclad fiends as a whirlwind leaps upon a dryingground of tallow candles would that i had only kept sufficient sense to see for they tell me that it was magnificent heads that are full of hate should have some of it let out and several of the worst were stopped for ever from receiving any more misanthropy all who knew anything about it said that rakhabat himself the worst manhater of all the demons of kazbek was seen to come down with the wings of a black eagle and enter the vesture of the white lambangel that was the osset name for this poor prince and now having broken bounds he proved the irony of his claim to it for soon the chiefjustice of the court went down and so did the foreman of the jury and a pair of clerks who sought nothing but their living and others who had come to see things out without any view to their own exit among them raged hafer like hector of troy with twenty years and more than that of goodness to let out and no man could shoot straight at him because he was in the right while all their guns were crooked nevertheless the force of numbers must have been too great for himfor the conscience of ossets still requires to be formedbut for the rapid and resistless charge of stepan and strogue and the lesghians and the miners down the long valley and over the moss reeking already with more blood than it could staunch at the same moment usi the svan and jack nickols who had been hampered by some tangle of the rope shouting to their comrades fell in upon the flank and the noble tribe of ossets or at any rate that branch of it split up and fell asunder like an unroped fagot there can be no certainty of justice in this world but even the races connected with them by the tenderest ties of corobbery found it in their hearts when the facts could not be altered to pronounce the only verdictserved them right chapter lvii but not in vain in recounting my little adventuresas i am begged sometimes to doupon coming to this particular part my general practice is to stop as if i had no more to say whereas it is only that i want to know in which of the persons concerned my friends appear to take most interest and to my pride more perhaps than to my credit their first question always is not what became of you george but what became of dariel and that is more than i could tell for many a long day afterwards when the door of her cell was beaten in she came forth as in a dream or trance without any wonder or fear or question possessed by one purpose aloneto share the fate of her dear father in the gloom of the tunnelled rock she glanced at the tall form of her brother but the light even there was enough to show that this was not the one she wanted and he having reason from very early days to give a wide berth to the feminine form drew aside gladly for a strange young lady to go her way without compressing him for this young fellow prince origen the son of imar and oria the child who escaped by his fall into the drift when marvas genuine hafer perished being substituted for him and brought up with plenty of chastisement and strict privations and a candid absence of affection had never been encouraged to think or act or even to feel for his poor young self what then could be expected of him when in a moment at one blow the whole of his world was cut from beneath him his own identity plucked away and not even a quiet corner left for considering who he was or how he came to be in such a case is it surprising that his head went round so rapidly that he might fairly be said to have lost it instead of attending to his newfound father he had simply stood staring at the prostrate form till moans of despair from that inner cell were brought to his ear by the chilly draughts of rock thereupon he rushed in and while i kept the entrance he used his great strength to such purpose that his unknown sister glided past him and hurried to their unconscious father and truly it was a great mercy for me as well as a glory to this grand young fellow that instead of waiting longer where he was not wanted he ran out at once to obtain fresh air and get some light shed upon so many marvels rapid action and muscular exertion for which he found ample cause at once probably saved him from congestion of the brain and certainly saved me from perforation of the heart for why should i make light of my defeats any more than extol my victories which latter it would be hard to do by reason of their nonentity those ossets had performed an exploit declared to be impracticable by all the bravest sons of wykeham during my generation that is to say they had cracked my skull which was not a piece of biscuit china but of solid and heavy metal sounder i trow than its contents and those who have studied the subject tell me that the thicker the pot is which nature has provided for our poor brains to boil in the more ticklish the job is to make good the splinters what tinker can patch an enamelled saucepan and a queer saucepan must our brainpan be if after all the smut shed round it and the slow smoke under it any steam of selfconceit still has a puff to lift the cover let any man who thinks himself a wonder get a bit of his skull too small perhaps for a chick to pick up for the good of his gizzard crumbled in upon the brain he is so proud of and if he has the luck to meet with a friend who can get it out again when he comes to know his own name once more will he count it worth remembering but as for myselfbecause perhaps i had never thought wonders of ittrouble beyond belief was needful ever to make it sound again when i came to know the factsas i did at lastit may appear a singular result but as true as i sat up in bed the salt tears ran into my soup so fast that they had to give me another basin not through any weakness as an illnatured man might fancy but just because i was so happy to come home to a world where loving folk were living and people better than myself who wished to keep me with them perhaps i ought not to talk about it and yet it seems shabby and ungrateful not to say how much they had done for me here was my sister grace together with her husband jackson stoneman rushing from the honeycomb of their blue moon among the soft italian lakes into the horrid caucasus and bringing with them by telegraph to surrey that wonderfully clever dr hopmann to whose skill i owe it that my reason was restored as good as ever it was before and perhaps even better for when it came back it had slept in the dew of humility but the doctors humility was not increased neither deserved it so to be because the most eminent physician at tiflis a frenchman of vast renown being called in at once by my host sur imar had pronounced all surgical operation futile and declared that the owner of that battered brain might linger on for weeks until inflammation kindled but could never be better than an imbecile even if he failed to satisfy science by ending as a raving madman shorge my poy were the first words passed by my ears into any superior part now you let your tongue comevery slowly put a good soup at the back of him then put him in his house quietly and go to shleep again but you havent finished cooking the partridges yet and i want to have the one that is over this cupidity might scarcely seem to prove the possession of high intellect yet hopmann declares that the noblest utterance has never afforded him so fine a moral zat frenchman vot he know to talk so quick no fear for a prain with a memory like zat shorge they kill bairds all the year round here go to shleep while i cook you four bartriches for another week he took good care to keep me in a state of body which wanted no motion of the mind inside it nor even any quick heartaction except at the sight of a knife and fork but i feel ashamed to say how long the disabled body was the lord of all and the nobler elements of our existence were not allowed even to speak to it i have dishpelled his shister and his sweetheart off i heard dr hopmann say to some one whom i could not see after he had attended to my straps one day vot they want i tell you no i let you help because you not care his leetle prain stand nothing yet but i do care because it was all through me the reply was in a sweet low voice as i caught a glimpse of a fair young lady dressed in black and retiring towards the door you may have got rid of his sister doctor but there is one you will never get rid of so you may just as well give it up how much longer and i am sure it would do him good why only yesterday i knew ach you be off i am ze master here we are not in england where ze vimmen rule the roast the lady departed hastily as if she had found that overtrue while the german bolted the heavy door and came back with a grin on his solid ruddy face am i never to see any one again i muttered for gratitude does not flourish and abound with a man who has spent two months on his back nobody but a confounded german who bolts everybody out zat is shoost vot i vant to hear shorge zat proves how you come round if you say dank you tochtor hopmann you have saved my life i shall never forget it how can i ever hope to recompensh you then i know that your prain is very weak not fit for healthy englishmans at all but when you call him a confounded sherman he know he see that the nation have come up which is the most obstinate of nature not to die all the same you lie down again the world go on very well without you shorge it came into my head that this was not quite right and that as an honest man i ought to try to stop it but torpor overpowered my sense of justice as it has a right to do when the case is not our own i only want to know who that lady was i mumbled zat gal was nothing of your concerns hopmann replied as he sat down by the table and began to rub some cake tobacco he had sliced little english fraeulein of the name of pezzeril zat bad feloe you knock worse than they knock you bring her from england with a heap of lies and make sham to marry her then he throw her off and drive long black stick through her brother because he haf desire of too moosh money englishmans often make mishtakes zat way but i want to know about some one else somebody different altogether somebody who never thinks of money ach zen what fool can it be sometimes leetle gal not think of money but boys do vimmen do men obliged to follow zem nonsense doctor the men set the example but you know well enough what i want to know i want to know where i am and all about it the german came over and looked at me and turned up one of my eyelids and then did the same to the other while he blew his smoke over his shoulder and then he said no fear shorge you are a brick and your prain go the way to belong to him one leetle drop i give you shoost to clear both ears and zen i tell you everyzing o doubledyed villain with my usual faith i accepted and made the most of his kind offering and when i awoke again where was he perhaps in a boat at the mouth of the rion listening for the millwheels of a paddlesteamer to grind the slow grit of distance for a telegram had reached karthlos that the vegetable earl the good melladew lay at the last twist of our mortal coil internal through travail on a bicycle with a county council lecturer who had taken crabapples to be synonymous with crabs when this abandonment was first brought home to me my behaviour was not what it should have been we are all too apt to suppose ourselves neglected and doubly so when the system has been lowered and the action of the heart restricted to my shame i confess that a miserable pessimismsuch as manhood should scorn on its own behalf even without higher thoughts to lead itinvaded and began to vanquish me what is the good of anything all nature is cruelty all life a curse every one for himself and for none of us a god bitterness and contempt of mankind and a reckless fight for ones own handthose are the only solid things black destiny has left us there is no choice before us as for sense of duty or the stuff we call honour or patriotism or the absurdity called love my dear young friend my directions are precise and i cannot depart from them you may talk as much as you like about flowers or food or sport or the hills and valleys or anything in fact that you know anything about and while you do that you may refresh yourself and grow stronger and stronger with these good things here sur imar who had risen from behind a curtain pointed to a table which was laden with fine import of exceedingly attractive fragrance on the other hand if you insist upon wandering into difficult and unpleasant subjects which no man has ever yet made head or tail of my orders are to anticipate the inevitable injury to the poor head and enfeebled system by prompt administration of these two doses my host laid his hands upon a large flat bottle nearly full but with room below the cork to shake up a profoundity of horrors at the bottom and a box of pills as big as bullets but before he could approach me my heart and stomach and every other organ that can influence opinion underwent a fundamental change i did not mean it you must make allowance only think of what has been done to me sur imar you are not a small minded man you can see how a fellow gets driven to sing out emptiness must bear a great deal of the blame i entreat you to look at the matter largely i am ready to vow that the world is good and everything contained in it exceptexcept that bottle and that box hasty conversions are not worth much but from you george we accept anything i hope to confirm you in the better faith with these little proofs that the world produces one or two things not entirely bad and after that somebodywell never mind unless you are inclined to be amiable the chief was now in full lesghian dress a very magnificent affair to look at stately and graceful and impressive but he proved himself worthy of apparel even grander by putting away all disrelishing sights and waiting upon me like a hospital nurse until i could compass not a dainty morsel more and then he said shut your eyes and perhaps you will have a little dream was it a little dream if so i pray you tell me of a great one expecting nothing i lay back upon the quiet pillows quite content as young men arefor age destroys that comfortto fancy that the world is good and governed by a gentle lord who waves a hand when we drop our eyes that we may try to look up again when the pride of strength is crushed and violence of the will lies low and a man is able to take himself at his proper insignificance sometimes a little flow of calm glides in upon his nature so that all is soft and bright and his undulations multiply the silver and gold of heaven for behold as i was gazing with a sweet and tranquil wonder caring not to enquire even where i was or who i was but taking as it came to me the goodwill of the time and welcome of the friendly airbehold there came as it were a vision not to be enquired into but accepted with the smiles of sleep the form and face that had never left methough never could i see them clearlythe presence without which my own presentment was all absence it was not for me to be certain yet played with as i had been by visions that cry advantage of the brain when even a pennyweight thereof is gone neither was i clear enough to indulge in bright aerial doubt as adolescent genius may all i knew was here i am and nature needed no more proof when i had given myself a substantial pinch is there any one here or there at all i seemed to say but could not be sure of uttering or thinking anything then as sure as i am sitting here this day the last thing that ever i could have believed was done concerning me and to me dariel came and i knew nothing except that here was dariel i feared to look direct or even glance as if i meant it being now little more than a lump of patches with gingery tufts among them and fool enough in my heart to think that love would be ashamed of me i cannot say another word to teach any one who does not know or do good to one who does at such a time is there any man or even any woman who notices the tint of cheeks the curve of lips and eyebrows the guidance of the breath or even the quick and tremulous enquiries and lingering watches of the eye my love was looking at me thus with a sad and piteous misgiving whether there might be any hope that i was large of heart as she wasfor now she felt it tremblingand yet with some cold arm of pride and maiden fear thrown round it to hold it back from being offered till it had been asked for and i was looking at my love with nothing but abasement that anything i had ever done could make her feel afraid of me and yet with some victorious hope that it was because she loved me yes i do i do she said as if she saw the very thing i wanted to be sure of with all my heart i do but how shall i make you believe it after all that i have done how can you ever believe it this made me look about and wonder for all i wanted was her voiceto listen to its soft sweet tones and feel that it was full of kindness and know that it was meant for me and then to see the smile perhaps that came so often with her words and never failed to follow them if ever they forgot themselves you are not to me as you were you think me of no value now because i have not been as true and obstinate of truth against all signs and symptoms and testimony as an english lady would have been if you have in your mind decided so to estimate me there is nothing more for me to say only that you must not think because you will not let me show it that i am base enough not to feel the wonderful things you have done for us for me it is nothing for i am not worth it but for my father and my brother and for stopping cruel wickednessand now they have nearly killed you so that you do not even know me she had tried to make her meaning clear by keeping herself a good way off and looking at the mountains more than me and speaking as if her words came one by one from some typewriter until the thought of my mishap and long disablement brought her near then i saw how she was trembling and withdrawing her hands to hide it and striving to make her eyelids proof against the shower inside them with that the power of my love arose and i said dariel look at me it is impossible any more after all that i have done even while she spoke she did the impossible thing to such effect that i partook of the miracle it seemed to me as i met that soft deep gaze of boundless love and hope as if heaven had now so gifted and endowed me with the richest wealth that humble as my powers were henceforth i could do anything i am afraid i am afraid she whispered as she saw my joy love of my heart it is not right that you should care for me any more it is right for me to love you and to be your slave for ever but for you to hate me to hate the dariel you loved once because she so requited you here you have been worse than dead worse than dead for weeks and weeks after saving all our lives through whom through me that could not trust you but measured you by my paltry self but now i know all from that sly traitor who sent the letter to her wicked brother alas how wicked i am too when he is dead and sheoh george i ought to hate her but i cannot because of her misfortunes tell me george do you feel like that do you feel that you ought to hate me because i have destroyed your poor poor mind well perhaps i shall when you have done it but not till then my dariel and i think that dariel owes me something for her compliment to my intellect hush my orders are to keep you perfectly quiet and stupid i like that very much because it appears so soft and easy but i must not take advantagehush you want to talk it is not right she laid one sweet soft finger on my lips and when i closed them obedience had its due reward such as is well known to those who have been true and faithful through every doubt and trouble to the one they love better than themselves i am the master now she said and i shall make the love to you and you will have to put up with it because you are so helpless and because i have robbed you of all chance of doing it to me when you could but one thing i shall insist uponyou must not want to know anything about yourself or even me or anything that you can think of until your poor mind restores itself then i said a thing worthy of tom erricker i will leave myself in dariels hands if she will take me into her arms sometimes being so treated i should have shamed england among races who think well of her if i had allowed a mere knock on the head to dwell too much upon my mind strogue came to look at me and spoke with his usual lofty confidence my son you have done well and wisely i fell among a tribe on the borders of thibet who make a point of taking out a piece about the size of half a crown from the skull of every strong male infant the folly of the earth goes out and the wisdom of the air comes in according to their traditions but i was not allowed to verify their views and i found more vigour than wisdom there for they kicked me over their border but you may hope the best who knows you may begin to say something good at last and we shall know how you got it this was all very well for him who had not received a single scratch and was living now in clover let good friends try things for themselves and comfort us with their own distress optimism is a lovely gift and comes direct from heaven chiefly when the sun shines on ourselves but strogue never listened to argument you are the luckiest fellow he proceeded that i have ever come across here you have had your sister crying over you for days and days putting her husband on the shelf although he is made of money and then the best doctor in the world the only one that ever did any good and now you have the loveliest girl ever seen waiting upon you hand and foot and more than all without a bit of pain without even knowing it you are made a wise man for the rest of your life at the age of sixandtwenty stop out here my boy stop out here your father will have heaps of money now from your brothers grand discovery sur imar has made up his mind to keep farmer george for the coffeegrowing you can shoot all sorts of mountain game and people the terek and the kur with salmon and winter at tiflis or patigorsk as yet i was not in a clear condition to care where i was or even to enquire at all about it so long as the one my whole heart looked for came for it to dwell with every day but gradually i know not how and probably none can tell me a power almost as strong as love of the finest and sweetest of our kind began to grow in my heavy nature everything is now explained even when a man knocks his brother on the head as a piece of hereditary tendency to enter that plea appears to me to cast an ungraceful reproach upon those who have gone before us and done their best according to their lights which we disparage and without receiving any credit for the wonderful goodness we derive from them let me blame no one but myself for that unreasonable pining and hankering for my native land look at the glory of the sky look at the mountains and the woods several people said to me who never looked twice at them when they could smell their dinner look at the grand peaks robed with snow can you see anything like that in england no but i can feel the things i see there i used to answer meekly there may be little grandeur in them but i love the things i know moreover it came into my jarred and worried mind that the gentle satisfactionthe only solid form ever taken by human happinessis seldom or perhaps never to be found when nature is too great around us we see perpetual change of form and colour and a fleeting majesty and possibly our puny selves are incited to hopeless rivalry or even if there be nought in that the sense of danger and wild elements and powers altogether beyond our control is at enmity with placid thought and the quiet course of duties so that it is a sweeter thing at any rate for an englishman to watch the plough on a gentle slope or the cows in a meadow with their hind legs spread ready for the milkingpail or the harvestwaggon coming to the rick than to gaze at all the rugged grandeur of the alps or caucasus my dear friend sur imar said when i tried to make him see it so you were not born here but i was and that makes all the difference i see no more of majesty or menace or sublime oppression when i look at a peak growing up against the sky than you find in a tall poplartree and behold how calm is your captain strogue a man of the world who takes nothing amiss because he has no strict sense of right he will do what he thinks honourable which every man judges by his own sidelights forgive me sur imar for speaking so you have your own standard and you keep to it and it is as much higher than mine as kazbek is than a surrey hill there you are wrong he answered gently the proof is always in the practice and i am proving myself as selfish and as thoroughly ungrateful as if i had always been prosperous george you know too well what i mean through you alone and your wonderfulit would not become me to repeat all he saidi now have not only my life and my rights but also a very grand son of my own whose nature is that of the sweet one i destroyed and soon he will help me in the work i hope to do yet i am so mean and small that i grudge you the one love of your life if you insist upon taking her away for a moment as i looked at him and perceived the sparkle of tears in his eyes although his voice was clear and firm it came home to my heart that here was a contest of generosity wherein it would be ignoble of me not to show some valiance but a sense of yearning and perpetual loneliness and an empty life coupled with a doubt of my duty to the power which has ordained true love proved too much for my nobility if you really think sur imar i began with a dismal voice if you can reconcile it with your duty as a father to keep your dear child all to yourselffor she has vowed i may tell you that fifty times she has pledged herself never to have any one but meand of course i know that i am poor this was very mean of me and i never meant to say it but love is mean as well as grand then let us settle it this way he answered with a proud paternal smile i have been so long in england that i will follow english usages let us leave it to the lady i will send for dariel and she shall choose between us i pray you not it would be such a pain and trial to her as i spoke he looked at me with a warmth of true affection george you love her even more than her own father does he said you deserve a decision in your favour but i doubt whether you will get it if you do i resign without conditions but poverty there need be none unless you insist upon it mr stoneman your brotherinlaw entreats me to accept l for the valley of st winifred three railway companies there are according to his account of it railing and raving at one another for the possession of that part of surrey they all declare that such a line can never pay for making but they would spend their last shilling upon it rather than see either of the others there mr stoneman is in what you call the bench the chair the throne of the wealthiest of the three and if he can make purchase of that track the rivals will have no chance to pass i have felt much scruple about accepting so much for land that cost me so little the justice of the matter is not clear to me as a stranger to the english equity oh sur imar i exclaimed with great surprise the largest and noblest of all the angels if he got the whiphand of a railway company would be compelled by selfrespect to take it out of them to their last penny so i have been told on every side the lesghian chief replied with calm decision but i waited for you to confirm it george i perceive that they are the civilised form of the bandit well that sum which seems considerable to us though in england you think nothing of it will pass at once to my dariel as the strict justice of the case demands of that she knows nothing and if she knew it her decision would be just the same but here she comes as i arranged the chief window of the sittingroom to which i was now promoted faced westward over the tablerock on which the great house stood and further to the west beyond deep chasms and dark precipices arose a mighty tau the rival of kazbek in this eastern range and mantled with perpetual snow this being flushed with ruddy thrills from the glances of the evening sun shed a rich tint through the room as if the rugged mountains vied with heaven to bring their sweet princess a tribute of bright roses then as she passed the black walnut panels which looked as old as the ark itself i took it for a good omen that she wore a dress which i had praised not such a thing as we see here but graceful elegant flowing softly docile ductile and yet expressive simple though full of harmonious contrasts zealousif there were any hope of thatto enhance the beauty it contained as a great poets thoughts are clothed sometimes in language that transcends themselves she glanced at me as i rose for now i could stand once more without giddiness and by that passing glance she told me that she knew the time was come when her long choice must be made then she went on to her fathers side and took both his hands and looked at him as if there was nobody else to look at over her bowed head he gave me a smile which i interpretedbehold the vanity of human wishes be satisfied with natures laws a dear child loves her father best young men may long to rob him but the lord forbids it i grieve for you but how could it be otherwise there was nothing more for me to say i made the best bow of which a trueborn british back is capable and with all the dignity left in me by the beating of my foolish heart i walked away from both of them towards a little door which opened on a quiet gallery where i might sit down and think it over with myself alone but before i could turn the handle trembling arms were round my neck and a quivering breast arose to mine and a face that shone with rolling tears looked up for me to comfort it and sweet lips whispered close to minemy love could you believe it then i felt myself all right again the strength that had been shattered by big osset clubs and long prostration lonely wanderings of bloodless brain feeble doubts of womans truth and the crush of furious doctors all flowed back and filled my heart and life with the joy of this great love i led his beautiful daughter back to sur imar and i saidyou see yes i see he answered softly and there is no more to be said illustration yes i see he answered softly printed by william blackwood and sons
