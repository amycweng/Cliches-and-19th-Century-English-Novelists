cradock nowell a tale of the new forest by richard doddridge blackmore author of clara vaughan you have said whether wisely or no let the forest judge as you like it act iii sc in three volumes vol iii london chapman and hall piccadilly the right of translation is reserved london printed by c whiting beaufort house strand contents of volume iii chapter page i ii iii iv v vi vii viii ix x xi xii xiii xiv xv xvi xvii xviii cradock nowell chapter i upon the christmas morning the parish flocked to church and the church was dressed so beautifully that every one was amazed amy and eoa made the wreaths the garlands and rosettes there was only one cross out of the lot a badlybred maltese one and eoa walked over the barbarous pewscreens like the travisses in a stable springing from one to another with a cable of flowers and evergreens as easily and calmly as she would come downstairs to dinner of course she had never heard of that sort of thing before but she took to it at once as she did to anything pretty and soon she was amys mistress as indeed she must be every ones unless she could not bear them the sons of the forest looked up with amazement as they shambled in one after other and an old woodcutter went home for his axe lest the ivy should throttle the pillars on the whole the parish attributed this great outburst of foliage to the indignation of the pixies at parson johns going to london and staying there so long the prayers were read by mr pell for the rector was weary and languid but he would not forego his pleasant words to the wellknown flock that day while the choir was making a stupendous din out of something they called an anthem octave slipped off to his rushford duty through the chanceldoor then with his silken gown ongiven him years ago by subscription and far too grand for him to wear except at christmas and easterjohn rosedew mounted the pulpitstairs and showed as in a holy bower of goodwill and of gratitude the lovingkindness of his face and the grandeur of his forehead as he glanced from one to the other with a general welcome a genial interest in the welfare both of soul and body a stir and thrill ran through the church and many eyes were tearful for already a rumour was abroad that uncle john must leave them that another christmas day would see a stranger in his pulpit after dwelling briefly on his favourite subject christian love and showing by quotations from the noblest of heathen philosophers how low and false their standard was how poor a keystone is earthly citizenship the patriotism of a pugnacious village or a little presumptuous attica to crown and bind together the great arch of humanity after showing too with a depth of learning wasted on his audience how utterly false the assertion is that the doctrines or rather the principles nay the one great principle of our new testament had ever been anticipated on the banks of the yellow rivereloquently he turned himself to the application of his subject with some unconscious yearning perhaps or perhaps some sense of hometruth he gazed towards the curtained pew where sat his ancient friend brought thither it was too evident by tidings of his absence as the eyes of the old men met for the first time after long estrangementthose eyes that had met so frankly and kindly for more than fifty years during all which time each to the other had been a necessariusand as each observed how pale and grey his veteran comrade looked neither heart was wholly free from selfreproach and sorrow john rosedews mild eyes glistened so and his voice so shook and faltered that all the parish noticed it and wondered what harm it had done last week for none of them had ever known his voice shake except when some parishioner had done the unbecoming and then the village mourned it because it vexed the parson so the next day as soon as parson john had found that all parochial matters were in proper trim and that he might leave home again without neglect of duty what did he do but order a fly no less than a onehorse fly from the jolly foresters which fly should rush to the parsonagedoor as nearly as might be at one oclock now why would not corbus suffice to carry the rector and valise according to the laws of the medes and persians a distance of two parasangs simply because our amy was going and had every right to go beautiful amy was going to london great fountainhead of all visions and marvels even from white longclothes up to the era of striped crinoline and who shall object except on the ground that amy was too good to go if amy were put down now in hyde park piccadilly or regentstreet at the height and cream of the season when fop and screw and fogey frivolus and frivola diana venatrix copa syrisca aphrodite misthote yea and even some natural honest girls moderately ticketed are doing their caravaningif amy were put on the pathway there in her simple grey hat and feather and that roundabout chenille thing which she herself had made and which followed the lines of her figure so fifty fellows themselves of the most satisfactory figure at drummonds or at couttss fifty fellows who had slipped the hook fifty times apiece spite of motherly bend oshaugnessey must have received their stroke of grace and hated cradock nowell although the southwestern railway had been open so many years our forestchild had never been further from green leaf and yellow gorse than winchester in the eastern hemisphere and salisbury in the western and now after all to think that she was going to london not for joy but sorrow desperate coaxing it had cost every known or new devicetransparent every one of them as the pleading eyes that urged itevery bit of cozening learned from three years old and upward every girlish argument that never can hold water unless it be a teardrop and better than a million pleas every soft caress and kiss all loving all imploringthere was not one of these but came to batter amys father or ever he surrendered for johns ideas were very oldfashioned as to maidenly decorum and aunt eudoxias view of the matter was even more prim and grim than his yet as amy well remarked if she could see no harm in it there certainly could be none and how could they insist so much on the and the as if they overrode it is likely enough that this last stroke won the palm of victory for though miss amy knew little of greek and her father knew a great deal she often contrived with true feminine skill to take his wicket neatly before he had found his blockhole and then her father would smile and chuckle and ask to have his bat again which never was allowed him to think that any man should be the father of such therefore that father was compelled to throw himself flat as a flounder on eudoxias generosity for the leechbottle now was dry darling doxy you know quite well you are such a wonderful manager you have got a little cash somewhere he put it with a twist of interrogation a quivering lever of doubt and yet a grand fulcrum of confidence which were totally irresistible no wonder his daughter could coax oh that i were like you john when i want a bit of money hereupon aunt doxy smiled with the perception of superior mind and the power of causing astonishment never a word she said but went to some unknown recesses in holy upstair adyta she fussed about with many keys over sounding boards and creaking ones to signify her caution and at last came back with a leathern bag washleather tied with bobbin putting up her hands to keep amy at a distance she pursed her lips as if to say now dont be disappointed there is really nothing in it nothing at least i mean for people of your extravagant ideas then one by one before johns eyes which enlarged with a geometric progression of amazement she laid a gorgeous train of gold as if it were but dominoes beginning with halfsovereigns first then breaking into the broader gauge until there must have been twenty pounds and john thought of all his poor people verily then she stopped awhile to enhance her climax or perhaps she hesitated as was only natural but now the pleasure of the thing was too much for her prudence looking at john and then at amy and wanting to look at both at once she drew from a little niche in the bag with a jerk as if it were nothing a dainty marrowfat tenpound note of the bank of england with a name of substance upon the back and an authenticity of grease grander than any watermark she tried very hard to make light of it and not wave it in the air even but the tide of her heart was too strong for her and she turned away and cried as hard as if she had no money who may pretend to taste and tell every herb in the soup of nature there is no sovereign moly no paramount amellus even basil the herb of kings may be lost in garlic blest are they who seek not ever for the forcedmeat balls but find some good in every brewis homely burnt or overstrained john rosedew putting on his boots for the road to london felt himself at every tug quite as rich as megaclesthat man of foremost athenian blood but none the more a gentleman who walked capaciously into and rapaciously walked out of the goldgranaries of crsus a delightful sense of having gotten great money out of eudoxiaa triumph without historic parallelinspired him away with that overdone wordaerated him with glory thirty pounds and some odd shillings wholly at john rosedews mercy who never gave quarter to money but hewed it as small as agag when anybody asked himthirty pounds with no duty upon it no stamp of responsibility and a peculiar and peppery piquancy in the spending of every halfpenny to wonder what sister doxy would think if she could only know it he gave careful amy the note to keep and l to go inside it because he had promised to do so for doxy knew his nature in that noble fly from the foresters which had only two springs broken john and his daughter went away to catch the train at brockenhurst out of the windows dangerously they pushed their beautiful headsthe beauty of youth on one side the beauty of age on the otheralthough the coachman had specially warned them that neither door would fasten but what could they do when aunt doxy was there by the great rhododendron with a kettleholder over her mouth because it was so cold fat jemima too and jenny and jem pottles leading corbus to shake off his dust at the shayhorse and learn what he might come to some worthy people had journeyed up from the further end of the village to bid an eternal farewell to amy and to take home the washing they knew she would never come back again she would never be let go again folks in london were so wicked and parson was so innocent evil though the omens were as timidly blushing she went away tearfully leaving her fathers hearth though a daw on the left hand forbade her to go and a wandering chough was overheard and a croaking raven whirled away into the wilds of the woodlandfor whom shall i fear i the cannie seer while amy smiles dexter out of the cab and wraps her faith around her make we not half our life here according as we receive it is it not as the rain that falls softly when softly taken as of leaves and grass and water but rattling and flying in mud and foul splashes when met at wrong angles repulsively my little daughter if you cannot see your way in that similea very commonplace onetake a still more timeworn and venerable illustration our life is but a thread my child at any moment snappable though never snapped unwisely and true as it is that we cannot spin and shape it as does the spider out of our own emotions yet we have this gift of god that we can secrete some gold along it some diamonds fetching the sunlight knowing then in whose hand we are and feeling how large that hand is let us know and feel therewith that he will not crush us that he loves us to rejoice therein and tamely to regard him with confidence in adoration a smile in every bow to him chapter ii polly ducksacre was sitting in state behind the little counter and opposite the gasjet upon her thronea bushel basket set upside down on another it was the evening of boxing day and polly was arrayed with a splendour that challenged the strictest appraisement so gorgeous were her gilt earrings cornelian necklace sham cameo broochcupid stealing the sword of marsand germansilver bracelets the children who came in for haporths of specked forgot their errand and hopes of prigging and sucking their lips with wild admiration cried lor now aint she stunnin spexs her sweetheart in a coach and four exclaimed one little girl of great penetration oh give us a ride miss when he comes that little girl was right to a limited extent polly did expect her sweetheart not in a coach and four however but in a smallish taxcart chestnutcoloured picked out with white on the panel whereof was painted as the act directs robert clinkers junior coalmerchant hammersmith mr clinkers whose first visit had been paid simply from pity for cradock and to acquit himself of all complicity in hearty wibrahams swindle had called again to make kind inquiries after finding how ill the poor fellow was and that his landlady sold coals nor was it long before he ventured to propose an arrangement mutually beneficial under which the ducksacre firm should receive their supply from him two or three councils were held but the ladies were obliged to surrender at last because he was so complimentary and had such nice white teeth and spoke in such a feeling manner of his dear departed angel on the other hand their old wharfinger would come blustering about his sacks loud enough to make the potatoes jump and he kept such impudent men and bit his nails without any manners and called them both mrs acreducks during this clinkerian diplomacy polly showed such shrewdness and such a nice foot and ancle and had such a manner of rolling her eyesblacker and brighter than best wallsendthat the coals of love were laid the match struck the fire kindled and drawing well up the hearthplace before robert clinkers knew what he was at and now he came every evening bringing two sacks of coal with him and sat on a bag of barcelonas and cracked and gazed at polly miss ducksacre you should sell lemonade he had said only saturday last which was christmas eve it is such a genteel drink you know when a chap is consumed with internal fires as the great poet sayshim as wrote the operas or the copperas bless me i never know which it is likely you can tell miss lor mr clinkers why the proper name is hopperas we shows the boards and we gets a ticket when nobody else wont go oh now do you though ah i was there afore ever i knew what life was a tricksome thing is life miss polly especially for a andsome female and no young fellow to be trusted with it valuable cargo on green wood sure to come to shipwreck lor mr clinkers you dont mean me i am sure i am not at all handsome then there isnt one in london miss coals is coals and fire is fireoh i should like some lemonade with a drop of rum in it would you join me in it now if i just pop round the corner it would make you feel so nice now do i ever feel anything else but nice oh polly what a leading question i wishes it was in my province now with the deepest respect to try here polly flashed away though nobody was pursuing her got behind some penzance broccoli and seized a halfpottle to defend herself mr clinkers knowing what he was about appealed to a bunch of mistletoe under which in distracting distraction the young lady had taken refuge now nobody else in all this london said the coalmerchant to the berries in all this mighty baal as the poet beautifully expresses it especially if a young man not over fiveandthirty not so very badlooking but experienced in life and with great veneration for females and a business you may say of three hundred a year clear of incometax and increasing yearly and a contract with the company without no encumbrances would ever go to think of letting that beautiful young lady enjoy the sweets of retirement in that most initing position without plucking some of the pearls off and no harm done or taken and nothing at all pervents me no consideration of the brockolocould pay for it tomorrow morningbut my deepest respects not having my best togs on through a cruel haxident please pigs theyll come home tomorrow morning and ill do it on monday and lock up yard at four oclock if tailor has made a job of it look nice indeed and feel nice i should like to know how she could help it this explains why when the wheels at the door proved to be not of the sprightly taxcart but a lumbering cab polly was disappointed neither was her displeasure removed when she saw a very pretty girl get out and glide into the shop with the loveliest damask spreading over the softest and clearest cheeks though polly had made up her mind about cradock as now a bad speculation it was not likely that she should love yet any one who meant to have him amy shrunk back as her nice clean skirt swept the grimy threshold she was not by any means fidgety but had a nervous dislike of dirt as most upright natures have then she felt ashamed of herself and coloured yet more deeply to think that a place good enough for cradock should seem too sordid for her indeed and then her tears glanced in the gaslight that cradock should ever have come to this and partly no doubt for her sake though she never could tell how the little shop was afforested with christmastrees of all sorts and of every pattern as large as ever could be squeezed with a knuckle of root to keep them steady into pots no the costermongers repudiate larger pots because they take too much room on a truck and involve the necessity of hiring a boy to push aucuba irish yew portugal laurel arbor vit and baytree but most of alland for the purpose by far the most convenient because of the hatpeg orderthe stiff selfconfident argumentative spruce all these when they have done their spiriting and yielded longremembered fun will be fondly tended by gentlehearted girls on some suburban balcony they will be

and papa is so provoking that he will only shake his head too sagaciously to commit himself an earnest appeal will be addressed to some of the gardening papers or perhaps the tree will be planted with

because the house will be darkened so in a few short years meanwhile the editors reply arrivespossibly sylvias tree has no roots he is laughed to scorn for his ignorance until little charley falls to work with his ramsgate spade unbidden factura nepotibus umbram it has been chopped all round the bole with a hatchet and is as likely to grow as a lucifermatch through that christmas tabraca john rosedew led his daughter begging her at every step to be careful of the trees whose claims upon her attention she postponed to those of her frock lor bless me sir is that you now and your good lady along of you how glad i am to be sure miss ducksacre this is my daughter miss amy rosedew of whom you have heard me speak here john executed a flourish of great complacency with his hat my only child but as good to me as any dozen could be will you allow her to stop here a minute while i go upstairs amy was trembling now more and more every moment and john would not ask how cradock was for fear of frightening his daughter to be sure she can stay here said polly not over graciously for if mr clinkers should come in the while it might alter his ideal ah so very sad so very sad miss aint it now yes said amy having no desire to pursue the subject with polly but pollys tongue could no more keep still than a frond of maidenhair fern in the draught of a river archway ah so very sad to think of him go quite young as he is to one of them moonstruck smilems where they makes ropemats and tiger rugs as andsome a young man miss as ever i see off a hengine and of course he must be such being as he is your brother before poor amy could answer mrs ducksacre came to fetch her and frowned very hard at polly who began to look out of the window in spite of all her faith and hope the child could scarcely get up the stairs till her father came to meet her there is no one with him now dear mrs jupp is in the sittingroom so very kindly lent us by the good landlady only two more pairs of stairs and there our cradock lies not a bit worse than he was if anything a little better and his faithful little wena with him she wont leave him night or day dear give me your hand amy why i declare it is rather dark when you get too far from the windows madam come in with us but eliza ducksacre though little versed in mintage and taking pigrings for halfpence knew when her presence had better be absence as well as a sleeping partner does at the associations bankruptcy so after showing them up to the door she slipped away into the sidecupboard which mr rosedew had called a sittingroom then john took amys bonnet off after ruining the strings and stroked her pretty hair down and took her young cheeks in his hands and begged her not to tremble so because she would quite upset him only she might cry a little if she thought it would do her good but when she put her hand up and gave a dry sob only the father led her very tenderly into the little chamber it was a wretched little room like a casual paupers home when he gets one only much lower and smaller amy took all of it in at a glance for in matters of that sort a womans perception is when compared to a mans as forked lightning compared to a blunt dessert fork she even knew why the bed was awry which her father could sooner have written ten scolia than discover the bed was placed so because poor cradock jumping up all of a sudden in an early stage of illness and before his head grew soft had knocked a great piece of plaster away from the projecting hipbeam now craddy was looking away from them sitting up in the sackcloth bed and trying with the sage gravity of fixed hallucination to read some lines which his fancy had written on the glazed dirt that served for a window that window perhaps pronounced itself more by candlelight than by daylight and the landlord had forbidden any attempt at cleaning it because he knew that the frame would drop out two candles the residue of two pounds which mr rosedew had paid for only helped to interpret the squalid room more forcibly while amy stood there shocked and frightened and her father was thinking what to say the poor sick fellow turned towards them and his eyes met hers she saw that the tint of her lovers eyes was gone from a beautiful deep grey to the tone of a withered oakleaf the pupils forthstanding haggardly the whites dull and chased with blood veins the sockets marked with a cloudy blue and channeled with storms of sorrow the countenance full of long sufferinggaunt and wan and weary amy could not weep but gazed never thinking anything with all the love and pity devotion and faith eternal which are sure to shine in a womans eyes when trouble strikes its light there how different from the shy maids glance which only a month or two ago would have met his youthful overtures and how infinitely grander something of the good allfathers power and mercy in it she kept her eyes upon him she had no power to move them and they changed exactly as his did the pale glance wandering into her gaze with an appealing submissive motion eager to settle somewhere but too faint to ask for sympathy began to feel its way and fasten began to quiver with vibrant light and sense of resting somewhere began to quicken flush and deepenfrom what fountain god only knowsthen to waver and suffuse in feeble consciousness of grief retire and return again fluttering to some remembered home as a bird in the dark comes to his nest then to thrill and beam and sparkle with the light the life the love so with a weak but joyful cry like a shipwrecked man at his hearth again he stretched out both his wasted arms and amy was there without knowing it she laid his white cheek on her shoulder and let her hair flow over it she held him up with her own pure breast till his worn heart beat on her warm one then she sobbed and laughed and sobbed and called him her world and heart and heaven and kissed his nestling forehead and looked and asked oh where the love was all she begged for was one word just one little word if you please to know who was to come to comfort him oh he must know herof course he mustwouldnt she know him that was all though she hadnt a breath of life left his own his faith his truth his lovehis ownlet him say who and she never would cry again only say it once his own amy yes your amy amy amy say it again oh say it again my poor everlasting love suddenly the barriers of his frozen grief were loosened with a feeble arm staying on her although it could not cling to her he burst into a flood of tears from the fountain of great waters whose source and home is god then john who had stood at the door all the time with his white head bowed on his coatsleeve came forward and took a hand of each knelt by the bed and gave thanks they wanted not to talk of it nor any doctor to tell them because they had an angels voice that god would be gracious to them darlings didnt i tell you said amy looking up at them with her rich curls tearbespangled like a young grapeleaf in the vinery dont you know that i was sure our father would never forsake us and that even a simple thing like me might fetch back my own blessing oh you never would have loved me so only god knew it was good for us while she spoke cradock looked at her with a faint faroff intelligence not entering into her arguments he only cared to hear her voice to see her every now and then and touch her to make sure of it then to dream that it was an angel then to wake and be very glad that it was not but was amy chapter iii slowly from that night but surely cradocks mind began to return like a child to its mother who is stretching forth her arms to it timid at first and wondering and apt for a long time to reel and stagger at very slight shocks or vibrations then as the water comes over the ice in a gradual gentle thaw beginning to gleam at the margin first where the reeds are and the willowtrees then gliding slowly and brightly on following every skatemark or line where a rope or stick has been till it flows into a limpid sheet so crystal reason dawned and wavered felt its way and went on again tracing many a childish channel many a dormant memory across that dull lethargic mind until the bright surface was restored and the lead line of judgment could penetrate mr rosedew quartered himself and his amy at the portland hotel hard by and reckless of all expense moved cradock into mrs ducksacres very best room he would have done this long ago only the doctor would not allow it then amy who did not like london at all because there were so few trees in it hired some of the christmasgrove from the fair greengrocers and decked out the little sittingroom so that cradock had sweet visions of the queens bower mead as for herself she would stay in the shop perhaps half an hour together and rejoice in the ways of the children all her pocketmoney went into the till as if you had taken a shovel to it barcelonas brazils and cobnuts she was giving all day to the warmints and golden oranges rolled before her as from atalantas footstep it is a most wonderful fact and far beyond my philosophy that instead of losing her roses in london as a country girl ought to have done amy bloomed with more jacqueminot upon very bright occasionsmore louise odier constantly with goubalt in the dimples then toning off at any new fright to malmaison or devoniensismore of these roses now carmined or mantled in the delicate turn of her cheeks than ever had nestled and played there in the free air of the forest good aunt doxy was quite amazed on the saturday afternoon when meeting her brother and niece at the stationfor it made no difference in the outlay and the drive would do her goodshe found not a pale and withered child worn out with london racket and freckled with dust and smokespots but the loveliest amy she had ever yet seenwhich was something indeed to saywith a brilliance of bloom which the good aunt at once proceeded to test with her handkerchief but before the young lady left townto wit on the friday eveningshe had a little talk with rachel jupp or rather with strapping issachar which nearly concerns our story oh miss amy said rachel that morningmiss amy sounded more natural somehow than miss rosedew didso youre going away miss after all and never see my looey and a pretty child she is and a good one and a quiet one and father never lift hand to her now and the poor young gentleman saved her life and he like her so much and she like him i will come and see her this evening as you have so kindly asked me that is with my papas leave and if you dont mind coming for me to the inn at six oclock i am afraid of walking by myself after dark in london my papa has found some books at the bookstalls and he is so delighted with them he never wants me after dinner dear miss amy would you mind thenwould you mind taking a drop of tea with us to be sure i will i mean if it is quite convenient and if you can be spared here and ifoh nothing else mrs jupp only i shall be most happy she was going to say and if you wont make any great preparations but she knew how sensitive poor people are at restraints upon hospitality so grand preparations were made and grander still they would have been and more formal and uncomfortable if amy had finished her sentence rachel at once rushed off to her lord whose bargeshaped frame was moored alongside of his wharf dreaming as stolidly as none except a bargee can dream he immediately shelled out seven and sixpence from the cuddy of his inexpressibles and left his wife to her own devices except in the matter of tea itself the tea he was resolved to fetch from a little shop in the bargewalk where as mother hamp declared who kept the tobaccoshop by the gate they sold tea as strong as brandy if you please to excuse our zakey miss taking no more tea said mrs jupp after issachar had laboured very hard at it the host being bound in his opinion to feast even as the guest did because he belong to the antiteatotallers as takes nothing no stronger than gin miss darrnt take more nor one noggin of tay miss cried mr jupp touching his short front curl with a hand scrubbed in quicklime and copperas likes it but it dont like me miss makes me feel quite intemperant likeso narvous and queer and staggery looey dear dads mild mixture for to speak the young ladys health in leastways by your lave miss dads mild mixture soon made its appearance in a battered halfgallon can and mr jupp was amazed and grieved that none but himself would quaff any the strongest and headiest stuff it was which even the publicans of london alchymists of villainy can quassify and cocculise and nuxvomicise up to proof then the wrath of hunger and thirst being mollified issachar begged leave to smoke if altogether agreeable and it would all go up the chimney which however it refrained from doing now while he is smoking i may admit that the contents of mr jupps censuspaper if indeed he ever made legal entries after punching the collectors head have not been transcribed to the satisfaction of the registrargeneral or homeoffice or whoever or whatever he or it is who or which insists upon knowing nine times as much about us as we know about ourselves mr jupp was a bargee of catholic views it warnt no odds to he whether he worked upon wharf or water sea or river or canal at coal or hay or lime breeze or hoppoles or anything else now and then he went down to gravesend or up the river to kingston or staines but his more legitimate area was navigable by three canals where a chap might find time to eat his dinner and give his wife and nag theirn issachars love of nature always culminated at one oclock and then how he loved to halt his team under a row of alders and see the painted meadows gay and have grub and pipe accordin his three canals affording these choice delights unequally were the surrey the regents and the basingstoke that last was indeed to his rural mind the nearest approach to paradise but as there is in all things a system of weights and measures mr jupp got better wages upon the other two and so could not very often afford to indulge his love of the beautiful hence he kept his household gods within reach of the yellow tibers and took them only once a year for a treat upon the anio then would rachel jupp and looey spend a summer month afloat enjoying the rural glimpses and the sliding quietude of inland navigation and keeping the pot aboiling in the statecabin of the enterprise or the industrious maiden now amy having formed loos acquaintance and said what was right and pretty in gratitude for their entertainment and faithful kindness to cradock was just about to leave them when issachar jupp delivered this speech very slowly as a man who has got to the marrow and popeseye of his pipe now scuse me for axing of you miss and if any ways wrong in so doing be onscrupulous for to say so and no harm done or taken but i has my raisons for axing from things as ive a eard him say and oncommon good raisons too if you please what be the arkerate name and dwellinplace of the young gent as saved our loo mr clinkers couldnt find out miss though he knowed as it warnt charles newman dont you know his story then asked amy in some astonishment i thought you knew all about it and were so kind to him partly through that though you were kind enough not to talk to me about it we guesses a piece here and there miss since he talk so wild in his illness and thats what made me be axing of you for i knowed one name right well as he out with once or twice not at all a common name nother but we knows for sartin no more nor this that he be an onlucky young gent and the best as ever come into these parts there can be no harm in my telling you such faithful friends as you are and the sad tale is known to every one far and wide in our part of hampshire hampshire ah said mr jupp with a very mysterious look we knowed mr rosedew come from hampshire and that set us the more athinkin of it loo child run for dads baccobox as were left to mother richardsons and if it aint there try at blinkin davys and if he aint got it try mother hamp the child sadly disappointed for her eyes were large with hopes of a secret about her dear gentleman as she called cradock departed upon her long errand then amy told as briefly as possible all she knew of the great mishap and the misery which followed it from time to time her soft voice shook and her tears would not be disciplined while rachel jupps strayed anyhow but issachar listened dryly and sternly with one great brown hand on his forehead not once did he interrupt the young lady by gesture look or question but when she had finished he said very quietly one name miss as have summat to do with it ive not eard you sinnify and it were the sound o that very name as fust raised my coorosity scuse me miss but i wouldnt ax only for good raison i hardly know what right i have to mention any other names replied amy blushing and hesitating for she did not wish to speak of pearl garnet there is only one other name connected at all with the matter and that one of no importance ah returned jupp with a glance as intense as a cats through a dairy keyhole maybe the towrope aint nothin to do with the goin of the barge miss that name didnt happen permiskious now to be the name of garnet maam yes indeed it did but how could you know that mr jupp pearl garnet were the name i eard on and that aint a very common name leastways to my experience now could it ave appened by a haxident that her good fathers name were bull garnet amy drew back for mr jupp in his triumph and excitement had laid down his pipe and was stretching out his unpeeled crate of a hand as if to take her by the shoulder and shake the whole truth out of her it was his fashion with rachel and he quite forgot the difference mrs jupp cried zakey zakey in a tone of strong remonstrance but he was not abashed very seriously it couldnt be now could it miss it wornt in any way possible that pearl garnets father was ever known by the name of bull garnet but indeed that is his name mr jupp why should you be so incredulous oncredulous it be miss oncredulous as i be a sinner rachey whod ha thought it how things does come about to be sure now please to tell me missvery careful and not passin lightly of anything never you mind how small it seemevery word you knows about pearl garnet and that therejob there and all you knows on her father too you must prove to me first mr jupp that i have any right to do so issachar now was strongly excited a condition most unusual with him except when his wife rebelled and that she had years ago ceased to do he put his long black face which was working so that the high cheekbones almost shut the little eyes quite close to amys little white ear and whispered if ye dunna tell me yell cry for it arl the life long yell never right the innocent and yell let the guilty ride over ye i canna tell no more just now but every word is gospel i be no liar miss though i be rough enough god knows supposes he made me so then amy trembling at his words and thinking that she had hurt his feelings put her soft little hand for amends into zakeys great black piece of hold which looked like the bilge of a barge and he wondered what to do with it such a sort of chap as he was he had never heard of kissing a hand and even if he had it would scarcely be a timely offering for he was having a chaw to compose himselfyet he knew that he ought not in good manners to let go her hand in a hurry so what did he do but slip off a ring one of those socalled galvanic rings in which sailors and bargemen have wonderful faith as an antidote to rheumatics tick dolorous and the caroline morgan and this ring he passed down two of her fingers for all females do love trinkets so amy kept it carefully and will put it on her chatelaine if ever she institutes one then being convinced by his words and manner she told him everything she knew about the garnet familytheir behaviour in and after the great misfortune the strange seclusion of pearl and mr garnets illness and then she recurred to some vague rumours which had preceded their settlement in the new forest to all this issachar listened without a word or a nod but with his narrow forehead radiant with concentration his lips screwed up in a serrate ring after the manner of a medlar and a series of winks so intensely sage that his barge might have turned a corner with a team of eight blind horses and no nod wanted for one of them aint there no more nor that miss he asked with some disappointment when the little tale was ended cant you racollack no more no indeed i cannot and if you had not some important object i should be quite ashamed of telling you so much gossip if i may ask you a question now what more did you expect me to tell you that they had knowd miss as bull garnet were sir cradock nowells brother mr garnet sir cradocks brother you must be mistaken mr jupp my father has known sir cradock nowell ever since he was ten years old and he could not have failed to know it if it had been so most like he do know it miss but dunna you tell him now nor any other charp it be true as gospel for all that though then robert and pearl are cradocks first cousins and mr garnet is his uncle not ezackly as you counts things answered the bargeman looking at the fire but in the way as we does amy felt that she must ask no more at least upon that subject and that she was not likely to speak of it even to her father let him go miss continued issachar referring now to cradock let him go for a long seavohoyage same as doctor horders un he be better out of the way for a spell or two the basingstoke aint fur enoo whur i meant to ave took him a mun be quite out o the kintry till this job be over like and niver a word as to what i thinks to coom anigh his ear miss if so be you vallies his raison but you forget mr jupp that you have not told me as yet at all what it is you do think you said some things which frightened me and you told me one which astonished me beyond that i know nothing and better so my dear young leddy a vast deal better so only you have the very best hopes and keep your spirits roaring zakey jupp never take a thing in hand but what he go well through with it ask rachey about that now this were a casooal haxident mind you only a casooal haxident of course we all know that mr jupp no one would dare to think anything else yes yes all right miss and well find out who did the casooal haxidentthats all miss thats all only you hold your tongue she was obliged to be content with this and on the whole it greatly encouraged her then she returned to the portland hotel under convoy of all the jupp family and issachar got into two or three rows by hustling every one out of her way although poor amy was frightened at this no doubt it increased her faith in him through some feminine process of dialectics unknown to the author of the organon though amy could not bear to keep anything secret from her father having given her word she of course observed it and john was greatly surprised at the spirits in which his daughter took leave of cradock but there were many points in amys character as has been observed before which her father never understood and he concluded that this was a specimen of them and was delighted to see her so cheerful now being returned to nowelhurst he held counsel with sister eudoxia who thoroughly deserved to have a vote after contributing so to the revenue and the result of their lateranfor they both were brickscouncil was as follows that john was bound howsoever much it went against his proud stomach after his previous treatment to make one last appeal from the father according to the spirit to the father according to the flesh in favour of the unlucky son who was now condemned to exile so as at least to send him away in a manner suitable to his birth that if this appeal were rejected and the appellant treated unpleasantlywhich was almost sure to followhe could not consistently with his honour and his clerical dignity hold any longer the benefices paltry as they were the gifts of a giver now proved unkind that thereupon mr rosedew should first provide for cradocks voyage so far as his humble means and small influence permitted and after that should settle at oxford where he might get parochial duty and where his old tutorial fame and repute now growing european from a life of learning would earn him plenty of pupils and a professorship at least miss eudoxia broke in for much as she nagged at her brother she was proud as could be of his knowledge marry ay and a bishopric john answered smiling pleasantly you have often menaced me doxy dear with jemimas apron so on a bright day in january john rosedew said to jem pottles saddle me the horse james and they saddled him the horsenot so called by his master through any false aggrandisement such as maketh us talk of the servants when we have only got a maidofallwork but because the parson in pure faith regarded him as a horse of full equine stature and superequine powers after tightening up the girths thenfor that noble cob at the saddling period blew himself out with a large sense of humour unappreciated by the biped who bestraddled him unwarily an abdominal sense of humour which as one touch of nature makes the whole world kin induced the pigskin to circulate after the manner of a brass dogs collartush i mean a dogs brass collarin order to learn what the joke was down in those festive regions therefore having buckled him up six inches till the witty nag creaked like a tightlaced maid away rode the parson towards the hall much liefer would he have walked by the wellknown and pleasant footpath but he felt himself bound as one may say to go in real style sir the more he reflected upon the nature of his errand the fainter grew his hopes of success he even feared that his ancient friendship would not procure him a hearing so absorbed were all the echoes of memory in the pique of parental jealousy and the cajoleries of a woman and the consequences of failurehow bitter they must be to him and his little household moreover he dearly loved his two little quiet parishes and though he reaped more tithe from them in kindness than in kind or by commutation to his contented mind they were far sweeter than the incumbency of libyacumgades and both pni for his beadles he thought of amy with a bitter pang and of his sister with heaviness as he laid his handfor he never used whipon the fat flank of the pony to urge him almost to a good round trot that suspense might sooner be done with and when the hall was at last before him he rode up not to the little postern hard by the housekeepers snuggery which had seemed of old to be made for him but to the grand front entrance where the orangetrees in tubs were and the myrtles and the pilasters most of the trees had been removed with the aid of little gocarts before the frosts began but they impressed john rosedew none the less so far as his placid and simple mind was open to small impressions dismounting from corbus whose rusty snaffle and mildewed reins would have been a disgrace to any horse as amy said every day he rang the main entrance bell and wondered whether they would let him in that journey had cost him a very severe battle to bear himself humbly before the wrong and to do it in the cause of the injured in the true and noble sense of pride there could not be a prouder man than the gentle parson but he ruled that noble human pride with its grander element left in it by the son of god his incarnations legacy the pride which never apes but is itself humility at last the door was opened not by the spruce young footman who used to look so much at amy and speer about as to her expectations because she was only a parsons daughter but by that ancient and most respectable job hogstaff patriarch of butlers dull and dim as his eyes were growing job who now spent most of his time in looking for those who never came had made out mr rosedews approach by virtue of the ponys most unmistakable shamble therefore he pulled down his best coat from a jugcrook twitched his white hair to due stiffness pushed the ostiary footman back with a scorn which rankled for many a day under a zebra waistcoat and hobbled off at his utmost pace to admit the visitor now so strange though once it was strange without him mr rosedew walked in very slowly and stiffly then turned aside to a tufted mat and began to wipe his shoes in the most elaborate manner though there was not a particle of dirt upon them old jobs eyes blinked vaguely at him he felt there was something wrong in that dont ye do that sir now for gods sake dont do that i cant abear it and thats the truth full well the old man remembered how different in the happy days had been john rosedews entrance and now every scrub on the mat was a rub on his shaky hardworn heart mr rosedew looked mildly surprised for his apprehension as we know was swifter on paper than pavement but he held forth his firm strong hand and the old man bowed tearfully over it any news of our boy sir any news of my boy as was yes job very bad news he has been terribly ill in london and nobody there to care for him then ill throw up my situation sir manys the time i have threatened them but didnt like to be too hard like and pretty goings on thered be without old job in the pantry but i baint bound to stand everything for the saving of them as goes on so and that hismallitish woman as find fault with my buckles and nice things she herself wearid a given notice a week next monday but that i likes miss oa so and feel myself bound as you may say to see out this sir cradock folk would say i were shabby to leave him now he be gettin elderly man and boy for sixty year and began no more than bootcleaning man and boy for sixtythree year come next lammastide i should like it upon my tombstone sir with what god pleases added if i not make too bold and you the master of the churchyard if so be you should live long enough when my turn come god willing it will not be in my power job but if ever it is you may trust me and i wants that in i was tellin my niece about put thy hand in the hollow of my thigh holy bible you know sir and none cant object to that come job my good friend you must not talk so sepulchrally leave his own good time to god to be sure sir i baint in no hurry yet ive a sight of things to see to and my master must go first he be so very particular ill live to see the young master yet as my duty is for to do he ont carry on with a hismallitish woman he ont say what hogstaff are your wits gone woolgatherin and his own wits all the time sir fleeced fleeced fleeced here john rosedew cut short the contrast between the present and the future master which would soon have assumed a golden tinge as of the fourth eclogue for the parson was too much a gentleman to foster millennial views at the expense of the head of the household job take my card to your master and tell him with my compliments that i wish to see him alone if he will so far oblige me bytheby i ought to have written first to request an interview but it never occurred to me he could scarcely help sighing as he thought of formality reestablished on the ruins of familiarity hell be in the little coved room no doubt long o that hismallitish woman but step in here a moment sir instead of passing the doorway which the butler had thrown open for him mr rosedew stood scrupulously on the mat as if it marked his territory until the old man came back and showed him into the black oak parlour the little coved room was calmly and sweetly equal to the emergency the moment jobs heels were out of sight mrs corklemore who had been indulging in a nice little chat with sir cradock when she ought to have been at work all the while plainsewing for her little household for who was to keep the wolf from the door if she shrank from a womans missionthough irksome to her she must confess for it did hurt her poor fingers sohere she held up a dishcloth rather rougher than a coalsack which she had stolen cleverly from her hosts own lower regions and did not know from a glasscloth but it suited her because it was brown and set off her lily hands sooh uncle cradock in all this there is something sweetly sacred because it speaks of home she was darning it all the while with white silk and took good care to push it away when any servant came in it had lasted her now for a week and had earned her a hundred guineas having made the most profound impression upon its legitimate owner she would earn another hundred before the week was out by knitting a pair of rough worsted socks for her little flore though it made her heart bleed to think how that poor child hated the feel of them now she rose in haste from her chair and pushed the fortunate dishcloth with a very expressive air into her pretty workbasket and drew the strings loudly over it what are you going for georgie you need not leave the room i am sure yes uncle dear i must you are so clear and so honest i know and most likely i take it from you but i could not have anything to do with any secret dealings uncle even though you wished it which i am sure you never could i never could keep a secret uncle because i am so shallow whenever secrecy is requested i feel as if there was something dishonest either done or contemplated very foolish of me i know but my nature is so childishly open and of course mr rosedew has a perfect right and is indeed very wise to conceal his scheme with respect to his daughter georgie stay in this room if you please he is not coming here but that poor simple amy will if he has brought her with him well i will stay here and lecture her uncle about her behaviour to you after all this the old man set forth in some little irritation to receive his onceloved friend he entered the black oak parlour in a cold and stately manner and bowed without a word to john who had crossed the room to meet him the parson held out his hand as a lover and preacher of peace should do but the offer ay and the honour too not being at all appreciated he withdrew it with a crimson blush all over his bright clear cheeks as deep as his daughters would have been then sir cradock nowell trying to seem quite calm and collected addressed his visitor thus sir i am indebted to you for the honour of this visit i apologize for receiving you in a room without a fire pray take a chair i have no doubt that your intentions are kind towards me i thank you replied the parson speaking much faster than usual and with the frill of his shirtfront rising i thank you sir cradock nowell but i will not sit down in the house of a gentleman who declines to take my hand i am here much against my own wishes and only because i supposed that it was my duty to come i am here on behalf of your son a noble but most unfortunate youth and now in great trouble of mind if he had only said in great bodily danger it might have made a difference your interest in him is very kind and i trust that he will be grateful which he never was to me he has left his home in defiance of me i can do nothing for him until he comes back and is penitent but surely the question concerns me rather than you mr rosedew i am sorry to find answered john quite calmly that you think me guilty of impertinent meddling but even that i would bear as becomes my age and my professionhere he gave sir cradock a glance which was thoroughly understood because they had been at school togetherand more than that i would do cradock nowell for a man i have loved like you sir that sir came out very oddly john poked it in as a retractation for having called him cradock nowell and as a salve to his own selfrespect lest he should have been too appealing and to follow up this view of the subject he made a bow such as no man makes to one from whom he begs anything but sir cradock nowell lost altogether the excellence of the bow the parson had put up his knee in a way which took the old man back to sherborne his mind was there playing cobnut as fifty years since with john rosedew once more he saw the ruddy and then pugnacious john bringing his calf up and priming his knee for the cobnut to lie upon it this he always used to do and not care a flip for the whack upon it instead of using his blue cloth cap as all the rest of the boys did because his father and mother were poor and could only afford him one cap in a year and so the grand bow was wasted as most formalities are but if john had only known when to stop it might have been all right after all in spite of georgie corklemore but urged by the last infirmity except gout of noble minds our parsons never do know the proper time to stop excellent men and admirable they make us shrink from eternity by proving themselves the type of it mr rosedew spoke well and eloquently as he was sure to do but it would have been better for his cause if he had simply described the sons distress and left the rest to the fathers heart at one time indeed poor old sir cradock who was obstinate and misguided rather than cold and unloving began to relent and a fatherly yearning fluttered in his greylashed eyes but at this critical moment three little kicks at the door were heard and the handle rattled briskly then a shrill little voice came through the keyhole oh pease let fore tum in pease do pease do pease do me ost me ummy top oh you naughty bad door then another kick was administered by small but passionate toetoes of course your mother did not send you innocent brighthaired popples and with a lie so pat and glib in that pouting pearlset mouth foolish mother if she did though it seal attalic bargain sir cradock went to the door and gently ordered the child away but the interruption had been enoughibi omnis effusus labor when he returned and faced john rosedew the manner of his visage was altered the child had reminded him of her mother and that graceful gushing loving nature which tried so hard not to doubt the minister so he did what a man in the wrong generally does instinctively he swept back the tide of war into his adversarys country you take a very strong interest sir in one whose nearest relations have been compelled to abandon him i thought that your greatest grievance with him was that he had abandoned you excuse me i cannot split hairs all i mean is that something has come to my knowledgenot through the proper channel not from those who ought to have told mesomething which makes your advocacy seem a little less disinterested than i might have supposed it to be have the kindness to tell me what it is oh perhaps a mere nothing but it seems a significant rumour what rumour if you please that mythat cradock nowell is attached to your daughter who behaved so ill to me of course it is not true perfectly true every word of it and john rosedew looked at sir cradock nowell as proudly as ever a father looked amy in his opinion was peeress for any mortal and perhaps he was not presumptuous ah was the only reply he received an ah drawn out into half an ell why i would have told you long ago the moment that i knew it but for your great trouble and your bitterness towards him you have often wished that a son of yours should marry my daughter amy surely you will not blame him for desiring to do as you wished no because he is young and foolish but i may blame you for encouraging it now that he is the only one do you dare to think that i am in any way influenced by interested motives i dare to think what i please no bullying here john if you please we all know how combative you are and now you have forced me to it i will tell you what will be the conviction ay and the expression of every one in this county except those who are afraid of you mr rosedew has entrapped the future sir cradock nowell hushed up the crime and made all snug for his daughter at nowelhurst hall sir cradock did not mean half his words any more than the rest of us do when hurt and he was bitterly sorry for them the moment they were uttered they put an impassable barrier between him and john rosedew between him and his own conscience for many a day and night to come have you ever seen a pure good man a man of large intellect and heart a lover of truth and justice more than of himself confront without warning some black charge some despicable calumny in a word for i love strong english and nothing else will tell it some damned lie if not i hope you never may for it makes a mans heart burn so john rosedew was not of the violent order indeed as his sister eudoxia said and to her own great comfort knew his cistern of wrathfulness was so small and the supplypipe so unreadyas must be where the lower passions filter through the intellectthat most people thought it impossible to put the parson out and very few of those who knew him could have borne to make the trial even now hurt as he was to the very depth of his heart he was indignant more than angry it would have been more manly of you sir cradock nowell to have said this very mean thing yourself than to have put it into the mouths of others i grieve for you and for myself that so mean a man was ever my friend perhaps you have still some relics of gentlemanly feeling which will lead you to perform a hosts duty towards his visitor have the kindness to order my horse then john rosedew so punctilious so polite to the poorest cottager turned his broad back upon the baronet and as he slowly walked to the door these words came over his shoulder today you will receive my resignation of your two benefices if i live a few years more i will repay you all they have brought me above a curates stipend my daughter is no fortunehunter she never shall see your son again unless he renounce you and yours for ever or you come and implore us humbly as now you have spoken arrogantly contemptibly and meanly then fearing lest he had been too grand about a little matternot his daughters marriage but the aspersion upon himselfhe closed the door very carefully so as not to make any noise and walked away towards his home forgetting corbus utterly and before his fine solid face began to recover its healthy and bashful pink he was visited by sore misgivings as to his own behaviour to wit what claim had any man however elate with the pride of right and the scorn of wrong to talk about any fellowman becoming humble to him nevertheless he could not manage to retract the wrong expression in his letter of resignation not from any false prideoh nobut for fear of being misunderstood but that very night he craved pardon of him before whom alone we need humbly bow who alone can grant us anything chapter iv what is lovelier just when autumn throws her lace around us and begs us not to begin to think of any spiteful winter because she has not yet unfolded half the wealth of her bosom and will not look over her shoulderwhen we take that rich one gaily for her gifts of beauty what among her clustered hair freshened with the hoarfrost in imitation of the spring all fashions do recur so tell us what can be more pretty pearly light and elegant more memoried of maidenhood than a jolly spiders web see how the diamonds quiver and sparkle in the september morning what jeweller could have set them so all of graduated light and metrical proportion every third preeminent strung on soft aerial tension as of woven hoarfrost and every carrying thread encrusted with the breath of fairies then crossed and latticed at just angles with narrowing interstices to a radiated octagonthe more we look the more we wonder at the perfect tracery then if we gently breathe upon it or a leaf of the bramble shivers how from the open centre a whiff of waving motion flows down every vibrant radius every weft accepts the waft slowly and lulling vibration every stayrope jerks and quivers and all the fleeting subtilty expands contracts and undulates yet if an elegant spider glide out exquisite manydappled pellucid like a scotch pebble or a calceolaria with a dozen dimples upon his back and eight fierce eyes all up for business the moment he slips from the blackberryleaf all sense of beauty is lost to the gazer because he thinks of rapacity and so i fear john rosedews hat described in the air a flourish of more courtesy than cordiality when he saw mrs corklemore gliding forth from the bend of the road in front of him although she had left the house after him by the help of a short cut through the gardens where the rector would no longer take the liberty of trespassing she contrived to meet him as if herself returning from the village oh mr rosedew i am so glad to see you cried georgie as he tried to escape with his bow what a fortunate accident indeed said john not meaning to be rude but unwittingly suggesting a modified view of the bliss ah i am so sorry but you are prejudiced against me i fear because my simple convictions incline me to the low church view that hit was a very clever one no other bolt she could have shot would have brought the parson to bay so upon his homeward road with the important news he bore i assure you mrs corklemore i beg to assure you most distinctly that you are quite wrong in thinking that most truly i hope that i have allowed no prejudice upon such grounds to dwell for a moment with me then you are not a ritualist and you think so far as i understand you that the low church people are quite as good as the high church i hope they are as good still i doubt their being as right but charity is greater even than faith and hope and for the sake of charity i would wash all rubrics white if the living are rebuked for lagging to bury their dead how shall they be praised for battling over the burial service mrs corklemore quick as she was did not understand the allusion mr rosedew referred to a paltry dissension over a corpse in oxfordshire which had created strong disgust far and near among believers while infidels gloried in it it cannot be too soon forgotten and forgiven oh mr rosedew i am so glad that your sentiments are so liberal i had always feared that liberal sentiments proceeded from or at least were associated with weak faith i hope not madam the most liberal one i have ever read of was god as well as man but i cannot speak of such matters casually as i would talk of the weather if your mind is uneasy and i can in any way help you it is my duty to do so oh thank you no i dont think i could do that we are such protestants at coo nest forgive me i see i have hurt you you misunderstand me purposely said john rosedew with that crack of perception which comes like a chapped lip suddenly to folks who are too charitable or else you take a strangely intensified view of the simplest matters all i intended was oh yes oh yes i am always misunderstanding everybody i am so dreadfully stupid and simple but you will relieve my mind mr rosedew here georgie held out the most beautiful hand that ever darned a dishcloth so white and warm and dainty from her glove and pink mufflining mr rosedew of course was compelled to take it and she left it a long time with him to be sure i will if it is in my power and you will only tell me how it is simply this she answered meekly dropping her eyes and sighing i do so long to do good works and never can tell how to set about it unhappily i am brought so much more into contact with the worldlyminded than with those who would improve me and i feel the lack of something something sadly deficient in my spiritual state could you assign me a district anywhere i am sadly ignorant but i might do some little ministering feeling as i do for every one if it were only ten cottages with an interesting sheepstealer oh that would be so charming can i have a sheepstealer i fear i cannot accommodate youthe parson was smiling in spite of himself she looked so beautifully earnest we have no felons here and scarcely even a henstealer though i must not take any credit for that every house in the village is sir cradock nowells and mr garnet is not long in ousting the evildoers oh sir cradock poor sir cradock here she came to the real object of her expedition oh mr rosedew tell me kindly as a christian minister i am in so difficult a positionhave you noticed in poor sir cradock anything strange of late anything odd and lamentable mr rosedew hated to be called a ministerthe dissenters love the word so and even the great john had his weaknesses i trust i should tell you the truth mrs corklemore whether invoked as a minister or asked simply as a man no doubt you wouldof course you would i am always making such mistakes i am so unused to clever people but do tell me in any capacity which may suit you bestit was foolish of her not to forego that little reparteewhether you have observed of late anything odd and deplorable anything we who love him so here she hesitated and wiped her eyes though sir cradock nowell replied mr rosedew slowly and buttoning up his coat at the risk of spoiling his cockscomb frill is no longer my dearest friend as he was for nearly fifty years it does not become me to speak about him confidentially and disparagingly to a lady whom i have not had the honour of seeing more than four times including therein the celebration of divine service at which a districtvisitor should attend with some regularity if only for the sake of example mrs corklemore i have the honour of wishing you good morning although the parson had neither desire nor power to pierce the ladys schemes he felt by that peculiar instinct which truly honest men have though they do not always use it that the lady was dishonest and dishonestly seeking something else had he never uttered a speech so unlike his usual courtesy as for poor simple georgie she was rolled over too completely to do anything but gasp then she went to the gorse to recover herself and presently she laughed not spitefully but with real amusement at her own discomfiture being quite a young woman still and therefore not spe longa and feeling a want of sympathy in waiting for dead mens shoes mrs corklemore who had some geniusif creative power prove it if gignere not gigni be taken as the test though perhaps it requires both of themthat sweet mother of a sweeter child if so much of the saccharine be admitted by chancellors of the exchequer themselves men of more alcohol what did she do but devise a scheme to wear the shoes ipso vivo and put the old gentleman into the slippers how very desirable it was that nowelhurst hall and those vast estates should be in the possession of some one who knew how to enjoy them and make a proper use of them poor sir cradock never could do so it was painfully evident that he never more could discharge his duties to society that he was listless passive somnolentsomnambulant perhaps she ought to say a man walking in a dream she had heard of casesmore than that she had actually known themsad cases in which that pressure on the brain which so frequently accompanies the slow reaction from sudden and terrible trials had crushed the reason altogether especially after a certain age what a pity and it might be twenty years yet before it pleased god to remove him he had a tough and wiry look about him in common kindness and humanity something surely ought to be done to relieve him to make him happier nothing rough of course nothing harsh or coercive no personal restraint whatever for the poor old dear was not dangerous only to make him what she believed was called a committee in chancerythere she was wrong for the guardian is the committeeand then mr corklemore of course and mr kettledrum would act for him at least she should think so unless there was some obnoxious trustee under his marriagesettlement that settlement must be got at so much depended upon it probably young cradock would succeed thereunder to all the settled estate upon his fathers death if so there was nothing for it except to make him incapable by convicting him of felony poor fellow she had no wish to hang him she would not have done it for the world and she had heard he was so goodlooking but there was no fear of his being hanged like the son of a tradesman or peasant well when he was transported for life with every facility for repentance who would be the next to come bothering why that odious eoa as for her she would hang her tomorrow if she could only get the chance though she believed it would never hurt her for the child could stand upon nothing impudent wretch only yesterday she had frightened georgie out of her life again and there was no possibility of obtaining a proper influence over her there was hardly any crime which that girl would hesitate at when excited what a lamentable state of morality she might be made to choke amy rosedew her rival in bobs affection but no that would never do too much crime in one family how would society look upon them and it would make the house unpleasant to live in there was a simpler way of quenching eoadeny at once her legitimacy the chances were ten to one against her having been born in wedlocksuch a loose wild man as her father was and even if she had been why the chances were ten to one against her being able to prove it whereas it would be very easy to get a few hindoos or coolies or whatever they were to state their opinion about her mother well supposing all this nicely managed what next why let poor sir cradock live out his time as he would be in her hands entirely and would grow more and more incapable and when it pleased god to release him why then thou and ziba divide the land and for the sake of her dear little flore she would take good care that the kettledrums did not get too much this programme was a far bolder one than that with which mrs corklemore had first arrived at the hall but she was getting on so well that of course her views and desires expanded all she meant at first was to gain influence over her host and irrevocably estrange him from his surviving son by delicate insinuations upon the subject of fratricide at the same time to make eoa do something beyond forgiveness and then to confide the reward of virtue to obituary gratitude could anything be more innocent perhaps we should say more laudable what man of us has not the privilege of knowing a dozen christian mothers who would do things of nobler enterprise for the sake of their little darlings but now upon the broader gauge which the lady had selected there were two things to be done ere ever the train got to the switches one was to scatter right and left behind and before and up and down wonder hesitancy expectation interrogation commiseration and every other sort of whisper confidential suggestive cumulative as to poor sir cradocks condition the other thing was to find out the effect in the main of his marriagesettlement and this was by far the more difficult already mrs corklemore had done a little business without leaving a tongueprint behind her in the distributory process and if mr rosedew could just have been brought after that rude dismissal to say that he had indeed observed sad eccentricity growing strangeness on the part of his ancient friend why then he would be committed to a line of most telling evidence and the parish half bound to approval but johns high sense of honour and low dislike of georgie had saved him from the neat and neatlybaited trap that morning mr rosedews path was beset with beauty though his daughter failed to meet him inasmuch as she very naturally awaited him on the parish road when he had left the chase and was fetching a compass by the river along a quiet footway elbowed like an old oakbranch overlapped with scraggy hawthorns paved on either side with good intention of primroses there just in a nested bend where the bank overhangs the stream and you would like to lie flat and flip in a trout fly about the end of april over the water came lightly bounding and on a mossy bank alighted young eoa nowell to and fro thats the way i go dont you see uncle john i must only the water is so narrow it scarcely keeps me in practice then your standard my dear must be very high i should have thought twice about that jump in my very best days you indeed said eoa with the most complacent contempt eyeing the parsons thickset figure and anterior development nevertheless replied john with a laugh it is but seven and forty years since i won first prize at sherborne both for the long leap and the high leap and proud enough i was eoa of sixteen feet four inches but i should have had no chance thats certain if you had entered for the stakes but how could i be there uncle john dont you see thirty years before i was born my dear i am quite prepared to admit the validity of your excuse tyrio cothurno child what have you got on oh i found them in an old cupboard with tops and whips and whistles and i made mother biddy take them in at the ancle because i do hate needles so and i wear them not on account of the dirt but because people in this country are so nasty and particular and now they cant say a word against me thats one comfort at any rate she wore a smart pair of poor claytons vamplets and a dark morningfrock drawn tightly in with a little of the skirt tucked up and a black felt hat with an ostrich feather and her masses of hair rolled closely as the bright colour shone in her cheeks and the heartlight outsparkled the sun in her eyes john rosedew thought that he had never seen such a wildly beautiful and yet perfectly innocent creature well i dont know he answered very gravely about your gaiters proving a palladium against calumny but one thing is certain eoa your face will to all who look at you but why dont you ride my dear child if you must have such rapid exercise because they wont let me get up the proper way on a horse me to sit cramped up between two horns as if a horse was a cow me who can stand on the back of a horse going at full gallop but it doesnt matter now much nobody seems to like me for it she spoke in so wistful and sad a tone and cast down her eyes so bashfully that the old man who loved her heartily longed to know what the matter was nobody likes you eoa why everybody likes you you are stealing everybodys heart my amy would be quite jealous only she likes you so much herself i am sure i have more cause to be jealous of her some people like me i know very much but not the people i want to do it oh then you dont want us to do it what harm have we done eoa you dont understand me at all uncle john and perhaps you dont want to do it and yet i did think that you ought to know as the clergyman of the parish but i never seem to have right ideas of anything in this country tell me my dear said mr rosedew taking her hand and speaking softly for he saw two great tears stealing out from the dark shadow of her lashes and rolling down the cheeks that had been so bright but a minute ago tell me as if you were my own daughter what vexes your pure heart so very likely i can help you and i will promise to tell no one oh no uncle john you never can help me nobody in the world can help me but do you think that you ought to know that depends upon the subject my dear not if it is a familysecret or otherwise out of my province but if it is anything with which i have to deal or which i understand oh yes oh yes because you manage you manage allall the banns of matrimony this last word was whispered with such a sob of despairing tantalization that john although he was very sorry could scarcely keep from laughing you need not laugh uncle john you wouldnt if you were in my place or could at all understand the facts of it and as for its being a familysecret ever so many people know it and i dont care two pice who knows it now then let me know it my child perhaps an old man can advise you the child of the east looked up at him with a mist of softness moving through the brilliance of her eyes and spake these unromantic words it is that i do like bob so and he doesnt care one bit for me she looked at the parson as much as to say what do you think of that now i am not at all ashamed of it and then she stooped for a primrose bud and put it into his buttonhole and then she burst out crying upon my word said john upon my word this is too bad of you eoa oh yes i know all that and i say it to myself ever so many times but it seems to make no difference you cant understand of course uncle john any more than you could jump the river but i do assure you that sometimes it makes me feel quite desperate and yet all the time i know how excessively foolish i am and then i try to argue but it seems to hurt me here and then i try not to think of it but it will come back again and i am even glad to have it and then i begin to pity myself and to be angry with every one else and after that i get better and whistle a tune and go jumping only i take care not to see him there you are quite right my dear and i would strongly recommend you not to see him for a month as if that could make any difference and he would go and have somebody else and then i should kill them both well done oriental now will you be guided by me my dear i have seen a great deal of the world yes no doubt you have uncle john and you are welcome to say just what you like only dont advise me what i dont like but tell the truth exactly then what i say is this eoa keep away from him altogetherdont allow him to see you even when he wishes it for a month at least hold yourself far above him he will begin to think of you more and more why you are ten times too good for him there is not a man in england who might not be proud of you eoa when you have learned a little dignity somehow or other none of the rosedews appreciated the garnets yes i dare say but dont you see i dont want him to be proud of me i only want him to like me and i do hate being dignified if you want him to like you do just what i have advised so i will uncle john kiss me now to make it up oh you are such a deardont you think a week would do now chapter v at high noon of a bright cold day in the early part of march a labourer who had been frithing that is to say cutting underwood in one of the forest copses came out into the green track which could scarce be called a lane to eat his wellearned dinner as it happened to be a monday the poor man had a better dinner than he would see or smell again until the following sunday for there as throughout rural england a working man receiving his wages on the saturday evening lives upon a sliding scale throughout the dreary week he has his bit of hot on sunday smacking his lips at every morsel and who shall scold him for staying at home to see it duly boiled and feeling his heart move with the steaming and savoury potlid more kindly than with the dry parson and he wants his old woman long of him he see her so little all the week and she be always besttempered on sundays let the young uns go to school to get larningthough he dont much see the use of it and his father lived happy without itbating that matter which is beyond him let them go and then hear parson and bring home the news to the old folk only let em come home good time for dinner or they had best look out now molly lift the potlid again oh it do smell so good got ever another onion having held high feast on sunday and thanked the lord without knowing it by inhaling happiness and being good to the childrenour lords especial favourites off he sets on the monday morning to earn another eighteenpencetwopence apiece for the young uns and he means to be jolly that day for he has got his pinch of tobacco and two lucifers in his waistcoat pocket and in his frail a most glorious dinner hanging from a hedgestake all the dogs he meets jump up on his back but he really cannot encourage them with his own dog so fond of bones and having the first right to them of course his own dog is not far behind for it is a law of nature admitting no exception that the poorer a man is the more certain he is to have a dog and the more certain that dog is to admire him pretermitting the dog important as he is let us ask of the masters dinner he has a great hunk of cold bacon from the cabbagesoup of yesterday with three short bones to keep it together and a cross junk from the clod of beef out of the same great pot which he will put up a tree for tuesday because if it had been left at home mother couldnt keep it from the children who do scarce a stroke of work yet and only get strong victuals to console them for school upon sundays then upon wednesday our noble peasant of this merry england will have come down to the scraping of bones on thursday he may get bread and dripping from some rich mans house on friday and saturday nothing but bread unless there be cold potatoes and he will not have fed in this fat rich manner unless he be a good workman a hater of publichouses and his wife a tidy body now this labourer who came out of the copse with a fine appetite for his mondays dinner for he had not been spreeing on sunday was no other than jemnot jem pottles of course but the jem who fell from the oakbranch and must have been killed or terribly hurt but for cradock nowells quickness everybody called him jem except those who called him father and his patronymic not being important may as well continue latent now why could not jem enjoy his dinner more thoroughly in the copse itself where the witheys were gloved with silver and gold and the primroses and the violets bloomed and the first of the woodanemones began to star the dead ashleaves in the first place because in the timbertrack happen he might see somebody just to give good day to the chances were against it in such a lonesome place still it might so happen and a man who has been six hours at work in the deep recesses of a wood with only birds and rabbits moving is liable to a gregarious weakness especially at feedingtime furthermore this particular copse had earned a very bad name it was said to be the harbourage of a white and lonesome ghost a ghost with no consideration for embodied feelings but apt to walk in the afternoon in the glimpses of wooded sunshine therefore jem was very uneasy at having to work alone there and very angry with his mate for having that day abandoned him and but that his dread of mr garnet was more than supernatural he would have wiped his billhook then and there and gone all the way to the publichouse to fetch back that mate for company pondering thus he followed the green track as far as the corner of the coppice hedge and then he sat down on a mossy log and began to chew more pleasantly he had washed his hands at a little spring and gathered a bit of watercress and fixed his square of cold bacon cleverly into a mighty hunk of brown bread like a whetstone in its socket and truly it would have whetted any plain mans appetite to see the way he sliced it and the intense appreciation with his mighty claspknife straight not curved like a gardeners he cut little streaky slips along and laid each on a good thickness of crust and patted it like a piece of butter then fondly looked at it for a moment then popped it in with the resolution that the next should be a still better one supposing such excellence possible and all the while he rolled his tongue so and smacked his lips so fervently that you saw the man knew what he was about dealt kindly with his hunger and felt a good dinnerwhen he got it there scratch he cried to his dog after giving him many a taste off and on as in fairness should be mentioned hie in and seek it there lad with that he tossed well in over the hedgefor he was proud of his dogs abilitiesthe main bone of the three summum bonum from a canine point of view and after all perhaps they are right and the flat bone fell it may be a rod or so inside the fence of the coppice scratch went through the hedge in no time having watched the course of the bone in air as a cricketer does of the ball or an astronomer of a comet with his sweet little tail on the quiver but scratch in the coppice was all abroad although he had measured the distance and the reason was very simplethe bone was high up in the fork of a bush and there it would stay till the wind blew now this apotheosis of the bone to the terrier was not proven his views were low and practical and he rushed as all we earthmen do to a lowering conclusion the bone must have sunk into ras bosom being very sharp at one end and heavy at the other the only plan was to scratch for it within a limited area and why was he called scratch but for scarifying genius therefore that dog set to work in a manner highly praiseworthy save indeed upon a flowerbed first he wrought well with his forefeet using them at a trot only until he had scooped out a little hole about the size of a rats nest this he did in several places and with sound assurance but a purely illusory bonus presently he began in earnest as if he had smelled a rat he put out his tongue and pricked his ears and worked away at full gallop all four feet at once in a fashion known only to terriers jem came through the hedge to see what it was for the little dog gave short barks now and then as if he were in a rabbithole with the coney round the corner mun there mun lad show whutt thee carnst do boy thus encouraged scratch went on emulative of selfburial throwing the soft earth high in the air and making a sort of laughing noise in the rapture of his glory after a while he sniffed hard in the hole and then rested and then again at it the master also was beginning to share the little dogs excitement for he had never seen scratch dig so hard before and his mind was wavering betwixt the hope of a pot of money and the fear of finding the skeleton belonging to the ghost scratch worked for at least a quarter of an hour and then ran to the ditch and lapped a little and came back to work again while jem stood by at a prudent distance and puffed his pipe commensurately and wished he had somebody with him presently he saw something shining in the peaty and sandy trough about two feet from the surface something at which scratch tried his teeth but found the subject ungenial so jem ran up making sure this time that it was the pot of money alas it was nothing of the sort nothing at all worth digging for jem was so bitterly disappointed that he laid hold of scratch and cuffed him well and the little dog went away and howled and looked at his bleeding claws and stood penitent with his tail down nevertheless the thing dug up had cost some money in its time for gunmakers know the way to charge if never another soul does it was a pair of gunbarrels without any stock or lock or ramrod heavily battered and marked with fire as if an attempt had been made to burn the entire implement and then the wood being consumed the iron parts had been kicked asunder and the hot barrels fiercely trampled on now jem knew nothing whatever of guns except that they were apt to go off whether loaded or unloaded so after much ponderous thinking and fearingfiat experimentum in corpore vilihe summoned poor scratch and coaxed him and said hie boy vetch thic thur thin when he found that the little dog took the barrels in his mouth without being hurt by them and then dragged them along the ground inasmuch as he could not carry them jem plucked up courage and laid them by to take them home that evening after his bit of supper that night jem and his wife held counsel the result of which was that he took his prize down to roger sweetlands shop at the lower end of the village there he found the blacksmith and one apprentice working overtime repairing a harrow which must be ready for farmer blackers next morning the worthy vulcan received jem kindly for his wife was jems wifes second cousin and then he blew up a sharp yellow fire and examined the barrels attentively niver zeed no goon the likes o thissom though a ave eered say as they makes em now to shut out o tother end man whai her hant gat niver na brichin a must shut the man as shuts wi her what wull e gie vor un roger her baint na gude to ussen gie thee a zhillin lad mare nor her be worth ony to bate up vor harseshoon after vainly attempting to get eighteepence jem was fain to accept the shilling and this piece of beautiful workmanship and admirable damascus twist was set in the corner behind the door to be forged into shoes for a carthorse so as sophocles well observes all things come round with the rolling years the best gunbarrels used to be made of the stubnails and the horseshoes though the thing was a superstition now good horseshoes shall be made out of the best gunbarrels but in despite of this law of nature those gunbarrels never were made into horseshoes at all and for this simple reasonrufus hutton came over from nowelhurst to have his polly shodden meanwhile he would walk up to the hall and see how his child eoa was it is a most worshipful providence and as clever as the works of a watch that all the people who have been far abroad whether in hot or cold climates i mean of course respectively and not that a melville bay harpooner would fluke in with a ceylon rifleman somehow or other when they come home groove into and dovetail with one another and not only feel a pudor not to contradict a brother alien but feel bound by a sacramentum to back up the lies of each other to this rule of course there are some exceptions explosive accidents in the times for instance but almost every one will admit that it is a rule just as it is not to tell out of school as regards rufus and eoa this association was limited as all of them are nowadays except in their powers of swindling strictly limited to a keen and spicily patriarchal turn eoa somehow or other with that wonderful feminine instinct which is far in advance of the canine but not a whit less jealous felt that rue hutton had admired her though he was old enough to be her grandfather in those precocious climates and though she would not have had him if he had come out of golconda mine one stalactite of diamonds she really never could see that rosa had any business with him therefore on no account would she go to geopharmacy lodge and she regarded the baby impending there as an outrage and an upstart dr hutton knew more about shoeing a horse than any of the country blacksmiths and as polly in common with many fast trotters had a trick of throwing her hindfeet inwards and cutting as it is termed in the art she liked to have her hindshoes turned up and her hoofs rasped in a peculiar manner which sweetland alone could execute to her perfect satisfaction ha roger what have you got here said rufus having returned from the hall and inspected pollys new shoes which she was very proud to show him naethin at all yer honour but a bit o a old anshent goon as happed to coom in last avening ancient gun man why it is a new breechloader only terribly knocked about i found it all out in london but there are none in this part of the country how on earth did you come by it and what made you spoil it you stupid in your forgefire her hant a bin in my vargevire if her had herd nivir a coom out alaive her hath bin in a wood vire by the look o the smouk then roger sweetland told rufus hutton as briefly as it is possible for any new forest man to tell anything all he knew about it to which the inquisitive doctor listened with the keenest interest and what will you take for it sweetland of course it is utterly ruined but i might stick it up in my rubbishhole ill tak whutt i gie vor un no mare nor no less though be warth a dale mare by the looks ov un and what did you give for ittwopence as good a croonpace as wor iver cooined putt un barck in carner if a baint worth thart dr hutton was glad to get it for that but the blacksmith looked rather blue when he saw him carefully wielding it turn his mares head towards the copse where poor jem was at work for to lose the doctors custom would make his lie at four shillings premium an uncommonly bad investment and jem was almost sure to let out how much he had got for the gunbarrels after hearing all that jem had to say and seeing the entire process of discovery put dramatically and himself searching the spot most carefully without any further result and which was the main point of all at least in jems opinion presenting the woodman with halfacrown and bidding him hold his tongue rufus hutton went home and very sagely preferred harpocrates to hymen the which resolution was most ungrateful for hymen had lately presented him with a perfect little cupid according to the very best judges including the nurse and the mother and the fuss that was made at the lodge about it for to us men a baby is neuter a heterogeneous vocable unluckily indeclinable really the way everybody went on and worst of all rufus hutton was enough to make a sane bachelor bless the memory of herod however of that no more at present some one was quite awake to all the ridiculous parts of it and perfectly ready to turn it all to profitable account as an admirable reviewer treats the feeble birth of a novel mrs corklemores sympathetic powers were never displayed more brilliantly or to better effect and before very long she had added one and that the primal step to the ascending scale of the amiable monarch for she could manage baby and baby could manage rosa and rosa could manage rufus only rufus was not king of the world except in his own opinion as soon as dr hutton could get away he took the barrels to his own little room and examined them very carefully scarred as they were and battered and discoloured by the fire there could be no question as to their having formed part of a patent breechloading gun even the hinge and the bolt still remained though the wooden continuation of the stock was of course consumed moreover there was no loop for ramrod nor screwthread to take the breeching then rufus went to a little cupboard and took out a very small bottle of a strong and rodent acid and with a feather slightly touched the battered and crusted and rusty bridge in the place where a gunmaker puts his name and for the most part engraves it wretchedly in breechloading guns the bridge itself is only retained from the force of habit and our conservatism of folly for as the breechend is so much thicker than the muzzleend of the barrel and the interior a perfect cylinder the line of sight if meddled with should be raised instead of being depressed at the muzzleend to give us a perfect parallel of course we know that shot falls in its flight and there is no pure pointblank but surely the allowance for and correction of these defeasances according to distance c should be left to the marksmans eye and practice not slurred by a crossing of planes at one particular distance leaving that to wiser heads which already are correcting it by omitting the bridge entirely let us see what dr hutton did as the acid began to work it was very beautiful to watch the clouding and the clearing over the noble but fiercelyabused metal there is no time now to describe itfor which readers will be thankfulenough that the result revealed the makers name and address l crstreet and the number of the gun dr hutton by this time had made the acquaintance of that eminent gunmaker who after improving greatly upon a french design had introduced into this country a rapid and striking improvement an implement of slaughter as far in advance of the muzzleloader as a lucifermatch is of flint and tinder and rufus although with a set design to work out his suspicions would have found it a very much slower work but for a bit of accident he was sauntering along one day from charing cross to the westward looking in at every window as his manner was for he loved all information when suddenly he espied the very moralas the old women saythe exact facsimile of the thing in his waistcoat pocket instantly he entered the shop and asked a number of questions though it was clear that he came to purchase nothing he was received most courteously for it is one of the greatest merits of men who take the lead with us that they scale or skin the british dragon and substitute for john bulls jumble of surliness and serfdom the courtesy of selfrespect then the brevity and simplicity of the new inventionfor everything is new with us during fiveandtwenty years and it took thirty years of persistent work to make covent garden own rhubarball the great advantages which true britons would consider of were pointed out to rufus hutton and he saw them in a moment though of guns he had known but little and now he saw so much of import in his new discovery that he resolved to neglect all other business and start for london the very next morning if rosa could be persuaded to let him without having heard his purpose but in spite of all his eagerness he did nothing of the sort for rufus junior that very night was taken with some infantile ailment of a serious kind and for more than a month the doctor could not leave home for a day even without breach of duty towards his wife and towards the unconscious heir of his orchardhouse and pyramids troubles were closing round bull garnet but he knew nothing of them and to tell the truth he cared not now what the end would be or in what mode it would visit him all he cared for was to defer if it might be so the violence of the outburst the ruin of the household until his darling son should be matured enough of judgment and shaped enough in character to feel and to make others feel that to answer for our own sins is quite enough for the best of us yet there was one other thing which mr garnet fain would see in likely course of settlement ere the recoil of his own crime should sweep upon his children it regarded only their worldly affairs their prospects when he should have none and being the mixture he happened to beso shrewd and so sentimentalhe saw how good it was to exert the former attributive when his children were concerned and the latter and far larger one upon the world at large he had lately made some noble purchase from the government commissionerswho generally can be cheated because what they sell is not their ownand he felt that he was bound by the very highest interests to be a capable grantee till all was signed and sealed and safely conveyed to uses beyond attaint of felony therefore he was labouring hard to infuse some of his old energy into the breasts of lawyerswhich attempt proves the heat of his nature more than would a world of testimony chapter vi why should i care for life or death the one is no good and the other no harm what is existence but sense of self severance for one troubled moment from the eternal unity we disquiet ourselves we fume and pantlo our sorrows are gone like the smoke of a train and our joys like the glimmer of steam why should i fear to be mad any more than fear to die what harm if the mind outrun the body upon the road of return to god and yet we look upon madness as the darkest of human evils how this gliding river makes one think of life and eternity not because the grand old simile lives in every language not because we have read and heard it in a hundred forms and more a savage from the rocky mountains feels the same ideafor ideas strongly stamped pierce into the feelings why does the mind so glide away to some calm sea of melancholy when we stand and gaze intently upon flowing water and the larger the spread of the water is and the grander the march of the current the deeper and more irresistible grows the sadness of the gazer that naval captain so well known as an explorer of the amazon who dined with us at nowelhurst one day last july was a lighthearted man by nature and full of wit and humour and yet in spite of wine and warmth he made the summer twilight creep with the sadness of his stories nevertheless we hung upon them with a strange enchantment we drew more real pleasure from them than from a world of drolleries poor clayton tried to run away for he never could bear melancholy but all he did was to take a chair nearer to the voyager as for me i cried in spite of myself i cried being carried away by the flow of his language so smooth and wide and gliding with the mystery of waters and he was not one of those shallow men who talk for effect at dinnerparties nothing more than a modest sailor leaving his mind to its natural course only he had been so long upon that mighty river that he nevermore could cease from gliding ever gliding with it once or twice he begged our pardon for the sweep of hazy sadness moving like the night on water through his tales and scenery he is gone there again of his own free choice he must die upon that river he loves it more than any patriot ever loved his country betwixt a man and flowing water there must be more than similitude there must be a sort of sympathy taprobin ahoy there ahoy every son of a seacook of you heave us over a rope you lubbers would yer swamp us with parson aboard of me this was mr jupp of course churning up crads weak ideas like a steampaddle in a fishpond perhaps the reason why those ideas had been of such sad obscurity and so fluxed with sorry sentiment was that the vague concipient believed himself to be shipped off for an indefinite term of banishment without even a message from amy whereas in truth he was only going for a little voyage to ceylon in the clipper ship taprobane a for all time at lloyds and never allowed to carry more than twice as much as she could how discontented mortals are he ought to have been jollier than a sandboy for he had a cabin all to himself quite large enough to turn round in and what of all things we britons love best a happy little sinecure he was actually appointedon the strength of his knowledge of goods earned at the cramjam terminus but not through any railway influence being no chip of the board neither any attorneys lovechildif there be such a heterogeny only through john rosedews skill and knowledge of the world cradock was actually made undersupercargo of a vessel bound to the tropics the clipper had passed greenhithe already and none had hailed her or said farewell the taprobane would have no tug she was far too clean in the bows for that work her mother and grandmother had run unaided down the river even back to the fourth generation of ships when the dutchmen held ceylon and doubtless would have kept it but for one great law of nature no dutchman must be thin but even a dutchman loses fat within ten degrees of the line so nature reclaimed her square dutchmen from the tropics which turned them over most likely these regions are meant in the end for the yankee who has no fat to lose and is harder to fry than a crocodile but who can stop to theorize while the taprobane is dancing along under english colours and swings on her keel just in time to avoid running down mr rosedew and issachar mr jupp is combining business with pleasure being as you may say under orders to meet the saucy sally and steer her home from northfleet to the surrey docks so he has taken a lift in a collier and met mr rosedew at gravesend according to agreement and then borrowed a boat to look out alike for saucy sally and taprobane when words and gifts had been interchangedwhat amy sent is no matter now but loo jupp sent a penny baccobox which beat fathers out and out as he must be sure to tell cradock and had am i welcome on it in letters of gold at leastwhen god bless you had been said for the twentieth time and love tied the tongue of gratitude the taprobane layto for a moment and the sails all shivered noisily and the water curled crisply and hissed and bubbled and the little boats hopped merrily to the pipe of the rising wind then mr rosedew came down the side lightly of foot and cleverly while the undersupercargo leaned upon the rail and sorrowfully watched him ponderously then and slowly with his great splay feet thrust into the ropeladder even up to the heel quite at his leisure descended that good bargeman issachar jupp this noble bargee had never been seen to hurry himself on his own account he and his deeds lagged generally on the bight of a long and slack towrope the sailors not entering into his character thought that he was frightened and condemned his apprehensive luminaries in words of a quarter the compass then mr jupp let go with both hands stood bolt upright on the footrope and shook his great fists at them let him catch them ashore at wapping if the devil forewent his due let him catch them that was all thereupon they gave him a round of cheers and promised to square the account please god mr rosedew and the bargeman looked up from the tossing wherry and waved their last farewell the parson reckless of sunday hat and letting his white locks glance and flutter on the cold march wind but cradock made no reply all right govnor said jupp catching hold of the parson no call for you to take on so ive a been the likes o that there mysel in the days when i tuk blue ruin the rattisination of it are to fetch it out of him by travellin and the taprobin are a traveller and no mistake drectly moment i comes to my fortin ill improve self and family travellin zakey to assert his independence as his nature demanded affected a rough familiarity with the man whom he revered the parson allowed it as a matter of course his dignity was not so hollow as to be afraid of sandpaper the result was that issachar jupp every time felt more and more compunction at and less and less of comfort in the unresented liberties as he said goodbye at the landingplacefor he had seen the sally cominghe put out his hand and then drew it back with a rough bow disinterred from longforgotten manners and his raspy tongue thrust far into the coalmine of his cheek but john rosedew accepted his hand and bowed as he would have done to a nobleman even if a baby smiled at him john always acknowledged the compliment for he added christian courtesy and the humility of all thoughtful minds to a certain grand and glorious gift of radiating humanity cradock nowell was loth to be sent away and could not see the need of it but doubtless the medical men were right in prescribing a southern voyage a total change of scene and climate as the likeliest means to reestablish the shattered frame and the tottering mind and so he sailed for the gorgeous tropics where the sun looks not askance where the size of every climbing swimming fluttering or crawling thing save man himself is doubled where life of all things bounds and beatsuntil it is quickly beatenas it never gets warm enough to do in the pinching zones tightbuckled meanwhile john rosedew went to his homea home so loved and fleetingand tried to comfort himself on the road with various elzevirs finding them fail one after another for his mind was not in cue for them he pulled out his little greek testament and read what a man may read every day and never begin to be weary because his heart still yearns the more towards the grand ideal and feels a reminiscence such as plato the divine alone of heathens won john rosedew read once more the sermon on the mount and wondered how his little griefs could vex him as they did that sermon is grander in english far grander than in the greek for the genius of our language is large and strong and simplethe true spirit of the noblest words that ever on earth were spoken how cramped they would be in attic greek like mount athos chiselled in latin how nerveless and alien ours is the language to express and ours the race to receive them what man in later life whose reading has led him through vexed placeswhence he had wiser held aloofdoes not on some little touch brighten and bedew himself with the freshness of the morning thrill as does the leaping earth to see the sun come back again and dashing all his night away open the power of his eyes to the kindness of his father john rosedew felt his cares and fears vanish like the dewcloud among the quivering treetops and bright upon him broke the noon the heaven wherein our god lives earth and its fabrics may pass away but that which came from heaven shall not be without a home meditating comforted strengthened on the way john rosedew came to his little hearth and was gladdened again by little things such as here are given or lent us to amuse our exile life most of us with growing knowledge and keener sense of honesty more strongly desire from year to year that these playthings were distributed more equally amongst us but let us not say equably for who shall impugn the power of contrast even in heightening the zest of heaven amy met him his own sweet amy best and dearest of all girls a thoroughly english maiden not salient like eoa but warmly kind and thoughtful and toned with selfrestraint but even that last she threw to the winds when she saw her father returning and ran with her little feet pattering like sweetgale leaves over the gravel to the unpretentious gate darling father was all she said and perhaps it was quite enough of late she had dropped all her little selfwill which used to vex her aunt so and her character seemed to expand and ripen in the quiet glow of her faithful love thenceforth and for nearly a fortnight amy rosedew if suddenly wanted was sure to be found in a garret whose gablewindow faced directly towards the breadth of sea when a call for her came through the crazy door she would slam up with wonderful speed her own little munich telescope having only two slides and a cylinder but clearer and brighter than highpowered glasses ten stories long perhaps and of london manufacture and then she would confront the appellant with such a colour to be sure and a remark upon the weather as sage as those of our weatherclerks who allow the wind so much latitude that they never contrive to hit it but which of the maids knew not and loved her not the more for knowing that she was a little coastguard looking out for her eau de vie of course she saw fifty taprobanesevery one more genuine than its predecessorand more than fifty cradocks some thirty miles away leaning over hearts of oak with a faint sweet smile waving handkerchiefs as white as their own unsullied constancy and crying with a heavy sigh my native land good night facts however are stubborn things and will not even make a bow to the sweetest of young ladies and the fact was that the ceylon trader fetched away to the southward before a jovial northeast wind and not being bound to say anything to either plymouth or falmouth never came near the field of gentle amys telescope that doctor knew something of his subjectthe triple conglomerate called manwho prescribed for cradock nowell instead of noxious medicinesmedicina a non medendothe bounding ease and buoyant freedom of a ship bound southward go westward and you meet the billows headers all of them staggering faith even in the psalmists description for he was never in the bay of biscay and a wind that stings patriotic tears with the everlasting brine go eastward and you meet the ice or in summer shoals and soundings and a dreary stretch of sandbanks go northward and the chances are that you find no chance of return but go fullsail to the glorious south and once beyond the long crossploughings and headland of the gulf stream you slide into a quiet breast a confidence of waters over which the sun more duly does his work and knows it and under which the growth of beauty clothes your soul with wonder when shall we men leave off fighting cease to prove the darwinian theory and the legends of kilkenny by leaving only our tails behind us a legacy for new lawsuits and in the latter days ask god the reason we were made for when our savage life is done with and we are no longer cannibalsand at present cannibals are perhaps of more practical mind than we for they have an object in homicide and the spit justifies the battlefieldwhen we do at last begin not to hate one another not to think the evil first because in nature prior not to brand as maniacs and marks for paltry satire every man who dares to think that he was not born a weasel and that ferocity is cowardicethen a man of selfrespect may begin to be a patriot at present as our nations are all abusing one another none inquiring none allowing all preferring wrong to weakness if it hit the breed and strain each proclaiming that it is the favoured child of god the only one he looks upon merging his allseeing eye in its squint ambitionat present even we must feel that patriotism is little more than selfishness in a balloon poor cradock wasted so and altered when he left black london that nothing short of womans true love could run him home without check began to feel the change of sky and drink new health from the balmy air and relish the wholesome mindbread leavened with the yeast of novelty a man who can stay in the same old place and work the blessed old and new year at the same old work dwell on and deal with the same old faces receive and be bound to reciprocate the selfsame old ideas without crying out oh bother you without yearning for the seaview or pining for the mountainthat man has either a very great mind or else he has none at all for a very great mind can create its own food fresh as the manna daily or dress in unceasing variety the fruit of other intellects and live thereon amid the grand and evershifting scenery of a free imagination on the other hand a man of no mind gets on quite contentedly having never tasted thoughtfood only wind him up with the golden key every saturday night and oil him with respectability at the sunday service now the undersupercargo of the taprobane was beginning to eat his meals like a man to be pleased with the smell of new tar and the headoverheel of the porpoises and to make acquaintance with sailors of large morality in a word he was coming back by spell and spate to cradock nowell but as yet so merely skewnailed to the pillar of himself that any change of weather caused a gape a gap a chasm give him bright sun and clear sky with a gentle breeze over the water spreading wayward laughter with an amaranth haze just lightly veiling the union of heaven and ocean and a few flyingfish or an albatross for incident in the foregroundand the young man would walk to and fro as briskly and talk as clearly and pleasantly as any one in the ship could but let the sky gather weight and gloom and the sullen sun hang back in it and the bright flaw of wind on the waters die out and the sultry air in oppressive folds lean on the slimy oceanand cradocks mind was gone away like a bat flown into darkness sometimes it went more gradually giving him time to be conscious that his consciousness was departing and that of all things was perhaps the most woeful and distressing it was as if the weak mindfountain bubbled up reproachfully like a geyser overgargled and flushed the thin membrane and cellular tissue with more thought than they could dispose of then he felt the air grow chill and saw two shapes of everything and fancied he was holding something when his hands were empty then the mind went slowly off retreating ebbing leaving shoalground into long abeyance into faintlyknown bayous feebly navigated by the nautilus of memory it is not pleasant but is good now and then to see afar these pretty little drawbacks upon our selfcomplacencyan article imported hourly though in small demand for export however that is of little moment for the home consumption is infinite how noble it is to vaunt ourselves how spirited to scorn as faber him who would be father when a floating gossamer breathed between the hemispheres of our brain makes imperial reason but the rubbish of an imperious flood then the cells and clever casemates rammed home with explosive stuff to blow god out of heaven are no mortar but a limekiln crusted and collapsing after three days fire a stranded cockle dead and stale with the door of his shell a bubble and so ends the philosopher upon a glaring torpid sea a degree or two south of the line the taprobane lay so becalmed that the toss of a quid into the water was enough to drive her windward or leeward whichever you pleased to call it the last of the trade winds being long dead was buried on the log by this time and the sailors were whistling by day and by night and piping into the keys of their lockers but no responsive dimple appeared in the sleek cadaverous cheek of the neverchanging sea what else could one expect they had passed upon the windseyes so adverse a decisionwithout hearing counsel on either sidethat really to escape ophthalmia it must close its eyelids so everything was heavy slumber sleep of parboiled weariness where sea and sky met one anotherif they could do it without movingthe rim of dazzled vision whitened to a talclike glimmer within that circle all was tintless hard as steel yet dull and oily smitten flat with heat and haze not a single place in sky and sea to which a man might point his finger and say to his mate look there no skir of fish not even a sharks fin or a mitching dolphin no dip of wing no life at all beyond the hot rim of the ship or rather now the vessel where many a man lay frying with scarcely any lard left and oh how the tar and the pitch did smell running like a cankered apricottree and the steam of the bilgewater found its way up and reeked through the yawning deckseams but if any man durst look over the side being gifted with an egyptian skull for to any thin head the sunstroke is death when taken upon the crown that daring man would have seen in blue water some twenty fathoms below him a world of life and work and taste complex yet simple more ingenious than his wisest labours for here no rough rivers profane the sea with a flood of turbulent passion like a foul oath vented upon the calm summer twilight neither is there strong indraught from the tossing of distant waters nor rolling leagues of mountain surf as in the indian ocean all is heat and sleep above where the sheer dint of the sun lies but down in the depth of those glassy halls they heed not the fervour of the noonblaze nor the dewy sparkle of starlight typhoon byandby said the first mate yawning but too lazy to stretch under the awning of a sail which they wetted with a hydropult a most useful thing on shipboard as well as in a garden not a bit of it answered the captain looking still more lazy but managing to suck cold punch we shall see was all the mate said it was a deal too hot to argue and he was actually drinking ale english bottled ale hoisted up from a dip in blue water but as hot as the pipes in a pinery the undersupercargo heeded not these laconic interchanges the oppression was too great for him amid that universal blaze and downright pour of stifling heat his mind was gone woolgathering back into the old new forest the pleasant stir of the stripling leaves the shadows weaving their morricedance and trooping away on the grasstufts at the pensive steps of evening the sound and scent of the vernal wind among the blowing gorse the milky splash of the cuckooflower in swarded breaks of woodland the bees in the belfry of cowslips the frill of the white windflower and the fleeting scent of violetsall these in their form and colour moved or lay in their beauty before him while he was leaning against the siderail and it burned his hand to touch it wants a wet swab on his nob said the first mate tersely never come to himself sure as my name is cracklins dont agree with you answered the captain who always snubbed the mate hes a sight better now than at blackwall poor young gent i like him so do i said the mate pouring out more boiling beer but that aint much to do with it theres the wet swab anyhow about an hour before sunset when the sky was purple and the hot vapours piling away in slow drifts like large haycocks walking a gentle breeze came up and made little fingermarks on the water first it awoke shy glances and glosses light as the play upon richlyglazed silk or the glimpse upon motherofpearl then it breathed on the lips of men and they sucked at it as at springwater then it came sliding curling ruffling breaking the image of sky upon sea but bringing earthly life and courage hope and the spirit of motion many a rough and gruff tar shed tears not knowing the least about them only from natures goodwill and power as turpentine flows from the pinewood hearty my lads and bear a hand pipe my eye and be blessed to me they rasped it off with their tarry knuckles and would knock down any one of canine extraction who dared to say wet was the white of their eyes the gurgling of the water sounded like the sobs of a sleeping child as it went dapping and lipping and lapping under the bows and along the run of the sweetlygliding curvature soon you could see the quiet closure of the fluid behind her the fibreing first as of parted hair convergent under the counter the dimples circling in opposite ways on the right and left of the triangle and then the linear ruffles meeting and spreading away in broad white union after a little jostling you may see the same at the tail of a millstream when the water is bright in july and the aldershade falls across it for the sails were beginning to draw again now and the sheets and tacks were tightening and the braces creaking merrily and every bit of manstuff on board felt his heart go and his lungs work therefore all were glad and chaffing as the manner is of britons when the man in the foretop shouted down land upon the portbow i have looked for it all day said the captain i was right to half a league smith the skipper had run somewhat out of his course to avoid a cyclone to the westward but he had not allowed sufficiently for the indraught of the gulf of guinea and was twenty leagues more to the eastward than he had any idea of being nevertheless they had plenty of searoom and now from the trending of the coast might prudently stand due south they had passed cape lopez three days ago of course without having sighted it and had run by the log three hundred miles thence despite the dead calm of that day so they knew that they could not be very far from the mouth of the river congo as they slipped along with that freshening breeze the water lost its brightness and soon became of a yellowish hue as if mixed with a turbulent freshet then they lay to in fifteen fathoms and sent off a boat to the island for the intense heat of the last few days had turned their water putrid the first and second mates were going and the supercargo took his gun and declared that he would stretch his legs and bring home some game for supper what island it was they were not quite sure for there was nothing marked on the charts just there to agree with their reckoning and logrun but they knew how defective charts are when the watercasks were lowered and all were ready to shove off and the mast of the yawl was stepped and the sail beginning to flap and jerk in a most impatient manner cracklins who was a goodnatured fellow hollaed out to cradock come along of us newman old fellow you want bowsing up i see bring your little dog for a run to rout up some rabbits or monkeys for tippler and have a good run yourself my boy without stopping to thinkfor his mind that day had only been a dream to himcradock nowell went down the side with wena on his arm and she took advantage of the occasion to lick his face all over then he shuddered unconsciously at the gun which lay under the transoms look sharp cracklins shouted the captain from his window the glass is down i see half an inch i can only give you two hours all right sir answered the mate but we cant fill the casks in that time unless we have wonderful luck the land lay about a mile away and with the sail beginning to tug and four oars dipping vigorouslyfor the men were refreshed by the evening breeze and wild for a run on shorethey reached it in about ten minutes and nosed her in on a silvery beach strewn with shells innumerable a few dwarf rocks rose here and there and the line of the storms was definite but for inland view there was nothing more than a crescent terrace of palmtrees the air felt beautifully fresh and pure and entirely free from the crawling miasma of the african coast no mangrove swamps no festering mud no reedy bayou of rottenness but the boatcrew found no fresh water at first and they went in three parties to search for it the mate with three men struck off to the right the boatswain with three more made away to the left only cradock and the supercargo walked directly inland wena found several rabbits all of a sandy colour and she did enjoy most wonderfully her little chivies after them most of the birds were going to rest as the rapid twilight fell but the trees were full of monkeys and here and there a squirrel shook the light tracery of the branches tippler and cradock wandered inland for half a mile or more keeping along a pleasant hollow which they feared to leave lest they should lose the way back and as yet they had seen neither spring nor brook although from the growth and freshness they knew that water must be near them then suddenly the supercargo fired his gun at a flying green pigeon whose beauty had caught his eyes to his great amazement cradock fell down utterly helpless pale as a corpse not trembling but in a syncope his comrade tried to restore him but without any effect then managed to drag him part way up the slope and set him with his back to an ebonytree while he ran to fetch assistance suddenly then an ominous sound trembled through the thick wood a mysterious thrill of the earth and air at the coming of war between them it moved the wild grapes the flowering creepers the sinuous caoutchouc the yellow nuts of the palmoiltree and the pointed leaves of the ebony when the supercargo ran down to the boat the men were pushing off hastily the water curling and darkening and a sullen swell increasing a heavy mass of cloud hung to leeward and the tropical night fell heavily till the ship was swallowed up in it jump in tippler just in time cried the first mate seizing the tillerropes not a moment to lose we must go without water we shall have enough out of the sky tonight i could not tell what to do about you and the signals return immediately but i tell you we cant go cracklins poor newman is up there in a fit or something send two men with me to fetch him how far off is he nearly a mile then i darent do it we are risking our lives already the typhoon will be on us in half an hour said so this morningskipper wouldnt listen jump in man jump in or were off without you cant you see how the sea is rising ease off the sheet you lubber there we must down with the sail in two minutes lads soon as ever weve got way on her lend a grip of your black fist julep instead of yawing there like a nigger now will you come or wont you tippler was a brave and kindhearted man but he thought of his wife and children and leaped into the boat although he was not a sailor he saw the urgency of the moment and confessed that nine lives must not be sacrificed for the sake of one the power of the wind was growing so fast and the lift of the waves so menacing that the nine men needed both skill and strength to recover their ship ere the storm burst and a terrible storm it was of the genuine capricorn type sudden deluging laced with blue lightning whirling in the opposite direction to that which our cyclones take at midnight the taprobane was running under bare poles shipping great seas heavily with an electric coronet gleaming and bristling all around truck and dogvane and by that time she was sixty miles from her undersupercargo chapter vii dr huttons baby was getting better and rosa who had been as the nurse said losing ground so sadly poor dear was beginning to pick up her crumbs again therefore rufus who in common with rosa and all the rest of the household regarded that baby as the noblest and grandest sublimation of humanity if not as the final cause of this little worlds existence was beginning now to make up his mind that he really might go to london that week without being as his wife declared he must be if he even thought about it cruel inhuman unfatherly utterly void of all sense of duty not to say common affection and she knew quite well what he wanted all he wanted was to go and see mr riverss peachtrees in blossom as if that was such a sight as her baby yes her baby mas own darling a dove of a dumpling dillikins to think that his own pa should prefer nasty little trees without a hair on them and that didnt even know what bo meant to the most elegant love of a goldylocks that ever was was was master goldylocks had received from another quarter a less classical and less pleasing but perhaps from an objective point of view a more truthful and unprismatic description of the hair it pleased god to give him governors carrots and no mistake cried mrs ogaghan the moment she saw him which of course was upon his first public appearancecatch biddy out of the way when any baby of any father or mother she had ever heard of was submitted even to the most privileged inspectionknew he must have em of course you niver can conquer that maam if your own hair was like a sloe and you tuk me black briony arl the time hould him dacent will ye nurse not slot his head down that fashion he dont want more blood in his hair child oh yes i can see maam niver knowed more nor two wi that redhot poker colour colour of the red snuff they calls irish blackguard in the top of a hot shovel and one of the two were mr hutton maam saving your presence to spake of it and the other were of tim brady as were hung at the crossroads near clonmel for cutting the throat of his grandmother oh mary take her away what a horrid woman here mrs ogaghan was marched away amid universal indignation which she could not at all understand but she long had borne against rufus hutton the bitterest of all bitter spites such as only an irishwoman can bear for the exposure of her own great mistake and the miserable result which as she fully believed had sprung from all his meddling and yet she was a goodhearted woman but a good heart is only the wad upon powder when a violent will is behind it not to attach undue importance to biddys prepossessions yet to give every facility for a verdict upon the question i am bound to state what an oldyoung lady growing every month more satirical because nobody would have her yet quite unconscious that the one drawback was the main cause of the other for all men hate sarcastic womenhow tersely she expressed herself ridiculous likeness was he born with two cheroots in his mouth but a lady who would marry for ever because she was so soft and nice came to see darling baby again the moment she was quite assured that he was equal to the interview having denied herself from day to day although it had affected her appetite and was telling upon her spirits neither would she come alonethat would be too selfish she must make a gala day of it and gratify her relatives so mrs hutton had the rapture of sitting behind her bedroom curtain and seeing no less than three carriages draw up in a thundering manner while rufus was in the greatest fright that they would not find room to turn but must cut up his turf luckily the roller was in the way or else those great coachmen who felt themselves lowered by coming to a place of that size would have had their revenge on the sod the three carriages were of course that of nowelhurst hall in the van no pun if you please with two noble footmen behind it and georgie in state inside then the kettledrum rattletrap as the hypercritical termed it with mr kettledrum driving and striking statuesque attitudes for the benefit of the horses and mrs kettledrum inside entreating him not to be rash last of all the coo nest equipage a very neat affair with mr corklemore inside wanting to look at his wife in the distance and wondering what she was up to oh such shocking taste i know cried georgie directly the lower order were supposed to be out of hearing horribly bad taste to come in such force but what could we do dr hutton there was my sister there was my husband there was my own silly self all waiting as for a bulletin to know when baby would receive and so at the very first moment by some strange coincidence here we are all at once and i do hope darling rosa will allow some of us to come in jonah shouted rufus hutton going away to the door very rudely according to our ideas but with angloindian instincts see that all those men have beer plaise sir there baint none left brewer haint a been since you drank as every one in the house heard this dear georgie had some revenge however babe rufus received his ovation and the whole thing went off well as most things do in the counties of england when plenty of good wine produces itself lunch was ready in no time and as all had long ago assented to mrs corklemores most unselfish proposition that she as privileged of pet rosa should just steal upstairs for a minute and then come down againafter giving notice of course that dear baby should have all his lace onthe pleasant overture of the host was accepted with little coyness let us suppose that we have dined because the roads are so very bad let us venture upon a light dessert i have a few pears even now in april which i am not altogether afraid to submit to the exquisite taste of ladiesmadame millet and josephine may we think that we have dined as the company not only thought but felt that they had made an uncommonly good dinner this little proposal did pleasant violence to their sense of time it would be so charmingly novel to think that they had dined at three oclock oh people of brief memory for kettledrum hall and coo nest loved nothing better than to dine at two which perhaps is two hours too late according to nature versus fashion for such an occasion as this said rufus under all the excitement of hospitality multiplied by paternity we will have a wine worth talking of clicquot of course and paxarette for the ladies if they prefer it which perhaps they will do because it is sweeter than port but i do hope that some will deign to taste my presidents unrefreshed georgies pretty lip came out like the curl of an opening convolvulus to think of offering her sweet wine when choice port was forthcoming there are few better judges of a good glass of port than mrs nowell corklemore port sir for my wife if you please she likes a rather dry wine sir but with plenty of bouquet there is no subject i may say in which she hasha hawa more profound capacity my dear nowell why you are perfectly calumnious thank you no champagne it spoils the taste ofyour beautiful water how dreadfully we were alarmed in ringwood we all but drove over a child what a providential escape i have scarcely yet recovered it it has made me feel so nervous what dr hutton port for a lady at this time of day and not ordered medically thereupon of course rufus prescribed it till georgie being quite overcome by the colour as the host himself decanted it capitulated at last for strictly half a glass after a little the ladies withdrew to see double perfections in the baby and mrs hutton who knew quite well what they had been doing while she was discussing arrowroot received them at first rather stiffly but she had no chance with georgie who entered beautifully into the interesting room and exclaimed with great vivacity oh dear mrs hutton as the little boys say here we are again and so glad to get away because your husband is so hospitable and we thought of you all the time i wanted so much to bring you a glass of that very exquisitelet me see i think it must have been port though i never know one wine from anotheronly i feared it might seem rude if i had ventured to propose it of course dr hutton knew best of course he didnt said rosa pettishly he never thought about it not that i would have taken it oh dear no ladies cannot have too little wine i think it seems to make them so masculine well dear you know best very likely you heard us laughing i assure you we were quite merry we drank his health three times threedont they call it about a baby and i was nearly proposing yours only a gentleman ought to do that oh it was so interesting and the wine superbat least so said the gentlemen i do wish they had brought you some dear i am very glad they did not it is so very lowering to a fine sense of the ideal i heard you laughing or making some noise only i was so absorbed in these lovely poems to my babe is so very beautiful so expressive so elevating i feel every single word of it and this sonnet about the first cropper and the stanzas to his little red shoes terminating with pinch his nose you have had so many husbands dear you must know all about it my darling child how i feel for you but in all probability he will come up when both decanters are empty let him find you in a good temper dear but this which must have grown into a row for georgie had even more spirit than tact and rosa was equal to anything all this evil was averted and harmony restored by the popping in of nurse who had not taken her halfcrowns yet but considered them desirable and saw them now endangered goldylocks goldylocks oh bring him here nurse skillikins dillikins oh such a dove and if nobody else cares for poor mamma he has got so much better taste hasnt he goldylocks very soon proved that he had and georgie having quite recovered her temper admired him so ecstatically that even his mother thought her judgment was really worth something give him to me i cant do without him o you beautiful cherub kicklewick i am sure you never saw any one like him that indeed i never did maam answered nurse kicklewick holding her arms out as if she must have him back again many a fine child i have seen and done for to my humble ability maam since the time i were at lord elderguns and her ladyship said to mekicklewick says she oh his love of a noseyposey oh then his bootiful eyes dick dock and then his golden hair you know so lovely chaste and rare you know will um have a danceyprancey and georgie forgetting all dignity went through a little polish dance with the baby in her arms to his very grave amazement and the delight of all beholders although of the genuine hutton strain he was too young to crow yet nevertheless he expressed approval in the most emphatic watercolours mrs huttons heart was won for ever oh darling i am so obliged to you he has positively popped two bubbles a thing he never did before how can i ever repay you by letting me come over and dance him twice a week oh that i only had a boybecause i do love boybabies so one would think that you must have had fifty at least before you were fiveandtwenty how on earth do you understand him so i only know half what he means though i try for hours and hours simply by sympathizing with him i feel all his ideas come home to me and i put them into shape you are the loveliest creature i ever saw and indeed georgie did look very well for it was not all mere humbug now though perhaps it was at first oh no wonder baby loves you kicklewick isnt it wonderful indeed then and it would be maam replied mrs kicklewick rapturouslyfor now she had four halfcrowns in her pocketonly for it bein nature maam nature it is as does it as must be nothing else no good again it and how i should like to belong of you maam when your next time come please god would you mind to accept of my card maam unpretenshome but in good familiessarah kicklewick late to lord eldergun and have hopes to be again maam if any confidence in headfootman mrs kicklewick he says and me upon the bridge maam with the wind a blowin to be sure said georgie and the water flowing how clearly you describe it but we must cut her short even as she cut nurse kicklewick enough that she won such influence over the kind but not too clever rosa that rufus huttons plans and acts so far as they were known to his wife were known also to his wifes best friend but one thing there was which mrs corklemore could not at all understandwhy should he be going to london so and wanting to go again in spite of domestic emergencies she very soon satisfied herself that rosa was really in the dark upon this point and very indignant at being so this indignation must be fostered and pointed to a practical end mrs kettledrum of course had been kept in the background all this time and scarcely allowed to dandle the baby for fear of impairing her sisters triumph how wonderfully kind and thoughtful of you said rosa as georgie came in again have you really brought me a glass of wine and no one else in the house to suppose that i ought to have any nourishment how can i thank you mrs corklemore no more mrs corklemore if you please i have begun to call you rosait is such a pretty nameand you must call me georgie darling every one does who loves me then i am sure all the world must dearest georgie how did you get it i am sure i would not touch it only for your sake oh i did such a shameful thing such a liberty i never took before i actually sent the servant to say with mrs corklemores compliments that she felt the effect of the fright this morning and would like another glass of port but would not touch it if any of the gentlemen left the table even for a moment and they actually sent me a dockglass in pleasantry i suppose but i am very glad they did i will take some if you take half dear not a drop my poor weak head is upset in a moment but you really need it dear and i can so thoroughly feel for you because the poor count when my flore was born waited on me with such devotion day and night hand and foot and i am sure mr corklemore must do the same no husband could help adoring you oh he is very good according to his lights as they say but i have known him let me cough three times without getting up for the jujubes and oncebut perhaps i ought not to tell you it was so very bad oh you may safely tell me dear i will never repeat it to any one he actually allowed me to sneeze in the carriage without saying that i must have a new fur cloak or even asking if i had a cold oh dear is that all i may sneeze six times in an hour and my husband take no notice but run out and leave the front door open and prune his horrid little trees and then he shouts for his patent topdressing he thinks far more of dressing them than he does of dressing me and dont you know the reason dont cry sweet child dont cry i have had so much experience i understand men so thoroughly oh yes i know the reason i am cross to him sometimes and of course i cant expect a man with a mind like his you may expect any man to be as wise as solomon if you only know how to manage him it is part of the law of nature then i am sure i dont know what that means except that people must get married and ought to love one another the law of nature is this between a wife and a husband there never must be a secret except when the lady keeps one now your husband is to some extent a rather superior man oh yes to the very greatest extent no one of any perception can help perceiving that then he is quite sure to attempt it to reserve himself upon some point in an unsympathetic attitude this is just what you must not allow you have no idea how it grows upon them and how soon it supplants affection and makes a married man a bachelor oh how dreadful but i really do think dear that you must be wrong this once my husband has never kept anything from me anything i mean which i ought to know then he told you about that poor wild polly how very good and kind of him polly what polly you dont mean to say no no dear nothing of that sort only the mare running away with him at night through the thickest part of the forest my polly that eats from my hand run away with rufus yes your polly a perfect miracle that both of them were not killed but of course he must have told you then after sundry ejaculations rosa learned all about that matter and was shocked first and then thankful and then hurt and now said mrs corklemore when the sense of wrong was paramount he has some secret i am almost sure about our sad affair at nowelhurst and i am sure even if you were not his wife dear he need not conceal any matter of that sort from the daughter of sir cradock nowells old friend mr ralph mohorn i will tell you another thing answered rosa shaking all her pillows with the vehemence of her emotions whether he ought or not he shall not do it georgie darling as sure as i am his lawful wife i will know every word of it before i sleep one wink if not he must take the consequences upon both his wife and child darling i think you are quite right only dont tell me a word of it it is such a dreadful matter it would make me so unhappy i will tell you every single word just to prove to you georgie that i have found the whole of it out after this laudable resolution rosa may be left to have it out with rufus it requires greater skill than ours to interfere between man and wife even without the tertium quid of an astounding baby the ides of march were come and gone the balance of day and night was struck and sleep the queen of half the world had wheeled across the equator her poppychintzed throne or had got the stars to do it for her because she was too lazy ha that sentence is almost worthy of a great stumporator all i mean to say is that all fools day was over blessed are the all fools who begin the summer which accounts for its being a mull with us and blessed be the all saints who begin the winter and then hand it over to beelzebub in april she tunes her bill several nightingales were at it for the spring was early and right early were many nests conned planned and contracted for blessed birds that never say what are your expectations sir or how much will you give your daughterbut feather their nests without waiting for an appointment in the treasury nesteggs too almost as sweet as those of addled patronage were beginning to accumulate and it took up half a birds time to settle seniority and precedence among them fettle them all with their heads the right way and throw overboard the cracked ones perhaps in this last particular they exercised a discretion not only unknown to but undreamed of by any british government it was nearly dark by this time and two nightingales across the valley strove in amoiban song till the crinkles of the opening leaves fluttered with soft melody in poplar shadows philomel complaineth of her brood her callow nestlings plunderd from her by the ploughman rude from lonely branch all night she pours her weeping musics flow repeats her tale and fills the world with melody and woe georg iv mr garnet heeded neither crisp young leaf nor bulbul neither did his horse appear to be a judge of music man and horse were drooping flagging jaded and bespent wanting only the two things which according to some philosophers are all that men want here belowa little food and a deal of sleep bull garnet was on his return from winchester whither he now went every week for some reason known only to himself or at least unknown to his family it is a long and hilly ride from the west of ytene to winton and to travel that distance twice in a day takes the gaiety out of a horse and the salience out of a man no wonder then that mr garnet slouched his heavy shoulders and let his great head droop for at fiveandforty a powerful man jades sooner than does a slight one presently he began to drowse for the stout grey gelding knew every step of the road and would take uncommonly good care to avoid all circumambience and of late the rider had never slept only dozed and dreamed and started then he muttered to himself as he often did in sleep but never at home until he had seen to the fastening of the door tried it againtried very hard and failed thought of bob at last moment bob to stand and see me hangand hate me and go to the devil no i dont think he would hate me though he would say father could not help it and how nice that would be for me to see bob take my part to see him with his turndown collars standing proudly up and saying father was a bad manaccording to your ideasi am not going to dispute thembut for all that i love him and so my children shall if i could be sure that bob would only think so only make his mind up his mind up his mind upfor there is nothing like itwhoa grayling what be looking atand take poor little pearl with him i would go tomorrow morning and do it over at lymington best do it tonight govnor no time like the praysent and us knows arl about it a tall man had leaped from behind a tree and seized bull garnets bridle the grey gelding reared and struck him but he kept his hold till the muzzle of a large revolver felt cold against his ear then issachar jupp fell back he knew the man he had to deal with how stern in his fury how reckless despite the better part of him and issachar was not prepared to leave his loo an orphan no man robs me cried mr garnet in his most tremendous voice except at the cost of my life and the risk of his i have seven and sixpence about me i will give it up to no man neither will i shoot any man unless he tries to get it nubbody wants to rob you govnor only to have a little rattysination with you possible you know me now bull garnet fell back in his saddle he would rather have met a dozen robbers by the voice he recognised a man whom he had once well known and had good cause to knowthrough his outrage upon whom he had left the northern counties the man whom he had stricken headlong down a coalshaft as the leader of rebellion the night after pearl was christened nigh twenty years ago yes i know you jupp your name is small credit it is to know you and smarler still to know you bull garnet try your pistol thing if you like you must have rare stommick i should think to be up for another murder issachar i am sorry for you do you call it a murder to keep such a fellow as you off no i dunna carl that a murder because i be arl alive but i do carl a murder what you did to young clayton nowell fool what do you know of it let go my horse i say you know pretty well what i am i know you hant much patience govnor and be arlways in a hurry jupp hesitated but would not be beaten whatever might be the end of it i am in no hurry now jupp i will listen to all you have to say but not with your hand on my bridle there goeth free then arl knows you be no liar i am glad you remember that issachar hold the horse while i get off now throw the bridle over that branch and i will sit down here come here into the moonlight man and look me in the face here is the pistol for you if you bear me any revenge scarcely knowing what he did because he had no time to think jupp obeyed bull garnets orders even to the lastfor he took the pistol in his hand and tried to look straight at his adversary but his eyes would not cooperate then he laid the pistol on the bank but so that he could reach it issachar jupp said mr garnet looking at him steadily and speaking very quietly have you any children only onea leetle gal but an oncommon good un how old is she five year old plase god come next valentines day now when she grows up and is pure and good would you like to have her heart broken id break any coves head as doed it but supposing she were betrayed and ruined made a plaything and then thrown awaywhat would you do then god almighty knows man i cant abide to think of it and if thethe man who did it was the grandson of the man who had ruined your own mother lied before god in the church to her and then left her to go to the workhouse with you his outcast bastardwhile he rolled in gold and laughed at herwhat would you do then jupp by the god that made me id have my revenge if i went to hell for it i have said enough do exactly as you please me you cannot help or harm death is all i long foronly for my children still he looked at issachar but now without a thought of him only as a man looks out upon the sea or sky expecting no return and issachar jupp so dense and pigheadedsurly and burly and weaseleyedin a word retrospectively britishgazing at bull garnet then got some inkling of an anguish such as he who lives to feelfar better were it for that man that he had never been born chapter viii to bar the entail of crime a bitter and abortive task at least in this vindictive world where christians dwell more on mount sinai than on the mount that did not quake and burn with fire and yet for this and little else still clung to fair fame and life the man who rather would have lain beneath the quicklime of newgate it was not for the empty part the reputation the position the respect of those who prove the etymon of the word by truly looking backwardnot for these alone nor mainly did bull garnet bear the anguish now from month to month more bitter deeper less concealable he strove with himself and checked himself and bit his tongue and jerked back his heart and nursed that shattered lie his life if so might be that pearl and bob should start anew in another land with a fair career before them not that he cared more than he could help whether they might be rich or poor only that he would like them to have the chance of choosing this chance had not been fair for him forsaken as he was and outcast banned by all the laws of men because his mother had been trustful and his father treacherous yet against all chances he by his own rightful power deeply hating and which was worse conscientiously despising every social prejudice made his way among smaller men taught himself by day and night formed his own strong character with the hatred of tyranny for its base and tyranny of his own for its apex and finally gained success in the world and large views of christianity and in all of this he was sincere it was a vile and bitter wrong to which he owed his birth sir cradock nowell the father of the present baronet had fallen in love of some sort with a comely yorkshire maiden whose mothers farm adjoined the moors whereon the shooting quarters were then in that period of mean license when fashionable servility was wriggling like a cellarslug in the slimetrack of low princes sir cradock nowell did what few of his roystering friends would have thought ofunfashionable tarquinian he committed a quiet bigamy he had lived apart from lady nowell even before her second confinement because he could not get on with her so miss garnet went with him to the quiet altar of a little yorkshire church and fancied she was lady nowell only that must be a secret because they had not the kings consent for he was not in a state to give it when she learned her niddering wrong and the despite to her unborn child she cast her curse upon the race not with loud rant but long scorn and went from her widowed mother to a cold and unknown place so soon as bull garnet was old enough to know right from wrong and to see how much more of the latter had fallen to his share two courses lay before him two i mean were possible to a strong and upright nature to a false and weak one fifty would have offered and a little of each been taken conscious as he was of spirit energy and decision he might apply them all to very ungenial purposes to sarcasm contemptuousness and general misanthropy or else he might take a larger view pity the poor oldfashioned prigs who despise a man for his fathers fault and generously adapt himself to the broadest christianity the latter course was the one he chose in solid earnest too because it suited his nature and so perhaps we had better say that he chose no course at all but had the wiser one forced upon him yet the old adam of damnable temper too often would rush out of paradise and prove in strong language that he would not be put off together with his works exeter hall would have owned him in spite of all his backslidings as a very faradvanced christian because he was so evangelical and yet he never dealt in cant nor distributed idyllic tracts sabbatarian pastorals where godly thomas meets drunken john and converts him to the diluted vappa of an unfermented sunday and now this man whom all who knew him either loved or hated felt the troubles closing around him and saw that the end was coming he had kept his own sense of justice down while it jerked like a thistle on springs in his heart he had worn himself out with thinking for ever what would become of his children whom he had wronged more heavily than his own bad father had wronged himonly the difference was that he loved them and most of all he had let a poor fellow whom he liked and esteemed most truly bear all the brunt all the misery all the despair of fratricide now all he asked for all he prayed forand indeed he prayed more than ever now and with deeper feeling though many would have feared to do itnow his utmost hope was to win six months of life in that time all might be arranged for his childrens interest his purchase of those five hundred acres from the crown commissionersall good land near the romseyroad but too full of juicewould soon be so completed that he could sell again at treble the price he gave so well had he reclaimed the land while equitably his and then bob should have half and pearl take half because she had been so injured and starting with the proceeds of all his earthly substance before it should escheat be happy in america and think fondly of dead father this was all he lived for now it may seem a wild programme but practical as he was in business and not to be wronged of a halfpenny bull garnet was vague and sentimental when he took on about his children furious if they were wronged loving them as the cow did who without a horn to her head pounded dead the leopard ready to take most liberal views of everything beyond them yet keeping ever to his eyes that parental lens whose focus is so very short and therefore by the optic laws its magnifying power and aberration glorious now three foes were closing round him all of whom by different process and from different premises had arrived at the one conclusion the three were as he knew too well rufus hutton issachar jupp and mr chope of southampton of the first he held undue contempt not knowing all his evidence the second he had for the time disarmed by an appeal ad hominem the third was the most to be feared the most awful because so crafty keen and deep so utterly impenetrable mr chope the partner and brains of cole the coroner was absent upon a lawyers holiday at the time of the inquest when he came home and heard all about it and saw the place and put questions he scarcely knew what to think only upon one point he was certainthe verdict had been wrong either cradock nowell had shot his brother purposely or some one else had done so to chopes clear intuition and thorough knowledge of firearmsfor his one relaxation was shootingit was plain as possible that there had been no accident to the people who told him about the cartridge balling he expressed no opinion but to himself he said pooh i have seen cradock nowell shoot he always knew all he was doing he never would put a green cartridge into his gun for a woodcock and the others very seldom ball and even if he had a green cartridge look at the chances against it i would lay my life clayton nowell was shot on purpose then of course mr chope set to not only with hope of reward but to gratify his own instinct at the puzzle and wards of the question if he had known the neighbourhood well and all the local politics he must have arrived at due conclusion long before he did but a heavy piece of conveyancing came into the office of cole chope and co and being far more lucrative than amateur speculations robbed them of their attention but now that stubborn piece was done with and mr chope again at leisure to pursue his quest twice or thrice every week he was seen walking in his deliberate way as if every step were paid for through the village of nowelhurst and among the haunts of the woodcutters he carried his great head downwards as a bloodhound on the track does but raised it and met with a soft sweet smile all who cared to look at him in his hand he bore a fishingrod and round his hat some troutflies and often he entered the village inn and had bread and cheese in the taproom though invited into the parlour although his boots were soaked and soiled as if he had been wading and the landingnet slung across his back had evidently been dripping he opened to none his fishing creel neither had any trout fried but spoke in a desponding manner of the shyness of the fish and the brightness of the water and vowed every time that his patience was now at last exhausted as none could fish in that neighbourhood without asking sir cradocks permission or trespassing against him and as the old baronet was most duly tenacious of all his sporting rights everybody wondered what mark stote was about to allow a mere farcomer to carry on so in nowelhurst water but mark stote knew a great deal better what was up than they did four or five times now bull garnet riding on his rounds of business had met simon chope and bowed politely to him on the first occasion mr chope knowing very little of garnet and failing to comprehend him as we fail at first sight with all antipodes lost his slow sequacious art because he overriddled it all very cunning men do this even my lord bacon but never our brother shakespeare but mr garnet read him truly and his purpose also by the aid of his own consciousness and a thrill of deep cold fear went through that hot and stormy heart nevertheless he met the case in his usual manner and puzzled mr chope on the third or fourth encounter by inviting him to dinner the lawyer found some ready plea for declining this invitation sleuth and coldblooded as he was he could not accept hospitality to sift his host for murder of course mr garnet had foreseen the refusal of this overture but it added to his general alarm even more than it contributed to his momentary relief clearly enough he knew or felt that now he was running a race against time and if he could only win that race and give the prize to his children how happily would he yield himself to his only comfortdeath with his strong religious viewsright or wrong who shall dare to say for the matter is not of reasonhe doubted gods great mercy to him in another world no more than he doubted his own great love to his own begotten and sad it was enough to move the tears of any stoic to behold bull garnet now sitting with his children instead of being shy and distant as for a while he had been when the crime was new upon him he would watch them word by word smile by smile or tear for tear as if he never could have enough of the little that was left to him they had begun to talk again carelessly in his presence as the manner of the young is bob had found that the vague dark cloud of whose origin he knew nothing was lifted a little and lightened and pearl who knew all about it was trying to slip from beneath its shadow with the selfpreservation of youth and into the longobscured but native sunlight of a daughters love and all the while their father the man of force and violence would look from one to the other of them perceiving with a curious smile little traits of himself often amused at and blessing them for their very sage inexperience thinking to show how both were wrong yet longing not to do it and then he would begin to wonder which of them he loved more deeply pearl had gained upon him so by the patience of her wrong by coming to the hearth for shelter from the storms of outer love in all races against time luck itself the child of time is apt to govern the result more than highest skill may so far most of the luck had been in mr garnets favour the approach of unlucky cradock that day the distraction of his mindthe hurried and jostled aim which even misled himself the distance of john rosedew the blundering and timid coroner and the softhearted jury even the state of the weather and since that time the perversion and weakness of the fathers mind all these had prevented that close inquiry which must have led to either his conviction or confession for of course he would have confessed at once come what might if an innocent man had been apprehended for his guilt only in one important matterso far at least as he knew yet not having heard of jems discovery and mr huttons advance upon ithad fortune been against him that one was the crashing of his locked cupboard and the exposure of the broken guncase to rufus huttons eyes and now it was an adverse fate which brought mr chope upon the stage and yet it was a kindly one which kept him apart from hutton for simon chope and rufus hutton disliked one another heartily as the old repulsion is between cold blood and hot blood as it happened mr chope was mrs corklemores pet lawyer he had been employed to see that she was defrauded of no adequate rights uxorial upon her second marriage and uncommonly good care he took to secure the lions share for her indeed had it been possible for him to fall in love at all with anything but money that foolish lapse would have been his at the very first sight of georgie sweetly innocent and good she did so sympathize with to wit whereas and notwithstanding she entered with such gush of heart into the bitter necessity of making many folios and charging for every one of them which the depravity of human nature has forced on a class whose native bias rather tends to poetry she felt so acutely when all was made plain to her and mr corklemore paid the bill how very very wrong it was not to have implicit confidencein being cheated under her breath and that shaft was cupids to mr chopein a word he was so smitten that he doubled all his charges and inserted an especial power of appointment for mr corklemore having the gout he looked on her as his reversion hang it he said for his extreme idea of final punishment was legal hang it if i married that woman our son would be lord chancellor i never saw such a liar now it was almost certain that under sir cradock nowells settlement upon marriage an entail had been created the lawyers who do as they like in such matters and live in a cloud of their own breath are sure to provide for continuance and the bills of their grandchildren alas how sad thought georgie as she lay back in the nowelhurst carriage on her way to cole chope and co how very sad if it should be so then there will be no cure for it but to get up the evidence meet the dreadful publicity and get the poor fellow convicted and they say he is so goodlooking perhaps i hate ugly people so much because i am so pretty oh how i wish mr corklemore walked a little more like a gentleman but as a sacred duty to my innocent darling i must leave no stone unturned fully convinced of her pure integrity georgie drove up in state and style to the office of cole chope and co somewhere in southampton she would make no secret of it but go in sir cradock nowells carriage and then evilminded persons could not misinterpret her mr chope alone could tell her as she had said to uncle cradock with a faint hope that he might let slip something what really was the nature and effect of her own marriagesettlement things of that sort were so far beyond her so distasteful to her sufficient for the day was the evil thereof she could sympathize with almost any one but really not with a person who looked forward to any disposal of property unless it became for the sake of the little ones a matter of strict duty and even then it must cause a heartpangoh such a bitter heartpang coles brains was not the man to make himself too common he always required digging out like a fossil from three or four mural septa being disinterred at last from the innermost room after winks and nods and quiet knocks innumerable he came out with both hands over his eyes because the light was too much for him he had been so hard at work and the first thing he always expressed was surprise even though he had made the appointment mr simon chope attorney and solicitor was now about fiveandthirty years old a squarebuilt man just growing stout with an enormous head and a frizzle of hair which made it look still larger there was a depth of gravity in his paperwhite countenanceslightly marked with smallpoxa power of not laughing such as we seldom see except in a man of great humour who says odd things but rarely smiles till every one else is laughing but if chope were gifted as he may have been with a racy vein of comedy nobody ever knew it he was not accustomed to make a joke gratis neither to laugh upon similar terms at the jokes of other people tremendous gravity quiet movements very clear perception most judicious reticencethese had been his characteristics since he started in life as an officeboy and these would abide with him until he got everything he wanted if any man ever does that with many a bow and smile expressing surprise delight and deference mr chope conducted to a special room that lady in whom he felt an interest transcending contingent remainder mrs corklemore swam to her place with that ease of movement which was one of her chief fascinations and fixed her large grey eyes on the lawyer with the sweetest expression of innocence i fear mr chopeoh where is my husband he promised to meet me herei fear that i must give you oh so much trouble again but you exerted yourself so very kindly on my behalf about eighteen months ago that i cannot bear to consult any other gentleman even in the smallest matter my services such as they are shall ever be at the entire disposal of madame la comtesse mr chope would always address her so a countess once a countess for ever was his view of the subject moreover it ignored mr corklemore whom he hated as his supplanter and best reason of all the lady evidently liked it you are so very kind i felt sure that you would say so but in this case the business is rather mr corklemores than my own but he has left it entirely to me having greater confidence perhaps in my apprehension she knew of course that so to disparage her husband by implication was not in the very best taste but she felt that mr chope would be pleased as she quite understood his sentiments and not without excellent reason answered the lawyer softly if any lady would be an ornament to our profession it is madame la comtesse oh no mr chope oh no i am so very simple and i never should have the heart to do the things you are compelled to do but to return this little matter in which i hope for your assistance is a trifling exchange of mixed land with sir cradock nowell ah to be sure said chope feeling slightly disappointed for he had some idea that the question would be more lucrative if you will give me particulars it shall have our best attention i think i have heard said georgie knowing thoroughly all about it that there is some mode of proceeding under some act of parliament which lightens perhaps to some extent the legal difficultiesand oh yes the expenses mrs corklemore knew how mr chope had drawn her a very long billupon his imagination oh of course replied mr chope smitten yet more deeply with the legal knowledge and full of the future lord chancellor there is a rough and ready way of dealing with almost anything what they call a statutory proceeding shockingly careless and haphazard and most ungermainely thrust into an enclosure act but we never permit any clients of ours to imperil their interests so for the sake perhaps of half a sovereign there is such a deal of quackery in all those dabblesome interferences with ancient institutions for security for comfort of mind for scientific investigation there is nothing like the exhaustive process of a good common law conveyance look at a proper abstract of title a charming thing to contemplate and still more charming if possible the requisitions upon it when prepared by eminent counsel but the tendency of the present age is to slur and cut short everything melancholy most melancholy especially for the legal gentlemen i suppose mr chope yes it does hurt our feelings so to see all the grand safeguards invented by men of consummate ability swept away like old rubbish i even heard of a case last week where a piece of land sold for l actually cost the purchaser only l for conveyance oh how disgraceful cried georgie so nicely that chope detected no irony and now i presume if we proceed in the ordinary way we must deliver and receive what you call abstracts of title quite so quite so whichever way you proceed it is a most indispensable step it will be my duty and privilege to deduce mr corklemores title and mr brockwoods i presume to show sir cradock nowells all may be completed in six months time if both sides act with energy if you will favour me with the description of parcels i will write at once to mr brockwood or indeed i shall see him tonight he will be at the masons dinner for a moment mrs corklemore was taken quite aback it is needless to say that no interchange of land had ever been dreamed of except by herself as a possible method of learning how the land lay and indeed there was no intermixed land at all as mr chope strongly suspected neither was he for the matter of that likely to meet mr brockwood but when it becomes a professional question a man can mostly outlie a woman because he has more experience be guided by me if you please said georgie smiling enough to misguide any one we must not be premature lest we seem too anxious about the bargain and i am sure we have done our very best to be perfectly fair with sir cradock only we trust you of course to be sure that he has reposing composingoh how stupid i am i mean disposing power that there is no awkward entail here she looked so preternaturally simple which she would never have done but for her previous flutter that simon chope in a moment knew exactly what her game was nevertheless he answered nicely in that tantalizing way which often makes a woman flash forth we shall see no doubt ere long of course sir cradock would not propose it unless he had full power is it quite certain that poor clayton nowell left no legitimate offspring oh what a horrible suggestion such a thing would quite upset every scheme georgie had never thought of it and yet it might even be so there was something in the tone of mr chopes whisper which convinced her that he had heard something and only think young men are so little looked after at oxford that they can get married very easily without anything being heard of it at least so thought mrs corklemore and then oh if poor clayton had left a child how his grandfather would idolize him sir cradock would slip from her hands altogether and scarcely any hope would remain of diverting the succession even if the child was a daughter probably she would inherit and could not yet have committed felony oh what a fearful blow it would be all this passed through that rapid mind in about half a second during which time however the thinker could not help looking nonplussed mr chope of course perceived it and found himself more and more wideawake well what a strange idea she exclaimed with unfeigned surprise there has not been the slightest suggestion of anything of the kind and indeed i have lately heard what surprised me very much that he had formed anan improper attachment in a quarter very near home indeed do you know to whom it was mr chope who was trying now to appear indifferent yes i was told but it does not become me to repeat such stories it not only becomes you in this case but it is your absolute duty andand your true interest why you quite frighten me mr chope your manner is so strange it would grieve me deeply indeed to alarm madame la comtesse answered the lawyer trying in vain to resume his airiness but i cannot do justice to any one who does not fully confide in me in a case like this especially such interests are concerned the title is soso complicated that purely as a matter of business we must be advised about everything well i see no reason why i should not tell you it cannot be of any importance poor clayton nowell had fallen in love with a girl very far beneath himthe daughter i think she was of a mr garnet oh i think i had heard a report of that sorthe had never heard but suspected itit can of course signify nothing if the matter went no further nevertheless i thank you for your gratifying confidence i apologize if i alarmed you there is nothing alarming at all in it i was thinking of something very different this was utterly false but it diverted her from the subject oh yes i see of something you mean which might have caused a disagreement between the unfortunate brothers now tell me your opinionin the strictest confidence of courseas to that awful occurrence do you thinkoh i hope not i was far away at the time and can form no conclusion but i know that my partner mr cole the coroner was too sadly convincedoh i beg your pardon i forgot for the moment that madame la comtesse pray forget my relationship or rather consider it as a reason oh i would rather know the sad sad truth it is the suspense oh the cruel suspense what was mr coles conclusion that if cradock nowell were put on his trial he would not find a jury in england but must convict him oh how inexpressibly shocking excuse me may i ask for a glass of water oh thank you thank you no wine if you please i must hurry away quite rudely the fresh air will revive me i cannot conclude my instructions today how could i think of such little matters please to do nothing until you hear from me yes i hear the carriage i told giles to allow me ten minutes only unless mr corklemore came you see how thoroughly well i know the value of your time we feel it so acutely but i must not presume no further if you please having thus appraised mr chope and apprised him of his distance from a social point of view georgie gave him a smile which disarmed him at least for the moment but he was not the lawyer or the man to concede her the last word we lawyers never presume madam any more than we assume we must have everything proved except your particulars of account which you leave to prove themselves ha ha you are too clever for the whole profession we can only prove our inferiority he stood with his great bushy head uncovered looking after the grand apparatus and three boys sitting behind it and then he went sadly back and said our son might have been lord chancellor but i beat her this time in lying chapter ix two months of opening spring are past and the forest is awaking up all we who love such things come and see more glorious doings than of man or angel however hearts have been winterbound with the nip of avarice and the iron frost of selfishness however minds have checked their sap in narrowness of ideal let us all burst bands awhile before the bright sun as leaves do heavens young breath is stirring through crinkled bud and mossy crevice peaceful spears of pensioned reeds and flags all innocent of battle lo where the wind goes while we look playing with and defying us chasing the dip of a primrosebank and touching sweet lips with dalliance lifting first the shining tutsan gently so and apologizing then after a tender whisper to the nodding milkwort away to where the soft blue eyes of the periwinkle hesitate last before he dies away the sauntering ruffler looks and steps into a quiet tufted nook overhung with bank and lintelled with the twisted oakroots here as in a niche of sabbath dwells the nervous soft woodsorrel feeding upon leafmould quivering with its longstalked cloves pale of hue and shunning touch delicate woodsorrel coralrooted shamrockleafed loved and understood of few except good fra angelico tutwe want stronger life than that and here we have it overhead with many a galling boss and buff yet on the whole worth trees exertion and worth mans inspection see the oakleaves bursting out crimped and crannied at their birth with little nicks and serrate jags like painted lady chrysalids or cowries pushing their tongues out throwing off the hidesome tuck and frilled with pellucid copper see as well the fluted beechleaves started a full moon ago offering out of fawnskin gloves and glossed with waterproof copal then the ashbut hold i know not how the ash comes out because it gives so little warning or rather it warns a long long time and then does it all of a sudden tushwhat man cares now to glance at the yearly manuscript of god let the leaves go they are not inscripti nomina regum yet the brookthough time flees faster who can grudge one glance at brooklet where the mockmyrtle begins to dip where the young agrimony comes up and the early forgetmenot pushes its claim upon our remembrance and the waterlily floats halfway up quivering dusk in the clearness like a trout upon the hover look how the little waves dance towards us glancing and casting over drawing a tongue with limpid creases from the broad pool above then funnelling into a narrow neck over a shelf of gravel and bubbling and babbling with petulant freaks into corners of calmer reflection there an old tree leans solemnly over with brows bent and arms folded turning the course of the brook with his feet and shedding a crystal darkness below this the yellow banks break away into a scoop on either side where a green lane of the forest comes down and wades into the water here is a favourite crossingplace for the cattle of the woodland and a favourite bower for cows to rest in and chew the cud of soft contemplation and here is a grey wooden bridge for the footpath adding to rather than destroying the solitude of the scene because it is plain that a pair of feet once in a week would astonish it yet in the depth of loneliness and the quiet repose of shadow all is hope and reassurance sense of thanks and breath of praise for is not the winter gone by and forgotten the fury and darkness and terror the inclination of march to rave and the april too given to weeping surely the time of sweet flowers is come and the glory of summer approaching the freedom of revelling in the sun the vesture of the magnificent trees and the singing of birds among them through the great huntley wood and along the banks of the millaford brook this fine morning of the may wander our rosalind and celia amy to wit and eoa it is a long way from nowelhurst but they have brought their lunch and mean to make a day of it in the forest seeking balm for wounded hearts in good green leaf and buoyant air coming to the old plankbridge they sit upon a bank to watch the rising of the trout for the stonefly is on the water eoa has a great idea that she could catch a trout with a kidneybean stick and a fly but now she has not the heart for it and amy says it would be so cruel and they are so pretty what a lovely place says amy i could sit here all day long how that crabapple clothed with scarlet seems to rouge the water it isnt scarlet i tell you amy any more than you are its only a deep deep pink you never can tell colours well never mind it is very pretty and so are you when you are good and not contradictorycontradictionary as james pottles calls corbus well it does just as well whats the good of being so particular i am sure i am none the better for it and i have not jumped the brook ever so long and have thrown away my gaiters just because uncle john saidoh you are all alike in england what did my father say if you please that possessed such odious sameness there there i am so glad to see you in a passion dear because i thought you never could be uncle john only said that no doubt somebody would like me better if i gave up all that and stayed indoors all day and i have been trying hard to do it but he is worse than he was before i sat on a bench in the chase last monday and he went by and never noticed me though i made quite a noise with my hat on the wood until i was nearly ashamed of myself but i need not have been alarmed for my lord went by without even looking and what do you mean to do about it amy took the deepest interest in eoas loveaffair oh you need not smile amy it is all very well for you i dare say but it makes me dreadfully angry just as if i were nobody and after i have told uncle cradock of my intentions to settle you premature little creature but my father was quite right in his advice as he always is and not for that reason only you belong to a wellknown family and for their sake as well as your own you are bound to be very nice dear and to do only what is nice instead of making a tomboy of yourself tomboy indeed and nice nice things they did didnt theyshooting one another almost before she had uttered the words she was thoroughly ashamed of herself for she knew about amy and cradock from the maidens own confession amy arose without reply and taking her little basket turned into the homeward path with a little quiet sigh eoa thought for a moment and then having conquered herself darted after the outraged friend i wish to have no more to do with you that is all cried amy with eoas strong arms round her waist but indeed you shall you know what a brute i am i cant help it but i will try i will bite my tongue off to be forgiven i simply wish miss nowell to have nothing more to do with you then you are a great deal worse than i am because you are unforgiving i thought you were so wonderfully good and now i am sorry for you even more than for myself i had better go back to the devils people if this is the way of christians could you forgive any one in a moment who had wounded you most savagely in a momentif they were sorry and asked me are you quite sure of that sure indeed how could i help it then eoa you cannot help being more like a christian than i am i am very persistent and steadily bitter to any one who wrongs me you are far better than i am eoa because you cannot hate any one i dont know about being better amy i only know that i dont hate any onewith all my heart i meanexcept mrs nowell corklemore here amy could not help laughing at eoas method of proving her rule and the other took advantage of it to make her sit down and kiss her and beg her pardon a dozen times because she was such a little savage and then to open her own lunchbasket and spread a white cloth and cover it with slices of rusk and reindeers tongue and hearted lettuce and lemonade and a wing of cold duck at the corner i left it to hoggy she cried in triumph and he has deserved my confidence beat that if you can now my darling oh i can beat that out and out said amy who still was crying just a drop now and then because her emotions were persistent then she smiled because she knew so well no old butler could touch her in catering but i must not tell what amy had for fear of making people hungry only in justice it should be said that neither basket went home full for both the young ladies were hearty and they kissed one another in spite of the stuffing oh amy i do love you so whenever you dont scold me i am sure i was meant for a christian heres that nasty sneaks lawn handkerchief i picked her pocket this morning i do twice a week for practice but i wont wipe your pretty eyes with it darling because i do so loathe her now if you please no more crying amy what a queer thing you are most truly may i return the compliment answered amy smiling through the sparkle of her tears but you dont mean to say that you keep what you steal oh no it is not worth it and i hate her too much to keep anything last week i lit the fire in my dressingroom on purpose to burn her purse you should have seen the money melting i took good care of course not to leave it in the ashes though i am forming quite a collection of it for i dont mind keeping it at all when it has been through the fire and you cant think how pretty it is all strings and dots of white and yellow well i never heard such a thing why you might be transported eoa yes i know if they found me out but they are much too stupid for that besides it is such fun the only fun i have now since i left off jumping you know the old thing is so stingy old thing indeed why she is not fiveandtwenty i dont care she has got a child she is as old as methusalem in her heart though she is so deucedly sentimentalthe old colonels daughter had not forgotten all her beloved papas expressionsi know i shall use what you call in this country physical force some day with her i must have done it long ago only for picking her pocket she would be but a baby in my hands and she is quite aware of it look at my arm its no larger than yours except above the elbow and it is nearly as soft and delicate yet i could take you with one hand amy and put you into the brook if you like ill do it much obliged dear but i am quite content without the crucial test i know your wonderful strength which none would ever suspect to look at you i suppose it came to you from your mother yes i believe at any rate i have heard my father say so and i could hold both his hands most easily but oh she is such a screw amy that sympathetic georgie she never gives any one sixpence and it is so pleasant to hear her go on about her money and handkerchiefs and most of all her gloves she is so proud of her nasty little velvet paws she wont get her gloves except in southampton and three tollgates to pay and i steal them as fast as she gets them she grumbles about it all dinnertime and i offered her eighteenpence for turnpikesout of her own purse of coursebecause she was so poor i said but she flew into such a rage that i was forced to pick her pocket again at breakfasttime next morning and the lies she told about the amount of money in her purse between eight and nine pounds she said the last time and there was only two pounds twelve uncle cradock made it good to her because he guessed that i had done it though he was afraid to tell me so but thank god i stole it again the next day when she went out walking and that of course he had nothing to say to because it did not occur in his house oh what a rage she was in she begins to suspect me now i think but she never can catch me out you consummate little thief why i shall be afraid to come near you oh i would never do it to any one but her and i should not do it to her so much only she thinks me a clumsy stupid me who was called neverspotthedust but i have got another thing of hers and she had better take care or ill open it something else take care eoa or i will go and tell no you know better than that it is nothing but a letter she wrote and was going to post at burley i knew by her tricks and suspicious ways that there was something in it and she would not let it go in the postbag so i resolved to have it and of course i did and she has been in such a fright ever since but i have not opened it yet and i hope you never will either confess or post it at once or never call me your friend any more oh you need not be hot amy you dont understand the circumstances i know that she is playing a nasty game and i need not have any scruples with her after what i caught her doing twice she has been at my desk my own new desk uncle cradock gave me where i put all the letters and relics that were found on my dear dear father here eoa burst out crying and amy came near again and kissed her darling i did not mean to be cross if the wretch would do such a thing as that it justifies almost anything and what do you think i did said eoa half crying and half laughing i set a fishhook with a spring to it so that the moment she lifted the cover the barb would go into her hand and the next day she had a bad finger and said that little flore bit it by accident while she was feeling her tooth which is loose i should like to have seen her getting the barb out of her nasty little velvet paw i am quite surprised cried amy and we all call you so simplea mere child of nature if so nature is up to much more than we give her credit for and pray what is your next device oh nothing at all till she does something i am quits with her now and i cannot scheme as she does suddenly amy put both her hands on eoas graceful shoulders and poured the quick vigour of english eyes into the fathomless lustre of darklyfringed oriental orbs you will not tell me a story dear if i ask you very particularly i never tell stories to any one you might know that by this time at any rate not to my friends no i dont think you would now do you think that mrs corklemore is at the bottom of this vile thing what vile thing the viler it is the more likely she is to have done it oh no she cannot have done it though she may have had something to do with it i mean of course about poor cradock what about cradock i love cousin cradock because he is so unlucky and because you like him dear dont you know it you must have seen that i was in very poor spirits and this made me feel it so much the more when you said what you did we have heard that an application has been made in london at the home office or somewhere that a warrant should be issued against cradock nowell and a reward be offered for him asoh my cradock my craddy put your head in here darling what a brute you must have thought me oh i do so love you dont think twice about it dear i will take care that it all comes right i will go to london today dearest and defy them to dare to do it and ill open that letter at once it becomes a duty now as that nasty beast always says when she wants to do anything wrong no no sobbed amy you have no right to open her letter and you shall not do it eoa unless my father says that it is right will you promise me that dear oh do promise me that how can i promise that when i would not have him know for a lac of rupees that i had ever stolen it he would never perceive how right it was and though i dont know much about people i am sure he would never forgive me he is such a fidget but i will promise you one thing amynot to open it without your leave amy was obliged at last to be contented with this though she said it was worse than nothing for it forced the decision upon her and scrupulously honest and candid as she was she would feel it right to settle the point against her own desires old biddy knows i have got it cried eoa changing her humour and she patted me on the back and said begorra thin you be the cliver one hould on to that same me darlint and well bate every bit of her yit the purtiest feet and ancles to you and the best back legs more than iver she got and now you bate her in the stalin and plase miss rade yer ould biddy every consumin word on it mullygaslooce but weve toorned her this time and thank donats for it eoa dramatised biddy so cleverly even to the form of her countenance and her peculiar manner of standing that amy with all those griefs upon her could not help laughing heartily come along i cant mope any longer when i have jumped the brook nine times you may say something to me what do you think of a bathe amy i am up for it if you areand our tablecloths for towels nobody comes here once in a year and if they did they would run away again what a lovely deep pool i can swim like a duck and you like a stone i suppose amy of course would not hear of it and her lively friend having paddled with her naked feet in the water and found it colderoh ever so muchthan the tributaries of the ganges was not so very sorry selfwilled though being to keep upon the dry land only she must go to queens mead and amy must come with her and run the entire distance to get away from trouble amy was light enough of foot when her heart was light but eoa could run round her as the sporting phrase is and she gave herself the rein at will that lovely afternoon as a highmettled filly does when she gets out of piccadilly and she chatted as fast as she walked all the time hoping so to divert her friend from this new distress i should not be one bit surprised if we saw thatbob here somewhere we are getting near one of his favourite placesnot that i know anything about it and he is always away now in mark ash wood or puckpits looking out for the arrival of honeybuzzards or for a merlins nest oh of course we shall not see him now you know you will replied amy laughing at eoas clumsiness and you have brought me all this way for that very reason now if we meet him just leave him to me and stay out of hearing i will manage him so that he shall soon think you the best and the prettiest girl in the world well i wish he would said eoa blushing beautifully wouldnt i torment him then no doubt you would and yourself as well now where do you think he will be oh amy how can i possibly guess but if i did guess at all i should say there was just an atom of a chance of his being not far from the queens mead suppose him to be there what would bring him there not to see you i should hope as if he would go a yard for that oh no he is come to look forat least perhaps he might just possibly i mean come to look for whom amy was very angry for she thought that it was herself under eoas strategy a horrid little white mole a white mole why i had no idea that there was such a thing oh yes there is but it is very rare and he has set his heart upon catching this one that he shant oh i see exactly what to do come quickly for fear he should catch it before we get there oh i do hate such cruelty ah there i see him now you keep out of sight in a sunny break of tufted sward embayed among long waves of wood young bob garnet sat more happy than the king of all the world of fairies at his side lay several implements of his own devising and on his lap a favourite book with his open watch upon it from time to time he glanced away at a chain of little hillocks about twenty yards in front of him and among which he had stuck seven or eight stout hazel rods and brought them down as benders he was trying not only to catch his mole but also to add another to his many observations as to the periods of molar exertion whether nature does enforce upon those clever miners any three hour act as the popular opinion is or whether they are free to work and rest at their own sweet will as seems a world more natural amy walked into the midst of the benders in her selfwilled characteristic manner as if they were nothing at all she made believe to see nought of bob who on the other side of the path was fluttering and blushing with a mixture of emotions some very cruel person she exclaimed in loud selfcommune probably a cruel boy has been setting moletraps here i see and papa says the moles do more good than harm except perhaps in my flowerbeds now ill let them all off very quietly the boy will think he has caught a dozen and then how the moles will laugh at him he will think its a witch and leave off very likely for all cruel boys are ignorant my pretty little darlings so glossy and so clever oh please not to do that cried bob having tried in vain to contain himself and now leaping up in agony i have taken so much trouble and they are set so beautifully what master robert garnet oh have you seen my companion miss nowell about here look there you have spoiled another and theyll never set so well again oh you cant know what they are and the trouble i have had with them oh yes master garnet i know what they are clumsy and cruel contrivances to catch my innocent moles your moles cried bob with great wrath arising as she coolly destroyed two more traps why are they your moles i should like to know i dont believe you have ever even heard of them before suppose i have not answered amy screwing up her lips as she always did when resolved to have her own way then how can they be your moles oh if you havent spoiled another well gods moles if you prefer it master garnet at any rate you have no right to catch them but i only want to catch one amy a white one oh such a beauty i have heard of him since he was born and had my eye on him down all the galleries and now he must be fullgrown for he was born quite early in august i hope hell live to be a hundred and i will thank you master garnet to speak to me with proper respect up went another riser there was only one left now and that a most especial trap which had cost a whole weeks cogitation i declare you are a most dreadful girl you dont like anything i do and i have thought so much of you then once for all i beg you never more to do so i have often wished to speak with you upon that very subject whatwhat subject miss rosedew i have no idea what you mean that is altogether false but i will tell you now i mean the silly ungentlemanly and very childish manner excusable only in such a boy in which i have several times observed you loitering about in the forest bob knew what she meant right well although she would not more plainly express ithis tracking of her footsteps he turned as red as meadowsorrel and stammered out what he could i amveryvery sorry but i did not mean it i meani could not help it you will be kind enough to help it now for once and for all otherwise my father who has not heard of it yet shall speak to yours about it insufferable impudence in a boy just come from school amy was obliged to turn away for fear he should look up again and see the laughter in her eyes for all her wrath was feigned inasmuch as to her bob garnet was far too silly a butterflyboy to awake any real anger but of late he had been intrusive and it seemed high time to stop it if i have done anything wrong miss rosedew anything in any way unbecoming a gentleman yes try to be a good boy again said amy very graciously at the same time giving the stroke of grace to his masterpiece of mechanism designed to catch the white mole alive now take up your playthings and go if you please for i expect a young lady here directly and your little tools for cockchaferspinning would barbarize the foreground of our sketch besides being very ugly oh cried bob with a sudden access of his fathers readinessyou spin a fellow worse than any cockchafer and you do it in the name of humanity then think me no more a divinity answered amy because she must have the last word and even bob young as he was knew better than to paragogize the feminine termination utterly discomfited as a boy is by a womanand amys trouble had advanced her almost to that proud claimbob gathered up his traps and scuttled cleverly out of sight she on the other hand laughing all the while at herself for her simple piece of acting and doubting whether she had been right in doing even a little thing so much against her nature there she sat with her sketchingblock ready and hoped that eoa would have the wit to come and meet her beloved bob now labouring under his fierce rebuff but eoa could not do it she had wit enough but too much heart she had heard every word of amys insolence and was very indignant at it was bob to be talked to in that way as if he knew nothing of science as if he really had an atom of any sort of cruelty in him was amy so very ignorant as not to know that all bob did was done with the kindest consideration and for the interest of the species though the pins through the backs were unpleasant perhaps but that was over in a moment and he always carried ether and it was nothing to the fakirs or the martyrs of christianity therefore eoa crouched away behind a tuft of thicket because her maidenhood forbade her to come out and comfort him to take advantage of his wrong and let him know how she felt it therefore too she was very sharp with amy all the homeward road vindicating bob and snapping at all proffered softness truth being that she had suspected his boyish whim for amy and now was sorry for him about it and very angry with both of them from that little touch of womans nature she learned more dignity more pride more reservation and selfrespect than she could have won from a score of governesses or six seasons of society chapter x not another minute to lose and the sale again deferred all the lots marked and the handbills out and the particulars and conditions ready and then some paltry pettifogging and another fortnight will be required to do justice to my interests justice to my interests how they do love roundmouthed rubbish the only justice to me is from a legal point of view to string me up and then quicklime me and the only justice to my interests is to rob my children because i have robbed them already robbed them of their birth and name their power to look men in the face their chance of being allowed to do what god seems chiefly to want us forto marry and have children who may be worse than we are though thank him mine are not robbed them even of their chance to be met as christians though i have increased their right to it in this wretched moneyseeking servile and contemptuous age but who am i to find fault with any after all my wasted life a life which might in its little way have told upon the people round me and moved if not improved them which might at least have set them thinking doubting and believing oh the loss of energy the loss of selfreliance and the awful load of fear and anguishi who might have been so different pearl is at the window there i know quite well who loves heran honest upright hearty man with a true respect for women but will he look at her when he knowsoh god my god forsake me but not my childrenbob what are you at with those cabbages why they are clubbed dont you see father beautifully clubbed already and the leaves flag directly the sun shines and i want to know whether it is the larva of a curculio or anthomyia brassic and i cant tell without pulling the plants up and they cant come to any good you know with all this ambury in them i know nothing of the sort bob i know nothing at all about it go into the house to your sister i cant bear the sight of you now bob without a single word did as he was told he knew that his father loved him though he could not guess the depth of that love being himself so different and so he never took offence at his fathers odd ways to him but thought better luck next time the governor has got red spider this morning and he wont be right till dinnertime bull garnet smiled at his sons obedience with a mighty fount of pride in him and then he sighed because bob was goneand he never could have enough of him for the little time remaining he loved his son with a love surpassing that of woman or that of man for woman men would call him a fool for it but god knows how he has made us thinking none of this but fretting over fierce hearttroubles which now began to be too many even for his power of lifeas a hundred wolves kill a lionhe turned again down the espalierwalk where the appletrees were in blossom pinky shells spread to the sun with the little close tuft in the middle some striped some patched some pinched with white some streaking as the fruit would be and glancing every gloss of blushno two of them were quite alike any more than two of us are yet the bees knew every one among the countless multitude and never took the wrong one even as the angels know which of us belongs to them and who wants visitation bull garnet casting to and fro and taking heed of nothing not even of the weeds which once could not have lived before his eyes began again in a vague loose manner the weakness of which would have angered him if he had been introspective to drone about the laws delays and the folly of institution he stood at last by his wicket gate where the hedge of irish yew was and there carried on his grumbling lawyers indeed and cannot manage a simple thing of that sort thank god i know nothing of law excuse me mr garnet it is possible that you may want to know something of law shortly by what right sir dare you break in upon my privacy like this pale as he was and scorning himself for the way in which his blood shrunk back bull garnet was far too strong and quick ever to be dumbfoundered chope looked at him with some admiration breaking through the triumph of his small comprehensive eyes excuse me mr garnet i forgot that a public man like you must have his private moments even at his own gate i am sorry to see you so hot my dear sir though i have heard that it is your character that sort of thing leads to evil results and many deplorable consequences but i did not mean to be rude to you or to disturb you so strangely you have not disturbed me at all sir i am truly happy to hear it all i meant as to knowledge of law was to give you notice that there is some heavy trouble brewing and that you must be prepared to meet some horrible accusations may i trespass further upon your kindness to ask what their subject is oh nothing more than a very rash and unfounded charge of murder mr chope pronounced that last awful word in a deeply sepulchral manner and riveted his little eyes into bull garnets great ones mr garnet met his gaze as calmly as he would meet the sad clouded aspect of a dead rabbit or hare in a shop where he asked the price of them and regarded their eyes as the test of their freshness chope could not tell what to make of it the thing was beyond his experience but all this time bull garnet felt that every minute was costing him a year of his natural life even if he ever got any chance of living it out how does this concern me is it any one on our estates yes and the heir to your estates young mr cradock nowell bull garnet sighed very heavily then he strode away and came back again with indignation swelling out the volume of his breast and filling the deep dark channels of brow and the turgid veins of his eyeballs whoever has done this thing is a fool or a roguewhich means the same it may be so it may be otherwise we always hope for the best very likely he is innocent perhaps they are shooting at the pigeon in order to hit the crow perhaps you know best what their motives are i see no use in canvassing them you have heard i suppose the rumour that mr cradock nowell has left england i know very little about it i have nothing to do with the case or it might have been managed differently but i heard that the civil authorities being called upon to act discovered without much trouble that he had sailed under a false name in a ship called the taprobane bound direct for ceylon and that of course told against him rather heavily ah he sailed for ceylon did he a wonderful place for insects i had an uncle who died there yes ceylon where the flying foxes are not so cunning perhaps as our foxes of the forest and yet the fox is a passionate animal violent hot and hasty were you aware of that fact excuse me my time is valuable i will send for the gamekeeper if you wish to have light thrown upon that question or my son will be only too glad ah your son poor fellow those few short words pronounced in a tone of real feeling with no attempt at inquiry quite overcame bull garnet first extrinsic proof of that which he had so long foreseen with horrorthe degradation of his son he dropped his eyes which had borne till now and returned the lawyers gaze and the sense of his own peril failed to keep the tears from moving up to this time mr chope had doubted and was even beginning to reject his shrewd and wellfounded conclusion now he saw and knew everything and even he was overcome passion is infectious and lawyers are like the rest of us mr chope had loved his mother bull garnet gave one quick strange glance at the eyes of simon chope which now were turned away from him and then he looked at the ground and said yes i have wronged him bitterly simon chope drew back from him mechanically instinctively as our skin starts from cold iron in the arctic regions he could not think much less could he speak though his mind had been prepared for it to human nature it is so abhorrent to take the life of another to usurp the rights of god to stand in the presence of one who has done it touches our pulse with death we feel that he might have done it to us or that we might have done it to him and our love of ourselves is at once accelerated and staggered and then we feel that life for life is such low revenge the vendetta of a drunkard very slowly we are beginning to see the baseness of it bull garnet was the first to speak and now he spoke quite calmly you came with several purposes one of them was that i should break to sir cradock nowell these tidings of new trouble the news of the warrant which you and others have issued against his luckless son i will see to it today and i will try to tell him good god he does not deserve iti have watched himhe is no father oh i wish you had a son chope then you could feel for me mr chope had two sons not to be freely discoursed of whom he meant to take into the office pseudonymously some day and he was rather inclined to like the poor little nullius filii first because they were his own secondly because they had big heads thirdly because they had cheated all the other boys nevertheless he was in no hurry to be confidential about them yet without his knowing it or at least with only despising it this little matter shaped its measure upon his present action the lawyer lifted his hat to bull garnet in a very peculiar manner conveying to the quick apprehension what it would not have been safe to pronounceto wit that mr chope quite understood all that had occurred that he would not act upon his discovery until he had well considered the matter for after all he had no evidence lastly that he was very sorry for mr garnets position but would rather not shake hands with him the steward watched him walking softly among the glad young leaves and down the dell where the sunlight flashed on the merry leaps of the water long after the lawyer was out of sight bull garnet stood there watching as if the forest glades would show him the approaching destiny strong and firm as his nature was he had suffered now such wearing wearying agonies that he almost wished the weak mans wishto have the mastery taken from him to have the issue settled without his own decision poor cradock sailed in the taprobane what an odd name he continued with that childishness to which sometimes the overtaxed brain reverts tap taproot taprobin tush what a fool i am oh god that i could think oh god that i could only learn whether my first duty is to you or to my children i will go in and pray in the passage he met his son and kissed his forehead gently as if to atone for the harshness with which he had sent him away father said bob shall you want me today or may i be from home till dark i have so many things most important things to see to birds nests i suppose and grubs fieldmice and tadpoles yes my son you are wise enjoy them while you can and take your sister also for a good run if you can you may carry your dinner with you i shall do well enough oh its no use asking pearl she never will come with me and i am sure i dont want her she does much more harm than good she cant kill anything properly nor even blow an egg but ill ask her as you wish it sir because i know that she wont come mr garnet had not the heart to laugh at his childrens fine sense of duty towards him but he saw bob start with all his tackle in great hopes and high spirits the father looked sadly after him wondering at his enjoyment yet loving him the more perhaps for being so unlike himself and as he gazed he could not help saying to himself very likely i shall never see him thus againonly look at him when he will not care to look on me yet he must know in the end and she the poor thing she must know how all my soul was on them now god in heaven lead me aright half an hour shall settle it chapter xi meanwhile supposing the warrant to issue let us see what chance there is of its ever being served and it may be a pleasant change awhile to flit to southern latitudes from the troubles and the drizzle and the weeping summer of england poor cradock as we saw him last backed up by the ebonytree and with wena crouching close to him knew nothing of his lonely plight and miserable abandonment until the sheets of plashing rain and long howls of his little dog awoke him to great wonderment then he arose and rubbed his eyes and thought that his sight was gone and felt a heavy weight upon him and a destiny to grope about and a vain desire to scream such as we have in nightmare meanwhile he felt something pulling at him always in the same direction and he did not like to put his hand down for he had some idea that it was beelzebub suddenly a great flash of lightning triple thrice repeated lit up the whole of the wood like day and he saw black wena tugging at him to draw him into good shelter he saw the shelter also ere the gush of light was gone an enormous and hollow mowanatree a little higher up the hill then all was blackest night again and even wena was swallowed up in it but with both hands stretched out to fend the blows of hanging branch or creeper he committed himself to the little dogs care and she took him to the mowanatree then another great flash lit up all the hollow and wena was frightened and dropped her tail but still held on to her master cradock neither knew nor cared what the name of the tree was nor whether it possessed as some trees do especial attractions for lightning any harbour in a storm was all he thought if he thought at all and he lay down very snugly and felt for amys present to him and then in spite of the crashing thunder and the roaring wind snugly he went off to sleep and at his feet lay wena in the bright morning the youth arose and shook himself and looked round and felt rather jolly than otherwise travellers say that the baobab or mowanatree is the hardest of all things to kill and will grow along the ground when uprooted and not allowed to grow upright frenchmen have proved to their own satisfaction that some baobabs now living grew under the deluge of noah and not improbably had the great ark floating over their heads be that as it may and though it is a cadmeian job to cut down the baobab for every root thereupon claims and takes a distinct existence we can all of us tell the travellers of a thing yet harder to killthe hope in the heart of a man and the better man he is the more of hopes spores are in him and the quicker they grow again after they have all been stamped upon a mushroom in the egg likes well to have the ground beaten overhead with a paviours rammer and comes up all the bigger for it and lifts a pavestone of two hundredweight shall then the pluck of an honest man fail while his true conscience stirs in him though the result be like a fleeting fungus supposed to be born in an hour by those who know nothing about it and who make it the type of an upstartshall not his courage work and spread although it be underground as he grows less and less defiant and rear perhaps in the autumn of life a genuine crop and a good one cradock nowell found his island not at all a bad one there was plenty to eat at any rate which is half the battle of life plenty to drink is the other half in the judgment of many philosophers but i think that plenty to look at it ought to be at least a third of it the pride of the eyes if not exercised on that vanishing point oneself is a pride legitimate and condemned by no apostle and here there was noble food for it and it is a pride which when duly fed slumbers off into humility oh the glory of everything the promise and the brightness the large leading views of sky and sea and the crystal avenues onward the manner in which a fellow expands when he looks at such thingsif he be capable of expanding which surely all of us arethe way in which he wonders and never dreams about wondering and the feeling of grandeur growing within him and how it repents him of littleness and all his foes are forgiven and then he sees that he has something himself to do with all the beauty of itupon my word i am a great fool to attempt to tell of it cradock saw his lovely island and was well content with it it was not more than four miles long and perhaps three miles across but it was gifted with three grand thingsbeauty health and nourishment it might have been ages for all he saw then since man had sworn or forsworn in it perhaps none since the voyagers of necho whose grand truth was so incredible there were no high hills and no very deep holes but a pleasant undulating place ever full of leaves and breezes and as for wild beasts he had no fear he knew that they would require more square miles than he owned as for snakes he was not so sure and indeed there were some nasty ones as we shall see byandby then he went to the shore and looked far away even after the taprobane the sea was yet heaving heavily and tumbling back into itself with a roar and some fishing eagles were very busy stooping along the foam of it but no ship was to be seen anywhere and far away in the south and southeast the selvage of black clouds lopping over the mist of the horizon showed that still the typhoon was there and no one could tell how bad it was cradock found a turtle at which wena looked first in mute wonder with her eyes taking jumps from their orbits and then like all females she found tongue and ran away and barked furiously presently she came back sniffing along and drawing her nose on the sand yet determined to stick by her master even if the turtle should eat him but to her immense satisfaction the result was quite the converse she and her master ate the turtle beginning ab ovo that morning for although crad could not quite eat the eggs raw bytheby they are not so bad that way and although he could not quite strike a light by twirling one stick in the back of another he had long ago found reason for and he rapidly found that excellent goddess in the roasting of eggs and for that he had to thank amy only see how thoughtful women areyes a mark of astonishment but the astonishment will subside perhaps when we come to know all about it for then all the misogynes may declare that the thought was born of vanity let them do so facts are facts i say amy had sent him a photograph of her faithful self beautifully done by mr silvy of bayswater and framed in a patent lovers box i forget the proper name for itsomething french of courseso ingeniously contrived that when a spring at the back was pressed a little wax match would present itself from a lining of asbestos together with a groove to draw it in thus by night as well as by day the smile of the loved one might illumine the lonely heart of the lover now this device stood him in good steadas doubtless it was intended to do by the practical mind of the giverfor it served to light the fire wherewith man roasteth roast and is satisfied and a fire once lit in the hollow heart of that vast mowanatree where twenty men might sit and smoke when the rainy season came if you only supplied some fuel daily and cleared away the ashes weekly there need be no fear of philanthropy making a trespasser of prometheus cradock soon resolved to keep his headquarters there for the tree stood upon a little hill overlooking land and sea for many a league of solitude and it was not long before he found that the soft bark of the baobab might easily be cut so as to make a winding staircase up it and the work would be an amusement to him as well as a great advantage master and dog having made a most admirable breakfast upon turtles eggs roasted very knowinglyas homer well expresses itwith a large pineapple to follow started before the heat of the day in search of water the indispensable shaddocks and limes and mangosteens bananaswith their long leaves quillingpineapples mawas and mamoshoes cocoanuts plantains mangoes palms and palmyras custardapples and gourds without endbesides fifty other groundfruits ay and treefruits for that matter quite unknown to cradock there was no fear of dying from drought and yet the first thing to seek was pure water if cradock had thought much about the thing very likely it would have struck him that some of the fruits which he saw are proof not so much of human cultivation as of human presence at some time but he never thought about that and indeed his mind was too full for thinking so he cut himself a most tremendous bludgeon of camelthorn as heavy and almost as hard as iron and off he went whistling with wena wondering whether the stick would beat her he certainly took things easily more so than is quite in accord with human nature and reason but the state of his mind was to blame for it and the freshness of the island air after the storm of the night even a rejected lover or a disconsolate husband gives a jerk to his kneejoints and carries his elbows more briskly when the bright spring morning shortens his shadow at every step cradock moreover felt quite sure that he would not be left too long there that his friends on board the taprobane would come aside from their track to find him on their returnvoyage from ceylon and so no doubt they would have done if it had been in their power but the taprobane as we shall see never made her escape in spite of weatherly helm and good seamanship from the power of that typhoon she was lost on the shoals of benguela bay thirty miles south of quicombo and not a man ever reached the shore to tell the name of the ship but a portuguese halfcaste trading there found the name on a piece of the taffrail and a boat which was driven ashore after all we see then that cradock was wonderfully luckyat least if it be luck to livein having been left behind that evening on an uninhabited island desolate nobody could call it for the gifts of life lay around in abundance and he soon had proof that the feet of men ay of white men trod it sometimes following the shore a little further than the sailors had gone he came on a pure narrow thread of crystal a current of bright water dimpling and twinkling down the sand wena at once lay down and rolled and wetted every bit of herself and then began to lap the water wherein her own very active and industrious friends were drowning that wena was such a ladylike dog she washed herself before drinking and she never would wash in salt water it made her hair so unbecoming cradock followed up that stream and found quite a tidy little brook when he got above the sandridge full of fish and fringed with trees and edged with many a quaint bright bird scissorbills and avosets demoiselles and flamingoes wena plunged in and went hunting bluerats and birds and fishes while her master stooped down and drank and thanked god for this discovery a little way up the brook he found a rude shanty a sort of wigwam thatched with leaves and waterproof backed by a low rock but quite open in front and at both ends under the shelter were blocks of ebony billets of barwood piled up to the roof a dozen tusks of ivory bales of dried bark and piles of rough cylinders full of caoutchouc and many other things which cradock could not wait to examine but he felt quite certain that this must be some traders dept for shipping the only thing that surprised him was that the goods were left unprotected for he knew that the west africans are the biggest thieves in the world while he did not understand the virtue of the hideous great fetich hanging there it was made of a long dried codfish with glass eyes ground in the iris and polished again in the pupil and a glaring stripe of red over them and the neck of a bottle fixed as for a tongue and the body skewered open and painted bright blue ribbed with white like a skeleton and the tail prolonged with two spinal columns which rattled as it went round the effect of the whole was greatly increased by the tattered cage of crinoline in which it was suspended and which went creaking round now and then in the opposite direction no nigger would dare to steal anything from such a noble idol at least so thought the yankee trader who knew a thing or two about them he had left his things here in perfect faith while he was travelling towards the gaboon to complete his cargo cradock was greatly astounded he thought that it must be a white mans work and soon he became quite certain for he saw near a cask the clear mark of a boot of civilized make unquestionably then he prized out the head of the cask after a deal of trouble and found a store of shipbiscuit a little the worse for weevil but in very fair condition he gave wena one but she would not touch it for she set much store by her teeth and had eaten a noble breakfast having made a rough examination of the deserted shed and found no sort of clothingwhich did not vex him much except that he wanted shoeshe resolved to continue the circuit of his new dominions and look out perhaps for another hut he might meet a man at any time so he carried his big stick ready though none but cannibals could have any good reason to hurt him as he went on and struck inland to cut off the northern promontory the lie of the land and the look of the woods brought to his mind more clearly and brightly his own beloved new forest he saw no quadruped larger than a beautiful little deer lighter than a gazelle and of a species quite unknown to him they stood and looked at him prettily without either fear or defiance and wena wanted to hunt them but he did not allow her to indulge that evil inclination he had made up his mind to destroy nothing even for his own subsistence except the coldblooded creatures which seem to feel less of the deathpang but he saw a foul snake with a flat heavy head which hissed at and frightened the doggie and he felt sure that it was venomous monkeys also of three varieties met him in his pilgrimage and seemed disposed to be sociable while birds of every tint and plumage fluttered and flashed and flitted then wena ran up to him howling and limping and begging for help and he found her clutched by the seedvessels of the terrible uncaria he could scarcely manage to get them off for they seemed to be crawling upon her when he had made nearly half his circuit without any other discoveryexcept that the grapes were worthlessthe heat of the noonday sun grew so strong although it was autumn thereso far as they have any autumnthat cradock lay down in the shade of a plantain and in a few seconds afterwards was fast asleep and dreaming wena sat up on guard and snapped at the nasty poisonous flies which came to annoy her master how heavenly tropical life would be in a beautiful country like that but for those infernal insects the mosquito for instanceand he is an angel compared to some of those beelzebubsmust have made adam swear at eve even before the fall and then those awful spiders whose hair tickles a man to madness even if he survives the horror of seeing such devils and then the tampanbut let us drop the subject please for fear of not sleeping tonight cradock awoke in furious pain and spasms most unphilosophical he had dreamed that he was playing football upon cowley green and had kicked out nobly with his right foot into a marching line of red ants immediately they swarmed upon him up him over him into him biting with wild virulence and twisting their heads and nippers round in every wound to exasperate it wena was rolling and yelling for they attacked her too cradock thought they would kill him although he did not know that even the python succumbs to them he was as red all over inside his clothes and outside as if you had winnowed over him a bushel of fine rouge dancing and stamping and recalling with heartfelt satisfaction some strong words learned at oxford he caught up wena and away they went two solid lumps of ants headlong into the sea luckily he had not far to go he lay down and rolled himself clothes and all and rolled poor wena too in the waves until he had the intense delight of knowing that he had drowned a million of them ah and just now he had made up his mind to respect every form of life so oh but i defy any fellow even the sage archbishop who reads novels to stop other people to have lectured us under the circumstances or to have kept his oaths in with those twenty thousand holes in him the salt water went into cradocks holes and made him feel like a cayenne peppercastor and the little dog sat in the froth of the sea and thought that even dogs are allowed a hell after that there was nothing to do except to go home mournfullyif a tree may be called a home as no doubt it deserves to beand then to dry the clothes and wish that the wearer knew something of botany cradock had no doubt at all that around him grew whole stacks of leaves which would salve and soothe his desperate pain but he had not the least idea which were balm and which were poison how he wished that instead of reading so hard for the scholarship of dean ireland he had kept his eyes open in the new forest and learned just natures rudiments of course he would have other leaves to deal with but certain main laws and principles hold good all the world over bob garnet would have been quite at home though he had never seen one of those plants before we cannot follow him day by day it is too late in the tale for that even if we wished it enough that he found no other trace of man upon the island except the traders hut or store with the hideous scarecrow hanging and signs of human labour in the growth of some few treesabout which he knew nothingand in a rough piece of ground near the shanty cleared for a kitchengarden cassavas and yams and kiobos and peanuts and some other things grew there which as he made nothing of them we must treat likewise there had even been some cotton sown but the soil seemed not to suit it it was meant perhaps by the keen american who thought himself lord of the island for a little random experiment when would he come back that was the question cradock asked both of himself and wena twenty times a day of course poor cradock knew not whether his lord of the manor were a yankee or a britisher a portuguese or a dutchman thebis nutritus an argis only he supposed and hoped that a white man came to that island sometimes and brought other white men with him by this time he had cut a winding staircase up the walls of his castle and added a great many rough devices to his rugged interior twice every day he clomb his tree to seek all round the horizon and at one time he saw a sail in the distance making perhaps for loanda but that ship was even outside the expansive margin of hope and now he divided his time between his grand mowana citadel and the storehouse with whose contents he did not like to meddle much because they were not his property there he placed the ships hydropult which he had found lying on the beach for the mate had brought it to meet the chance of finding shallow water where the casks could not be stooped or the water bailed without fouling it and the boats crew in their rush and flurry had managed to leave it behind them cradock left it in the storehouse because it was useless to him where he had no water and it amused him sometimes to syringe wena from the brook which flowed hard by moreover he thought that if anything happened to prevent him from explaining things the owner of the place whoever he might be would find in that implement more than the value of the biscuits which cradock was eating and getting on nicely with them because they corrected the richness of turtle truly his diet was glorious both in quality and variety and he very soon became quite a pomarian apicius of all fruits perhaps the mangosteen garcinia mangostana is the most delicious when you get the right sort of itwhich i dont think they have in brazilneither is the lee chee a gift to be despised nor the chirimoya and several others of the annona race some of the granadillas too and the sweet lime and the plantains and many another fount of beauty and delightall of which by skill and care might be raised in this country where we seem to rest content with our meagre hothouse catalogue i do not say that all these fruits were natives of pomona island as cradock appreciating its desserts took the liberty of naming it but most of them were discoverable in one part or another of it some born from the breast of nature others borne by man or tide and almost all of them still would be greatly improved by cultivation so the head gardener of the island who left the sun to garden for him enjoyed their exquisite coolness and wondered how they could be so cool in the torrid sunshine and though he did not know the name of one in fifty of them he found out wonderfully soon which of them were the nicest and soon he discovered another means of varying his diet for he remembered having read that often in such lonely waters the swarming fish will leap on board of a boat floating down the river thereupon he made himself a broad flat tray of bark with a shallow ledge around it and holding a towrope made also of bark launched it upon the brook immediately a vast commotion arose among the finny ones they hustled and huddled and darted about and then paddled gravely and stared at it then whether from confusion of mind or the reproaches of their comrades or the desire of novelty half a dozen fine fellows made a rush and carried the ship by boarding whereupon cradock laughing heartily drew his barge ashore and soon wena and himself were deep in a discussion ichthyological as may well be supposed the pure sea breezes and wholesome diet the peace and plenty and motherly influence of nature the due exercise of the body without undue stagnation of mind the pleasure of finding knowledge expand every day stomachically while body and mind were girded alike and the heart impressed with the diamondstudded belt of hopeall this we may well suppose was beginning to try severely the nasal joints of incessant woe chapter xii but pomona island now and then had its own little cares and anxieties how much longer was cradock nowell to live upon fruit and fish and turtle with shipbiscuit for dessert when would the trader come for his goods or had he quite forgotten them what would amy and uncle john think if the taprobane went home without him and the snakes the snakes that cared not a rap for the enmity of man since the rainy season set in but came almost up to be roasted and worst of all and most terrible thing crad was obliged to go about barefooted while the thorns were of natures invention and went every way all at once like a hedgehog upon a fryingpan for that last evil he found a cure before he had hopped many hundred yards he discovered a pumpkin about a foot long pointed and with a horny rind and contracted towards the middle he sliced this lengthwise and took out the seeds and planted his naked foot there the coolness was most delicious and a few strips of baobab bark made a firstrate shoe of it he wore out one pair every day and two when he went exploring but what did that matter unless the supply failed and he kept some hung up for emergency as to the snakes though he did not find out the snakewood or the snakestone or the fungoid substance like a morel which pumices up the venom he invented something much better as prevention is better than cure he discovered a species of aspalathus perfectly smooth near the root and not very hard to pull up yet so barbed and toothed and fanged upon all except the seedleaves that even a pythonwhereof he had nonecould scarcely have got through it of this he strewed a ring all round his great mowanatree and then a fenced path down the valley toward his bathingplace and then he defied the whole of that genus so closely akin to the devil but wena had saved his life ere this from one of those slimy demons of course we know how hateful it is to hate anything at all except sin and crime in the abstract but i do hope a fellow may be forgiven for hating snakes and scorpions at any rate if he cannot be he ought to be able to help it while cradock was making his fence aspalathine and before he had finished the ring yet a little snake about two feet long semitransparent and jellified of a dirty bottlegreen colour like the caterpillar known as the pearleech selandria thiops only some hundreds of sizes bigger that loathsome reptile sneaked in through and crouched in a corner while cradock thought that he smelled something very nasty as he smoked a pipe of the traders tobacco before turning into his locker he had cut himself a good broad coving from the inside of the mowanatree about three feet from the ground fitted up with a flap and a pillowplace and strewn with fresh plantainleaves across the niche he had fastened a new mosquito net borrowed from his friend the trader whose goods he began to look upon now as placed under his trusteeship and in that rude couch he slept as snugly after a hard days work as the pupa does of the goat moth or of the giant sirex under his feet was wenas hole wherein she crouched like a rabbit and pricked her ears every now and then and barked if ever the wind moaned fortunatos nimium there was nobody to rogue them and yet no sooner was craddy asleep upon the night i am telling of than that dirty bottlegreen snake flatheaded and with a years supply of venom in its toothbag came wriggling on its dappled belly around the hollow ring while the dying embers of the firefor the night was rather chilly and wet and cradock had cooked some fishshowed the mean sneak poking its head up feeling the temper of the time ready to wriggle to anything then it came to the bedposts of cradocks couch which he had cut in a dry sort of humour from the soft baobab wood it lifted its head and heard him snoring and tapped its tail and listened again very likely it was warm up there and the snake was a little chilly in this depth of the winter so without any evil forethoughtfor i must be just even to a snakethough ready to bite at a move or a turn of the animal known as man up went that little serpent cleverly and elegantly as on a bohemian vase cradock would have died in two hours after that snake had bitten him but before that lissom coil of death had got all its tail off the ground fangs as keen as its own though not poisonous had it by the nape of the neck wena knew a snake by this time and could treat them aright she gave the devilish miscreant not a chance to twist upon her but tore him from his bellyhold and walked pleasantly to the fire and with a spit of execration threw him into it and ran back and then ran to again and barked at the noise he made in fizzing therewith cradock awoke and got out of bed and saw the past danger and coaxed the little dog and kissed her and talked to her about amy whose name she knew quite as well as her own after all his works were finished and when he hardly knew what great public improvement he should next attempt cradock received visitors unexpected and unfashionable in fact they were all stark naked although that proves very little climbing his tree one beautiful morning he saw four or five little marks on the sea as of so many housemaids thumbs when the cheek of the grate has been polished staring thereat with all his eyesas we loosely express ithe found that the thumbmarks got bigger and bigger until they became long canoes paddling like good ones towards him this was not not by any means the sort of thing he had bargained for and he became to state the matter mildly most decidedly nervous he saw that there were invading him five great double canoes each containing ten or twelve men and he had no gun nor a pinch of powder very likely they were cannibals and would roast him slowly to brown him nicely and then serve up wena for garnish he shook so up there among the rough branchesfor he did not so very much mind being killed but he could not bear to be eatenthat wena began to howl down below and he was obliged to come down to quiet her then he tied up black wena and muzzled her to her immense indignation with a capistrum of mowana bark which quite foreclosed her own and then he crept warily through the woods to observe his black brethrens proceedings they were very near the shore by this time and making straight for the traders hut of which they had doubtless received some account cradock felt his courage rising and therewith some indignation for he knew that the goods could not be theirs and by this time he considered himself in commission as supercargo so he resolved to save the store from pillage if it were possible even at the risk of his life for this purpose he lay down in a hollow place by the waterside where he could just see over the tidebank without much fear of discovery at least till the robbers had passed the shed which of course was their principal object it was evidently a king of men who stood at the prow of the foremost canoe with a javelin in his great black hand poised and ready for casting his apparel consisted of two great eardrops two rings upon his right wrist and one below either knee also a chain of teeth was dangling down his brawny bosom he was painted red and polished highly which had to be done every morning and he looked as dignified and more powerful than a don or dean one man in each boat was painted and polisheddoubtless the sign of high rank and great birth when the bottom of the double canoe grated upon the beach the negro king flung back his strong arm and cast at the shed his javelin it passed through the roof and buried itself in the body of the fetich which swung horribly to and fro while the crinoline moved round it hereupon a yell arose from the invading flotilla and every man trembled waiting to see what would come of such an impiety finding that nothing at all ensued for cradock had not the presence of mind to advance at the moment they gave another yell and landed washing a great deal of red from their legs but the king was brought ashore dry and bright sitting on some officers shoulders then they came up the bank without any order but each with his javelin ready and his eyes intent on the idol how cradock longed for a piece of packthread to have set the dried codfish dancing at last they came quite up to the shed and held a consultation in which it seemed the better counsel to allow the god who looked ever so much more awful now they were near him a certain time to vindicate himself if he possessed the power to do so cradock was watching them closely through a tussock of long seagrass and in spite of their powerful frames and elastic carriage he began to despise them in the wholesale britannic manner they should not steal his property that he was quite resolved upon although there were fifty of them they were so near to him now that he could see their great white teeth and hear them snapping as they talked when the time allowed which their agamemnon was telling upon his fingers had quite expired and olympian jove had sent as yet no lightnings the king who was clearly in front of his age cast another javelin through the frame of crinoline and leaped boldly like patroclus following his dart suddenly he fell back howling and yelling cured for ever of scepticism and with both his great eyes quite slewed up and all his virtue in his heels away went every nigger drowning the royal screams with their own pellmell down the beach anyhow only caring to cut hawser words like these came back to cradock as they rolled over one another mbongo pongo warakai urelwi which mean as interpreted afterwards by the yankee trader he is a god a great god he maketh rain yea very great rain headlong they tumbled into their boats not stopping to carry the king even for which he kicked them heartily as soon as he got on board and every son of a woman of them plied his knotted arms at the paddle as if grim death was behind him cradock laughed so heartily that he rolled over with the hydropult on him and threw his heels up in the air and if they had not yelled so they would have been sure to hear him very skilfully he had brought the nose of that noble engine to bear full upon the royal countenance and the jet of water from the little stream passed through the ribs of the fetich that god had asserted himself to such purpose that henceforth you might hang him with beads and give him a wig of tobacco and no black man would dare to look at them cradock nowell felt almost too proud of his mighty volunteer movement and began to think more than ever that the whole of the island was his these things show more than anything else can his return to human reason for of the rational human beingas discovered ordinarilythe very first instinct and ambition is the ownership of a peculium what man cannot sympathize with that feeling who has got three fields and six children therefore when a beautiful schooner of the true american rig which made such lagging neddies of our yachts a few years since came into view one afternoon and fetched up with the sails all shaking in the wind abreast of the shed ere sundown cradock felt like the owner of a house who sees a man at his gate then he came down quietly with wena and sat upon a barrel with a pipe of cavendish in his mouth and wena crouched like a chrysalis between his pumpkind feet even the yankee who had not been surprised at any incident of life since his nurse dropped him down an oilwell when he was two years old even he experienced some sensation when he saw a white man sitting and smoking upon his barrel of knowingest notions with a black dog at his feet but recklesome young was not the man to be long taken aback darn me but yoo are a cool hand britisher for ten dollars never see none like em i dont you are right answered cradock i am an englishman very much at your service what is your business upon my island waal said the yankee turning round to the four men who had rowed him ashore zebedee this is just what i likes and no mistark about it one of them old islanders come to dispute possession and perhaps a cannon up the hill and a company of sojers aint it good zeb aint it lor how i do love them now dont be too premature said cradock it is the fault of your nation as the opposite is ours darned well said young britisher give us your hand upon it for arter all i likes yoo cradock shook hands with him heartily for there was something in the mans face and manner when you let his chaff drift by which an englishman recognises as kindly strong and sincere although now and then contemptuous the contempt alone is not genuine but assumed to meet ours or anybodys the active for fear of the passive voice you are welcome to all the island said cradock and all my improvements if you will only take me home again the whole of it belongs to me no doubt but i will make it all over to you for a passage to southampton cant take you that way young boss and dont want your legal writings how come you here to begin with cradock told him all his story while the men were busy and the keen american saw at once that every word was true strikes me he said with a serious drawl which the fun in his eyes contradicted that yoo after the way of the british have made a trifle free young man with some of my goods and chattels hear and even yoor encroaching country cant prove tittle to them yes replied cradock and i will pay you if i have not done so already i will give you the thing which has saved the whole from plunder and perhaps fire afterwards then he fetched the little machine which the yankee recognised at once as an american invention and he laughed till his yellow cheeks were reeking at the description of the darned naygurs retreat rip me up young man he said but yood be a credit to us amost darnd if i thought as any britisher wud ever be up to so cute a dodge shake hands agin young chap i likes yoo and yoove airned your ticket anywhor and a hunderd dollars to back of it well take yoo to the centre of the univarsal world and make yoo open your eyes a bit ship aboard of us for noo yerk and if that dont make a man of yoo call me small pumpkins arterwards but i want to get to england said cradock looking very black and i have no money for passage from new york to southampton thur now yoo be all over a britisher agin and reckwirin enlightment yoo allays spies out fifty raisons agin a thin smarter than one in its favior harken now ill have yoo sot down in the docks of suthanton free and with fifty dollars to trade upon sure as my name is recklesome young thur now bet i dont will yoo and pay me out o my spisshy not to dwell too long upon these little sidepaths it is enough to record that captain recklesome young of new york and the schooner dont you wish you may catch me made sail two days afterwards with half of his best cabin allotted to cradock and to wena and keen as he was to the shave of a girls lip in striking a contract or cutting it upon a large scale he came down as nobly as the angels on jacobs ladder no english duke or prince of the blood could or would have behaved to cradock more grandly than recklesome young did when once he understood him in such things the yankees are far ahead of us keen as they are and for that same reason they have far more trust than we have in large and good human nature of the best of them i have heard many a true tale such as i never could hope to hear of our noblest london merchants proofs of grand faith and godlike confidence in a man once approved which enlarge the heart of him who hears them and makes him hate small satire chapter xiii bob garnet with his trowel and box and net and many other impediments was going along very merrily in a quiet path of the forest thinking sometimes of amy and her fundamental errors and sometimes of eoa and the way she could catch a butterfly but for the most part busy with the display of life around him and the prospects of a great boring family which he had found in a willowtree suddenly near the stagheaded oak he chanced upon miss nowell tripping along the footpath lightly smiling and blushing rosily and oh so surprised to see him she darted aside like a trout at a shadow then finding it too late for that game she tried to pass him rapidly with her long eyelashes drooping oh please to stop a minute if you can spare the time said bob what have i done to offend you she stopped in a moment at his voice and lifted her radiant eyes to him and shyly tried to cloud away the sparkling night of hair through which her white and slender throat gleamed like the milky way the sprays of the wood and the winds of may had romped with her glorious tresses and now she had been lectured so that she doubted her right to exhibit her hair miss nowell said bob as she had not answered but only been thinking about him only please to stop and tell me what i have done to offend you and you do love beetles soand you never saw such beautieswhat have i done to offend you an english maiden would have said oh nothing at all mr garnet and then swept on with her crinoline embracing a thousand brambles but eoa stood just where she was with her bright lips pouting slightly and her gaze absorbed by a tuft of moss only because you are not at all goodnatured to me bob but it doesnt make much difference then she turned away from him and began to sing a little song and then called amy amy dont call amy i dont want her oh i beg your pardon im sure i rather thought you did eoa said bob and she looked at him and the tears were in her eyes and then she whispered yes bob you have got on the very prettiest dress i ever saw in all my life here bob was alarmed at his own audacity and durst not watch the effect of his speech oh is that all she answered but i am very glad indeed that you likemy frock bob here she looked down at it with much interest and to tell you the truth continued he i think if you will please not to be offended that you look very well in it oh yes i am very well i wish i was ill sometimes now i dont mean that what i mean is very nice well i always try to be nice but how can i out butterflyhunting now you wont understand me you are as bad as a weevil that wont take chloroform what i mean is very pretty i dont know anything about that said eoa drawing back and i dont see that you have any right even to talk about it oh there goes a lovely butterfly where where what eyes you have got i do wish i was married to you what a collection we would have and you would never let my traps off i am sure that you are a great deal better and prettier than amy and i like you more than anybody i have ever seen do you bob are you sure of that she fixed her large eyes upon his and in one moment her beauty went to the bottom of his heart it changed him from a boy to a man from play to passion from dreams to thought and happy for him that it was so with the trouble impending over him she saw the change herself too young too pure in spite of all the evil that ever had drifted by her to know or ask what it meant she only felt that bob liked her now better than he liked amy she had no idea of the deep anticipation of her eyes eoa wont you answer me he had been talking some nonsense why are you crying so dreadfully do you hate me so much as all that oh no no bob i am sure i dont hate you at all i only wish i did no i dont bob i am so glad that i dont i dont care a quarter so much bob for all the rest of the world put together then only look up at me eoa i cant tell what i am saying only look up you are so nice and you have got such eyes have i said eoa throwing all their splendour on him oh i am so glad you like them do you think that you could give me just a sort of a kiss eoa people always do you know and indeed i feel that you ought i scarcely know what is right bob after all the things they have told me but now you know you must guide me then ill tell you what just let me give you one the leaves are coming out so well thats a different thing said eoa amy cant see us can she sir cradock nowell was very angry when his niece came home and told him with an air of triumph all that bob had said to her that butterflyhunting boy eoa to think of his presuming so a mere boy a boy like that thats the very thing uncle perhaps if he had been a girl you know i should not have liked him half so much and as for his hunting butterflies i like him all the better for that and well hunt them all day long oh exclaimed uncle cradock smiling at the young girls earnestness in spite of all his wrath that is your idea of married life then is it but i never will allow it eoa he is not your equal of course not uncle he is my superior in every possible way scarcely so in the matter of birth nor yet my child i fear in a pecuniary sense for both of those i dont care two pice you know it is all very nice uncle cradock to live in large rooms where you can put three chairs together and jump over them all without knocking your head and to have beautiful books and prawns for breakfast and flowers all the year round and to be able to scold people without their daring to answer but i could do without all that very well but i never could do without bob i fear you must indeed my dear as other people have had to do well i dont see why unless god takes him and then he should take me too and indeed i had better tell you once for all uncle cradock that i do not mean to try it would be so shabby of me after what i told him just now and after his saving my life and you yourself said yesterday that no nowell had ever been shabby you have been very kind to me and good and i love you very much i am sure but in spite of all that i wish you clearly to understand uncle cradock that if you try any nonsense with me i shall get my darling fathers money and go and live away from you my dear said the old man smiling at the manner and tone of her menace which she delivered as if her departure must at least annihilate him you are laying your plans too rapidly you are not seventeen until next july and you cannot touch your poor fathers money until you are twentyone i dont care she replied he is sure to have been right about it but i will tell you another thing everybody says that i could earn ten thousand a year as an operadancer in london and i should like it very muchthat is to say if bob did and i would not think of changing my name as i have heard that most of them do i should be miss eoa nowell the celebrated dancer god forbid said sir cradock my only brothers only child i will not trouble you about him dear only i beg you to consider to be sure i will uncle cradock i have been considering ever since how long it must be till i marry him now give me a kiss dear and i wont dance except for your amusement and i dont think i can dance for a long time after what i have been told about poor cousin cradock i am sure he was very nice uncle from what everybody says of him and i am almost certain that you behaved very badly to him my dear you are allowed to say what you like because nobody can stop you but your own good feeling should make you spare me the pain of that sad subject not if you deserve the pain for having been hardhearted and much you cared for my pain when you spoke of bob so besides you are quite sure to hear of it and it had better come from me dear uncle who am so considerate something new what is it my child i can bear almost anything now it is that some vile wretches are trying to get what they call a warrant against him and so to put him in jail put him in jail my unfortunate son what more has he been doing nothing at all and i dont believe that he ever did any harm but what the brutes say is that he did that terrible thing on purpose oh uncle dont look at me like that how i wish i had never told you poor sir cradocks mind was not so clear and strong as it had been although the rumours scattered by georgie were shameful exaggerations the habit of brooding over his grief whenever he was alonea habit more and more indulged as it became a morbid pleasurethe loss moreover of his accustomed exercise for he never would go out riding now having no son to ride with him these and the everpresent dread of some inevitable inquiry began to disturb though not destroy the delicate fibres of reason which had not too much room in his brain he fell into the depths of an easychair and wondered what it was he had heard the lids of his minds eye had taken a blink as will happen sometimes to old people and to young ones too for that matter neither was it the first time this thing had befallen him then eoa told him again what it was because he made her tell it and again it shocked him dreadfully but that time he remembered it and i have no doubt continued his niece with bright tears on her cheeks that mrs corklemore herself is at the bottom of it georgie what my niece georgie she is not your niece uncle cradock i am your niece and nobody else and you had better not think of wronging me if you call her your niece any more i know i will never call you my uncle nasty limy slimy thing if you would only give me leave to choke her my darling child cried her uncle who loved her the more though he knew it not for siding with his son so you are so very hot and hasty i am sure mrs corklemore speaks of you with the warmest pity and affection shall i tell you why she does uncle crad shall i tell you in plain english most likely you will be shocked you know my dear i am so used to you that i am never shocked now at anything then it is because she is such a jolly liar eoa i really must send you to a nice institution for young ladies you get worse and worse if you do ill jump over the wall the first night and bob shall come to catch me but now without any nonsense uncle for you do talk a good deal of nonsense will you promise me one thing a dozen if you like my darling anything in reason you did look so like your poor father then oh i am so glad of that but it is not a thing of reason uncle it is simply a thing of justice now will you promise solemnly to send away mrs corklemore and never speak to her again if she vows that she knows nothing of this and if i prove from her own handwriting that it is her plot altogether and also another plot against us every bit as bad if not worse of course eoa i will promise you that as solemnly as you please what a deluded child you are am i now let her come in and deny it thats the first part of the business without waiting for an answer she ran to fetch mrs corklemore whom she well knew where to find that time of the afternoon dear georgie had just had her cup of tea with the darling flore in her private audiencechamberoratory she called it though all her few prayers were public and now she was meditating what dress she should wear at dinner those dinners were so dreadfully dull unless she could put eoa into a vehement passionwhich was not very hard to doand so exhibit her in a pleasant light before the servingmen yet strange to say although the young lady observed little moderation when she was baited thus and sunk irony in invective the sympathies of the audience were far more often on her side than on that of the soft tormentor come now sugarplums said eoa who often addressed her so we want you downstairs if you please for a minute tum pease oh ah cried little flore running up pease tum and tell fore a tory cant now you good little child and your mamma tells stories so cleverly oh so very cleverly it quite takes away ones breath ill have my change out of you at dinnertime said georgie to herself most viciously as she followed down the passage eoa led her along at a pace which made her breath quite short for she was not wont to hurry so and she dropped right gladly into the chair which sir cradock politely set for her then as he himself sat down facing her with a heavy sigh georgie felt rather uncomfortable she was not quite ready for the crisis but feared that it was coming and she saw at a glimpse that her hated foe neverspotthedust was quite ready burning indeed to begin only wanting to make the most of it thereupon mrs corklemore knowing the value of the weathergage and being unable to bear a slow silence was the first to speak something has occurred i see to one of you two dear ones oh uncle cradock what can i do to prove the depth of my regard for you or to be sure the depth of your regard eoa interrupted or is it for you you poor wild thing we all make such allowance for you because of your great disadvantages if you have done anything very wrong indeed poor darling anything which hard people would call not only thoughtless but unprincipled i can feel for you so truly because of your hot temperament and most unhappy circumstances you had better not go too far cried eoa grinding her little teeth thank heaven i see dear it is nothing so very disgraceful after all because it has nothing to do with you or you would not smile so prettily you take it so lightly it must be something about dear uncle cradock oh uncle cradock tell me all about it my whole heart will be with you blackspangled hen has broken her eggs nothing more said eoa dear oh we do love you so she made two syllables of that word as mrs corklemore used to do in her many gushing moments georgie looked at eoa with wonder she had stupidly thought her a stupid then sir cradock nowell rose in a stately manner to put an end to all this little nonsense my niece eoa declares mrs corklemore that you in some underhand manner have promoted a horrible charge against my poor son cradock a charge which no person in any way connected with our family should ever dare to utter even if he or she believed its justice far less dare to promulgate and even force into the courts of law is this so or is it not oh uncle cradock how can you speak so what charge should i ever dream of see how her hands are trembling and how white her lips are not with telling black lies uncle cradock but with being found out eoa have the kindness not to interrupt again very well uncle cradock i wont unless you make me then as i understand madam you deny entirely the truth of this accusation of course i do most emphatically what can you all be dreaming about now eoa it is your turn to establish what you have said i cant establish anything though i know it uncle cradock know it indeed you poor wild nautchgirl dreamed it you mean i suppose i mean continued eoa not even looking at her but bending her fingers in a manner which georgie quite understood that i cannot prove anything uncle cradock without your permission but here i have a letter with the seal unbroken and which i promised some one not to open without her leave and now she has given me leave to open it with your consent and in the presence of the writer why how pale you are mrs corklemore my heavens and this is england stealing letters and forging them which of the two do you mean madam asked sir cradock looking at her in his old magisterial manner after examining the envelope either involves a heavy charge against a member of my family is this letter yours or not yes it is replied georgie after a moments debate for if she called it a forgery it must of course be opened have the kindness to give me my property i thought there was among wellbred people a delicacy as to scrutinizing even the directions of one anothers letters so there is madam you are quite rightexcept indeed under circumstances altogether exceptional and of which this is one now for your own exculpation and to prove that my niece deserves heavy punishment which i will take care to inflict allow me to open this letter i see it is merely a business letter or i would not ask even that although you have so often assured me that you have no secret in the world from me you can have nothing confidential to say to simon chope esq and if you had it should remain sacred and secure with me unless it involved the life and honour of my son shall i open this letter certainly not sir cradock nowell how dare you to think of such a thing so mean so low so prying after those words madam you cannot continue to be a guest of mine or be ever received in this house again unless you prove that i have wronged you by allowing me to send for your husband and to place this letter in his hands before you have in any way communicated with him give me my letter sir cradock nowell unless your niece inherits the thieving art from you as for you wretched little dacoit here she bent upon eoa flashing eyes quite pale from wrath for sweet georgie had her temper bitterly you shall rue the day when you presumed to match yourself with me you would like to do a little murder i see no doubt it runs in the family and the thugs and dacoits are first cousins of course never had eoa fought so desperate a battle with herself as now to keep her hands off georgie without looking at her again she very wisely ran away for it was the only chance of abstaining mrs corklemore laughed aloud then she took the letter which the old man had placed upon the table and said to him with a kind look of pity what a fuss you have made about nothing it is only a question upon the meaning of a clause in my marriagesettlement but i do not choose to have my business affairs exposed even to my husband now do you believe me uncle cradock no i cannot say that i do madam and it does not matter whether i do or not you have used language about my family which i can never forget a carriage will be at your service at any moment you please thanks for your hospitable hint you will soon find your mistake i think in having made me your enemy though your rudeness is partly excused no doubt by your growing hallucinations farewell for the present poor dear uncle cradock with these words mrs corklemore made him an elegant curtsey and swept away from the room without even the glisten of a tear to mar her gallant bearing although she had been so outraged but when she got little flores head on her lap she cried over it very vehemently and felt the depth of her injury when she had closed the door behind her not with any vulgar bang but firmly and significantly the master of the house walked over to a panelled mirror and inspected himself uncomfortably it was a piece of ancient glass purchased from an italian chapel by some former cradock nowell and bearing a mystic name and fame among the maids who dusted it by them it was supposed to have a weird prophetic power partly no doubt from its deep dark lustre and partly because it was circular and ever so slightly and quite imperceptibly concave as upon so broad a surface no concavity could be in the early ages of mechanism made absolutely trueand for that matter it cannot be done ad unguem even nowthere were of course many founts of error in this italian mirror nevertheless all young ladies who ever beheld it were charmed with it so sweetly deeply beautiful like galatea watching herself and finding polypheme over her shoulder in the glass of the blue sicilian sea to this glass sir cradock nowell went to examine his faded eyes timeworn troubleworn stranded by the ebbing of the brain he knew too well what mrs corklemore meant by her last thrust and the word hallucination happened through a great lawsuit then in progress to be invested with an especial prominence and significance while he was sadly gazing into the convergence of grey light and feebly reassuring himself yet like his image wavering a heavy step was heard behind him and beside his flowing silvery locks appeared the closecropped massive brow and the gloomy eyes of bull garnet chapter xiv as the brothers confronted one another the legitimate and the baseborn the man of tact and the man of force the luxurious and the labourer strangely unlike in many respects more strangely alike in others each felt kindly and tenderly yet timidly for the other the old man thought of the lying wrong inflicted upon the stronger one by their common father the other felt the worse wrongif possibledone by himself to his brother the measure of such things is not for us god knows and visits and forgives them even by the failing lightfor the sun was westering and a cloud flowed over himeach could see that the others face was not as it should be that the flight of weeks was drawing age on more than the lapse of years should garnet you do a great deal too much i shall recall my urgent request if you look so harassed and haggard take a holiday now for a month before the midsummer rents fall due i will try to do without you though i may want you any day i will do nothing of the sort work is needful for mewithout it i should die but you also look very unwell you must not attempt to prescribe for me i have not been happy lately byandby things will be better what is your impression of mrs nowell corklemore that she is an arrant hypocrite unscrupulous foul and deadly well that is plain speaking by no means complimentary poor georgie i hope you misjudge her as she says bad people do but for the present she is gone there has been a great fight all along between her and eoa they could not bear one another and now my niece has discovered a thing which brings me to her side in the matter for she at least is genuine that she is indeed and genuinely passionate you may trust her with anything she has been very rude indeed to me and yet i like her wonderfully what has she discovered that mrs corklemore is at the bottom of this horrible application for a warrant against my son i can well believe it it struck me in a moment though i cannot see her object i never understand plotting neither do i garnet i only know she has made me insult the dearest friend i had on earth yes mr rosedew i heard of it and wondered at your weakness but it did not become me to interfere certainly not most certainly not you could not expect me to bear it and the rosedews never liked you that has nothing to do with it very probably they are right for i do not like myself and you will not dislike but hate me when you know what i have to say bull garnets mind was now made up for months he had been thinking forecasting doubting waveringa condition of mind so strange to him so adrift from all his landmarks that this alone without sense of guilt must have kept him in wretchedness sir cradock nowell only said keep it for another time i cannot bear any more excitement i have had so much today bull garnet looked at him sorrowfully he could not bear to see his brother beaten so by trouble and to feel his own hard hand in it dont you know what they say of me oh you know what they say of me and nothing of the kind in the family the old man seemed to prove that there was by the vague flashing of his eyes garnet you are my brother after all you are my brother and they say i am going mad and i know they will try to shut me up without a horse or a book or a boy to brush my trousers oh garnet you have been bitterly wronged shamefully wronged detestably but you will not let your own brotherbrother who has no sons now to protect himbe shut up and made nothing of bull garnet promise me this although we have so wronged you garnet knew not what to do even he was taken aback shocked by this sudden outburst which partly proved what it denied and this altogether changed the form of the confession he was come to makeand changed it for the better my brotherit was the first time he had ever so addressed him not from diffidence but from pridemy brother let us look at things if possible as god made them i have been injured no doubt and so my mother was blasted both of us for life according to the little ideas of this creeping world in many cases the thief is the rogue in even more the robbed one is the only villain now can you take the large view of things which is forced upon us outsiders when we dare to think at all i cannot think now of such abstract things my mind is astray with trouble did i ever tell you your mothers words when she came here ten or twelve years ago and demanded a share of the property not for her own sake but for yours to get you into some business no i never heard of it how it must have hurt her bull garnet was astonished because it had long been understood that his mother should not be spoken of and me as well i gave her a cheque for a liberal sum as i thought she tore it and threw it at me what more could i do did i deserve her curse garnet is all this trouble come upon me because i did not obey her i believe that you meant to do exactly what was right i hopei believe i did and see how wrong she was in one part of her prediction she said that i and my father also should be punished through you through you her only son what a mistake that has proved you who are my right arm and brain my only hope and comfort the old man came up and looked with the deepest trust and admiration at his unacknowledged brother a few months ago bull garnet would have taken such a look as his truest and best revenge for the cruel wrong to his mother but now he fell away from it and muttered something in a manner quite unlike his own his mind was made up he was come to tell all but how could he do it now and wrench the old mans latest hope away then suddenly he remembered or knew from his own feelings that an old mans last hope in earthly matters should rest upon no friend or brother not even upon a wife but upon his own begotten his successors in the world and what he had to say while tearing all reliance from himself would replace it where it should be meanwhile sir cradock nowell thinking that garnet was too grateful for a few kind words followed him and placed his slender tremulous and purebred hand in the useful crossbred palm which had sent mr jupp down the coalshaft bull you are my very best friend after all we are brothers promise to defend me but garnet only withdrew his hand and sighed and could not look at him oh then even you believe it i see you do it must be true god have mercy upon me cradock it is a cursed lie you must not dwell upon it such thoughts are spawn of madness turn to another subject just tell me what is the greatest thing one man can do to another to love him i suppose garnet but i dont care much for that sort of thing since i lost my children yes it is a grand thing to love but far grander to forgive is it i am glad to hear it i always could forgive little things you mean no doubt slights and slursand so forth yes and great things also but i am not what i was bull you know what i have been through can you forgive as deep a wrong as one man ever did to another yes i dare say i am sure i dont know what makes you look at me like that because i shot your son clayton and because i did it on purpose viley my boy viley oh i had forgotten what a stupid thing of me i thought he was dead somehow now i will open the door for him because his hands are full and let him put his game on the tablenever mind the papershe always likes me to see it oh viley how long you have been away what a bag you must have made come in my boy come in bull garnets heart cleaved to his side as the old man opened the door and looked with the leaping joy of a fathers love for his pet his beloved his treasured one but nothing except cold air came in the passage is empty perhaps he is waiting because his boots are dirty tell him not to think twice about that i am fidgety sometimes i know and i scolded him last friday but now he may come anyhow if he will only come to me i am so dull without him you will never see him morebull garnet whispered through a flood of tears like grass waving out of wateruntil it pleases god to take you home where son and father go alike sometimes one first sometimes other as his holy will is he came to an unholy end i tell you againi shot him excuse me i dont quite understand there was a grey hare with a nick in her ear who came to the breakfastroom window all through the hard weather last winter and he promised me not to shoot her and i am sure that he cannot have done it because he is so softhearted and that is why i love him so talk of cradocktalk of cradock perhaps he is cleverer than vileythough i never will believe itbut is he half so soft and sweet will the pigeons sit on his shoulder so and the dogs nuzzle under his coatlap tell me thattell me thatbull garnet he leaned on the strong arm of his steward and looked eagerly for his answer then trembled with an exceeding great fear to see that he was weeping that such a man should weep but garnet forced himself to speak you cannot listen to me now i will come again and talk to you god knows the agony to me and worst of all that it is for nothing yet all of it not a thousandth part of the anguish i have caused perhaps it is wisest so perhaps it is for my childrens sake that i who have killed your pet child cannot make you know it yet it adds to my despair that i have killed the father too scarcely knowing voice from silence dazed himself and blurred and giddyso strong is contagion of the mindbull garnet went to the stables saddled a horse without calling groom and rode off at full gallop to dr buller by the time he got there his business habits and wonted fashion of thought had returned and he put what he came for in lucid form tersely crisply dryly as if in the world there were no such thing as illregulated emotionexcept on the part of other people not a bit of it said dr buller his mind is as sound as yours or mine and his constitution excellent he has been troubled a good deal but bless mei know a man who lost his three children in a month and could scarcely pay for their coffins sir and his wife only six weeks afterwards that is what i call trouble sir bull garnet knew from his glistening eyes and the quivering of his grey locks that the man he spoke of was himself reassured about sir cradock yet fearing to try him further at present mr garnet went heavily homewards after begging dr buller to call as if by chance at the hall observe and attend to the master heavily and wearily bull garnet went to the home which once had been so sweet to him and was now beloved so painfully the storms of earth were closing round him only the stars of heaven were bright myriad as the forest leaves and darkly moving in like manner fears and doubts and miseries sprang and trembled through him no young maid at his door to meet him lovingly and gaily none to say oh darling father how hungry you must be dear only pearl so wan and cold and scared of soft affection and as she timidly approached then dropped her eyes before his gaze and took his hat submissively as if she had no lips to kiss no hand to lay on his shoulder he saw with one quick glance that still some new grief had befallen her that still another trouble was come to make its home with her what is it pearl he asked her sadly come in here and tell me he never called her his pearly now his little native or pretty pet as he used to do in the old days they had dropped those little endearments you will be sorry to hear itsorry i mean that it happened but i could not have done otherwise i never hear anything now pearl but what i am sorry to hear this will make little difference so i suppose she answered mr pell has been here today andandoh father you know what indeed i have not been informed of anything what do i know of mr pell more than he does of you sir he asked me to be his wife he is a good man but of course you said no of course i did of course of course what else can i ever say she leaned her white cheek on the high oak mantel and a little deep sob came from her heart would you have liked to say yes pearl her father asked very softly going to put his arm round her waist and then afraid to do it oh no oh no at least not yet though i respect him very highly but i told him that i never could and never could tell him the reason and oh i was so sorry for himhe looked so hurt and disappointed you shall tell him the reason very soon or rather the newspapers shall father dont say that dear father you are bound for our sake i dont care for him one atom father compared withcompared with you i mean only i thought i must tell you becauseoh you know what i mean and even if i did like him what would it matter about me oh father i often think that i have been too hard upon you and all of it through me and my vile concealment my daughter i am not worthy of you would god that you could forgive me i have done it long ago father do you think a child of yours could help it after all your sorrow my child look kindly at me try to look as if you loved me she turned to him with such a look as a man only gets once in his life and then she fell upon his neck and forgot the world and all it held except her own dear father wrong he might have done wrong no doubt he had done but who was she his little child to remember it against him she lay for a moment in his arms overcome with passion leaning back as she had done there when a weanling infant for him it was the grandest moment of his passionate lifea fathers powerful love ennobled by the presence of his god such a moment teaches us the grandeur of our race the traces of a higher world stamped on us indelibly then we feel and try to own that in spite of satire cynicism and the exquisite refinements of the purest selfishness there is in even the sharpest and the shallowest of us something kind and solid some abiding element of the allpervading goodness now i will go through with itbull garnet was recoveringmy own child go and fetch your brother if it will not be too much for you if you think it will only send him father i will fetch him i may be able to help you both and now i am so much better presently she returned with bob who looked rather plagued and uncomfortable with a great slice of cork in one hand and a bottle of gum in the other and a regular housewife of needles in the lappet of his coat he was going to mount a specimen of a variety of devils coachhorse which he had never seen before and whose tail was forked like a trident never can let me alone said bob just ready to begin i was and i am sure to spoil his thorax he is getting stiff every moment bull garnet looked at him brightly and gladly even at such a time little as he knew or cared about the things that crawl and hopas he ignorantly put itskilled no more in natural history than our early painters were yet from his own strong sense he perceived that his son had a special gift and a special gift is genius and may with good luck climb eminence then he thought of what he had to tell him and the power of his heart was gone it was the terror of this moment which had dwelt with him night and day more than the fear of public shame of the gallows or of hell to be loathed and scorned by his only son oh that pearl had not been so true oh that bob suspected something or had even found it out for himself then the father felt that now came part of his expiation bob looked at him quite innocently with wonder and some fear to him the governor long had been the strangest of all puzzles sometimes so soft and loving sometimes so hard and terrible perhaps poor bob would catch it now for his doings with eoa sit down there my son not there but further from me dont be at all afraid my boy i have no fault to find with you i am far luckier in my son than you are in your father you must try to bear terrible news bob your sister long has borne it pearl who was ghastly pale and trembling stole a glance at each of them from the dark end of the room then came up bravely into the lamplight took bobs hand and kissed him and sat close by to comfort him bull garnet sighed from the depths of his heart his children seemed to be driven from him and to crouch together in fear of him it serves me right i know that of course that only makes it the worse to bear father what is it cried bob leaping up and dropping his corkslice and gumbottle whatever the matter is father tell me that i may stand by you you cannot stand by me in this when you know what it is you will fly from me will i indeed a likely thing oh father you think i am such a soft because i am fond of little things would you stand by your father bob if you knew that he was a murderer oh come said bob you are drawing it a little too strong dad you never could be that you know i not only can be but am my son father and son looked at one another the governor standing square and broad with his shoulders thrown well back and no trace of emotion in form or face except that his quick wide nostrils quivered and his lips were white the stripling gazing up at him seeking for some sign of jest seeking for a ray of laughter in his fathers eyes too young to comprehend the power and fury of large passion ere either spoke another wordfor the father was hurt at the sons delay and the son felt all abroad in his headbetween them glided pearl the daughter the sister the gentle womanthe one most wronged of all and yet the quickest to forgive it darling he did it for my sake she whispered to her brother though it cut through her heart to say it father oh father bob is so slow dont be angry with him come to me a moment father oh how i love and honour you those last few words to the passionate man were like heaven poured into hell that a child of his should still honour him he kissed her with tenfold the love young man has for maiden then he turned away and wept as if the earth was water very little more was said pearl went away to bob and whispered how the fatal grief befell and bob wept great tears for the sake of all and most of all for his fathers sake then as the father lay cramped up upon the little sofa wrestling with the power of life and the promise of death bob came up and kissed him dearly on his rugged forehead is that you my own dear son god is far too good to me chapter xv that night the man of violence enjoyed the first sweet dreamless sleep that had spread its velvet shield between him and his guilt and sorrow pearl who had sat up late with bob comforting and crying with him listened at her fathers door and heard his quiet breathing through many months of trouble now she had watched him kindly tenderly fearing ever some wild outbreak upon others or himself hiding in her empty heart all its desolation the very next day bull garnet resolved to have it out with his son not to surprise him by emotion to a hasty issue but now to learn what he thought and felt after taking his time about it all this we need not try to tell only so much as bears upon the staple of the story father i know that you hadyou had good reason for doing it there could be no good reason there might be and were many bad ones of this i will not speak to you i did it in violence and fury and under a false impression when i saw him with his arm cast round my pure and darling pearl satans rage is but a smile compared to the fury of my heart he had his gun and i had mine i had taken it to shoot a squirrel which meddled with our firework nonsense i tore her from him before i could speak thrust her aside stepped back two paces gave him one two three and fired he had time to fire in selfdefence and his muzzle was at my head and his finger on the trigger but there it crooked and he could not pull want of nerve i suppose i saw his finger shaking and then i saw him fall now my son you know everything why father after all then it was nothing worse than a duel he had just the same chance of killing you and would have done it only you were too quick for him even to retain your love i will have no lie in the matter bob although a duel in my opinion is only murder made game of but this was no duel no manslaughter even but an act of downright murder no english jury could help convicting me and i will never plead insanity it was the inevitable result of inborn violence and selfwill growing and growing from year to year and strengthened by wrongs of which you know nothing god knows that i have fought against it but my weapon was pride not humility now let this miserable subject never be recurred to by us at least in words till the end comes as soon as i hear that poor innocent cradock is apprehended and brought to england i shall surrender myself and confess but for your sake and poor pearlys i should have done so at the very outset now it is very likely that i may not have the option two persons know that i did it although they have no evidence so far as i am aware a third person more than suspects it and is seeking about for the evidence moreover sir cradock nowell to whom as i told you i owned my deed although he could not then understand me may have done so since or may hereafter do so at any lucid interval oh father father he never would be so mean he is bound by his duty to do itand for his living sons sake he must i only tell you these things my son to spare you a part of the shock one month now is all i crave to do my best for you two darlings i will not ruin the chance by going again to sir cradock god saved me from my own rash words doubtless for your pure sake now knowing all and reflecting upon it can you call me still your father bob this was one of the times that tell whether a father has through life thought more of himself or of his children if of himself they fall away like southern ivies in a storm parasites which cannot cling but glide on the marble surface but if he has made his future of them closer they cling and clasp more firmly like our british ivy engrailed into the house wall so the garnet family clung together although no longer blossoming but flagging sorely with blight and canker and daily fear of the woodman bob of course avoided eoa to her great indignation though he could not quite make up his mind to tell her that all was over without showing reason for it in the forcing temperature of trouble he was suddenly become a man growing daily more like his father in all except the violence he roamed no more through the wilds of the forest but let the birds nest comfortably the butterflies hover in happiness and the wireworm cast his shard unchallenged he would care for all those things again if he ever recovered his comfort now eoa as everybody knew did not by any means embody the spirit of toleration she would hardly allow any will but her own in anything that concerned her in a word she was a child a very warmhearted and lovely one but therefore all the more requiring a strong will founded on common sense to lead her into the lifebrunt and so if she must have bob some day she had better have him consolidated though reduced to three per cent not discerning her own interests she would have been wild as a hare ought to be at the vernal equinox but for one little fact there was nobody to be jealous of darling amy whom she loved as all young ladies love one anotheruntil they see cause to the contrarysweet thing she was gone to oxford with her dear good father they had slipped off without any fuss at all except from biddy ogaghan who came and threw an old shoe at them because mr rosedew in the first place felt that he could not bear it and thought in the second place that it would be an uncourteous act towards sir cradock nowell to allow any demonstration and yet it was notorious that even job hogstaff had arranged to totter down on mark stotes arm followed by a dozen tenants all of whom had leases and the rank and file of nowelhurst who had paid their houserent and then there would be a marshalling outside the parsonagegate and upon the appearance of the fly job with his crutch would testify whereupon a shout would arise pronouncing everlasting divorce between church and state in nowelhurst undying gratitude to the former and defiance to the latter power yet all this programme was nullified by the departure of john and his household gods at five oclock one may morning already he had received assurance from some of his ancient comates at oriel most cohesive of colleges that they would gladly welcome him and find him plenty of work to do in less than six weeks time of course the long vacation would begin what of that let him come at once and with his widespread reputation he must have the pick of all the men who would stay up to read for honours for now the fruit of a lifetime lore was ripening over his honoured head not like that of tantalus wafted into the cloudland not even waiting to be plucked at but falling unawares into his broad and simple bosom where it might lie uncared for except for the sake of amy so large a mind had long outlived the little itch for fame quite untruly called the last infirmity of noble minds their first it is beyond all doubt and wisely nature orders it their last is far more apt to beat least in this generationcontempt of fame and man and god except for practical purposes mr rosedews careful treatises upon the sabellian and sabellooscan elements had stirred up pleasant controversy in the narrow world of scholars and now at the tritomegistic blow of the roseororine hammer ringing upon no less a theme than the tables of iguvium the wise men who sit round the board of classical education even jupiter grabovius the original of john bull had clapped their hands and cried hear hear he knows what he is talking of and he is one of us that after all is the essence of itto know what one is talking of and the grand advantage of the ancient universities is not the tone of manners not the knowledge of liferather a hatbox thing with themnot even the high ideal the manliness and the chivalry which the better class of men win but the curt knowledge whether or not they are talking of what they know scire quod nescias is taught if they teach us nothing else and though we are all still apt to talk especially among ladies of things beyond our acquaintanceelse haply we talk but littlewe do so with a qualm and quasi and fluttering sense that effrontery is notbut leads topluck nevertheless who am i to talk proving myself by every word false to alma mater having ventured all along to talk of things beyond me as they rose the hill towards carfax amy tired as she was trembled with excitement her father had won a cure in st olesderived no doubt from oleoand all were to lodge in pembroke lane pending mature arrangements though they might have turned off near the jail and saved a little cab fare john would go by the broader way as his fashion always was except in a little posthumous matter wherein perhaps we have overdefined with brimstone the directionposts be that as it maynot to press the scire quod nescias potential in such a case i hope rather than conjunctivethere they must be left all three with jenny and jemima outside and jem pottles on the pavement amazed at the cheek of everything only let one thing be said though prettier girl than amy rosedew had never stepped on the stones of oxford since the time of amy robsart if even thennever once was she insulted lowest of all low calumnies there are blackguards among university men as everybody knows and as there must be among all men but even those blackguards can see the difference between a lady or rather between a pure girl andanother and even those blackguards have an intensified reverence for the onebut let the matter pass for now we hide in gold these subjects and sham not to see their flaunting be it however confessed that amy whose father soon had rooms in college not to live but to lecture in being a very shy young maiden never could be brought to come and call him to his teaoh no so many young men in gorgeous trappings charms and dangles and hooks of gold and eyeglasses very knowingnot to mention volunteer stuff and knickerbockers demonstrant of calfoddly enough they would happen to feel so interested in the architecture of the porters lodge whenever amy came by never gazing too warmly at her but contriving to convey their regret at the suppression of their sentiments and their yearning to be the stones she trod on and their despair at the possibility of her not caring if they were soreally all this was so trying that amy would never go into college without aunt doxy before her gazing fourgunned cupolas even at scouts and manciples and this was very provoking of her not only to the hearts that beat under waistcoats ordered for her sake but also to the domestic kettle aboil in pembroke lane for over and over again uncle john great as he was in chronology and every kind of marmora and able to detect a flaw upon potamogeitons tombstone lost all sense of time and place me and te and hocce and doxy and calmly went home some two hours late and complacently received doxology but alas we must abandon amy to the insidious designs of hebdomadal board the velvet approaches of proctor and pro and the brass of the gentlemen bedels while we regard more rugged scenes from which she was happily absent rufus hutton had found the missing link and at the same time the strongest staple of the desired evidence the battered gunbarrels had been identified and even the number deciphered by the foreman of messrs l and co and the entry in their books of the sale of that very gun number gauge and other particulars beyond all doubt corresponding wasto bull garnet c nowelhurst dell cottage whom also they could identify from his stronglymarked physiognomy and his quick decisive manner and the cartridgecase which had lain so long in dr huttons pocket of course they could not depose to its sale together with the gun but this they could show that it fitted the gauge was not at all of a common gauge but two sizes largerno in factand must have been sold during the month in which they sold the gun because it was one of a sample which they had taken upon approval and soon discarded for a case of better manufacture then as to motive rufus hutton himself could depose to that or the probability of it from what he had seen but not understood at the fixing of the fireworks neither had he forgotten the furious mood of bull garnet both then and in his garden while he was doubting how to actfor clearly as he knew his power to hang the man who had outraged him the very fact of his injury made him loth to use that power for he was not at all a vindictive man now the heat of the thing was past and he saw that the sudden attack had been made in selfdefencewhile he was hesitating between his sense of duty and pity for cradock on one hand and his ideas of magnanimity and horror of hanging a man on the other he was thrown without any choice or chance across the track of simon chope perhaps there is no more vulgar error no stronger proof of ignorance and slavery to catchwords than to abuse or think ill of any particular class of men solely on account of their professionalthough perhaps we might justly throw the onus probandi their merit upon hangmen bodysnatchers informers and a few othersyet may i think deprecating most humbly the omen of this conjunction that solicitors tailors and methodist parsons fight at some disadvantage both in fact and in fiction yet can they hold their own and sympathy if owing is sure to have to pay themnotwithstanding goose and amen away with all feeble flippancy heavy tidings came to nowelhurst hall dell cottage and geopharmacy lodge simultaneously as might be on the th of june the taprobane had been lost with every soul on board and this is the record of it enshrined in many journals by recent advices from capetown per the screwsteamer sutler we sincerely regret to learn that the magnificent clipperbuilt ship taprobane of tons new system a at lloyds for years and bound from the thames to colombo with a cargo valued by competent judges at l took the shore in benguela bay during a typhoon of unprecedented destructiveness it is our melancholy duty to add that the entirety of the valuable cargo was entirely lost although very amply assured in unexceptionable quarters and that every soul on board was consigned to a watery grave a portuguese gentleman of good family and large fortune who happened to be in the neighbourhood was an eyewitness to the catastrophe and made superhuman exertions to rescue the unfortunate mariners but alas in vain senhor jos de calcavello has arrived at the conclusion that some of her copper may be saved the illfated bark broke up so rapidly from the powerful action of the billows that her identity could only be established from a portion of her sternpost which was discovered half buried in sand three nautical miles to the southward we have been informed upon good authority although we are not at liberty to mention our source of information that her britannic majestys steamcorvette mumbo jumbo pierced for twentyeight guns and carrying two is under orders to depart as soon as ever she can be coaled for the scene of the recent catastrophe meanwhile the tug growler has arrived with all the memorials of the calamity after affording the rites of sepulture to the poor shipwrecked mariners cast up by the treacherous billows the set of the current being so adverse we have reason to fear that the rest of the bodies must have fallen a prey to the monsters of the deep there are said to be some hopes of recovering a portion of the specie mrs corklemore happened to be calling at geopharmacy lodge when the london papers arrived in the early afternoon rufus begged pardon and broke the cover to see something in which he was interested presently he cried good god and let the paper fall and seasoned as he was and shallowed by the shifting of his life it was not in his power to keep two little tears from twinkling too late all my work he said heaven has settled it without me how very sad cried mrs corklemore dashing aside an unbidden tear when she came to the end of the story to think of all those brave men lost and perhaps you knew some of them dr hutton oh i am so sorry why surely you know that the taprobane was the ship in which poor cradock nowell sailed under mr rosedews auspices oh i hope not please not to say so it would be so very horrible that he should go without repenting you must have forgotten mrs corklemore for i heard rosa tell you the name of the ship and her destination oh very likely ah now i remember for the moment it quite escaped me how truly truly grievedit has quite overcome me oh please not to notice meplease not i am so stupidly softhearted ohea isha ea no woman in the world could cry more beautifully than poor georgie and now she cried her very best it would have gone to the heart of the driest and bitterest sceptic that ever doubted all men and women because they would doubt him but rufus whose form of selfassertion was not universal negation in what manner then do you suppose that rufus hutton was liquefied a simple sort of fellow he was notwithstanding all his shrewdness although or perhaps i should say because he thought himself so knowing and his observation was more the result of experience than the cause of it so away he ran to fetch rosa and rosa wiped dear sensitive georgies eyes and coaxed her very pleasantly and admired her more than ever bull garnet rode home at twelve oclock from a long mornings work he never could eat any breakfast now and his manner was to leave home at six except when he went to winchester gallop fiercely from work to work or sometimes walk his horse and think often with glistening eyes when any little thing touched him and return to his cottage and rest there during the workmens dinnertime then he had some sort of a meal himself which pearl began to call dinner and away with a fresh horse in half an hour spending his body if only so he might earn rest of mind all this was telling upon him fearfully even his muscular force was going and his quickness of eye and hand failing him he knew it and was glad only none should ever say though every crime was heaped upon him that he had neglected his masters interests he tore the paper open in his sudden turbulent fashion as if all paper was rags and no more and with one glance at each column knew all that was in the tweenways suddenly he came to a place at the corner of a page which made him cease from eating he glanced at pearl but she was busy peeling new potatoes for him bob was not come in yet darling i must go to london if possible i shall return tonight if i catch the one oclock up express then he opened the window and ordered a horse his loud voice ringing and echoing round every corner of the cottage and in five minutes he was off at full gallop for the express would not stop at brockenhurst at he was in london and at in the countinghouse of messrs brown and smithson owners or at any rate charterers of the taprobane stripedball chambers fenchurch street there he would learn if he could what their private advices were the clerks received him very politely and told him that they had little doubt of the truth of the evil tidings of course the fatality might have been considerably exaggerated c c but as to the loss of the ship they had taken measures to replace her would he mind waiting only ten minutes though they saw that he was in a hurry the cape mailship had been telegraphed from falmouth they had sent to the office already and expected to get the reply within a quarter of an hour every information in their power cwe all know the form though we dont always get the civility bull garnet waited heavily with his great back against a stout brass rail having declined the chair they offered him and in less than five minutes he received authentic detail of everything he listened to nothing except one statement every soul on board was lost sir then he went out in a lumpish manner from the noble room and was glad to get hold of the iron rail in the bend of the dark stone staircase so now he was a double murderer finding it not enough to have killed one brother in his fury he had slain the other twin through his cowardly concealment floating about in tropical slime without a shark to eat him leaving behind him the fair repute of a moneygrabbing fratricide and he the man who had done it all who had loved the boy and ruined him miserably plotting for his own far inferior children no no not that at any rategood and noble children and how they had borne his villainy god in mercy only make him try to make him over again and how different his life would be all his better part brought out all his lower kicked away to the devil the responsible father of it good god how my heart goes death is upon me well i know but let me die with my children byunless i turn hymnwriter quick as he was in his turns of thoughtall of them subjectivehe was scarcely a match for the situation when mr chope and bailey kettledrum brushed by the sleeves of his light overcoat and entered the doors with pushpull on them but being both of the pushing order rather than the pulling employed indiscriminate propulsion and were out of sight in a moment still retaining some little of his circumspective powers bull garnet knew them both from a corner flash of his sad tearladen eyes there was no mistaking that great legal head like the breechend of a cannon mr kettledrum might have been overlooked for little men of a fussy nature are common enough in london or for that matter everywhere else but garnets attention being drawn he knew them both of course and the errand they were come upon and how soon they were likely to return and what they would think of his being there if they should happen to see him nevertheless he would not budge nothing could matter much now he must think out his thoughts when this puff of air was past which many breathe almost long enough to learn that it was life some so long as to weary of it none so long as to understand all its littleness and greatnesswhen that should be gone from him and absorbed into a boundless region even more unknown would not the wrong go with it if unexpiated here and abide there evermore and not to think of himself alonewhat an example now to leave to his innocent injured children the fury hidden by treachery the cowardice sheathed in penitence dn it all he would have no more of it his cursed mind was made up a man can die in the flesh but once his spirit had been dying daily going to the devil daily every day for months and he found no place for repentance as for his children they must abide it no man of any mind would blame them for their fathers crime if it was more than they could bear let them bolt to america anywhither anywhere so long as they came home in heavenif he could only get thereto the father who had injured ruined bullied cursed and loved them so after burning out this hell of thought in his miserable brain he betook himself to natures remedyinstant headlong action he rushed down the stairs forgetting all about chope and bailey kettledrum shouted to the driver of a hansom cab so that he sawed his horses mouth raw leaped in and gave him half a sovereign through the pigeonhole to get to ds bank before the closing time but at temple bar of course there was a regular chubbs lock after a minor bramah one at the bottom of ludgate hill cabby was forced to cut it and slash up chancery lane and across by kings college hospital and back into the strand by wych street it is easy to imagine bull garnets state of mind yet the imagination would be that and nothing more he sat quite calmly without a word knowing that man and horse were doing their utmost of skill and speed and having dealt enough with both to know that to worry them then is waste the bank had been closed the dayporter said as he girded himself for his walk to brixton exactlylet him seeyes exactly one minute and thirtyfive seconds ago most of the gentlemen were still inside of course and if the gentlemans business was of a confidentialhere he intimated not by words that there were considerations bow street policeoffice mr garnet cried to the driver not even glancing again at the disappointed doorkeeper in five minutes he was there man and horse seemed strung and nerved with his own excitement a stolid policeman stood at the door as bull garnet leaped out anyhow with his high colour gone away as in death and his wiry legs cramped with vehemence then bobby saw that he had met his master the perception being a mental feat far beyond the average leap of police agility accordingly he touched his hat and crinkled his eyes in a manner discovered by policemen in consequence of the suggestion afforded by the pegging of their hats mr bennings gone asked bull garnet pushing towards the entrance his wusship is gone arf an hour sir or may be at most fifty minutes can we do anything for you sir his wusship always go according to the business as is on thank you replied mr garnet that is quite enough what time do they leave at marlborough street according to the business sir but gone afore us amost always we sits as long as anybody and gets through twice the business but any message you like to leave or anything to be entered i can take the responsibility no it does not matter i will only leave my card mr bennings knows me be kind enough to give him this when he comes tomorrow morning perhaps i may call tomorrow at present i cannot say the policeman lifted his hat again like a cup taken up from a saucer and bull garnet sat heavily down in the cab and banged the doorshutters before him strand he called out to the driver d and cs the watchmakers there he bought a beautiful watch and gold chain for his daughter pearl giving a cheque for nearly all his balance at the bankers the cheque was so large that in common prudence the foreman declined to cash it without some confirmation but mr garnet gave him a reference which in ten minutes was established and in ten more he was off again with his very handsome trinkets and a large sum in banknotes and gold the balance of his draft where now sir shouted the driver delighted with his fare and foreseeing another halfsovereign i will tell you in thirty seconds well if he aint a rum un cabby muttered to himself while amid volleys of strong language he kept his horse gyrating like a twinscrew ship trying circles but rum customers is our windfalls should have thought it a reward case only for the bobby keep a lookout anyhow unless he orders me back to bedlam not bedlam waterloo station main line said bull garnet standing up in front and looking at him over the roof five minutes is all i give you mind what a blessed fool i am said the cabman below his breath but lashing his horse explosivelyto throw away half a sovereign sooner than hold my tongue he must be the devil himself to have heard meand as for eyesgood lord i shouldnt like to drive him much you are wrong replied mr garnet through the pigeonhole handing him twopence for the tollman i am not the devil sir as you may some day know have no fear of ever driving me again you shall have your halfsovereign when i have got my ticket follow me in and you shall know for what place i take it the cabman was too dumbfoundered to do anything but resolve that he would go straight home when he got his money and tell his old woman about it then he applied himself to the whip in earnest for he could not too soon be rid of this job and so bull garnet won his train and gave the driver the other halfsovereign with a peculiar nod having noticed that he feared to approach while the ticket was applied for bull garnet took a secondclass ticket his extravagance towards the cabman was the last he would ever exhibit he felt a call upon him now to save for his family every farthing all was lost to them but money and alas too much of that now if he cut his throat in the train could he be attainted of felony and would god be any the harder on him no he did not think he would it might be some sort of atonement even but then the shock to pearl and bob to see him brought home with his head hanging back and hopeless red stitches under it it would make the poor girl a maniac after all the shocks and anguish he had benumbed her with already what a fool he had been not to buy strychnine prussic acid or laudanum and yetand yetand yethe would like to see them just once moreblessed heartsonce more he sat in the last compartment of the last carriage in the train which had been added in a hurry immediately behind the break van and the swinging and the jerking very soon became tremendous he knew not neither cared to know that simon chope and bailey kettledrum were in a firstclass carriage near the centre of the train presently the violent motion began to tell upon him and he felt a heavy dullness creeping over his excited mind and all the senses which had been during several hours of tension as prompt and acute as ever they were in his prime of power began to flag and daze and wane and he fell into a waking dream a second person of sorrow but firstwhether for suicide or for selfdefence he had tried both doors and found them locked and he was far too large a man to force his way through the window he dreamed with a loose sense of identity about the innocent childhood the boyhoods aspiration the young mans sense of ability endorsing the right to aspire even his bodily power and vigour revived in the dream before him and he knitted his muscles and clenched his fists and was ready to fight fools and liars who had fought more hard and hotly against the hard cold ways of the age the despite done to the poor and lowly the sarcasm bred by selfconscious serfdom in clever men of the world the preference of gold to love and of position to happiness all the weak gregarious tricks shifts of coat and pupaism whereby we noble christians reduce our social history to a passage in entomology and quench the faith of thinking men in him whose name we take in vainthe great originatorall these feminine contradictions and fond things foully invented fables atellan if they be not actually fescennine had roused the combatism of young bull ere he learned his own disgrace and when he learned it such as it wasa proof by its false incidence how infantile our civilization isall his mothers bitter wrong her lifelong sense of shame and crushing because she had trusted a liar and the hollow elderstick institution was held up against her and none would take her part without money even if she had wished it then he had chosen his mothers course inheriting her strong nature let the shame lie where it fell by right and not by rule and carried all his energies into neochristian largeness all that time of angry trial now had passed before him and the five years of his married life which had not been very happy for his wife never understood him but met his quick moodiness with soft sulks and then in his dreamreview he smiled as his children began to toddle about and sit on his knees and look at him once he awoke and gazed about him the train had stopped at winchester he was all alone in the carriage still and all his cash was safe he had stowed it away very carefully in a hidden pocket to his languid surprise he fell back on the seat how unlike himself to be sure and with so much yet to do he strove to arise and rouse himself he felt for the little flask of wine which pearl had thrust into his pocket but he could not pull it out and drink such a languor lay upon him he had felt it before but never before been so overcome by it once or twice an hour or so before the sun came back again this strange cold deadness like a mammoth nightmare frozen had lain on him in his lonely bed and then he knew what death was and only came back to life again through cold sweat and long fainting he had never consulted any doctor about the meaning of this with his bold way of thinking and judging only by his own experience and feeling he had long ago decided that all medical men were quacks what one disorder could they cure all they had learned and that by a fluke was a way to anticipate one and even that way seemed worn out now now he fell away and feared and tried to squeeze his breast and tried to pray to god but no words came nor any thoughts only sense of dying and horror at having prayed for it a coldness fell upon his heart and on his brain an ignorance he was falling into a great blank depth and nothing belonged to him any moreonly utter utter loss and not a dream of god happy and religious folk who have only died in theory contemplating distant death knowing him only as opportune among kinsfolk owning consols these may hope for a prayerbook end sacrament administered weeping friends the heavenward soul glad to fly through the golden door animula vagula blandula yet assured of its reception with a heavenly smile of foretastethis may be no doubt it may be after the life of a christian bayard though it need not always be even then all we who from our age know death and have taken little trips into him through fits paralysis or suchlike are quite aware that he has at first call as much variety as life has but the death of the violent man is not likely to be placid unless it come unawares or has been graduated through years of remorse and weakness weariness and repentance then he tried to rise and fought once more with agony inconceivable against the heavy yet hollow numbness in the hold of his deep wide chest against the dark cold stealth of death and the black narrow depth of the grave the train ran lightly and merrily into brockenhurst station while the midsummer twilight floated like universal gossamer in the yard stood the kettledrum rattletrap and the owner was right glad to see it in his eyes it was worth a dozen of the lord mayors coach none of the children come dear asked bailey having kissed his wife as behoves a man from london no darling not one that here she used an adjective which sounded too much like odious for me to trust my sensesgeorgie would not allow them now darling did you do exactly what i told you yes darling anna i did the best i could i had a basin of mulligatawny at waterloo going up and one of mockturtle coming back and at basingstoke hamsandwiches a glass of cold cognac and water and some lemonchips since that nothing at all because there has been no time you are a dear said mrs kettledrum to do exactly as i told you now come round the corner a moment and take two glasses of sherry i can see quite well to pour it out i am so glad of her new crinoline she wont get out dont be afraid dear oh georgie georgie to think that her own sister should be so low so unfeeling and treacherous mr kettledrum smacked his lips for the sake of euphony after the second glass of sherry but his wife would not give him any more for fear of spoiling his supper then they came back and both got in and squeezed themselves up together in the front seat of the old carriage for mrs corklemore occupied the whole of the seat of honour you are very polite to keep me so long innocent turtles sweet childish anxiety the last survivor of a wrecked train so you took advantage anna dear of my not being dressed quite so vulgarly as you are to discuss this little matter with him keeping me in ignorance the carriage was off by this time and open as it was they had no fear of old coachey hearing for it took a loud hail to reach him take the honour of a kettledrum cried bailey smiting his bosom that the subject has not even been broached between my wiser part and myself ladies in this pure aerialno i mean etherealair with the shades of night around us and the breezes wafting would an exceedingly choice and delicately aromatic cigar oh i should so like it bailey and perhaps we shall have the nightingales i fear we must not think of it interposed mrs corklemore gently my dress is of a fabric quite newly introduced very beautiful but like myself too retentive of impressions if mr kettledrum smokes i shall have to throw it away there goes the cigar instead cried bailey the paramount rights of ladies ever have been and ever shall be sacred with bailey kettledrum but mrs kettledrum was so vexed that she jumped up as if to watch the cigar spinning into the darkness and contrived with sisterly accuracy to throw all her weight upon a certain portion of a certain lovely foot whereupon there ensued the neatest little passes into which we need not enter enough that mrs corklemore having higher intellectual gifts won in the language of the ring both eventsfirst tear and first hysterical symptom come cried mr kettledrum at the very first opportunity to wit when both were crying we all know what sisters are how they mingle thethe sweetness of their affection with a certainah yesa piquancy of expression most pleasant most improving because so highly conducive to selfexamination here he stood up having made a hit worthy of the house of commons all these little breezes ladies may be called the tradewinds of affection they blow from pole to pole the tradewinds never do that said georgie they pass us by as the idle wind when the clouds are like a whale ladies having overcome us for a moment like a summer dream hark to that thrush sitting perhaps on his eggsoh oh from the gallery of naturecan there be i pause for a reply anything but harmony where the voices of the night pervade and the music of the spheres youyou do speak so splendidly dear sobbed mrs kettledrum from the corner but it is a nasty wicked cruel story about dear papa saying that of me and he in his grave poor dear quite unable to vindicate himself i have always thought it so unchristian to malign the dead whats that cried georgie starting up in fear and hot earnest you are chattering so you hear nothing a horse dashed by them at full gallop with his rider on his neck shouting and yelling and clinging and lashing missed the wheel by an inch cried kettledrum drawing his head in faster than he had thrust it out a fire man or a french invasion but the man was out of hearing while the kettledrum horses scared and jumping as from an equine thunderbolt tried the strength of leather and the courage of ladies meanwhile at the station behind them there was a sad ado a man was lifted out of the train being found in the last compartment by the guard who knew his destinationa big man and a heavy one and they bore him to the wretched shed which served there as a waitingroom dead i believe said the guard having sent a boy for brandy dead as a doornail whoever he be not thee knaw who he be cried a forester coming in whoy marn there be no mistaking he he be our muster garnet whew and the train whistled on as it must do whether we live or die or when cyclops has made mince of us chapter xvi that night there had been great excitement in the village of nowelhurst a rumour had reached it that cradock nowell loved in every cottage there partly as their own production partly as their future owner partly for his own sake and most of all for his misfortunes was thrown into prison to stand his trial for the murder of his brother another rumour was that to prevent any scandal to the nobility he had been sent to sea alone in a seventyfour gun ship with corks in her bottom tied with wire arranged so as to fly all at once same as if it was gingerbeer bottles on the seventh day when the saltwater had turned the wires rusty it is hard to say of these two reports which roused the greater indignation perhaps on the whole the former did because the latter was supposed to be according to institution anyhow all the village was out in the street that night and the folding of arms and the selfimportance the confidential winks and the power to say more but for hypernestorean prudence were at their acme in a knot of gaffers gathered around rufus hutton and affording him good sport nothing now could be done in nowelhurst without rufus hutton he had that especial knack mistaken sometimes in a statesman for really high qualities which becomes in a woman true capacity for gossip by virtue thereof rufus hutton was now primeminister of nowelhurst and sir cradock the king being nothing more now than the shadow of a name his deputys power was absolute he knew the history by this time of every cottage and pigsty and tombstone in the churchyard how much every man got every week and how much he gave his wife out of it what he had for dinner on sundays and how long he made his waistcoat last suddenly the doublebarrelled noise which foreruns a horse at full gallop came from the bridge and old folk hobbled and young got ready to run hoorawhooraw cried a dozen and a half of boys here be hempror o roosia coming boys will believe almost anything when they get excited having taken the trick from their fathers but even the women were disappointed when the galloping horse stopped short in the crowd and from his withers shot forward and fell with both hands full of mane a personage not more august than the porter at brockenhurst station catch the horse you fool cried rufus cuss the horse said the porter trying to draw breath better been under a train i had dont stand gaping chawbacons is ever a sawbones surgeon doctor or what the devil you call them in these outlandish parts to be got for love or money i am a sawbones said rufus hutton coming forward with his utmost dignity and its a mercy i dont saw yours young man if thats all you know of riding the porter touched his hair instead of his hat which was gone long ago while the chawbacons rallied and laughed at him and one offered him a zidezaddle and all the women of the village felt that dr hutton had quenched the porter and vindicated nowelhurst when you have recovered your breath young man continued rufus pushing as he always did his advantage and thanked god for your escape from the first horse you ever mounted perhaps you will tell us your errand and we chawbacons will consider it a gruff hawhaw and some treble hehes added to the porters discomfiture for he could not come to time yet being now in the second tense of exhaustion which is even worse than the first being rather of the heart than lungs stationmr garnetdead was all the man could utter and that only in spasms and with great chestheavings rufus hutton leaped on the horse in a moment caught up old channings stick and was out of sight in the summer dusk ere any one else in the crowd had done more than gape and say oh lor by dint of skill he sped the old horse nearly as quickly to the station as the fury of jehu had brought him thence and landed him at the door with far less sign of exhaustion then walking into the little room in the manner of a man who thoroughly knows his work he saw a sight which never in this world will leave him upon a hard sofa shored up with an ashlog where the mahogany was sprung and poked up into a corner as if to get a bearing there with blankets piled upon him heavily and tucked round the collar of his coat and his great head hanging over the rise where the beading of the brass ends lay the illfated bull garneta man from birth to death a subject for pity more than terror fifty years oldmore than fifty yearsand scarce a twelvemonth of happiness since the shakings of the world began and childhoods dream was over toiling ever for the future toiling for his children ever since he had them labouring to make peace with god if only he might have his own where passion is not but love abides the room smelled strongly of bad brandy some of which was oozing now down his broad square chin and dripping from the great blue jaw of course he could not swallow it and now one of the women for three had rushed in was performing that duty for him turn out that drunken hag cried dr hutton feeling he had no idea how up with the window bring the sofa here and take all but one of those blankets off but master objected another woman hell take his death of cold turn out that woman also he was instantly obeyed now roll up one of those blankets and put it under his head herethis side cant you see good god what a set of fellows you are to let a mans head hang down like that hot water and a sponge this instant nearly boiling mind you plenty of it and a foottub now dont stare at me with a quick light hand he released the blue and turgid throat from the narrow necktie then laid his forefinger upon the heart and watched the eyelids intently appleplexy no doubt master said the most intelligent of the men i have eared that if you can bleed them hold your tongue or ill phlebotomise you that big word inspired universal confidence because no one understood it now support him in that position while i pull his boots off one of you run to the inn for a bottle of french cognacnot this filthy stuff mindand a corkscrew and a teaspoon now the hot water here in with his feet and bathe his legs while i sponge his face and chestas hot as you can bear your hands in it his heart is all but stopped and his skin as cold as ice thats it quicker yet dont be afraid of scalding him there he begins to feel it the dying mans great heavy eyelids slowly and feebly quivered and a long deep sigh arose but there was not strength to fetch it dr hutton took advantage of the faint impulse of life to give him a little brandy and then a little more again and by that time he could sigh bo he whispered very softly and trying to lift his hand for something and rufus hutton knew somehow perhaps by means of his own child that he was trying to say bob bob will be here directly cheer up cheer up till he comes my friend he called him his friend and the very next day he would have denounced him as murderer to the magistrates at lymington now his only thought was of saving the poor mans life the fathers dull eyes gleamed again when he heard those words and a little smile came flickering over the stern lines of his face they gave him more brandy on the strength of it while he kept on looking at the door rub rub rub men very lightly but very quickly keep your thumbs up dont you see mustnt get cold again for the world there now hell keep his heart up until his dear son arrives and then his children shall nurse him much better than any one else could and how glad they will be john thomas to see him looking so well and so strong again all this time rue hutton himself with a womans skill and tenderness was encouraging by gentle friction over the stagnant heart each feeble impulse yet to live each little bubble faintly rising from the well of hope every clinging of the soul to the things so hard to leave behind while there is life there is hope true and genial saying and we hope there is hope beyond it poor bull garnet was taken home even that very night for dr hutton saw how much he was longing for his children who until he was carried in knew nothing of his danger please god said rufus to himself as he crouched in the fly by the narrow mattress even foregoing his loved cheroot and keeping his hand on his patients pulse please god the poor fellow shall breathe his last with a child at either side of him meanwhile an urgent message from sir cradock nowell was awaiting the sick man at his cottage eoa herself had brought word to pearl of whom she longed to make a friend that her uncle was walking about the house perpetually walking calling aloud in every room for mr garnet and john rosedew he had heard of no disaster any more than she had for he seldom read the papers now but mr brockwood had been with him a very long time that morning and dr buller came in accidentally and eoa could almost vow that there was some infamous scheme on foot and she knew whose doing it was and oh that uncle john would come back but now they wanted mr garnet and he must hurry up to the hall the moment he came home mr garnet of course they could not have his strength was wrecked his heart benumbed his mind incapable of effort except to know his children if that could ever be one and in this paralytic state never sleeping never waking never wholly conscious he lay for weeks and time for him had neither night nor morning but mr rosedew could be brought to help his ancient friend if only it was in his power to overlook the injury he did not overlook it for that he was too great a man he utterly forgot it to his mind it was thenceforth a thing that had never happened tomorrow either with black cloud let the father fill the heaven or with sun fullblazing yet shall he not erase the past nor beat abroad and make undone what once the fleeting hour hath borne truly so our horace saith and yet that father gives sometimes to the noblest of his children power to revoke the evil or at least annul itgrandeur to undo the wrong done by others to them not with any sense of greatness neither hope of selfreward simply from the lovingkindness of the deep humanity in truth it was a noble thing such as not even the driest man sapped and carked with care and evil worn with undeserved rebuff and dwelling ever underground in the undermining of his faith could behold and not be glad with a joy unbidden could turn away from without wet eyes and a glimpse of the god who loves usand yet the simplest mildest scene that a child could describe to its mother so will i tell it if may be casting all long words away leaning on an old mans staff looking over the stile of the world it was the height of the summertime and the quiet mood of the setting sun touched with calm and happy sadness all he was forsaking men were going home from work wives were looking for them maidens by the gate or paling longed for some protection children must be put to bed and what a shame so early puce and purple pillows lay holding golden locks of sun piled and lifted by light breezes the painted eiderdown of sunset in the air a feeling wasthose who breathe it cannot tellonly this that it does them good god knows how and why and whencebut it makes them love their brethren the poor old man more tried and troubled than a lucky labourer wretched in his wealth worse hampered by his rank and placement sat upon a high oak chairfor now he feared to lean his head backand prayed for some one to help him oh for any one who loved him oh for any sight of god whom in his pride he had forgotten eoa was a darling his only comfort now but what could such a girl do who was she to meet the world and the son he had used so shamefully good god his only son and now he knew with some strange knowledge loose and wide and wandering that his son was innocent after all and lost to him for ever through his own vile cruelty and now they meant to prove him madwhat use to disguise ithim who once had the clearest head chairman of the quarter sessions here he broke down and lay back with his white hair poured against the carved black oak of the chair and his wasted hands flung downward only praying god to help him anyhow to help him then john rosedew came in softly half ashamed of himself half nervous lest he were presuming overdrawing the chords of youth the bond of the days when they went about with arm round the neck of each other in his heart was pity very deep and holy and yet of all that filled his eyes the very last to show itself over against the ancient friend the loved one of his boyhood he stopped and sadly gazed a moment and then drew back with a shock and sorrow as of death brought nearer at the sound sir cradock nowell lifted his weary eyes and sighed and then he looked intently and then he knew the honest face the smile the gentle forehead quietly he arose with colour flowing over his pallid cheeks and in his eyes strong welcome and ready with his lips to speak yet in his heart unable thereupon he held the chair and bowed with the deepest reverence such as king or queen receives not till a life has earned it even the hand which he was raising he let fall again drawn back by a bitter memory and a nervous shame but his friend of olden time would not have him so disgraced wanted no repentance with years of kindness in his eyes and the history of friendship he came without a bow and took the hand that now was shy of him cradock oh i am so glad john thank god for this john then they turned to other subjects with a sort of nervousnessthe one for fear of presuming on pardon the other for fear of offering it only both knew once for all that nothing more could come between them till the hour of death the rector accepted once again his wellbeloved home and cares for the vacancy had not been filled only mr pell had lived a short time at the rectory the joy of all the parish equalled if not transcended that of parson and of patron and over and above the ease of conscience and the sense of comfort it was a truly happy thing for poor sir cradock nowell when the loss of the taprobane could no longer be concealed from him that now he had the proven friend to fall back upon once more he had spent whole days in writing lettershumble loving imploring letters to the son in unknown latitudesdirecting them as fancy took him to the cape to port natal mozambique or even bombay in case of stress of weather point de galle colombo c c in all cases to be called for and invariably marked urgent then from this labour of love he awoke to a vague form of conviction that his letters ought to have been addressed to the bottom of the sea chapter xvii autumn in the forest now once again the autumn all things turning to their rest bird and beast and vegetable solemn and most noble season speaking to the soul of man as spring speaks to his body the harvest of the ample woods spreading every tint of ripeness waiting for the makers sickle when his breath is frost trees beyond trees in depth and height roundings and massive juttings some admitting flaws of light to enhance their mellowness some very bright of their own accord when the sun thought well of them others scarcely bronzed with age and meaning to abide the spring it was the same in epping forest richmond park and the woods round london only on a smaller scale and with less variety and so upon his northern road every coppice near or far even knockholt beeches which reminded him of the beechen hats every little winding wood of sussex or of surrey brought before cradock nowells eyes the prospect of his boyhood he had begged to be put ashore at newhaven from the american trader which had rescued him from pomona island and his lonely but healthful sojourn and then borne him to new york now with his little store of dollars earned from the noble yankee skipper by the service he had rendered him freely given and freely taken as behoves two gentlemen and with his great store of health recovered and recovered mind he must walk all the way to london forty miles or more so great a desire entered into him of his native land that stable versatility those free and everchanging skies which all her sons abuse and love cradock looked i do assure you as well and strong and stout and lusty as may consist with elegance at the age of twoandtwenty and his dress though smacking of broadway could not conceal as our best writers say his symmetrical proportions his pantaloons were of a fine bright tan colour with pockets fit for a thousand dollars and his boots full of eyelets like big lampreys and his coat was a thing to be proud of and a pleasing surprise for regentstreet his hat moreover was umbratile as of the pilgrim fathers with a measure of liquid capacity betwixt the cone and the turnedup rim superior to that of the ordinary cisterns of the london watercompanies nevertheless he had not acquired the delightful hydropultic art distinctive of the mighty nation which had been so kind to him and in spite of little external stuff only worthy of two glancesone to note and the other to smile at it the youth was improved in every point worth a mans observation three months in new york had done him an enormous deal of good not that the place is by any means heavenly perhaps there are few more hellish only that he fell in with men of extraordinary energy and of marvellous decision the very two hinges of life whereupon he being rather too philosophical had several screws loose and some rust in the joints as for wena she the beauty had cocked her tail with great arrogance at smelling english ground again to her straight came several dogs who had never travelled far except when they were tailpiped and one and all cried hail my dear have you seen any dogs to compare with us set of mongrel parleywoos cant bark or bite like a christian just look round the corner pretty while we kill that poodle to whom wenaleniter atterens caudamcordially i thank you so much now i have seen of the world that my faith is gone in tailwags if you wish to benefit by my society bring me a bit from the hock of bacon or a very young marrowbone then will i tell you something they could not comply with her requisitions because they had eaten all that themselves and so she trotted along the beach like the dog of polyphemus or the terrier of hercules who tinged his nose with murex tis a very easy thing to talk of walking fifty miles but quite another pair of shoes to do it especially with pack on back and feet that have lost habitual sense of macadams tender mercies moreover the day had been very warm for the beginning of octoberthe dying glance of summer in the year at her hitherto foregone and forgotten england the highest temperature of the year had been in the month of may in june and july and were the maxima and in august things were no better persistent rain perpetual chill and everpresent sense of icebergs and longing for logs of dry wood but towards the end of september some glorious weather set in and people left off fires at the time when they generally begin them therefore cradock nowell was hot footsore and slightly jaded as he came to the foot of sydenham hill on the second day of his journey the crystal palace which long had been his landmark through country crossroads shone with blue and airy light as the sun was sinking cradock admired more and more as the shadows sloped along it the fleeting gleams the pellucid depth the brightness of reflection framed by the softness of refraction he had always loved that building and now at the top of the hill he resolved weary as he was to enter and take his food there accordingly wena was left to sup and rest at the stables he paid the shilling that turns the wheel and went first to the refreshment court after doing his duty there he felt a great deal better then buttoned his coat like a briton and sauntered into the transept it had been a high and mighty day for the ancient order of mountaineers who had never seen a mountain were come to look for one at penge with sweethearts wives contingencies and continuations it boots not now to tell their games enough that they had been very happy and were gathering back in nave and transept for a last parade to cradock so long accustomed to sadness solitude and bad luck the scene instead of being ludicrous as a youth of fashion would have found it was interesting and impressive and even took a solemn aspect as the red rays of the sun retired and the mellow shades were deepening he leaned against the iron rail in front of the grand orchestra and seeing many pretty faces thought about his amy and wondered what she now was like and whether she were true to him from pomona island he could not write from new york he had never written not knowing the loss of the taprobane and fearing lest he should seem once more to be trying the depth of john rosedews purse but now he was come to england with letters from captain recklesome young to his london correspondents which ensured him a good situation and the power to earn his own bread and perhaps in a little while amys as he leaned and watched the crowd go by like a dream of faces the events of the bygone year passed also in dark parade before him sad mysterious undeservedat least so far as he knewhow had they told upon him had they left him in better or had they left him in bitter case with his god and his fellowman that question might be solved at once to any but himself by the glistening of his eyes the gentleness of his gaze around the smile with which he drew back his foot when a knickerbocked child trod on it he loved his fellowcreatures still and love is law and gospel while he thought these heavy things feeling weary of the road of his life half weary shrinking from the bustling world again to be encountered suddenly a grand vibration thrilled his heart and mind and soul from the great concave above him melody was spreading wide with shadowy resistless power like the wings of angels the noble organ was pealing forth rolling to every nook of the building sweeping over the heads of the people and into their hearts with one soft passport home sweet home the men who had come because tired of home the wives to give them a change of it the maidens perhaps to get homes of their own the children to cry to go home againall with one accord stood still all listened very quietly and said nothing at all about it only they were the better for it with many a kind old memory rising at least among the elder ones and many a large unselfish hope making the young people look with trust at one another and what did cradock nowell feel his home was not a sweet one bitter things had been done against him bitter things he himself had done none the less he turned away and wept beneath a musicstand as if his heart would never give remission to his eyes none could see him in the dark there only the god whose will it was and whose will it often is that tears should bring us home to him i will arise and go home to my father i will cry father i have sinned against heaven and against thee and so he had not heavily not wilfully not wittingly not a hundredth part so badly as that father had sinned against him yet it was wrong in him not to allow the old man to recover himself but forgetting a sons loveduty so to leave himhotly hastily with a proud defiance till now he had never felt or at least confessed to himself that wrong now as generous natures do he summed up sternly against himself leniently against others and then he asked with yearning and bitter selfreproach is the old man yet alive the woods were still as rich and sweet and the grass as soft as in may month the windings of the pleasant dells were looped with shining waters but she who used to love them so and brighten at their freshness to follow the steps of each wandering breeze and call to the sun as a flower doesnow she came through her favourite places and hardly cared to look at them only three short months ago she had returned to her woodland home and the folk that knew and loved her in the highest and brightest spirits of youth conscious beauty and hopefulness all her old friends were rejoicing in her and she in their joy delighted when her father thought it his sorrowful duty in this world of sorrow to tell her the bad news about her ever unlucky cradock at first she received it with scornas the high manner of her mind wasutter unbelief because god could not have done it being simple and very young she had half as much faith in her heavenly father as she had in the earthly and fallible parent neither was she quite aware that we do not buy but accept from god but as week upon back of week and month after tardy month went by amys faith began to wane and herself to languish she watched the arrival of every mail from the cape from india from anywhere her heart leaped up as each steamer came in and sank at each empty letterbag meanwhile her father was growing very unhappy about her and so was good aunt doxy at first john had said when she took it so calmly thank god how glad i am but her mother cared for me more than that like many another loving father he had studied but never learned his child now it was the fifth day of october the weather bright and beautiful the english earth and trees and herbage trying back for the summer of which they had been so cheated poor pale amy asked leave to go out she had long been under rue huttons care not professionally but paternally for rufus would have his own way when he was truly fond of any one and she asked so quietly so submissively without a bit of joke about it that when she was gone her father set to and shook his head till a heavy tear came and blotted out a reference which had taken all the morning as for aunt doxy she turned aside and took off her spectacles quickly because the optician had told her to keep them perfectly dry where the footpath wanders to and fro preferring pleasure to duty and meeting all remonstrance by quoting the course of the brook amy rosedew slowly walked or heavily stopped every now and then caring for nothing around her she had made up her mind to cry no more only to long for the time and place when and where no crying is perhaps in a year or so if she lived she might be able to see things again and attend to her work as usual till then she would try to please her father and keep up her spirits for his sake every one had been so kind to her especially dear eoa who had really cried quite steadily and the least thing that girl amy could do was to try and deserve it thinking thus and doing her best to feel as well as think it yet growing tired already she sat down in a chair as soft as weary mortal may rest in a noble beech with a head of glory overlooking the forest had not neglected to slipper his feet with the richest of natures velvet from the dovecoloured columns base two yards above the groundspread drifts of darker bulk began gnarled crooks of grapple clutching wide at mother earth deeply fanged into her breast sureties against every wind ridged and ramped with many a hummock rift and twisted sinew forth these mighty tendons stretched some fathoms from the bole itself betwixt them nestled all in moss corniced with the golden and cushioned with the greenest nooks of cool delicious rest wherein to forget the world and dream upon the breezes as you like it in your lap theocritus tossed over the elbow because he is too foreignwhat sweet depth of enjoyment for a hardworking man who has earned it but in spite of all this voluptuousness the moss more soft than slumber and the rippling leafy murmur there is little doubt that miss amy rosedew managed to have another cry ere ever she fell asleep to cry among those arms of moss fleecing tufting pillowing an absorbent even for niobe can the wornout human nature find no comfort in the vegetable though it does in the mineral kingdom back and back and further back into the old relapse of sleep the falling thither whence we came the interest on the debt of death yet as the old stagyrite hints some of days emotions filter through the strain of sleep it is not true that good and bad are for half of life the same alike their wits go roving haply after the true owner but some may find him others failfather who shall limit thus thine infinite amnesty it would not be an easy thing to find a fairer sight her white arms on the twisted plumage of the deep green moss the snowy arch of her neck revealed as the clustering hair fell from it and the frank and playful forehead resting on the soft grey bark she smiled in her sleep every now and then for her pleasant young humour must have its own way when the schoolmaster sorrow was dozing and then the sad dreaming of trouble returned and the hands were put up to pray and the red lips opened whispering come home only come to amy and then in her dream he was comeraining tears upon her cheek holding her from all the world fearing to thank god yet she was smiling up at him oh it was so delicious suddenly she opened her eyes what made her face so wet why wena wena as sure as dogs are dogs mounted on the mossy arm licklicklicking mewing like a cat almost even offering taste of her tongue while every bit of the wena dog shook with ecstatic rapture oh wena wena what are you come to tell me wena oh that you could speak wena immediately proved that she could she galloped round amy barking and yelling until the great wood echoed again the rabbits a mile away pricked their ears and the yaffingales stopped from tapping then off set the little dog down the footpath oh could it be to fetch somebody the mere idea of such a thing made amy shake so and feel so odd she was forced to put one hand against the tree and the other upon her heart she could not look she was in such a state she could not look down the footpath it seemed at least a century and it may have been half a minute before she heard through the bushes a voicetush she means the voice wena you bad dog come in to heel is this all you have learned by travelling but wena broke fence and everything set off full gallop again to amy tugged at her dress and retrieved her what happened after that amy knows not neither knows cradock nowell so anything i could tell would be a fond thing vainly invented all they remember islooking back upon it as both of them may to the zenith of their livesthat neither of them could say a word except darling darling darling all pronounced as superlatives with my own once or twice between and an exclusive sense of ownership illiberal and unphilosophical what business have we with such minor details who has sworn us accountants of kisses all we have any right to say is that after a long spell of inarticulate tautology amy looked up when cradock proposed to add another cipher very gravely indeed she looked up except in the deepest depth of her eyes oh no cradock you must not think of it seriously now you must not love why i should like to know indeed after all the time i have been away i have so little presence of mind i forgot to tell you in time dear why because wena has licked my face all over darling darling yes she has i say you are too bad not to care about it now come to my own best father dear offer your arm like a gentleman so theyas milton concisely says homer would have written they two how sadly our language wants a dual we the domestic race have we rejected it because the use would have seemed a truism that same afternoon bull garnet lay dying calmly and peacefully going off taking his accounts to a larger world he knew that there were some heavy items underscored against him but he also knew that the mercy of god can even outdo the hope he gives us for token and for keepsake a greater and a grander end after a life of mark and power might to his early aspirations and selfconscious strength have seemed the bourne intended if it had befallen himas but for himself it would have doneto appear where men are moved by passion vigour and bold decision his name would have been historical and better known to the devil as it was he lay there dying and was well content the turbulence of life was past the torrent and the eddy the attempt at forereaching upon his age and sense of impossibility the strain of his mental muscles to stir the great dead trunks of orthodoxy and then the selfdoubt the chill the depression which follow such attempts as surely as ague tracks the pioneer thank god all this was over now and the violence gone and the dark despair of all the good and evil things which so had branded him distinct two yet dwelled in his feeble heart only two still showed their presence in his dying eyes each of those two was good if two indeed they werefaith in the heavenly father and love of the earthly children pearl was sitting on a white chair at the side of the bed away from the window with one hand in his failing palm and the other trying now and then to enable her eyes to see things she was thinking poor little thing of what she should do without him and how he had been a good father to her though she never could understand him that was her own fault no doubt she had always fancied that he loved her as a bit of his property as a thing to be managed now she knew that it was not so and he was going away for ever and who would love or manage her and the fault of all this was her own rufus hutton had been there lately trying still to keep up some little show of comfort and a large one of encouragement for he was not the man to say die till a patient came to the preterite throughout the whole and knowing all he had behaved in the noblest manner partly from his own quick kindness partly from that protective and fiduciary feeling which springs selfsown in the hearts of women when showers of sorrow descend and crops up in the manly bosom at the fee of golden sunshine not that he took any fees but that his professional habits revived with a generosity added because he knew that he would take nothing though all were in his power suddenly mr pell came in our old friend octavius sent for in an urgent manner and looking as a man looks who feels but cannot open on the hinge of his existence like a thorough gentleman he had been shy of the cottage although aware of their distress eager at once and reluctant partly because it stood not in his but his rectors parish partly for deeper reasons though pell came in so quietly bull garnet rose at his entry or tried to rise on the pillow swept his daughter back by a little motion of his thumb which she quite understood and cast his eyes on the parsons with a languid yet strong intelligence he had made up his mind that the man was good and yet he could not help probing him the last characteristic act of poor bull garnets life a life which had been all character all difference from other people will you take my daughters hand pell only too gladly answered pell but she shrank away and sobbed at him pearl come forward this moment it is no time for shillyshallying the poor thing timidly gave her hand standing a long way back from pell and with her large eyes streaming yet fixed upon her father and no chance at all of wiping them now pell do you love my daughter i am dying and i ask you that i do with all my heart said pell like a downright englishman i shall never love any other now pearl do you love mr pell her fathers eyes were upon her in a way that commanded truth she remembered how she had told a lie at the age of seven or eight and that gaze had forced it out of her and she had never dared to tell one since until no lie dared come near her father i like him very much very soon i should love him ifif he loved me now pell you hear that beyond all doubt i do said octave whose dryness never deserted him in the heaviest rain of tears and it is the very best thing for me i have heard in all my life bull garnet looked from one to the other with the rally of his life come hot and a depth of joyful sadness yet must he go a little further because he had always been a tyrant till people understood him do you want to know how much money sir i intend to leave her when i die tonight or tomorrow morning cutanddry pell was taken aback a thoroughly upright and noble fellow but of wholly different and less rugged road of thought meanwhile pearl had slipped away it was more than she could bear and she was so sorry for octavius then pell up and spake bravely sir i would be loth to think of you my dear ones father as anything but a gentleman a strange one perhaps but a true one and so i trust you have only put such a question to me in irony pell there is good stuff in you i know a man by this time what would you think of finding your dear ones father a murderer octavius pell was not altogether used to this sort of thing he turned away with some doubt whether pearl would be a desirable mother of children for he after all was a practical man and hereditary insanity then he turned back remembering that all mankind are mad meanwhile bull garnet watched him with extraordinary wrinkles and a savage sort of pleasure he felt himself outside the world and looking at the stitches of it but he would not say a word he had always been a bully and he meant to keep it up sir said octave pell at last you are the very oddest man i ever saw in all my life ah you think so do you pell possibly you are right possibly you are right pell i have no time to think about it it never struck me in that light if i am so very odd perhaps you would rather not have my daughter if you intend to refuse her to me you had better say so at once sir i dont understand all this i wish you to understand nothing at all beyond the simple fact i shot clayton nowell and did it on purpose because i found him insulting her good god you dont mean to say it i never yet said a thing pell which i did not mean to say you did it in haste you have repented for gods sake tell me that treat this as a question of business look at the deed and nothing else do you still wish to marry my daughter pell turned away from the great wild eyes now solemnly fixed upon him his manly heart was full of wonder anguish and giddy turbulence the promptest of us cannot always come to time like a prizefighter pearl came in with her chest well forward and then drew back very suddenly she thought her fate must be settled now and would like to know how they had settled it then like a genuine english lady she gave a short sigh and went away pride makes the difference between us and all other nations but the dignified glance she had cast on pell settled his fate and hers for life he saw her noble selfrespect her stately reservation her deep sense of her own pure value which never would assert itself and her passing contempt of his hesitation at all risks i will have her he said to himself for his manly strength gloried in her strong womanhood if she can be won i will have her oh how i am degrading her what a foolbound fellow i am then he spoke to her father who had fallen back and was faintly gazing wondering what the stoppage was sir i am not worthy of her god knows how i love her she is too good for me bull garnet gathered his fleeting life and looked at pell with a love so deep that it banished admiration then his failing heart supplied for the last last time of all the woeworn fountain of his eyes strong and violent as he was a little thing had often touched him to the turn of tears what impulse is there but has this end even comic laughter pell lifted from the counterpane the broad but shrunken hand which was on the way to be offered to him until sad memory stopped it then he looked down at the poor grey face where the forehead from the fall of the rest appeared almost a monstrosity and the waning of strong emotions left a quivering of hollowness the young parson looked down with noble pity much he knew of his fatherinlaw bull garnet would never be pitied he drew his hand back with a little jerk and placed it against his broad square chin i cant bear to die like this pell i wish to god you could shave me pell went suddenly down on his knees put his strong brown hands up and said nothing except the lords prayer bull garnet tried to raise his palms but the power of his wrists was gone and so he let them fall together then at every grand petition he nodded at the ceiling as if he saw it going upward and thought of the lath and plaster he had said he should die at four oclock for the paroxysms of heartcomplaint returned at measured intervals and he felt that he could not outlast another so with his usual mastery and economy of labour he had sent a man to get the keys and begin to toll the great church bell as soon as ever the clock struck four not too long apart he said steadily and be done with it when the boom of the sluggish bell came in at the open window bull garnet smiled because the man was doing it as he had ordered him right he whispered yes quite right i have always been before my time just let me see my children and then he had no more pain amy came in very softly to know if he was dead they had told her she ought to leave it alone but she could not see it so knowing all and feeling all she felt beyond her knowledge if it wouldoh if it would help him with a spark of hope in his parting help him in the judgmentday to have the glad forgiveness of the brother with the deeper wrongthere it was and he was welcome a little whispering went on pale lips into trembling ears and then cradock with his shoes off was brought to the side of the bed he wont know you pearl sobbed softly but how kind of you to come she was surprised at nothing now her father raised his languid eyes until they met cradocks eager ones there they dwelt with doubt and wonder and a slow rejoicing and a last attempt at expression john rosedew took the wan stiffening hand lying on the sheet like a castoff glove and placed it in cradocks sunburnt palm he knows all the parson whispered he has read the letter you left for him and knowing all he forgives you that i do with all my heart cradock answered firmly may god forgive me as i do you wholly purely for once and for all kindnoblegodlike the dying man said very slowly but with his old decision bull garnet could not speak again the great expansion of heart had been too much for its weakness only now and then he looked at cradock with his amy and every look was a prayer for them and perhaps a recorded blessing then they slipped away in tears and left him as he ought to be with his children only and the telegraph of death was that god would never part them now think you not this man was dying a great deal better than he deserved no doubt he was and for that matter so perhaps do most of us but does our father think so chapter xviii softly and quietly fell the mould on the coffin of bull garnet a great tree overhung his sleep without fear of the woodman clayton nowells simple grave turfed and very tidy was only a few yards away that ancient tree spread forth its arms on this one and the other as a grandsire lays his hands peacefully and placidly on children who have quarrelled a lovely spot as one might see for violence to rest in for long remorse to lose the track and deep repentance hopefully abide the time of god to feel the soft mantle of winter return and the promising gladness of spring the massive depths of the summertide and the bright disarray of autumn and to be no more the while oppressed or grieved or overworked there shall forestchildren come joining hands in pleasant fear and sitting upon grassy mounds wonder who inhabits them wonder who and what it is that cannot wonder any more and haply they shall tell this talebecome a legend thenwhen he who writes and ye who read are dust ay and tell it better far more simply and more sweetly never having gone astray from the inborn sympathy for every grownup man is apt to mar the uses of his pen with bitter words and small and twaddling conceiting himself to be keen in the first just in the second and sage in the third for all of these let him crave forgiveness of god his fellowcreatures and himself respectively sir cradock nowell still alive to the normal sense of duty tottered away on john rosedews arm from the grave of his halfbrother he had never learned whose hand it was that dug the grave near by and no one ever forced that unhappy knowledge on him this last blow which seemed to strike his chiefest prop from under him had left its weal on his failing mind in great marks of astonishment that such a strong great man should drop and he the elder and the weaker be left to do without him he was going to the rectory now to have a glass of wine after fatigue of the funeral a vintage very choice and rare according to mr rosedew and newly imported from oxford and truly that was its origin it might have claimed founders kin fellowship like most of the oxford wineskins wonderful wonderful man said poor sir cradock doing his best to keep his back very upright from a sudden suffusion of memoryto think that he should go first john oh if i had a son left he should take that man for his model scarcely that john rosedew thought knowing all the circumstances but of the dead i will say no harm so quick so ready so up for anything ah i remember he knocked a man down just at the corner by this gate here where the dandelionseed is and afterwards he proved how richly he deserved it that is the way to do things john i am not quite sure of that said the conscientious parson it might be wiser to prove that first and then to abstain from doing it i remember an instance in point of course you do you always do john and i wish you wouldnt but that has nothing to do with it you are always cutting me short john and worse than ever since you came back and they talked of you so at oxford i hope they have not changed you john he looked at the whitehaired rector with an old mans jealousy who else had any right to him my dear old friend replied john rosedew with kind sorrow in his eyes i never meant to cut you short i will try not to do it again but i know i am rude sometimes and i am always sorry afterwards nonsense john dont talk of it i understand you by this time and we allow for one another but now about my son my poor unlucky boy to be sure yes said the other old man not wishing to hurry matters and so they stopped and probed the hedge instead of one another i dont know how it is at last sir cradock nowell said being rather aggrieved with john rosedew for not breaking ground upon himbut how hard those stubs of ash are look at that splinter almost severed by a man who does not know how to splash jem his name is poor garnet told me jemsomething or otherand yet all i can do with my stick wont fetch it away from the stock like a child who will not quit his father however his father has treated him what do you mean by that john are you driving at me again i thought you had given it over i never give over anything john answered in a manner for him quite melodramatic and beyond his usual key no we always knew how stubborn you were and now you are worse than ever no fool like an old fool john rosedew answered smiling sweetly yet with some regret cradock i am such a fool i shall let out everything what do you mean asked sir cradock nowell leaning heavily on his staff and setting his white face rigidly yet with every line of it ready to melt john i have heard strange rumours or i have dreamed strange dreams in the name of god what is it john my sonmy only son he could say no more but turned away and bowed his head and trembled your only son your innocent son has been at my house these three days and when you like you can see him when i likeah to be sure i dont like many people i am getting very old john and no one to come after me it seems a pity dont you think and every one against me so you can take your own part still my friend and you have to take your sons part yes to be sure my sons part perhaps he will come back some day and i know he did not do it now and i was very hard to himdont you think i was johnvery hard to my poor craddy and he was so like his mother but you will be very kind to him now and he will be such a comfort to you now he is come back again and going away no more i declare you make me shake john you do talk such nonsense one would think you knew all about himmore than his own father does what have i done to be kept like this in the dark all in the dark and you seem to think that i was hard to him cradock all you have to do is just to say the word just to say that you wish to see him and your son will come and talk to you talk to me oh yes i should like to talk to himvery muchi mean of course if he is at leisure he leaned on his stick and tried to think while john rosedew hurried off and of all his thoughts the foremost were what will cradock my boy be like and what shall i give him for dinner cradock came up shyly gently looking at his father first then waiting to be looked at the old man fixed his eyes upon him at first with some astonishmentfor his taste in dress was somewhat outraged by the broadway stylethen in spite of all the change remembrance of his son returned and love and sense of ownership last of all auctorial pride in the young mans width of shoulder blended with soft recollections of the time he dandled him why cradock it is my poor son cradock what a size you are grown my boy my boy oh father i am sure you want me only try me once again i am not at all a radical crad you never could be i knew you must come round at last to my way of thinking when you had seen the world crad when you had seen the world a bit as your father did before you and so they made the matter up in politics and dress and little touches of religion and in the depth of kindred love which underlies the latter and never after was there word except of migrant petulance between the crotchety old man and the son who held his hearts key all this while we have been loth to turn to mrs corklemore and contemplate her discomfiture although in strict sequence of events we ought to have done so long ago but it is so very painfuland nowadays all writers agree with epicurus in regarding pain as the worst of evilsso bitter is the task to describe a lovely mother failing in spite of all exertion to do her duty by her child in robbing other people that reallyah welladay physic must be taken at the time of her dismissal from the halls of nowelhurst mr corklemore had been so glad to see his pretty wife again and that queer little flore who amused him so by pinching his stiff leg and crying haw and he had found the house so desolate and the absence of plague so unwholesome and the responsibility of having a will of his own so horrible that he scarcely cared to ask the reason why they were come home and georgiewho was not thoroughly heartless else how could she have got on sothought coo nest very snug and nice with none to contradict her so she found relief awhile in banishing her worse while she indulged her better half let me do the same by suppressing here that evil tendency to moralise in georgies case as well as mine the indulgence possessed at any rate the attractions of change and variety but knowing how strictly we are bound by the canons of philosophy to suspect and put the curb on every natural bias that good young woman soon refrained from overactive encouragement of her inclination to goodness rallying her sense of right she vanquished very nobly all the seductions of honesty and by a virtuous effort marched from the capua of virtue she stood upon the woodcrowned heights which look upon coo nest and as the smoke came curling up the house seemed very small to her what a thing to call a garden and the pigeonhouse at nowelhurst was nearly as large as our stable and oh that little vinery where one knew every single bunch and came every day to watch its ripening and the little fuss of its colouring like an ogre watching a pet babe roasting surely nature never meant her to live upon so small a scale or why had she been gifted with such large activities she turned her back upon coo nest and her face to nowelhurst hall and in her minds eye saw a place ever so much larger then a pleasant sound came up the hollow a nice ring of revolving wheels coquetting with the best c springs and all the new improvements wellmettled horses too were there stepping together sonipedally and a footman could be seen whose legs must stand him in l a year that odious old sir julius wallop and his wizenfaced wife come to patronize us again and say ha corklemore snug little place charming situation but i think i should pull it down and rebuild no room for chang to stand in it and how is my old friend sir cradock your fortyfifth cousin i believe ah he has a nice place i havent the heart to meet them now and their patronizing disparagement heigho it is a nice turnout and yet they have at nowelhurst three more handsome carriages and it does look so much better to have two footmen there behind and i do like watered linings so how nice flo did look by my side in that new barouche oh my darling child i must not give way to selfish feelings i must do my duty towards you therefore she proceeded against her better nature in the face of prudence with her attempt to set aside poor sir cradock nowell and obtain fiduciary possession of his property cradock was lost in the taprobaneof that there could be no doubt and so she was saved all further trouble of laying before the civil authorities the stronger evidence they required before issuing a warrant but all was going very nicely towards the commencement of an inquiry as to the old mans state of mind then suddenly she was checkmated and never moved a pawn again one afternoon mrs corklemore was sitting in her drawingroom expecting certain visitors and quite ready to be bored with them because they were leading gossipsladies who gave the first complexion to any nascent narrative and georgie knew how to handle them in the county talk which must ensue only let them take her side and all the world would feel for her in her very painful position after a rumble of rapid wheels and a violent pull at the bell which made the lady of the house to jump because they had just had the bellhanger into her sanctuary came with a cooler than curcumine temperature not indeed lady alberta smith and her daughter victorina beatrice but eoa nowell and her cousin cradock for once in her life mrs corklemore was deprived of all presence of mind ghostly horror being added to bodily fear of eoa she fain would have fled but her limbs gave way and she fell back into a soft french chair and covered her face with both hands then eoa looking tall and delicate in her simple mourning dress walked up to her very quietly leading cradock as if she were proud of him i have taken the liberty mrs corklemore of bringing my cousin cradock to see you because it may save trouble i trust you will forgive said cradock our very sudden invasion we are come upon a matter of business to save unpleasant exposures and disgrace to our distant relatives oh gasped poor mrs corklemore you are alive then after all it was proved that you had lost your life upon the coast of africa yes but it has proved otherwise cradock answered bowing neatly and it would have been so much better under the sad sad circumstances for all people of good feeling and all interested in the family for the latter perhaps it would madam but not so clearly for the former i am here to protect my father from all machinations leave her to me cried eoa slipping prettily in front of him i understand her best becausebecause of my former vocation and i think she knows what i am that i do answered georgie cleverly interposing first a small enamelled table not only an insolent but an utterly reckless creature you may think so eoa replied with calm superiority but that only shows your piteous ignorance of the effects of discipline i am now so sedate and tranquil a woman that i do not hate but scorn you cradock could not help smiling at this knowing what eoa was we want no strong expressions my dear on one side or the other for he saw that a word would have overthrown eoas newborn discipline mrs corklemore is far too clever not to perceive her mistake she knows quite well that any inquiry as to my dear fathers state of mind can now be of no use to her and if she thinks of any further proceedings against myself perhaps she had better first look at just thisjust this document he laid before her a certificate granted by three magistrates that indisputable evidence had been brought before them as to the cause and manner of clayton nowells death and that cradock nowell had no share in it wittingly or unwittingly that was the upshot of it but of course it extended to about fiftyfold the length mrs corklemore bent over her in her most bewitching manner and perused it very leisurely as if she were examining flores attempts at pothooks meanwhile with a sideglint of her eyes she was watching both of them and it did not escape her notice that eoa was very pale to be sure she said at last looking full at the eastern maid i see exactly how it was i have thought so all along a female thug must be charmed of course by the only son of a murderer my dear i do so congratulate you thank you answered eoa and the deep gaze of her lustrous eyes made the clever woman feel a world unopened to her i thank you georgie corklemore because you know no better my only wish for you is that you may never know unhappiness because you could not bear it saying so she turned away and with her light quick step was gone before her enemy could see a symptom of the welling tears which then burst all control but cradock who had dwelt in sorrow compared to which hers was a joke stayed to say a few soft words and made a friend for evermore of the woman who had plotted so against his life and all his love madame la comtesse since that time has seen much tribulation and is all the better for it mr corklemore died of the gout and the angel flore of the measles and she herself having nursed them both and lost some selfishness in their graves is now as her destiny seemed to be the wife of mr chope of course she is compelled to merge her strong will in a stronger one and according to natures salique law is the happier for doing so whether this union will produce a subject for biography to some unborn lord campbell time alone can show from the above it will be clear that poor eoa nowell was now acquainted with the secret of the garnet family bob himself had told her all about a month after his fathers death renouncing at the same time all his claims upon her of that eoa would not hear only at his urgency she promised to consult her friends and take a week to think of it and this was the way she kept her promise first she ran up to cradock nowell with the bright tears still upon her cheeks and asked him whether he had truly and purely forgiven his injurer he took her hand and answered her with his eyes in which the deepened springs of long affliction glistened fixed steadily upon hers as truly and purely as i hope to be forgiven at the judgmentday then that settles that matter now order the dogcart crady dear and drive me to dr huttons of course he obeyed her immediately and in an hour they entered the gate of geopharmacy lodge rosa was amazed at her beauty and thought very little after that of mrs corklemores appearance for my part said rufus hutton when eoa had laid the case before him in a privy council although it is very good of you and very flattering to me that you look upon me still as your guardian i think you are bound first of all to consult sir cradock nowell how very odd now that is exactly what i do not mean to do he never can understand poor dear and i hope he never will the truth about poor claytons death his present conviction is like that of all the neighbourhood that black will the poacher did it the man who has since been killed in a fight with sir julius wallops gamekeepers and it would shock poor uncle so i am sure he would never get over it if the truth were forced upon him and if it were i am sure he would never allow me to have my way which of course i should do in spite of him and i am not his heiress now since cradock came to life again but i have plenty of money of my own and i have quite settled what to give him the day that i am married and you too my dear guardy if you behave well about this look here she drew forth a purse quite full of gold and tossed it in her old indian style so that rufus could not help laughing well my dear he answered kindly who could resist such bribery besides i see that your mind is made up and we all know what the result of that is and after all the chief question is what effect will your knowledge of this have on your love for your husband it will only make me love him more ever so much more because of his misfortune and will you never allude to it never let him see that you think of it so as to spoil his happiness is it likely i should think of it why my father must have killed fifty men he was desperate in a battle and bob has never brought that up against me well if you take it in that lightdecidedly not an english light and perhaps you never heard that bobs father by his quickness and boldness saved the lives of fifteen men in a colliery explosion before he ever came to nowelhurst and therefore he had a perfect right toto take the lives of fifteen others fourteen to his credit still well eoa you can argue if any female in the world can only in one thing my dear child be advised by me if you must marry robert garnet leave this country for a while and take his sister pearl with you of course i must marry bob said eoa and of course i should go away with him but as to taking pearl with us why thats a thing to be thought about however they got over that as well as all other difficulties sir cradock nowell was at the wedding mr rosedew performed the ceremony and rufus hutton gave away as lovely a bride as ever was seen bob garnet spied a purple emperor who had lost his way knocking his head in true imperial fashion against the chancelwindow and he glanced at eoa about it between the two i wills and she lifted her beautiful eyebrows and he saw that she meant to catch him so after signing the register they contrived to haul him down without letting john rosedew know it then at the chancelporch they let him go free of the forest with his glorious wings unsoiled not even an insect should have cause to repent their weddingday and now they live in as fair a place as any the world can show not far from pezo da ragoa in the alto douro district there eoas children toddle by the brilliant rivers brink and form their limbs to strength and beauty up the vineclad mountains side bob has invested his share of proceeds in a vineyard of young bastardo and muscat de jesu moreover he holds a good appointment under the royal oporto company agricultural of the vine many a time eoa sits watching with her deep bright eyes the purple flow of the luscious juice from the white marble lagar wherein the hardy peasants with their drawers tied at the knee tramp to the time of the violin to and fro without turning round among the pulpy flood then bob who has discovered a perfect cure for oidium and knows how to deal with every grub that bores into or nips the vine to his wife and bairns he comes in haste having been too long away bringing a bunch of the ladies fingers or the barrete de clerigo or it may be some magnificent insect new to his entomology or still more interesting prize a letter from pearl or amy wherein mrs pell or nowell gossips of the increasing cares which increase her happiness yet even among those lovely scenes and under that delicious sky frequent and fond are the glances cast by hope as well as memory at the bowered calm of the forest brooks and the brown glamour of the beechwood and when they return to dwell in the forest and to end their days there even bob will scarcely know the favourite haunts of his boyhoodto such an extent has cradock nowell planted and improved clothing barren slopes with verdure adding to the wealth of woods many a new tint and tone by the aid of foreign trees unknown to his father in doing so his real object is not so much to improve the estate or gratify his own good taste or even that of amy but to find labour for the hands and food for the mouths of industrious people sir cradock grumbles just a little every now and then because like all of us englishmen he must have his grievance but on the whole he is very proud of what his son is doing and thoroughly enjoys his power of urging or repressing it and if on theoretic matters any question chances to arise between them when one says no to the others yesas all true britons are bound to do upon politics port wine and parsonsthen a gentle spirit comes and turns it all to laughter with the soft and pleasant wit of a wellbred womans ignorance for amy still must have her say and still asserts her privilege to flavour every dull discussion with lively words and livelier glances and a smile for both the disputants then cradock looks at his dear young wife with notes of admiration and bids her keep such piquant wisdom for the councils of the nursery upon which pleasant reminder the old man chuckles as if some very good thing had been said then craftily walks with a spotted toy capable of barking and exactly representing caldo or wena whichever you please to the foot of certain black oakstairs where he fully expects to hear the prattle of small clayton to wit it has been long resolved and managed with prospective wisdom down the path of years that the county annals shall not be baulked of a grand sir clayton nowell and a very grand fellow indeed he is this twoyearold clayton nowellgrand in the stolid sageness of his broad and steadfast gaze grand in the manner of his legs and his holbein attitude grander still in stamping when his meat and ale are late but grandest of all immeasurably grand in the eyes of his grandfather hogstaff whose memory is quite gone and his hearing too of every sound except the voice of this boy identifies him beyond all cavil with the clayton of our story many a time the bowed retainer chides his little master for not remembering the things he taught him only yesterday then cradock smiles at his sons oblivion of the arts his uncle learned but never reminds old hoggy that the yesterday was rather more than fiveandtwenty years ago is it true or is it false according to the rules of art that the windingup of a long long story handled with more care than skill should have some resemblance to the will of a kindlynatured man in whose final dispositions no dependent however humble none who have helped him in the many pages of his life far less any intimate friend seeks in vain a grateful mention or a token of regard be that as it may any writer who loves his work although a fool for doing so feels the end and finish of it like the signature of his will and doubly saddened must he be if the scenes which charmed him most and cast upon him such a spell that he could not call spectators inif these for want of skill have wearied eyes and hearts he might have pleased for surely none would turn away whose nature is uncancelled if once he could be gently led into that world of beauty to rest in the majesty of shade forgetting weary headache to let the little carking cares avarice and jealousy selfconceit and thirst of fame fly away on the wild wood like the piping of a bird to hear the rustle of young leaves when their edges come together and dreamily to wonder at the size of things above us shall ever any man enclasp the good that grows above him or even offer to receive the spread of heavens greatness yet every man may lift himself above the highest treetops even to the throne of god by loving and forgiving and verily some friends of ours who could not once forego a grudge are being taught by tare and trett how much they owe their maker and how little to themselves first of these is rufus hutton quite a jolly mortal getting fat and riding polly for the sake of his liver and renes and all he has to say is this first that he will match trees and babies with those of any nurseryman next that as i have a knack of puffing good people and good things he begs for reciprocity on the part of superior readers and if this should chance to meet the eye of any one who knows where to find a really firstrate manilla conducted on freetrade principles such knowing person by addressing confidentially under seal r h postoffice ringwood may hear of something very greatly to his own advantage now do we without appeal to the blue smoke of enthusiasm know of anything to the advantage of anybody whatever yes i think we do we may highly commend the recent career of the ducksacre firm and mr clinkers and issachar jupp the bargee robert clinkers and polly his wife are driving a firstrate business in coal and coke and riddlings not highly aristocratic perhaps but free from all bad debts you may see the name on a great brassplate near the broadway hammersmith on the left hand where the busses stop but mr jupp flies at higher game he has turned his length of wind that once secured the palm of victory in physical encounters to a higher and nobler use in a word mr jupp is a primitive christian upon and beside the waters of avon there you may hear him preaching and singing through his nose alternatelyah me that is not what i meanfor either proceeding is nasalevery sunday and wednesday evening when the leaks in the punt allow him he gets fiveandthirty shillings aweek as sir cradocks waterbailiff and he has not stolen twig or catkin of all the trees he convoys down avon in seven or eight more summers little loo jupp will probably be the prettiest girl in the forest may we be there to see her the best and kindest man of all who have said their say in my story and not thrust their merits forward john rosedew still leads his quiet life nearer and nearer to wisdoms threshold nearer and nearer to the door of god his temper is as soft and sweet his memory as bright and ready and his humour as playful as when he was only thirty years old and walked every day to kidlington as for his shyness that we must never ask him to discard because he likes to know us first and then he likes to love us but of all the people in the world next to his own child amy most he loves and most he honours his soninlaw cradock nowell cradock nowell so enlarged and purified by affliction so able now to understand and feel for every poor man he when placed in large possessions and broad english influence never will forget the time of darkness grief and penury never will look upon his brethren as under another god than his it is true that we must have hill and valley towering oak and ragged robin zenith cloud overlooking the sun and mist crouching down in the hollows and true as well that we cannot see all the causes and needs of the difference but is it not still more true and sure that the whole is of one universal kingdom bound together by one great love the high and low the rich and poor the powerful and the helpless and in the spreading of that realm beyond the shores of time and space when at last it is understood what the true aim of this life has been not greatness honour wealth or science no nor even wisdomas we unwisely take itbut happiness here and hereafter a flowing tide whose fountain is our love of one another then shall we truly learn by feeling whereby alone we can learn that all the cleaving of our sorrow and cuts into the heart of us were nothing worse than preparation for the grafts of god the end london printed by c whiting beaufort house strand transcribers notes obvious print and punctuation errors were
