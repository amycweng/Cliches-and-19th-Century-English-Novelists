the remarkable history of sir thomas upmore bart mp formerly known as tommy upmore non usitata non tenui ferar penna a new edition london sampson low marston searle rivington crown buildings fleet street all rights reserved london printed by william clowes and sons limited stamford street and charing cross preface when sir thomas upmore came and asked me to write a short account of his strange adventures i declined that honour partly because i had never seen any of his memorable exploits perhaps that matters little while his history so flourishes by reason of being more creditable as well as far more credible than that of england for the last few years still in such a case the man who did the thing is the one to tell it and his veracity has now become a proverb my refusal seemed to pain sir thomas because he is so bashful and no one can see him pained without grieving for his own sake also and trying to feel himself in the wrong this compelled me to find other arguments which i did as follows first my dear sir in political matters my humble view's are not strong and trenchant as yours are become by experience but exceedingly large and lenient because i have never had anything at all to do with politics again of science the popular name for almost any speculation bold enough i am in ignorance equally blissful if it were not thrilled with fear what power shall resist the wild valour of the man who proves that his mind is a tadpole's spawn and then claims for that mind supreme dominion and inborn omniscience before his acephalous rush down go piled wisdom of ages and pinnacled faith cloud capped heights of immortal hope and even the mansions everlasting kept for those who live for them all those he may upset replied sir thomas with that sweet and buoyant smile which has saved even his supernatural powers from the sneers of those below him or at least he may fancy that he has done it but to come to facts can he upset or even make head or tail of such a little affair as i am not one of his countless theories about me has a grain of truth in it though he sees me and feels me and pokes me in the side and listens as if i were a watch run down to know whether i am going i assure you that to those who are not frightened by his audacity and fame his 'links of irrefragable proof' are but a baby's dandelion chain in chemistry alone and engineering has science made much true advance the main of the residue is arrogance in that branch of science we are all professors i answered to disarm his wrath knowing that in these riper years honest indignation wrought upon his system as youthful exultation once had done and i could not afford to have a hole made in my ceiling however sir thomas i shall stick to my resolve though your life when its largeness is seen aright will be an honour to the history of our race justice comes before honour and only you can do justice to it humility which competes with truth for the foremost place in his character compelled him to shake his head at this and he began again rather sadly my purpose is a larger one than merely to talk of my own doings i want to put common sense into plain english and to show as our medical men show daily that the body is beyond the comprehension of the mind the mind commands the body to lie down and be poked at and probed and pried into with fifty subtle instruments or even to be cut up and analysed alive and then understands never the more of it if the mind can learn nothing of the body it lives in grows rejoices and suffers with how can it know all about it for millions of years before either existed how can it trace their joint lineage up to a thing that had neither a head nor a body go to what i offer is not argument but fact and i care not the head of their ancestor for them but if i write it will you remove whatever may offend a candid mind if you offend no mind but that said i being fresh from a sharp review of something i had written you will give small offence indeed and to edit you will be a sinecure both these predictions have proved correct except indeed that a few kind readers of sadly unscientific mind have hankered for some explanation of parts which they failed to witness the reply is truly simple if you were not there the fault was yours here are the facts as in evidence better supported and less strange than those you accept without a wink and perhaps your trouble in realising a case of specific levity proceeds from nothing but your own excessive specific gravity r d blackmore contents chapter page i signs of eminence ii

the attention of the rest amazed as they are at a feat so far beyond their own power and experience and i would not have troubled any one's attention if i could only have been let alone and not ferreted as a phenomenon when the facts which i shall now relate were fresh and vivid in the public mind it might have been worth twenty guineas to me to set them in order and publish them such curiosity then was felt and so much of the purest science talked about my abnormal organism that nine or indeed i may say ten of the leading british publishers went so far as to offer me l with a chance of five dollars from america if i would only write my history but when a man is in full swing of his doings and his sufferings how can he stop to set them down for the pleasure of other people and even now when if i only tried i could do almost as much as ever it is not with my own consent that you get this narrative out of me how that comes to pass you shall see hereafter every one who knows me will believe that i have no desire to enlarge a fame which already is too much for me my desire is rather to slip away from the hooks and crooks of inquirers by leaving them nothing to lay hold of not even a fibre to retain a barb myself remaining like an open jelly clear and fitter for a spoon than fork as there is said to be a fish in oriental waters which being hooked turns inside out and saves both sides by candour one reason why i now must tell the simple truth and be done with it is that big rogues have begun to pile a pack of lies about me for the sake of money they are swearing one another down and themselves up for nothing else than to turn a few pounds out of me while never a one of them knows as much as would lie on a sixpence about me such is the crop of crop eared fame now if there is any man so eminent as to be made money of surely he ought to be allowed to hold his own pocket open otherwise how is he the wiser for all the wonder concerning him and yet those fellows i do assure you were anxious to elevate me so high that every sixpence pitched at me should jump down into their own hats this is not to my liking and i will do my utmost to prevent it and when you know my peculiar case you will say that i have cause for caution so fleeting is popularity such a gossamer the clue of history that within a few years of the time when i filled a very large portion of the public eye and was kept in great type at every journal office it may even be needful for me to remind a world yet more volatile than myself of the thrilling sensation i used to create and the great amazement of mankind these were more natural than wise for i never was a wonder to myself and can only hope that a truthful account of my trouble will commend me to all who have time enough to think as a mortal selected by nature for an extremely cruel experiment and a lesson to those who cannot enjoy her works without poking sticks at them my father was the well known bucephalus upmore called by his best friends bubbly upmore owner of those fine soap boiling works which used to be the glory of old maiden lane st pancras he was one of the best hearted men that ever breathed when things went according to his mind blest with every social charm genial wit and the surprising products of a brisk and poetical memory his figure was that of the broadest briton his weight eighteen stone and a half his politics and manners constitutional all over at every step he crushed a flint or split a contractor's paving stone and an asphalt walk was a quagmire to him my mother also was of solid substance and very deep bodily thickness she refused to be weighed when philosophers proposed it not only because of the bad luck that follows but also because she was neither a bull nor a pen of fat pigs nor a ribboned turkey but her husband vouched her to be sixteen stone and if she had felt herself to be much less why should she have scorned to step into the scales when she understood all the rights of women these particulars i set down simply as a matter of self defence because men of science who have never seen me take my case to support their doctrine of hereditary meiocatobarysm as they are pleased to call it presuming my father to have been a man of small specific gravity and my mother a woman of levity they are thoroughly welcome to the fact out of which they have made so much that the name of my mother's first husband was lightbody thomas lightbody of long acre a man who made springs for coaches but he had been in st pancras churchyard seven good years before i was born and he never was mentioned except as a saint when my father did anything unsaintly but a truce to philosophy none of which has ever yet bettered my condition let every tub stand or if stand it cannot let every tub fly on its own bottom better it is to have no attempt at explanation of my case than a hundred that stultify one another and a truly remarkable man has no desire to be explained away like many other people who have contrived to surprise the world before they stopped i did not begin too early as a child i did what the other children did and made no attempt to be a man too soon having plenty of time on my hands i enjoyed it and myself without much thought my mother alone perceived that nature intended me for greatness because i was the only child she had and when i began to be a boy i took as kindly as any boy to marbles peg top tip cat toffy lollipops and fireworks the pelting of frogs and even of dogs unless they retaliated and all the other delights included in the education of the london boy whose only remarkable exploit is to escape a good hiding every day of his life but as a straw shows the way of the wind a trifle or two in my very early years gave token of future eminence in the days of my youth there was much more play than there ever has been since and we little youngsters of maiden lane used to make fine running at the game of i spy and even in set races at these whenever there was no wind i was about on a par with the rest of my age or perhaps a little fleeter but whenever a strong wind blew if only it happened to be behind my jacket old nick himself might run after me in vain i seemed not to know that i touched the ground and nothing but a wall could stop me whereas if the wind were in front of my waistcoat the flattest footed girl even polly windsor could outstrip me another thing that happened to me was this and very unpleasant the effects were my mother had a brother who became my uncle william by coming home from sea when everybody else believed him drowned and done for perhaps to prove himself alive he made a tremendous noise in our house and turned everything upside down having a handful of money and being in urgent need to spend it there used to be a fine smell in our parlour of lemons and sugar and a square black bottle and uncle william used to say tommy i am your uncle bill come and drink my health boy perhaps you will never see me any more and he always said this in such a melancholy tone as if there was no other world to go to and none to leave behind him a man of finer nature never lived according to all i have heard of him wherever he might be he regarded all the place as if it were made for his special use and precisely adapted for his comfort and yet as if something was always coming to make him say good bye to it he had an extraordinary faith in luck and when it turned against him off he went one day while he was with us i came in with an appetite ready for dinner and a tint of outer air upon me from a wholesome play on the cinder heaps lord bless this tommy cried uncle william he looks as if he ought to go to heaven and without another word being very tall and strong he caught hold of me under the axle of my arms to give me a little toss upward but instead of coming down again up i went far beyond the swing of his long arms my head must have gone into the ceiling of the passage among the plaster and the laths and there i stuck fast by the peak of my cap which was strapped beneath my chin with spanish leather to see or to cry was alike beyond my power eyes and mouth being choked with dust and the report of those who came running below is that i could only kick however before i was wholly done for somebody fetched the cellar steps and with very great difficulty pulled me down uncle william was astonished more than anybody else for everybody else put the blame upon him but he was quite certain that it never could have happened without some fault on my part and this made a soreness between him and my mother which in spite of his paying the doctor's bill for my repairs as he called it speedily launched him on the waves again as soon as his money was got rid of this little incident confirmed my mother's already firm conviction that she had produced a remarkable child the latin pantheon is the place for tommy she said to my father every breakfast time and to grudge the money bucephalus is like flying in the face of providence with all my heart father always answered if providence will pay the ten guineas a quarter and l s for extras if you possessed any loftiness of mind my mother used to say while she made the toast you would never think twice of so low a thing as money against the education of your only child or at least you would get them to take it out in soap how many times must i tell you my dear that every boy brings his own quarter of a pound as for their monthly wash john windsor's boy jack is there and they get it out of him that makes it so much the more disgraceful my mother would answer with tears in her eyes that jack windsor should be there and no tommy upmore we are all well aware that mr windsor boils six vats for one of ours and sixty perhaps if he likes to say it but on the other hand he has six children against our one and which is worth the most my father used to get up nearly always when it came to this and take his last cup standing as if his work could not wait for him however it was forced into his mind more and more every morning that my learning must come to a question of hard cash which he never did approve of parting with and the more he had to think of it the less he smiled about it at last after cold meat for dinner three days running he put his best coat on and walked off straightway for the partheneion which is in ball's pond islington he did not come home in at all a good temper but boiled a good hour after boiling time and would not let any one know for several days what had gone amiss with him for my part having as behoves a boy no wild ambition to be educated and hearing from jack windsor what a sad case he was in i played in the roads and upon the cinder hills and danced defiance at the classic pile which could be seen afar sometimes when the smoke was blowing the other way but while i was playing sad work went on and everything was settled without my concurrence mrs rumbelow herself the doctor's wife lady president of the college although in a deeply interesting state as dates will show hereafter not only came in a cab to visit my mother but brought with her on the dicky as if he were nobody the seventh nephew of the lord mayor of london who could do a greek tree if it was pencilled out this closed all discussion and clenched my fate and our tailor was ordered to come next morning my father had striven his utmost to get me taken as a day boy or at any rate to be allowed to keep a book against the muses but mrs rumbelow waved her hand and enlarged upon liberal associations and the higher walks of literature to such an extent that my father could not put a business foot in anywhere and before i was sent to bed that night when i went for my head to be patted and to get a chuck below the chin he used words which hung long in my memory poor tommy thy troubles are at hand he said with a tender gaze at me beneath his pipe they can't make no profit from the victualling of thy mind but they mean to have it out of thy body little chap 'tis a woe as goes always to the making of a man and the lord have mercy on thee my son tommy footnote sir thomas cannot be accepted here without a good sized grain of salt exciting as his adventures are and sanguine as his nature is what can he be thinking of in the present distress of publisher strict economy of libraries and bankruptcy of the united states chapter ii itur ad astra the grandest result of education is the revival of the human system which ensues when it is over if it be of all pangs the keenest to remember joy in woe and of all pleasures the sweetest to observe another's travail upon either principle accommodated as all principles are to suit the purpose how vast the delight of manhood in reflecting upon its boyhood dr rumbelow of the partheneion which is in trotter's lane ball's pond combined high gifts of nature with rich ornaments of learning in virtue of all this he strove against the tendency of the age towards flippancy and self indulgence the absence of every high principle and the presence of every low one having to fill both the heads and the stomachs of thirty five highly respectable boys he bestirred himself only in the mental part and deputed to others the bodily not from any greed or want of feeling but a high minded hatred of business and a lofty confidence in woman so well grounded was this faith that mrs rumbelow never failed to provide us with fine appetites here and hence i first astonished the weak minds of the public and my own as much as anybody's although we had several boys of birth the boy of largest brains and body took the lead of all of us and this was bill chumps now sir william chumps the well known mp for st marylebone his father was what was then called a butcher but now a purveyor of animal provisions he supplied under contract the whole partheneion and his meat was so good that we always wanted more bill chumps being very quick at figures had made bright hits about holidays impending by noting the contents of the paternal cart and blowing the sibylline leaves of the meat book handed in by the foreman but even chumps was not prepared for a thing that happened one fine friday we had been at work all the afternoon or at any rate we had been in school and a longing for something more solid than learning began to rise in our young breasts oh shouldn't i like a good pig's fry the boy next to me was whispering or a big help out of a rump steak pie said the fellow beyond him with his slate sponge to his mouth but chumps said bosh what's the good of pigs and pastry kidneys and mushrooms is my ticket tommy give us the benefit of your opinion chumps was always very good to me although i was under his lowest waistcoat button for my father was a very good customer of that eminent butcher his father not only when he wanted a choice bit of meat but also as taking at a contract price all bones that could not be sent out at a shilling a pound as well as all the refuse fat which now makes the best fresh butter in reply to that important question i looked up at chumps with a mixture of hesitation and gratitude being a sensitive boy i found it so hard to give an opinion without offence to elder minds yet so foolish to seem to have no opinion and to spoil all the honour of being consulted a sense of responsibility made me pause and ponder concerning the best of all the many good things there are to eat and to lay mechanically as novelists express it both hands upon a certain empty portion of my organization when dr rumbelow arose we did not expect him to get up yet for nearly three quarters of an hour unless any boy wanted caning and at first a cold tremor ran through our inmost bones because we respected him so deeply but a glance at his countenance reassured us the doctor stood up with his college cap on a fine smile lifting his gabled eyebrows as the evening sun lights up gray thatch his tall frame thrown back and his terrible right hand peacefully under his waistcoat loosening the button of didactic cincture he spread forth the other hand with no cane in it and a yawn such as we should have had a smack for came to keep company with his smile boys he shouted sternly at first from the force of habit when we made a noise boys lacedaemonians partheneionidae hearken to the words which i with friendly meaning speak among you it has been ordained by the powers above holding olympian mansions that all things come in circling turn to mortal men who live on corn times there are for the diligent study of the mighty minds of old such as we who now see light of sun and walk the many feeding earth may never hope to equal but again there are seasons when the dies festi must be held and the feriae latinae which a former pupil of mine translated 'a holiday from latin' such a season now is with us once more it has pleased the good lucina to visit our humble tugurium and we are strictly called upon to observe the meditrinalia since which things are so it behoves me to proclaim to all of you feriae tridui imperativae the doctor's speech had been so learned that few of us were able to make out his meaning but chumps was a boy of vast understanding and extraordinary culture three days' holiday holloa boys holloa cried chumps with his cap going up to the roof three days' holiday rump steak for breakfast and lie a bed up to nine o'clock hurrah boys holloa louder louder louder again again again why you don't half holloa to the ear of reason it would have been brought home that the boys were holloaing quite loud enough and of that opinion was our master who laid his hands under his silvery locks while the smile of good will to us whom he loved and chastened came down substantially to the margin of his shave but behold to him thus beholding a new and hitherto unheard of prodigy wonderful to be told arose he sought for his spectacles and put them on and then for his cane and laid hold of it because he beheld going up into the air and likely to get out of his reach a boy it is not for me to say how i did it nobody was more amazed than i was although after all that had happened ere now to me i might have been prepared for it much as i try to remember what my feelings were all i can say is that i really know not and perhaps the confusion produced by going round so to which i was not yet accustomed and of looking downward at the place i used to stand on helped to make it hard for me to think what i was up to with no consideration as to what i was about and no sense of being out of ordinary ways i found myself leaving all the ground and its places not with any jump or other kind of rashness but gently equably and in good balance rising to the shoulders of the other little chaps and then over the heads of the tallest ones my sandals because of the weather being warm were tied with light blue ribbon according to the wishes of my mother and these made a show which i looked down at while everybody else stared up at them chumps was a very tall boy for his age by reason of all the marrow bones he got and the same thing had gifted him with high courage so that while all the other boys could only stare or run away if their nerves were quick he made a spring with both hands at my feet to fetch me back to the earth again and at the same instant he said tommy in the very kindest tone of voice entreating me to come down to him i do not exaggerate in saying that i strove with all my power to do this and with his kind help i might have done it if the string of my shoe had been sewed in but unhappily like most things now it was made for ornament more than use and so it slipped out and was left in his hand while much against my will i rose higher and higher at the same time i found myself going round and round so that i could not continue to observe the countenance of dr rumbelow gazing sternly and with some surprise at me but i saw him put on his spectacles which was always a bad sign for us capnobatae is the true reading in strabo as i have so long contended fetch me a cane a long long cane the doctor shouted as i still went up this is the spirit of the rising age i have long expected something of this kind i will quell it if i have to tie three canes together thomas upmore come down that i may cane you not upon my head boy or how can i do it for no sooner had i heard what was likely to befall me than my heart seemed to turn into a lump of cold lead at once my airy revolutions ceased my hands which had been hovering like butterflies stopped and dropped like beetles that have struck against a post and down i came plump with both feet upon the tassel of the trencher cap upon the doctor's head this must have been a very trying moment both for his patience and my courage and it is not fair to expect me to remember everything that happened however i feel that if i had been caned there would have been a mark upon my memory even as boys bear the limits of the parish in their minds through their physical geography likely enough my head was giddy from so much revolving and chumps living near us marched me home with a big lexicon strapped on my back to prevent me from trying to fly again chapter iii the dawn of science most people and more especially our writers of fiction history philosophy and so forth indulge in reflection at those moments when they are soaring above our heads but i have always found myself so unlucky in this matter as in many others that nothing would ever come into my head when aloft to be any good when i came down or at least only once as will be shown hereafter and that was the exception which proves the rule otherwise i might now give many nice and precise descriptions of variant motions and emotions both somatic and psychical as professor brachipod expressed them which must according to his demonstration have been inside me at my first flight very likely they were and even if they were not it would never pay me to be positive or negative perhaps is the proper word now because ignorant science is remunerative and nothing can be got by impugning it yet that consideration i assure you has nothing to do with my present silence i am silent simply because i know nothing and if all so placed would try my plan how much less would be said and written nevertheless all biologists psychologists anthropologists and the rest of our race who make it their study after proving it wholly below their heed these men if they deign to be called such have a claim upon me for all my facts which i will not grudge when i know them from the very outset they felt this and my father and mother who had not slept well through talking so much of my above adventure recounted perhaps with some embellishment by chumps hardly had got through their breakfast before some eminent scientists were at them for my part having made a hearty supper after long scarcity of butcher's meat or perhaps from having swallowed so much air i had slept long and soundly and was turning for another good sleep when i heard great voices madam allow me to express surprise were the words which came up to me through the ceiling at the place where my head had made the hole extreme surprise at the narrowness of your views must i come to the conclusion that you refuse to forward the interests of science sir replied mother who was always polite when she failed to make out what people meant science is what i don't know from the moon but i do know what my tommy is my dear mrs upmore was the answer in a soft sweet voice which i found afterwards to be that of professor brachipod in consulting the interests of science we shall consult those of the beloved tommy his existence is so interwoven with a newly formed theory of science you impudent hop' my thumb what do you mean broke in a deep sound which i knew to be my father's by calling my wife your dear indeed first time as ever you set eyes on her out you go and no mistake upon this ensued a heavy tread and a little unscientific squeak and out went professor brachipod as lightly as if on the wings of his theory upmore this violence is a mistake another and larger voice broke in as my father came back quietly the professor's views may be erroneous but to eliminate him because of somatic inferiority is counter to the tendency of the age my theory differs from his toto coelo but in the cause of pure reason i protest against unmanly recourse to physics you shall have the same physick if you don't clear out said my father as peaceable a man as need be till his temper was put up an englishman's house is his castle no science have a right to come spoiling his breakfast you call me unmanly in your big words you are a big man and now i'll tackle you out goes professor jargoon there was some little scuffle before this larger professor was eliminated because he was a strong man and did not like to go but without much labour he was placed outside now if either of you two chaps comes back my father shouted from his threshold the science he gets will be my fist and lucky for him he haven't had it yet running to the window of my room i saw the professors arm in arm going sadly up the cinder heaps and glad as i was to be quit of them i did not like the way of it however i hoped for the best and went down in my trousers and braces to breakfast my father was gone to his boiling by this time for nothing must ever interfere with that but my mother would never give up her breakfast till she saw the bottom of the teapot oh tommy darling she cried as she caught me and kissed me quite into the china cupboard for we always had breakfast in the kitchen when out of a maid of all work my own little tommy do you know why you fly all the greatest men in the kingdom have been here to prove that you do it from reasons of herod heroditical something but he was a bad man and murdered a million of little ones they may prove what they like and of course they know more about my own child than i do i don't care that for their science said mother snapping her thumb which was large and very fat but tell me tommy from your own dear feelings what it was that made you fly so i didn't fly mother i only went up because i could not help it because i was so empty and felt certain of getting full again quite early in the holidays begin at once darling and don't talk oh it is a cruel cruel thing that you should leave the ground for want of victuals when your father clears eight pounds a week deny it as he may i can prove it to him but i have found out what makes you fly a flip for their science and thundering words well mother i don't want to do it again i answered as well as i could with my mouth quite full of good bacon and a baker's roll but do please tell me what made me do it tommy the reason is out of the bible you cannot help flying just because you are an angel they never told me that at school i said and old rum would have caned me if he could reach but he never would have dared to cane an angel hush tommy hush how dare you call that learned old gentleman with white hair 'old rum' but never mind darling whatever you do don't leave off eating for this i might be trusted after all i had been through and so well did i spend my days at home especially when bill chumps came to dine with us upon his own stipulation what the dinner was to be that instead of going up into the air at all the stoutest lover of his native land could not have surpassed me in sticking to it chumps though the foremost of boys was inclined to be shy with grown up people till mother emboldened him with ginger wine and then he gave such an account of my exploit that my father and mother looked at him with faces as different as could be my mother's face was all eyes and mouth with admiration delight excitement vigorous faith and desire for more my father's face was all eyebrows nose and lips and he shook his big head that neighbour chumps should have such a liar for his eldest son nothing but the evidence of his own eyes would ever convince bucephalus upmore that a son of his or of any other englishman came out of an egg without which there was no flying mr upmore you should be ashamed of yourself my mother broke in rather sharply to argue such questions before young boys but since you must edify us out with your proof that the blessed angels were so born or will you deny them the power to fly never did i claim answered father with a little wink at chumps to know the ins and outs of angels not having married one as some folk do until they discover the difference our tommy is a good boy enough in his way but no angel no more than his parents be if ever i see him go up like a bubble i'll fetch him down sharp with my clout rake but if i don't use my rake till then it will last out my lifetime i'll bet a guinea now tommy feed and don't talk or look about you'll be sorry when you get back to school for every moment that you have wasted my mind is not altogether clear said mother about letting him go back to the latin pantheon this was her name for the partheneion he is welcome to have a gentle fly now and then as providence has so endowed him and i am sure he would never fly away from his own mother but as for his flying because he is empty in his poor inside i'll not hear of it bucephalus how would you like it can't say at all mother till i have tried it shall be glad to hear tommy's next experience back he goes to morrow morning and by this day week if they starve him well he'll be fit to go sky high again a likely thing indeed that i should pay ten guineas beforehand for a quarter's board and tuition in classics and mathematics all of the finest quality and another ten guineas in lieu of notice and get only three weeks for the whole of it come tommy how much have you learned my boy oh ever such a lot father i am sure i don't know what well my son give us a sample of it unless there's too much to break bulk at random tip us a bit of your learning tommy wait a bit father till i've got my fingers up when they come right i say hic haec hoc and the singular number of musa a song i have told mother every word of it out and out beautiful it sounds said mother quite above business and what goes on in the week dr rumbelow must be a wonderful man to have made such great inventions well it's very hard to pay for it and leave it in the clouds my father said sniffing as if he smelled pudding let's have some more of it sky high tommy my mother looked at me as much as to say now my dear son astonish him and my conscience told me that i ought to do it and i felt myself trying very hard indeed to think but not a latin word would come of it perhaps i might have done it if it had not been for chumps who kept on putting up his mouth to blow me some word bigger than the one that i was after while all that i wanted was a little one and father leaned back with a wink to encourage me to take the shine out of himself by my learning but i could only lick my spoon come if that is ten guineas' worth of latin said my father i should like to know what sixpenn'orth is tell us the latin for sixpence tommy it was natural that i should not know this and i doubt whether even chumps did for he turned away lest i should ask him but my mother never would have me trampled on mr upmore you need not be vulgar she said because you have had no advantages would you dare to speak so before latin scholars even master chumps is blushing for you and his father a man of such fine common sense no sensible person can doubt for a moment that tommy knows a great many words of latin but is not to be persecuted out of them in that very coarse manner at dinner time tell me my dear she said turning to me for i was fit to cry almost what is the reason that you can't bring out your learning i am sure that you have it my chick and there must be some very good reason for keeping it in then i'll tell you what it is i answered looking at my father more than her there is such a lot of it it all sticks together that's the best thing i ever heard in my life cried father as soon as he could stop laughing while chumps was grinning wisely with his mouth full of pudding what a glorious investment of my ten guineas to have a son so learned that he can't produce a word of it because it all sticks together to morrow my boy you shall go back for the rest of it like a lump of grains it seems to be that you can't get into with a mashing stick ah i shall tell that joke to night so you may said mother so you may bucephalus but don't let us have any more of it 'tis enough to make any boy hate learning to be blamed for it so unjustly would he ever have flown if it had not been for latin and that shows how much he has got of it answer that if you can mr upmore but my father was much too wise to try sophy you beat me there he said i never was much of a hand at logic as all the clever ladies are bill chumps shall have a glass of wine after his pudding and tommy drink water like a flying fish and you may pour me a drop from the black square bottle as soon as you have filled my pipe my dear that i will bucephalus with great pleasure if you will promise me one little thing if tommy goes back to that latin pantheon they must let him come home every sunday fly home to his nest to prevent him from flying my father replied with a smile of good humour for he liked to see his pipe filled encourage his crop and discourage his wings 'old rum' as they call him wouldn't hear of that at first but perhaps he will now that he has turned out such a flyer chapter iv the pursuit of science many people seem to find the world grow worse the more they have of it that they may be ready to go perhaps to a higher and better region but never has this been the case with me although i am a staunch conservative my settled opinion is that nature bearing in her reticule the human atom changes very slowly so that boys are boys through rolling ages even as adam must have been if he had ever been a boy at any rate the boys at dr rumbelow's were not so much better than boys are now as to be quoted against them they certainly seem to have had more courage more common sense and simplicity together with less affectation daintiness vanity and pretension but on the other hand they were coarser wilder and more tyrannical and rejoiced more freely than their sons do now in bullying the little ones the first thing a new boy had to settle was his exact position in the school not in point of scholarship or powers of the mind but as to his accomplishments at fisticuff his first duty was to arrange his schoolfellows in three definite classes those who could whack him and he must abide it those he would hit again if they hit him and those he could whack without any danger whenever a big fellow had whacked him knowledge of the world and of nature also was needed for making this arrangement well to over esteem or to undervalue self brought black eyes perpetual or universal scorn but to me alas no political study of this kind was presented all the other boys could whack me and expostulation led to more because i was the smallest and most peaceful among all the little ones and the buoyancy of my nature made a heavy blow impossible yet upon the whole the others were exceedingly kind and good to me rejoicing to ply me with countless nicknames of widely various grades of wit suggested by my personal appearance and the infirmity of lightness tom tit butterfly upmore flying tommy and skylark were some of the names that i liked best and answered to most freely while i could not bear to be called soap suds bubbly blue bottle or blow me tight but whatever it was it served its turn and the boy who had been witty at my expense felt less disposed to knock me but even as with the full grown public opinion once formed is loth to budge so with these boys it was useless to argue that having flown once i could not again do it if they would have allowed me simply to maintain the opposite or to listen mutely to their proofs it would have been all right for either side but when they came pricking me up with a pin in the end of a stick or a two pronged fork such as used to satisfy a biped with his dinner and a much better dinner then he gets now endeavouring also to urge me on high by an elevating grasp of my hair and ears you may well believe me when i say how sadly i lamented my exploit above i was ready to go up i was eager to go up not only to satisfy public demand but also to get out of the way of it and more than once i did go up some few inches in virtue of the tugs above and pricks in lower parts of me but no sooner did i begin to rise with general expectation raised and more forks ready to go into me than down i always came again calling in vain for my father and mother because i could not help it upon such occasions no one had the fairness to allow for my circumstances every one vowed that i could fly as well as ever if i tried in earnest and i was too young to argue with them and point out the real cause to wit the large and substantial feeding in which i employed my sundays by reason of this i returned to school every monday morning with a body as heavy as my mind almost and to stir up either of them was useless for a long time afterwards as ill luck would have it it was on a monday that science made her next attack on me and now let me say that if ever you find me from your own point of view uncandid bigoted narrow minded unsynthetical unphilosophical or anything else that is wicked and low when it fails to square with theories in the spirit of fair play you must remember what a torment science has been to me five of them came on that monday afternoon four in a four wheeler and one on the dicky and we had a boy who could see things crooked through some peculiar cast of eye and though the windows were six feet over his head he told us all about it and we knew that he was right presently in came the doctor's page a boy who was dressed like mercury but never allowed in the schoolroom unless he had urgent cause to show his name was bob jackson and we had rare larks with his clothes whenever we got hold of him and he waved above his head as his orders were to do a very big letter for the doctor every boy of us rushed into a certainty of joy away with books and away to play but woe instead of bliss was the order of the day dr rumbelow never allowed himself to be hurried or flurried by anything except the appearance of his babies and when he was made as he was by and by a bishop for finding out something in lycophron that nobody else could make head or tail of he is said to have taken his usual leisure in loosing the button enforced by mrs rumbelow ere ever he broke the prime minister's seal boys he said now after looking at us well to see if anybody wanted caning lads who combine the discipline of sparta with the versatile grace of athens mr smallbones will now attend to you under his diligent care you will continue your studies eagerly in these degenerate days hard science tramples on the arts more elegant happy are ye who can yet devote your hours to the lighter muses at the stern call of science who has no muse but herself is an erinnys i leave you in the charge of mr smallbones icarillus you will follow me and bring the light cane with the ticket no a light cane is sweeter for very little boys my heart went down to my heels while bearing my fate in my hands i followed him conscience had often reproached me for not being able to fly to please the boys universal consent had declared that it all was my fault and i ought to pay out for it what was the use of my trying to think that the world was all wrong and myself alone right very great men like athanasius might be able to believe it but a poor little tommy like me could not but i tried hard to say to the doctor's coat tails oh please not to do it sir if you can please to help it dr rumbelow turned as we crossed a stone passage where my knees knocked together from the want of echo and a cold shiver crept into my bones and seeing the state of my mind and body and no boy anywhere near us he could not help saying my poor icarillus cheer up rouse up tharsei the romans had no brief forms of encouragement because they never required it but the small and feeble progeny of this decadent country don't cry brave icarillus don't cry poor little fellow none shall touch you but myself what terror hath invaded you the doctor stooped and patted my head which was covered with thick golden curls and i raised my streaming eyes to him and pointed with one hand at the cane which was trembling in my other hand my master indulged in some latin quotation or it may have been greek for aught i know and then translated and amplified it as his manner was with a junior pupil boys must weep this has been ordained most wisely by the immortal gods to teach them betimes the lesson needed in the human life more often than any other erudition but alas for thee poor icaridion it seems as from the eyes afar a thing unjust and full of thambos for thou hast not aimed at nor even desired the things that are unlawful but rather hast been ensnared therein by means of some necessity hard to be avoided therefore i say again cheer up tommy science may vaunt herself as being the mistress of the now happening day and of that which has been ordained to follow but i am the master of my own cane thomas upmore none shall smite thee a glow of joy came into my heart and dried up my tears in a wink or two for we knew him to be a true man of his word whether to cane or to abstain and if the professors had kept in the background i might have soared up for them then and there but it never is their nature to do that and before i had time to be really happy four out of the five were upon me hearing the doctor's fine loud voice they could no more contain themselves but dashed out upon us like so many dragons on the back of their own eminence professors brachipod and jargoon chocolous and mullicles than whom are none more eminent on the roll of modern science the fifth and greatest of them all whose name shall never be out rubbed by time but cut deeper every year professor megalow sat calmly on a three legged stool which he had found none of these learned gentlemen had seen my little self before and an earnest desire arose in my mind that not one of them ever should see me again their eyes were beaming with intellect and their arms spread out like sign posts and i made off at once without waiting to think till the doctor's deep voice stopped me icarillus he said and though he could not catch them my legs could go no further athena the muses and phoebus himself command thee to face the enemy this new and prosaic and uncouth power which calls itself 'science' as opposed to learning wisdom and large philosophy excuse me gentlemen i am speaking in the abstract this arrogant upstart is so rampant because people run away from her tommy come hither these gentlemen are kind very kind don't be afraid tommy you may stand in the folds of my gown if you like answer any question they may ask and fly again if they can persuade you professors brachipod and jargoon chocolous and mullicles my little pupil is at your service beginning to feel my own importance i began to grow quite brave almost and ventured to take down my hands from my face and turn round a little and peep from the corners of my eyes at these great magicians and as soon as i saw that the foremost of them had been carried out of our house by father and sent away over the cinder heaps there came a sort of rising in my mind which told me to try to stick up to them and when they fell out one with another as they lost no time in doing they made me think somehow about the old women who came to pick over our ash heaps until through the doorway i saw another face the kindest and grandest i ever had seen the face of professor megalow before i had time to get afraid again there was no chance left to run away for the four professors had occupied all the four sides of my body they poked me and pulled me in every direction and felt every tender part of me and would have been glad to unbutton my raiment if the master had allowed it and they used such mighty words as nobody may reproduce correctly unless he was born or otherwise endowed with a ten chain tape at the back of his tongue every one talked as fast as if the rest were listening eagerly and every one listened as much as if the rest had nought to say to him for all worked different walks of science and each was certain that the other's walk was crooked i assure you that this was a very difficult thing for me to deal with having so many tongues going on about me and so many hands going into me and a strong pull in one direction crossed by a stronger push in the other moreover two learned gentlemen wanted to throw me up perpendicular while other two of equal learning would launch me on high horizontally between and among and amid them all there was like to be nothing but specimens left of unfortunate tommy upmore gentlemen gentlemen shouted dr rumbelow but they did not answer to that name professors professors forbear i beseech you is this scientific investigation i will have no vivisection here for they hurt me so much that i now screamed out i am sorry to lay hands upon you but humanity compels me now unless you all sit down i shall send argeiphontes for the police i grieve that you drive me to such strong measures but i cannot have my little icarus treated like orpheus or actaeon luckily for me the doctor's body might vie with his mind in grasp of subject and he soon had professors brachipod jargoon and mullicles seated in their chairs but the fourth professor whose name was chocolous and himself a foreigner of some kind entreated that he might not be compelled to sit not for five six seven year have i seet in ze shair he cried with his arms spread out and his back in a shake against some degradation i must not and i will not seet herr doctor in many languages laboriously excellent present not to me zis grade indignity i vill keek if you not leave off he was very angry but his friends seemed to enjoy it oblige me gentlemen said dr rumbelow decorously quitting this excitement by telling me why your learned friend resists my kindly efforts when the body is seated the mind is calm what find we in plato upon that subject not only once but even thrice in a single dialogue we discover directly and inferentially a flip for those old codgers sir exclaimed professor brachipod chocolous knows more than fifty platos though his leading idea is fundamentally erroneous i say nah i say non i say bosh broke in professor chocolous his leading idea that the human race may recover its primordial tail by abstaining for only a few generations seven chenerations first and when he have attained one yoint seven more i am ze first but in two tree four hundred year continued in ze female line wizout ever going upon ze shair shut up chocolous broke in professor mullicles how can molecular accretion ever be affected by human habitude 'tis a simple inversion of the fundamental process every schoolboy now is perfectly aware that the protoplasmatic anthropomorphism was a single joint of tail molecular accretion immediately commenced and the result is such a fellow as you are and such a fellow as professor megalow the little german answered with quiet self respect if i vos one he vos ze oder professor megalow vot for you stay back so my reason for staying back so as our learned friend expresses it said the tall man with the kind and noble face at last advancing is that the matter now in hand though deeply interesting and to judge by results even highly exciting is one that i have never dealt with when i was kindly asked to come i was very glad to do so but with your good leave i will form no opinion until i find some grounds for it the four men of science were struck dumb at the rashness of such a resolution while dr rumbelow took advantage of their amazement to say a word professor megalow allow me the honour of shaking hands with you sir you speak like a genuine acolyte of that glorious sage pythagoras the ereneuticon in all truth must precede the hermeneuticon whenever you like to examine tommy he shall be at your service this offer was highly disinterested but i did not enjoy its magnanimity especially as my protector now became so engrossed with the great professor that he quite forgot poor little me now is your time to go through with the question spake the arch enemy brachipod which beyond all doubt is nothing more than a case of organic levigation levigation be d d cried professor jargoon any fool can see that it is gaseous expansion gaseous expansion is bosh bosh bosh shouted professor chocolous ze babe zat vos born a veek longer dis day vill tell you bacilli bacilli how pleasant it would be to hear all this nonsense declared professor mullicles if ignorance were not so dogmatic the merest neophyte would recognise at once this instance of histic fluxion without any delay a great uproar arose and the four professors rushed at me to save rushing at one another my heart fell so low that i could not run away though extremely desirous of doing so and the utmost i could manage was to get behind a chair and sing out for my father and mother this only redoubled their zeal and i might not have been alive now to speak of it had not professor brachipod pulled out an implement like a butcher's steelyard and swung back the others with a sweep of it he belongs to me it was i who found him out i will have the very first turn at him he cried i'll knock on the head any man who presumes to prevent me from proving my theory just hold him tight while i get this steel hook firmly into his collar now are you satisfied this proves everything can this levigation be d d jargoon all his weight is a pound and five ounces he turned round in triumph and a loud laugh met him he was weighing my jacket without me inside it for mother had told me a hundred times that a child had much better be killed than weighed at the fright of his touch i slipped out of my sleeves and set off at the top of my speed away in the passage i found a side door open and without looking back dashed through it go it little 'un a cabman cried the very man who had brought mine enemies and go it i did like a bird on the wing without any knowledge of the ground below some of our boys looking out of a window called out well done tommy you'll win the something it may have been the derby i went too fast to hear what it was short as my legs were they flew like the spokes of a wheel that can never be counted and i left a mail cart and a butcher's cart too out of sight though they tried to keep up with me such was my speed on the wings of the wind with my linen inflated and my hair blown out the nimblest professor that ever yet rushed to a headlong conclusion were slow to me in a word i should have distanced all those enemies had i only taken the right road home but alas when i came to the top of a rise from which i expected to see my dear parents or at any rate our cinder heap there was nothing of the kind in sight the breeze had swept me up the barnet road and yonder was the smoke of our chimney like a streak a mile away down to the left of me all the foot of the hill which is now panelled out into walls and streets of the great cattle market remained to be crossed without help of the wind ere ever i was safe inside our door and the worst of it was that the ground had no cover not a house nor a tree nor so much as a ditch for a smallish boy to creep along only piles of rubbish here and there and a few swampy places where snipes sometimes pitched down to have a taste of london tired as i was after that great run and scant of breath and faint hearted for the sun was gone down below highgate hill and my spirits ever seem to sink with him i started anew for my own sweet home by the mark of the smoke of our boiling house i could hear my heart going pit a pat faster than my weary feet went for the place was as lonely as science could desire for a snug job of vivisection of that grisly horror i knew not as yet the name nor the meaning precisely but a boy at our school who was a surgeon's son used to tell things in bed there was no sleeping after and once he had said if they could catch you tommy what a treat you would be to be lectured on as the dusk grew deeper in the hollow places and the ribs of the naked hills paler i began to get more and more afraid and to start back and listen at my own footstep and before i could hear what i hoped to hear the anvil of the blacksmith down our lane the air began to thicken with the reeking of the earth and the outline of everything in sight was blurred and a very tired fellow could not tell at any moment what to run away from without running into worse at one time i thought of sitting down and hiding in a dip of the ground till night came on and my enemies could not see me but although that might have been the safest plan my courage would not hold out for it so on i went in fear and trembling peeping and peering both behind me and before and longing with all my heart to see our own door but instead of that oh what a sight i saw the most fearful that can be imagined from the womb of the earth those four professors whose names are known all over it brachipod jargoon chocolous and mullicles came forth and joined hands in front of me they laughed with a low scientific laugh like a surgical blade on the grindstone capital capital brachipod cried we have got him all snug to ourselves at last let me get my hook into my pretty little eel famous famous said the deep voice of jargoon now you shall see how i work my compressor hoch hoch chuckled chocolous ve have catch ze leetle baird at last i vill demonstrate his bacilli but the one that terrified me most of all was professor mullicles because he said nothing but kept one hand upon something that shone from his long black cloak oh gentlemen kind gentle gentlemen i sobbed dropping down on my knees before them do please let me go to my father and mother they live close by and they think so much of me and i am sure they would pay you for all your inventions a great deal more than the government i only flew once and i didn't mean to fly and i am sure it must have been a mistake altogether and i will promise upon my sammy as bill chumps says not to do it any more oh please to let me go it is so late and i beg your pardon humbly eloquent and aerial tommy replied that dreadful brachipod this case is too momentous in the interests of pure science for selfish motives to be recognized it will be your lofty privilege to abstract yourself to revert to the age of unbroken continuity when that which is now called tommy was an atom of protobioplasm stow that rubbish broke in jargoon ach ach ach all my yaw is on the edge screamed chocolous dancing with his hands up proto potatoes spoke mullicles sternly advancing to support his view of me d n exclaimed all of them unanimous for once when there was no view of me to be had was there ever such a little devil after him after him he can't get away can't he thought i though i did not dare to speak having not a single pant of breath to spare for while i was down on my knees for mercy through the tears in my eyes i had seen a lamp lit i knew where that lamp was and all about it having broken the glass of it once or twice and lamps were a rarity in maiden lane as yet it was not a quarter of a mile away and the light of it shone upon my own white pillow so when those philosophers parted hands to shake fists at one another out of the scientific ring i slipped and made off for the life of me my foes were not very swift of foot and none of them would let another get before him so that if i had been fresh and bold even without any breeze to help me i might have outstripped them easily but my legs were tired and my mind dismayed and the scientific terms in which they called on me to stop were enough to make any one stick fast and the worst of it was that having no coat on i was very conspicuous in the dusk and had no chance of dodging to the right or left so that i could hear them gaining on me and my lungs were too exhausted for me to scream out for father thus within an apple toss of our back door and with nothing but a down hill slope between me and our garden those four ogres of grim science had me lapsing back into their grasp again their hands were stretched forth in pursuit of my neck and their breath was like flame at the tips of my ears when a merciful providence delivered me i felt something quivering under my feet over which i went lightly with a puff of wind lifting the hollows of my hair and shirt sleeves in an instant i landed on a bank of slag but behind me was a fearful four fold splash so absorbing was my terror and so scattered were my wits that for ever so long i could not make out what had happened betwixt me and my pursuers except that i was safe and they were not there they were struggling and sputtering and kicking so much at least as could be seen of them throwing up their elbows or their heels or heads and execrating nature when their mouths were clear to do it in the very shortest language that has ever been evolved at the same time a smell even stronger than their words arose and grew so thick that they could scarcely be seen through it this told me at once what had befallen them or rather what they had fallen into videlicet the cleaning of our vats together with mr john windsor's whose refuse and scouring is run away in trucks upon the last saturday of every other month it would be hard to say what variety of stench and of glutinous garbage is not richly present here and the men from the sewers who conduct it to the pit require brandy at short intervals in the pit which is not more than five feet deep yet ought to be shunned by trespassers the surface is covered with chloride of lime and other materials employed to kill smell by outsmelling it and so a short crust forms over it until the contents become firm and slab and can be cut out for the good of the land when the weather is cold and the wind blows away now certain it is that all the science they were made of could never have extricated those professors without the strong arms of my father and mother and even small me at the end of the rope the stuff they were in being only half cooled and their bodies grown sticky with running so fastened heavily on them like tallow on a wick closing so completely both mouth and eyes that instead of giving they could only receive a lesson in materialism professors brachipod and chocolous being scarcely five feet and a quarter in height were in great danger of perishing but mullicles and jargoon most kindly gave them a jump now and then for breath and to be quit of an unfragrant matter and tell it more rapidly than we did it with the aid of a blue man from the indigo works and of two thickset waggoners we rescued those four gentlemen from their sad situation and condoled with them not for l per head however would any of our cabmen take them home though a man out of work had been tempted by a guinea to relieve them a little with a long handled broom and to flush them with a bucket afterwards under heavy discouragement they set forth on their several ways surveyed by the police at a respectful distance on account of the danger to the public health chapter v grip my mother was so frightened at the fright i had been through that she took it for an urgent sign from heaven that my education should be stopped at once having had as much of school as i desired i heartily hoped that her opinion would prevail but father was as obstinate as ever and after the usual argument in which she had the best of the words perhaps and he of the meaning i was bound to the altar of the muses once again with a promise of stripes if i should try to slip the cord dr rumbelow undertook that no professor of anything harder than languages unless it were professor megalow should come in at any door of the partheneion without having tallow poured over him which he had found from high greek authority to be the right ointment for neo sophistae and he said that my father must have been familiar with the passage he referred to and had thus discomfited all the pansophistae better than any modern deipnosophist could have done but my father said no he had never even heard of the gentleman with the hard name to crack and as for them prophesiers they ought to have prophesied what his clots was before tumbling into them he ought to have an action of trespass against them and but for the law he would do so to make it quite certain that no man of science should analyse synthesise generalise or in any way scientise me i was now provided with a guardian intrepid of neologisms ten yards long the father of our bill chumps mr chumps the purveyor of meat was the owner of a dog who was the father of a pup who was threatening every day to make mincemeat of the author of his existence the old dog might have tackled him bill told me or at any rate could have shown a good turn up but for having broken his best fighting tooth on the spiked collar of the last mastiff he had slain through this disability on the part of old fangs he found his son grip too many for him yet could not be brought to confess it and abstain from a battle at every opportunity these encounters in no wise disturbed mr chumps but became inconvenient to mrs chumps when she heard the piano which had cost l for her daughter belinda to learn her scales upset and entirely demolished if it had been possible to hang grip hanged he would have been that very day for the mistress had nursed fangs through his distemper and never would listen to a word against him whereas the whole fault was upon the side of fangs of which i am quite certain from the character of grip as it unfolded itself before me when he became my own dear dog providentially their attempt to hang him had proved a miserable failure not that he resisted he was too docile and kind and intelligent to do that but because his neck was much too thick and manifold and his wind too good for any rope to be of much account to him and before they could try any other form of murder his master came home and made short work with them knowing the superiority of the dog now that same evening the day being monday the very choice club to which he and my father and mr john windsor belonged as well as the largest potato man at king's cross and the owner of the indigo blue concern and the most eminent merchant in the cat's meat line and several other gentlemen of equal distinction held their bi daily congress at the best end of the scrag at the corner that night there was a very fine attendance and my father who had long been acknowledged to be the wittiest man on our side of the road perhaps because he got no chance at home to say what came inside him upon this occasion was compelled by the nature of some of the smells he had gone through to be at his best as he generally was after not less than two glasses and a half and he told the adventure of the four professors not as a sad and deplorable thing but rather as matter for merriment in such a light did he put it that all the gentlemen laughed heartily most of all mr john windsor who knew even better than my father did the variety of organic substance active in that pit just then there's things there he said to my living knowledge that'll never come out of their hair while they live and those big savage johns always have long hair and as fuzzy as a cat stroked upward why the very last friday when i was a cooling a pair of them comes with a brazen machine and asked me as quiet as a statue permission for to taste my follet oils i up with the wooden spoon and offered them a drop but that was not their meaning it was som'at about som'at we gives off according to them philanderers and i says 'government inquiry gents' and they says 'no sir but for purposes of science' 'tell me' says i 'what the constitootion is of this here clot' and they said 'composite organic' something while my composites all was upon the upper floor and never a hurdy gurdy allowed inside 'so much for science' says i 'jim show these gentlemen out by the back alley door' and now that you come to discourse of it bubbly it strikes me they might have come very likely smelling up a side wind for your poor tommy i should hope they have had enough of that said father if they come any more i'll boil them down and make 'science sauce for the million' how would you like john to pay your money and get no change out of it along of such a lot you mean the missus mr windsor asked won't allow thistledown as my jack calls him to go to old rum's any more i suppose afraid of the ladies mr upmore is i'll tell you what to do mr chumps broke in upmore you buy my young dog grip i'd give him to you with all my heart if it wasn't for the bad luck of it though he is worth ten guineas of anybody's money for he comes of the best blood in england downright house of lords bull dog he is same as should be chained to the pillars of the state to keep them glads and rads away just you put him in charge of thistledown or whatever you call that little yellow haired chap and i'll back grip against all the science that ever made a pint contain a pot what's the figure my father asked knowing how generously all men talk and that mr chumps' bull dogs were a fashionable race if you was to offer me more than a crown replied mr chumps with his fist on the table i should say 'bubbly he's no dog of yours because you desire to insult me' but put you down a crown as between old friends and before this honourable company i say 'bucephalus upmore grip is your dog' why so john windsor here knows why and so does harry peelings from king's cross and so does bill blewitt and sandy mewliver and all this honourable company and so do you bubbly upmore if you are the man i have taken you for gentlemen it is because mr upmore has told the best story i have sat and listened to ever since last election day he digged a pit for his enemies in the gate and they fell into it themselves as well as because my son bill chumps who will make his mark mind you if you live to see it has taken a liking to this gentleman's son thistledown or bubble blow or up goes the donkey they've got at least fifty names for him and in my humble opinion he must be protected from the outrages of all those fellows philo this and anti that my son bill knows their names and all about them who have made the world a deal too clever for a quiet man's comfort these very simple and sensible words were received with much knocking on the table and my father put down his five shilling piece so that all the other gentlemen had time to see it before they began talking as the subject compelled them to do of the merits of their children respectively severally and all together and they parted in thorough good will inasmuch as not anybody listened to anybody else my father's opinion at the time had been that the warmth of mr chumps' political and social feelings promoted by the comforts of the club had hurried him into a disregard of money which his friends should never lose a moment to improve but when the journeyman came over in the morning on his way to the partheneion with grip trotting chained at the tail of the cart my father cried what has chumps no more conscience than to impose upon a friend like this i who have known him all these years to pay as good a crown piece as was ever coined for a one eyed nick eared hare lipped broken tailed son of a female dog like that gristles you go back and tell your master that you saw me put an ounce of lead through him my father strode in to fetch his gun which he kept well charged in the clock case now for the sake of so many professors and grip for a surety would have been dead and boiling in less than five minutes except for his luck his luck was that i being under debate between my two parents had slipped out of doors being old enough now by experience to know that they took the kindest view of me when i was out of sight and coming round the corner to peep in at the window just to see whether they had settled my concerns there i saw this poor dog hideous they might call him doubtfully glancing in every direction dimly aware that the world was against him scenting the death of a dog in the air one of his eyes was out of sight and one of his ears was in need of a sling his tail which had lately been cracked by his father hung limp in the dust with a pitiable wag and every hair on his body was turned the wrong way his self respect had suffered a tremendous blow by the effort of mankind to hang him yesterday and by dragging at the tail of a cart to day and as sure as dogs are dogs he was aware of the awful decision against him gristles was a hard man and would not say a word to comfort or to plead for him having got a little snap from him a month or two ago so he looked down over the back of the cart and whistled pop goes the weasel while the poor dog implored him with all his one eye full of wistful enquiry what harm he had done all right guv'nor shouted gristles as my father came forthwith his big double barrel my mare will stand fire like a church but mind you it ain't no good to shoot at his head with nothing no smaller than a dockyard cannon have at his heart where you sees him now a panting but for god's sake guv'nor don't shoot me that fellow's cowardly cruelty made my father relent for his heart was kind and before he could put up his gun again i was lying upon grip and hugging him the unfortunate dog for his last resource had appealed to the only weak face he could find and my own fright enabled me to enter into his you little fool tommy get out of the way my father shouted but i would not budge and grip put his quivering tongue out and licked my cheek and besought me with a little speech of whine very well said my father being glad of an excuse for a milder course as his wrath went down and knowing that if he did this thing mr chumps would never look at him again which would cost him as much as l a year very well tommy if you like the brute you shall have him and i hope he will be grateful to you gristles here's half a crown for you and you need not tell your master what i said only that i seemed a little disappointed with the first appearance of the dog which is rather a good fault you know in a dog who has got to keep off strangers and my compliments and i begin to feel sure that grip will soon begin to grow upon us this prophecy was fulfilled right well so far as my mother and self were concerned and even my father grew fond of grip as soon as he found what a wonder he was but the dog while regarding him with deep respect could never forgive his own narrow escape any more than forget my timely aid for his memory was as tenacious as his teeth on me the dog fastened his strong heart at once with an attachment more than dogged making the best of whatever i did expecting no credit for his own good works humbly and heartily wagging his tail for the mere hope of a kind word or look and after a little while no one who knew him at least if he were any judge of a dog could consider him ugly from a proper point of view and without any personal feeling for his eye that had seemed to be gone came back so as nearly to agree with the other one yet working enough on its own account to redouble his power of expression while his tail being oiled and done up with bell wire returned to its natural tendency and as for his ear of a gingery yellow the colour was so rich that it wanted shading and gained it by having a division introduced so that on the whole he had succeeded without any serious damage to himself in impressing the main principle of the present age that of parental submission to the child now when i appeared at the partheneion under convoy of this gallant animal dr rumbelow scarcely knew what to do after looking at grip with some surprise he fired a strong volley of quotations at him but the dog moved never a tail point for them and instead of being frightened he would not even blink but gazed at them calmly as much as to say there is not a pinch of shot in the whole of them the doctor though one of the bravest of mankind could not return his gaze with equal largeness and frank placidity of criticism but shouted for mercury his page and bade him remember the glorious day whereon he slew the monster argus bob jackson failing to recall that date looked as if he would rather keep aloof from grip who opened his nostrils and curled up his lips and shot fire out of his discordant eyes good doggie good doggie poor fellow said the page in a tenderly condescending tone while approaching sideways gingerly if he is a very good doggie he shall have this beautiful collar to wear oh lor he was lying on his back with grip standing across him but scarcely thinking it worth while to bite him unless he should endeavour to make escape fetch me the big cane labelled no the doctor shouted valiantly the father of all canes the rhopalos which has warmed the back of a prime minister with that will i rescue my hermes though the hydra herself stand over him no sir no sir for god's sake don't go near him cried bill chumps running up the playground grip can beat any two men in the world because no blow can hurt him leave him to me sir i understand him and he knows me well enough though he never took to me somehow or other as his dear old father does he has taken wonderfully to fly tommy somebody come and give tommy a good whack of the many brave boys who had rejoiced in doing this even without instigation last week there was not one who would now discharge this duty for the public weal why should i hit him said boy after boy who said last week why shouldn't i i am a deal too fond of poor tommy for that hit him yourself if you want him hit so i will then you pack of dirty cowards answered chumps being put upon his mettle though he told me afterwards that he was in a horrid funk and he gave me at once a good sounding smack on a part of my body that was covered with material warranted to wear and having three stout seams with a piece to let out before the echo of the five's court ceased grip was between us looking up at me as if to ask what am i to do doubting in his mind whether justice would allow him to wage war against his late master's son worthy is he to be piled with praise not cumulari but qui cumuletur boys of the second form observe inasmuch as he has not doubted to encounter singly or in maniple all the foes of the pusill committed to his charge great is the manhood of this dog and yet it somewhat repenteth me that provoked by the wanton assaults of science upon the sweet retirement of the muses i have promised him the tub and the collar and the bowl of the deceased and perhaps now constellated animal heracles poikilostiktos mercury brush thy pulverulent petasus and with the aid of thy lyre or that of the ever ready minded chumps conduct this formidable animal to the many strewn couch prepared for him partheneionidae the hour has struck with grateful ardour let us hasten to the banquet of the mind provided for us by the generous wisdom of the men of old with these words our great master strode to the school room door and we his children and the fruit of his cane looked vainly for chance of escape from work then with as much of a sigh as childhood yet has learned from nature's book we followed the learned steps afar with two for one in length but only one for two in speed i ween chapter vi true science for some years now i had a quiet time increasing in knowledge very gradually but as fast as my teachers thought needful for the only true way to get on in learning is not to be in too much of a hurry counting every step and losing breath and panting into violence of perspiration but rather to take as the will of the lord whatever gets carried into us allowing it to settle and breed inside with the help of imagination under the steadfast care of grip and furtherance of dr rumbelow i advanced pretty fairly in fine acquirements which have proved once or twice to be serviceable to me and to all the school and indeed a considerable number of the houses around it was a sad and bitter day when william chumps esquire for that was his proper style now under stamp as he showed us of several letters was at last compelled to say farewell to the partheneion and the whole of us he had been elected to a scholarship founded for that purpose by his father at the partheneion to the amount of five shillings a week for three years as a tribute to humane letters and the many good contracts for meat mr chumps had performed and bill was to take it to oxford and perhaps when the chumps scholarship became talked about obtain some good orders to supply his college for a great deal of meat is consumed in hall tommy said bill the very day he was to leave when he saw me crying about his departure for he always had been so good to me keep up your spirits young fellow and don't blub the fault of your nature is being so soft now why am i going to the grandest old place and the finest young fellows on the face of the earth simply because i have got so much pluck i am not such a wonderfully clever cove though everybody seems to think so and i have plenty to learn yet i can assure you and of course i know well enough that i am going among big swells who have a right to be swells not snobs from the poultry and mincing lane such as used to try to snub me here but do you think i have a particle of funk feel the muscle in my arm tommy bill i replied you could knock them all down but when you had done it there would be fifty more tommy my boy i will not hurt one of them unless he endeavours to cock over me if it comes to any fighting at my time of life it must be done with pistols but my mind is made up not to meddle with any man unless he insults me and then let him look out they will very soon discover that i mean to be a gentleman although my father may be called a butcher and when they see that if they are gentlemen themselves they will be very glad to show me the way the great defect of your character tommy is that you have not got go enough i should think i have heard enough of that i said just because i don't want to fly to please you chaps that cock over me you are putting the cart before the horse replied chumps having taken already six lessons in logic from a man who came on purpose you have an extraordinary gift of flying which would make your fortune tommy and enable your father to leave off poisoning the public if only you would cultivate it i can do very good latin elegiacs and tidy greek iambics and run a mile in four minutes and three quarters but how many years might i hammer at all that and scarcely turn a sixpence but you you have only to put on your wings and astonish all the north of london if i had only got your turn for flying with my own for the classics and for going to the top i tell you what it is tommy upmore in ten years i'd be the prime minister of england my own opinion was that without any flying bill would arrive at the top of the tree in about five years which was a long time yet for any one to look forward to and thinking so much of him now and grieving so deeply for the loss of him i allowed his words to sink into my mind as they never had done before hitherto i had been inclined to think if ever i thought about it that my want of proper adhesion to the ground was a plague to me and no benefit my father treated it as a thing to laugh at and to disbelieve in my mother was afraid that i never might come down within her reach and the same as i went up while the rest of the world was content to take it entirely from a selfish point of view as a question of science or of low curiosity but before we could say any more about that old rum as we called him came into the hall where chumps was waiting with his boxes for his father's meat van to fetch them the doctor had already said farewell to bill before all the school and as a public essay but now he came to say good bye and to give him a few kind words with a friendly heart bill was as tall as his master now being an exceedingly strapping fellow and thoroughly thriven on the marrow of the ox but when the doctor took his hand and spoke to him in a low soft voice without any latin turn in it the cup of bill's feelings began to run over and i ran away not to look at it here in a passage as facts would have it with my eyes full of tears and shadow i ran into the arms or legs of a strong hard man hard in the matter of bones i mean and the absence of any fat about him but as soft and tender in heart and vein as anything he had ever dissected why tommy it is indeed our tommy exclaimed professor megalow prolepsis of our race what trouble is upon you oh sir cried i if you could only stop bill chumps from going away from us the place will be nothing after he is gone and nobody will want to stop here whatever you order is sure to be done well said the professor as he lifted me up and looked at me kindly with his large calm eyes i have come a long way to make that discovery and i wish it were so in great russell street he was thinking of his labours and forgetting a far more important matter in our eyes the two half holidays procured for us when he thought that we seemed to require them for now his vast knowledge and accuracy simplicity gentleness and playful humour had won the warm friendship of our dr rumbelow who seldom caned any of us now except for lying for my part i loved this kind gentleman and grieved that he had not once asked me to fly for him my friend you are often in my thoughts he said as if he knew all that was passing in my mind let us sit down a while in this quiet corner and consider a highly scientific case which happens to be in my pocket smiling at the fright his words had caused he drew forth a pretty little globular box yellow pellucid and inlaid with stars of gold and this he held so that the light of the sun glanced through it illuminating things inside that danced with colour purple and orange and rosy red i pulled out my handkerchief and dried my eyes and pushed back my curls for a hearty good stare tommy your mind is of a wholesome type said the great professor pleasantly brief should be the pangs of youthful woe and they are all good to eat tommy and as you suck them you can pull them out of your mouth and see the sun shine through and then put them back and find them ever so much sweeter oh but i can't get at them sir what good can they be if i can't get at them your reasoning is wonderfully sound and good from its own point of view he answered but get at them tommy and they shall be yours you shall have box and all if you open it this was very hard upon me for i had no more chance of opening it than of flying in the air as people say and indeed according to my gifts much less in vain i pulled and squeezed and pressed examined every part of it and then worked away again screwing up my lips and eyes so sternly that the professor could not help laughing and the worst of it was that the more i laboured the greater the temptation of the inside grew everything dancing with a play of colours glorious to see and feel that all was good to eat oh sir i can't i can't get at them do please to show me the way sir i cried for truly it was enough to make me cry my boy said the professor looking gravely at me and seeming to wink with one large clear eye though it was not a wink but rather the effect of a most sagacious and delightful nod i have long anticipated that result it is always agreeable to find one's prognosis confirmed by events though they often fail to do it no one has found out the secret of this box though very clever men have striven at it and among them three noted puzzle makers perfect simplicity is deeper than any depth of complexity tommy behold and with good will devour ha a practical rather than a theoretic mind perhaps he made that observation because without stopping to ask how the box came open i fell to at once upon its choice contents the flavour was altogether new to me and wonderfully fine and penetrating leaving no part of the mouth in idleness and warming the entire length of throat with hope at the same time these goodies had just enough about them of roughness to compel the tongue to stop and invite it to dwell upon their surface gently equably earnestly and with much delight refraining from speech while thus better employed ah said the professor and one ah of his contained all the fulness of three volumes tommy be just and consider them fairly they are made from my own design and stamped with cuneiform ah i see it now the young mind is plagued so with ancient tongues that the young tongue rejoices in demolishing their symbols by taking a patent for this design i might get on better than by building dragons but let us return to our point my good tommy as he spoke he was setting against one another the tips of his long middle fingers which i took for the point to be returned to and said yes sir if you please sir my young friend i take it that the point from which we have allowed our minds to be pleasantly diverted is whether you will allow me just to give you a lift in the air a very gentle lift not for any scientific view whatever but only for a little satisfaction to myself if from old experience of professors you have any misgiving say so tommy and i will not touch you oh sir said i with my mouth running over don't be afraid sir to lift me where you like at this good encouragement professor megalow nodded as if in pleasant commune with himself and then with one hand softly tossed me to his shoulder where i sate very nicely as on a spring cushion rather than a feather bed however then he handed me up the box which i put between my knees and began to sing according to my habit when contented with the world ah said the professor as he walked about having now and then a little whistle to himself and took me to look at a map of mountains placed at a mountainous height above my usual level of intelligence tommy this is very good this is quite delightful do you know why this is so delightful little tommy yes sir i replied for i was very clever then it is jolly because they are so capital to suck not only that tommy although i am perfectly open to conviction upon that point here he opened his mouth and i popped a goody in as if he were the boy and i the celebrated man but also because my most generous young friend it confirms my opinion or in finer words my theory most of us as we get older and older grow more and more interested in ourselves possibly you are too young small tommy to have any desire as yet to hear an empirical rather than a scientific opinion about your peculiar but not altogether unparalleled case if you please sir to say anything you like and i won't be afraid and i won't tell my mother unless you are sure that you would not be afraid and if you talk as plainly as you did just now i will try to make out what the meaning is professor megalow put me down with a gentle clap on my back as if he had found me one too much for him and then with a jerk of his prominent chin and a rub of his nose he considered me and while he was doing all this such a smile of large good will illumined us that i would have been glad to be dissected if it would please him and not hurt much the only thing that saddened me was this he did not appear to be at all astonished by anything discovered in me and i now called to mind that he never had shown any special excitement about my case as all the other scientific men had done and my mother had said that he could not be half so clever as his reputation was because of his letting me alone so though perhaps he was paid by the year for his work and the others by the job which would account for everything that may have been so and i thought about it now and concluded from brief observation of his hat that he only got his money at the end of the year the difference said the professor calmly with a glance of affection at his large skulled hat which was rolling on the floor without taking any harm according to my very humble opinion is not so much of kind as of degree my tommy it has long been well known that the various families of the human race as we may venture still to call it differ very greatly in specific gravity the celt for instance is especially heavy in proportion to his size and the jute the opposite there was i believe an exceptionally light and buoyant race in north america aboriginal so far as we know and the lightest member of that race tommy would probably have despised your highest flight at the same time and although i have met with a case of almost equal levity the example being i regret to say feminine you must not imagine that i am endeavouring to disparage your exploits my dear tommy don't cry my dear child i had no idea that you were so sensitive upon this matter your admirable master has always told me that your main desire is to stop upon the ground and that both your parents wish it you nod your head as if i understood your feelings then why are your blue eyes full of tears if you please sir i wasn't at all longing to go up only i didn't know anybody else had done it and i shan't care to go up any more after that well cried the professor with his great rich smile human nature has no exceptions half so wonderful as its laws are my good little friend allow me to comfort you and to restore your self respect it is not by any means a common thing for members of the english race to fly excuse me for using the popular but incorrect word to describe your exploits but there is a power that beats you tommy in your own province and that is time at three o'clock i have a lecture to deliver upon your antitype the apteryx a bird that has abdicated the rights which some of us desire to usurp oh sir do let me come and hear it if old rum will let me go bill chumps has heard you lecture and he says i thank him heartily for his approval replied the professor at the same time showing me his watch which ticked with a bullet upon cat gut william chumps is a fine young man with a great spirit in a strong body and i would ask your kind master to let you come if i thought the subject good for you but my dear little fellow i am sure that it is not so the less your mind runs upon the regions of the air and the more you endeavour to bring your body by good feeding exercise pleasant sports and moderate labours to the normal specific gravity the better it will be for yourself and your parents whose only child you are and i venture to differ from my learned brethren professors brachipod and jargoon chocolous and mullicles in thinking that it will be no worse for the interests of science good bye tommy you may keep the box as a souvenir of this long interview be sure that you eat all you can of good meat solid bread and glutinous material and don't swallow too much latin and greek which tend to undue elation if you were a lazy boy i should not tell you this but i hear that you are an ambitious boy and eager to learn everything i shall observe you my interesting friend and from time to time hint to your learned master any trifle that escapes the unmedical mind he lifted me up and kissed my forehead and as i picked up his hat a trifle which had escaped his universal mind and by jumping on a chair clapped it on his mighty head i could not help paying him the usual tribute paid at his departure glistening eyes that is to say and a smile of loving wonder chapter vii the great washed my father bucephalus upmore had been at the time of my birth a radical and owed his conversion from loose ideas to no amount of argument or even of wider observation but to a little accident upon his return one winter night from a meeting in st pancras not only of a liberal but a wildly generous character somebody tripped him up and stole his watch and purse and sunday hat a small man might have accepted this as a lesson against subversive views and a smaller one as a confirmation of them but my father was not of that sort his practice was to take his stand upon what he considered right and allow no evidence to move him one hair's breadth from the true conclusions poured into him and he never read anything that did not cap and sawder down his own contents this had made his life thus far most happy enabling him to despise all people who differed in any way from him as well as to enlarge himself without any compulsion to pay for it and he might have gone on in this easy way calling upon the people behind him to rob the people in front of him if he had not undergone the bad luck to be robbed himself when he came to speak of this among his friends not one of them failed to express deep sorrow and to assure him that such things must happen whenever the conservatives were in office at the same time they intimated gently that when he made so much money out of working men it served him right to lose some of it his feelings were hurt by this sometimes especially when the suggestion came from gentlemen who had attained that degree by adulterating the victuals of the working man however he smothered his common sense as the first duty is of liberals till his body and mind came thump upon a stumbling block and no mistake arising in a vast hall of reform to second a motion that all men are equal and must have the same money for their work whether they do it or leave it undone and must not do more than six hours in a day for fear of imparting infection to the rest with his mouth full of reason and his heart full of hope that none of his men might be there to hear him my dear father gave a stamp and found it fall upon something soft and dull he felt himself more at home through this having so much soft stuff round his vats and his eloquence mounted to full swell till he wanted to jump to give emphasis this he attempted to do with a clap of his hands to complete a grand sentence when up came something between his legs and got stuck on the top of his highlows with laudable agility my father stooped while the audience cheered lustily supposing him to be in quest of some word big enough to express his sentiments these however demanded outlet in a very short one when he found in his hand his own lost hat with a hole in the brim from the stamp of his heel and the crown chock full of heads for speech and demolitionist statistics he examined his hat and descried b u just in under the tuck of the lining where a liberal always puts his mark on the vote by ballot principle this alone was enough to shake his confidence in his party though all the gentlemen around him looked quite incapable of doing anything and he might as he said to my mother have believed that his old hat had come down from heaven if only his new hat bought last friday had been left for him to go home with that however was not the case his new hat managed to leave that great assembly upon the head of some eminent liberal and my father went home with his old hat on greasy and dirty and showing signs of conflict but containing a head that would be radical no more now i need not have told that little story which repeats itself among such people more often than it is repeated except to explain what it was that took us in the summer holidays to a place called happystowe on sea it appears that my father was by no means satisfied so to lose his hats though in truth it was no great grievance thus to save the contents at the cost of the case and like a thorough briton as he always was he determined not to get the worst of it several opportunities for reprisal had been allowed to escape him when soon after bill chumps went to oxford there came among us and excited our principles a contested election for marylebone by means of their noble organization the liberals knew from the outset that the battle of freedom was sure to be won or as our people put it rank bribery and corruption truckling and swilling would defeat the right nevertheless a just hope was entertained on both sides of a very lively contest and a fair occasion without legal intervention for sounding the capacity of an adversary's head my father was flying a big blue flag which we could see from the partheneion with church and state for ever on it and mr john windsor and chumps esquire as we called the great butcher in respect of his son and the best end of the scrag all had the same and only a man who knocked horses on the head durst hang out the red rag up our lane i speak of this only as a circumstance to prove that our neighbourhood was constitutional and that the radical element however respectable it might have been when kept at home had no right whatever to come invading us and desiring to trample on our principles they knew that for nearly three hundred and fifty yards the inhabitants were all true blue beginning with the indigo factory on the south and going all through the ash heaps and ending with my father but in the wantonness of triumph when their majority was posted up though our side claimed in front these demi cats as bill had sent us word from oxford to entitle them and so we did must needs assemble at king's cross in their thousands and resolve to storm every blue house in maiden lane the beginning of their enterprise was most glorious nothing could stand before them they broke all the glass that had a blue flag near it and they knocked down every man who had got blue eyes the premises of mr chumps were sacked his legs of mutton walked off as if they were alive and his salt beef was stuck on poles even bigger than the skewers he weighed it out with every drop in the cellars of the conservative hotel ran uphill inside a big radical and mr john windsor lost soap enough pretty nearly to clean half the liberals however he contrived to get over a back wall together with his wife and daughter polly jack was luckily at the partheneion and the other four gone to see their aunt with old fangs to protect them from the liberals and by taking an in and out way through the cinders the three arrived safely at our back door without breath enough to blow out one of their own dips till now my father had scarcely struck a blow on behalf of the constitution beyond giving his vote and knocking down a man who was anxious to do the like to him but now it did seem a bit too hard that the liberals should extinguish thus all liberty of opinion john he said now as he brought in the fugitives and heard a tremendous noise coming up the lane this is what i call coming it too strong mrs windsor ma'am you are all of a tremble sophy get whiskey and water at once bubbly poor mr windsor gasped this is most kind and cordial of you my dear you require a stimulant however much you dislike it but upmore down with your flag at once down with your flag that the fellows may go by oh yes mr upmore implored mrs windsor a lady of a most superior kind please not to lose a moment in hauling down your flag it is flying in the face of providence do cut the ropes if it won't untie will i said my father and his face took on as my mother said afterwards a very fine expression lower my flag to the scum of the earth ladies go down to the cellar and keep quiet you will have no one here while my flag is flying mr windsor is a man of high spirit as he has proved many times in our debates he and i will go to the boiling house and defend the true blue come what will my mother declares that mr windsor was going at his best pace to the cellar stairs when she locked him out and pulled out the key but mother was always severe upon him because of his wholesale ways and talk at any rate he did not flag or fly although he may have longed to do so perhaps now john said my father as he took his arm to confirm his courage which required it and led him down the red tiled passage to the boiling house you have had a great many good laughs at my little steam engine haven't you very well we'll try it on the 'great unwashed' if there happens to be a bit of fire left my men are all away the same as yours or else these fellows would not come to sack us i gave them the quarter day to vote the same as you did with yours and mine are gone the right colour to a man i do believe but i happened to say 'leave a little steam on' and i can get up a great deal in ten minutes and the blackguards won't be here for twenty they've got three blue houses yet to wreck and my double gates will keep them out at least five minutes i see i see what you mean to do what a glorious fellow you are bubbly i'll go half the waste of phleg then go and see that all the bolts are right while i get up steam and have the double hose ready these two gallant and sturdy boilers very soon had the front and back gates barred and bolted and strengthened with struts against the styles so that all the men who could get at them must take at least five minutes to get through them and meanwhile the furnace of the little engine was beginning to roar and the steam to puff capital i call this first rate stoking exclaimed my father as he stopped to breathe now you understand the hose john it is only three inch pipe and therefore as handy as a walking stick you put your nozzle upon that trestle commanding the back doors while i keep ready for the time they have broken the front gate down we have got a big vat of hot stuff to draw from but i don't think they'll want half of it bubbly i don't seem to understand it said mr windsor who was slow headed and losing his presence of mind perhaps although he had got his coat off from working so hard while he was fat and with terrible liberal screeches already arising in the air above the rattle of the gates suppose my dear friend that we killed some fellow no hope of that said my father being now in a rancorous and determined frame i am afraid that the temperature won't be above deg if so much and it cools in passing through the air too fast it will only make their eyes sharp and their faces clean as they should be on a holiday no white feather john windsor now ah they've fetched the blacksmith as i knew they would think of your wife and children john and of the british constitution things must be come to a very pretty pass if a man mayn't syringe a born jackass especially when the jackass kicks his gate in in for a penny then in for a pound his brother boiler answered with his courage up whatever you order shall be done friend bubbly this vat shall run away before i do i'll go bail for the front gate johnny if you'll be ready for the rear attack supposing they've the cheek to try one this engine works a double hose you see on the principle of a well coil now my fine fellows what do you want here the blacksmith though working against his will for my father always paid him ready money had prized one heavy gate off its hinges and the other was swagging to fall with it we wants you guv'nor and your scurvy flag cried the leader of the mob a chimney sweep b'iler b'iler we wants the tory b'iler cried a hundred dirty fellows as the gates crashed in well and you shall have him said my father who was standing just outside the slow house door with the nozzle of the hose tucked under his arm and a rod in his right hand to put the pressure on if you come a yard further you shall taste the boiler only let blacksmith grimes get out of the way i don't wish to boil a respectable neighbour and i don't want to boil you unless you insist on it not only grimes but a great many others would have liked to get out of the way at this but the bulk of the tumult behind shoved on and the heads that were fain to hang back got jammed up in front against the smash and then shot over father just waited till the chimney sweep a termagant of the highest rank was hurra ing and waving a soot brush and then he let go hot candles at them in a long white column flew the scalding fluid spreading like a sheaf when it met their faces and coating every man of them with poisonous gray froth no man could swear for his mouth was bunged up and no man could strike for his arms were stuck to him with a weight of deposit like a stalactite good stearine it was of the value of at least three halfpence a pound in the unrefined state and it went inside their shirts and stung like hornets and settled into every cracked place of the skin and made a man tight in his linings and to add to their grief such a steam arose among them not to mention something else beginning with same letters that the slits of any eyes that were left half open were as useless as in a thick london fog there's a deal more to come said my father calmly noble reformers stand shoulder to shoulder as one of your writers has beautifully said the deeper we go the more strength we get the issue is told in a ballad written that same night at the best end of the scrag which though inspired by liberal ale for the scrag had not a drop left of its own and was obliged to send across the road for it is a poem of high merit and my father was told upon the best authority that the poet from first to last received nearly fifteen shillings for it our house subscribed for sixpence worth and so did mr windsor and all the boys of the lower order up to grotto day were singing no matter what their politics might be and wrapping their bulls' eyes up in the lay of the soporific soap boilers the radicals bore this satire well having had their own way in everything and laughed on the right side of their mouths and even the men who had been cased in grease made a good thing of it when they scraped themselves by going to the rag and bone shops yet as bad luck would have it the leading mind among them that of mr joe cowl the master sweep was not content and broke out into a summons at the clerkenwell police court for mr cowl meeting all the first of the discharges before the stearine was well up in the hose was a loser instead of a receiver of deposit all the soot on his body was clean washed off and nothing being left to fill the pores the abnormal exposure of his system led to a pungent pervasive and radical catarrh mrs cowl sent for a doctor but her husband joe had still enough vitality to kick him out and then jumping from the frying pan into the fire shouted loudly for a lawyer and he recommended law chapter viii for change of air but said my father to mr john windsor who was urging him to leave home for a while that joe cowl's anger might blow over people pretend not to understand it john but you know as well as i do what it is how could i ever live for a fortnight at a stretch or even three weeks as might be needful without a breath of the air of the works john when i was obliged to spend a week in parree replied mr windsor who as mrs windsor said had acclimatised himself uncommon quick to the french style and their accent i thought i should have died for a day or two from the downright emptiness of the air but my dear fellow i found out some places where the air was as nourishing every bit as it is at our works on an over time day bubbly i contrived to bilk the doctor by going twice a day to a place with a hole in it over some large cookery vapours and you must contrive to find a place like that i'll tell you what go away to the seaside at the seaside now they are always making smells so they are i am sure said mrs windsor who was come to join in the attack on father the last time i was at brighton my dear with all the poor children how i envied you dwelling as the poet so graphically describes it in the sweet fragrancy of home mr upmore the air is never empty at any fashionable seaside place and for the sake of your dear wife and your wonderfully interesting boy who is a dear friend of my clever johnny's you cannot with any consistency whatever refuse to respond to the call of duty for duty it is and should be looked at in that light without a second thought of paltry money she has the gift of eloquence declared her husband and sometimes i almost wish she hadn't it comes to her from her mother's side whose mother was a celebrated baptist preacher and when it is upon her she has no consideration of other people's money and not so very much of mine but you must not take the whole of this for high talk bubbly to make yourself scarce just now will fetch you a pound for every penny you have to spend an old friend of mine is well up the back stairs and although he could never do a stroke for me for some reason which he explains much better than i can understand it he whispered to me last night 'keep in with the gentleman who boils higher up the lane than you do his fortune is made if he keeps quiet and the present government remains in office he will have more jobs than he can do and he must call you in to help him' i thought i had better tell you bubbly because we have always been straight forward and if you are pulled up in the police court why you might have to wait months before you got a contract my father stood up for nothing could be more illustrative of true friendship more incentive to patriotism and more ennobling to the human race than this announcement from his brother boiler he had passed through a good deal of emotion lately having been not only toasted largely wherever he appeared with his purse in his pocket and visited with post cards more than once from people whose names were in the papers but even invited to a hot dinner which he took care to go to at the mansion house for that lord mayor was not one of those who desire to have no successor john windsor we have always been straight forward there has never been the shadow of a doubt between us our friendship has never known a cloud upon it i was home for the holidays now and these words of my father's made me stare a little you know what i am john a humble briton who thinks for himself and sticks to it business is business politics come in the evening to smoke a pipe with when i was a rad i may have thought of making something out of it but i only made a loss of two good hats hear hear interrupted mr windsor and now by repulse of the rads you have gained three hundred hats the poet says stuff cried my father there were not thirty and shocking bad hats all of them you are welcome to your share if you will take your half of this confounded summons windsor gentlemen come said mrs windsor if you once begin with politics the point is to settle where to go to and i think mrs upmore should have a voice in that what coast do you prefer my dear my views are of very little moment mother answered quietly as she came in with a bottle of cherry brandy in her hand bucephalus is so bigoted but i love to see the sun rise over the sea from the window and then go to bed again your taste ma'am is of the very highest order said mr windsor who never could persuade his wife to turn her hand to pickles and bottled fruit and gravies and many a time have i enjoyed the fine results that comes of it to see the sun rise over the sea and the poor fellows shaking about in their boats and then to go to bed again while they are catching fish enough for your breakfast prawns and lobsters and a sole with egg and breadcrumbs and perhaps if they are lucky just a salmon collop ah that is what i call seaside and then you lounge about and see fine ladies jumping up and down as the white waves knock them and then you have a pipe and smell fine smells and talk to an old salt as if you were his captain and he shows you through his spy glass how rough it is outside with the people in the vessels looking enviously at you and by that time bubbly why you want your dinner and you eat it as if you was made for nothing else i don't remember much about it answered father though evidently struck by this description why it must be thirty years since i saw the sea ah how we go up and down in life i dare say i was no bigger than that little shrimp there mr upmore exclaimed mrs windsor whose manner we were told was more aristocratic than anything on our side of king's cross mr upmore with all your opportunities is it possible that you have not ever felt it your very first duty to take your dear wife and your tommy to the sea whatever should we do without the sea a great part of our commerce comes over it and my johnny can very nearly swim dear mrs upmore you should not lose a minute in taking your darling boy to the sea it seems to be considered so essential now that all young persons should be taught to swim my tommy can fly ma'am replied dear mother and what is swimming to compare with that i'll tell you what said mr windsor if you want to see the sun rise over the sea the best chance for it is on the east coast i'm very partial to brighton myself not being so exclusive as mrs w about a little smell here or a sort of odour there that feeling of the higher orders seems to be cutaneous spontaneous you mean mr windsor or perhaps contagious or indigenous i mean what i say my dear and what i say is this to the best of my knowledge the sun don't get up out of the sea at brighton though he does come over it in fine weather by the time the upper classes are looking about but i won't pretend to speak positive because i never got up to look for him only this i do say and it stands to reason if you want to compel him to get up there you had better go where the sea runs east to be sure i see my father answered i am not sure that i should have thought of that john you are a clever fellow after all i should hope that he was cried mrs windsor because you have made yourself famous mr upmore with my husband to stand in front of you are you going to begin to look down upon us don't be so hot my dear i assure you bubbly that she means it for the moment but it goes in two seconds like a spurt of steam now i happen to know a very nice little place on the east coast norfolk or suffolk i believe for i never can carry all the counties in my head happystowe on sea is the name of it none of your blessed sewers there i know a man who boils there twice a week he would let you in as a visitor of course and you would get the nourishment of his air barlow his name is billy barlow a rising man in compos and cocoa he has found a way to make one out of the other and both of them out of old shoes i believe and i thought of running down to him to get a wrinkle but mrs w seemed to think there was something infra dig in it we cannot be too particular in my humble opinion said mrs windsor not only not to admit any shadow of fraud into our own transactions but in no way to countenance any one tainted with secrets however lucrative that is the true way of looking at things all on the square ma'am and all above board and nothing else answers in the long run does it however continued my father if i should by any chance be down that way i might like to look in at barlow's works without letting him know who i was of course i should understand all his devices at a glance he would know me in a moment if i went down mr windsor was trying not to wink at father but he never would guess that you were in the trade if you wear your blue coat and brass buttons the one that makes the boys call you 'the admiral' and by the sea side that would be the proper thing only fair play bubbly and honour bright snacks as our jack says in whatever you find out pooh cried father after all our experience what could a country bumpkin teach us ah mrs windsor what things we could tell you if ladies' nerves were stronger but john i've a great mind to take your advice and encourage the policy of our noble government in doing me a good turn as early as they can we will get away before those unprincipled rads can serve their skulking summons that joe cowl means to get up to morrow after shamming to be dead for a fortnight a conservative sweep would have cured his cold by stopping up a chimney and on friday he goes for his summons i hear the beak is a rad and will let him have it i shall trust you to keep it all dark about us and mum's the address of our luggage and letters but friday will find all the upmore family stowed away happy at happystowe my father was ever a man of his word he made his arrangements for half time boiling and the completion of all contracts and left money enough for a fortnight's work and then we set off in the soap van with old jerry in the shafts and a hamper of good things and our best clothes on and grip sitting up in front and the tilt hanging down as if by accident over the third hoop from the back so that nobody could tell that we had got a bit of luggage and we jogged along up the lane first towards hampstead so that all the neighbours thought we were going for a pic nic as indeed we thoroughly deserved to do and they wished us a pleasant day and no rain for they all had a kindly will to us but as soon as we had thanked them and got them out of sight what did father do but turn old jerry and take the shortest cut to shoreditch at that time london was not such a thorough rat warren of railways as it is now and although i had travelled by steam before it was new enough to be delightful we were going by a line which was then considered the most dangerous in great britain and this made my mother put her head out of the window in her anxiety about me and father whenever there was anything at all to see we wanted to look out for ourselves but she declared that she understood things best and there was no chance of getting at the other window because four people put a cloth along their knees and went on eating for leagues and hours so my father went to sleep and i tried to get peeps behind dear mother's bonnet of the far world flying by with all my heart i longed to see the sea of which i had heard so many things wonderful terrible and enchanting my mother had bought me a straw hat with a blue ribbon on it like a gallant sailor's and she should have endeavoured after that to show me the sea if it ever came in sight but nothing that i could say though i never stopped bothering as she called it would keep her attention to that point and i found out afterwards the reason for it she was not at all sure about knowing the sea when she saw it and was afraid of making some mistake what do i care about the sea said father rather grumpily when i pestered him people call it the sea because you can't see it or if you do you can't see anything else i would much rather have a good london fog go to sleep boy and don't keep jerking at my legs so my father had been out of sorts for some time which had made it desirable that he should come away even without any summons against him his appetite was queer and he wanted setting up before mr windsor came urging him so i heard him say to mother a leg of mutton goes twice with me now and i call that a very serious sign then be more free handed with your money answered mother and now he was touchy because poor grip though accustomed to living in a tub at school was aggrieved at the box which the company provided for dogs on their travels and expressed his grief in a howl that out howled the engine his chest was capacious and his lungs elastic his heart also of the finest order and for these gifts of nature my father condemned him now rouse up rouse up everybody father shouted as if we had all been asleep which he alone had been in spite of grip when the bus from the happystowe road which was five or six miles from the genuine happystowe pulled up in a ring of newly planted trees and in front of a porch with square pillars to it tommy look sharp and count all our boxes in put them down in latin if it comes more easy sophy accept my arm up the steps never pretend to be younger than you are mrs roaker we are come to spend a week with you if agreeable and not too expensive mr upmore said mother in a tone of quiet dignity such as she had heard mrs windsor use as if a few pounds made any difference to you we are out for the holidays and we mean to have them then the thing to begin with is a rattling good dinner father answered without any dignity at all bless my something the dinner goes into mrs roaker if it isn't going on for seven o'clock and nothing all the way but hard boiled eggs and a cold duck and ham sandwiches i never was so hungry in all my life starving is the proper word for it what can we have for dinner ma'am and what is the shortest time for it anything you please to name sir said the landlady who understood things and the time will naturally depend upon the nature of the plats you order no foreign kickshaws and no french plates for me ma'am a pair of fried soles and a bit of roast mutton hot from the fire and a cold apple pie sophy can you think of anything else you want can we have a bedroom with a fine sea view my mother had been pensive all day and religious because of leaving home and of the dangers of the train we have not seen the sea yet mrs roaker to our certain knowledge you must not suppose us to be any sort of cockneys and indeed we live quite outside of london in a beautiful place with green fields round it still we are what you may call inlanders and we feel a kind of interest in the sea sophy you had better order dinner after that said my father very shortly now tommy you be off i am not going out till i've had my dinner but i can't stand any more of your plague about the sea find somebody to show you where it is or you ought to find it out by the row it makes i hear a noise now like an engine with the steam slack but don't tumble into it when you find it though you never were born to be drowned that i'll swear without any answer to this cut at me which i did not deserve as old rum could have told him i whistled for grip who was looking about after running all the way from the station for any dog anxious to insult him and as soon as he came and made a jump at me we set off together without more ado to find out where the sea was by the noise it made of which i was beginning now to read in homer chapter ix thalatta it was five years now since i had first gone up without any intention of doing so from the surface of the earth into the regions of the air through the sudden expansion of my heart and system at the thought of three days' holiday in the interval there had been times of elation and elevation when it was difficult for me to keep down and the mere shake of an elbow would have sent me up and among them i recollect one christmas eve when there was a hard frost on and the people at the hampstead ponds were skating and the ice was all green for boys to slide on and the trees on the hill were all feathered with snow and jack windsor came up to me and said plum pudding for dinner at your house tommy i smelled it as i came up the lane i was all on the flutter to fly and astonish the people who were putting skates on and i could not have helped it for there was nothing to lay hold of if grip who was full of my bodily welfare had not laid hold of me by the tails of the scarlet comforter which mother had knotted so tightly that i could not get it off get away you vile dog go up tommy jack windsor cried and would gladly have kicked grip if prudence had permitted it oh tommy do go up i have heard so much about it and i'd give anything to see you fly for my part i was not at all afraid my feet were off the ground and there is very little doubt that i should have escaped from the comforter and grip if jack had not made such a stupid fuss about it halloa there what are you boys doing a heavy policeman came grumbling along without any sense of the situation if you don't move on and take that beast of a dog further i'll walk you pretty quick to the station v answered jack who inherited his mother's lofty style if you knew who we are you'd employ your cheek to keep your tongue in and save me the trouble of reporting you the constable pretended not to hear him but the whole of my volatile power was gone so sensitive has it always been and instead of going up to the sky i was glad to sit down upon the broad back of the faithful dog and now i can assure you and you will readily believe it that having been plagued so long by boys and grown up people quite as troublesome at times concerning what had happened to me at an early age and being rebuked and jeered and scoffed at sometimes for having this gift and sometimes for not making more of it and sometimes for setting up a false claim to it young as i was i had thought a good deal and made up my mind in fifty different ways about it but though my conclusions perpetually varied there was one grain of wisdom to be found in all it had pleased heaven to afflict me with an unusually light corporeal part and then to relieve that affliction in some measure by the gift of a buoyant and complacent mind so that i was able unless a bad cold or measles or mumps or chilblains stopped me to be hopeful that all would turn out for the best and to keep my nature boyish throughout a boyhood of some perplexity grip though faithful and sage as almost all the patriarchs put together might still be considered a juvenile dog by those who dwell chiefly on the right side of things to say that his heart was still in the right place would be little less than an insult to him and to the great race of which he was one but it is not so wholly a matter of course that his mind was still ardent and his spirit lofty very few scientists of any candour could have looked at grip when prepared for battle with his ears pricked up and his neck on the rasp and his tail set with stiffening bulges without finding a nobler result of evolution and a likelier survival than their own his thankful spirit had not yet exhausted the joys of freedom from the railway box and perhaps though it is not for me to say it the happystowe air was more mercurial than that of our works which confined his meditations too persistently to one theme bone but let that pass it is quite impossible to explain everything that happens all i know is that grip set off from the porch of the twentifold arms hotel with a flourish and a scurry and a gambol of delight with a gentle breeze moving behind me i started to catch him and get the first sight of the sea and then down a steep path we came round the corner of what must have been a live rock and behold behold was a word you might have shouted at me like thunder without my knowing it because my whole nature was absorbed in beholding or gazing or staring or mooning or being bemooned for the things were done to me without my doing any one of them behind me shone the low summer sun throwing out my shadow any length it pleased on an endless measureless countless unimaginable world of silver like the moon come down if i could have uttered any syllable to let off or thought of any definite idea to keep in the wondrous inconceivable expansion of my nature perhaps even now i might have stayed upon the ground but being as i was away i went starting at a height of about ten feet above the level of spring tides with a moderate westerly breeze behind me and the light of the sinking sun coming up under the soles of my shoes as i slowly went round and unluckily i had all my best clothes on new from a shop down in liverpool street the first sunday of the summer holidays people who have never been up like this might suppose at first sight that i was terrified especially at being carried out to sea as my first acquaintance with that great space but without laying claim to any share of courage i may state as a simple matter of fact that i happened to feel no fear whatever my father as truthful a man as ever lived and from whom i inherit that quality had said that i never was born to be drowned and if i thought at all which i disremember doing that alone would have reassured me at any rate i looked around as calmly as if i were sitting down to dinner but with this disadvantage that i could not keep my gaze very firmly fixed upon anything because of the rotation of my body for instance i was able to shout down to grip who was howling most mournfully in the gap and making sad jumps to come after me that i was all right and would come back by and by but before i could judge whether he was consoled my eyes were on a ship a long way out if there had been much wind perhaps it would have proved a ticklish thing for me but the air was calm and full of yellow light the sea was below me like a floor of silver the sky of a pure soft blue wherever the sun did not interfere with it and nothing on any side suggested danger or uneasiness but whatever the state of things may be the human element is certain to rush in and spoil all the comfort of nature i had not been at all disconcerted at perceiving that some people on the beach were surprised by my appearance at a considerable height above their heads they were calling out loudly to one another and running together or running away and rubbing their eyes as if the sun had taken the accuracy out of them this rather pleased me and improved my flight which depends very much upon the approval of mankind and i was beginning to practise movements which i had thought of and heard of from jack windsor jack had been taking swimming lessons and being a wonderfully heavy fellow had tried very hard to keep his head up he had learned the whole theory of it beautifully and showed me how easy it was to do but as yet he had never been able to do it whatever i have done above the surface of the earth which people are stupid enough to call flying is nothing more than swimming in the air or floating or best of all perhaps i should say treading as people who are heavy enough tread water and my great desire was to be my own master to steer myself a little as a man can do in swimming instead of going round and round at the air's discretion like a bunch of lime berries in september but just as i was learning with my hands and feet and some guidance of the silken summer tunic at my hips what did i discover but a great long gun taken up by a man from a boat upon the beach and then being pointed with a careful aim at me i endeavoured to scream out i am tommy only tommy upmore going for a fly if you shoot me you will be hanged for murder but i give you my word that my fright was so great that no sound of any use would come out of my mouth old rum's cane was quite a joke compared to this every atom of my levity turned to lead my hands fell to my sides and my feet struck together and i dropped like a well bucket when the rope is broken and i never had a luckier drop in my life good as it is for all mortals to come down for just above my hair which had been floating like a sunset cloud they say but was now standing out like a badger's with alarm a heavy charge of duck shot that would have killed grip dead went whistling like a goods' train engine and a streak of white still may be discovered in my head from the combination of fear and fact and my drop was quite as lucky at the lower end for descending as you might say without exaggeration almost vertically though my head the lightest portion of my system still was up instead of falling into the sea i was received in a sail spread to catch me by a very lovely boat some moments elapsed as i have reason to believe before either my rescuers or myself were fit to go into all the questions that arose naturally enough they were surprised at the style of my visit to them while i was not only embarrassed by shyness at finding myself among great people but also to some extent confused in mind from the many gyrations of my upward and the rapid descent of my downward course moreover i had never been in a boat till now and the motion of the boards upon the water disconcerted me more than any action of the air but while i was balancing myself like this after stepping from the sail that was spread for me a beautiful lady who had been sitting on a fur and looking at me with surprise and interest arose and came towards me with some little doubt enlarging the brightness of her large bright eyes why you are a boy a boy she cried as if nature ought to have made me a girl and as pretty a boy as i ever beheld from the way you went round and the height it was up i thought it must be a machine at least one of those wonderful things they invent to do almost anything nowadays whatever you are you can speak i am sure and i am not going to be afraid of you where do you come from and what is your name and how long have you been up in the air like that and have you got any father and mother and how did you get such most wonderful hair like spun silk every bit of it and and why don't you answer me if you please ma'am i said looking up at her with wonder for i never had seen such a beautiful being although i had been to a play several times i was trying to think what question you would please to like me to begin with answering i'm afraid that i cannot remember them all because of my head going round so but my name is 'tommy upmore' and i come from maiden lane st pancras st pancras why that is in london surely did you come in a balloon or how can you have done it sit down and rest i am sure you must be tired though you look like a rose master tommy upmore i answered the beautiful lady as soon as presence of mind permitted that i had not come the whole way from london through the sky as she seemed to suppose but only from yonder place on the shore where i showed her grip still howling now and then and striving with all his eyes and heart to make sure what was become of me she replied that even so it was in her opinion wonderful and she doubted if she could have been brought to believe it unless she had seen it with her own eyes i told her that several most eminent men of science saw nothing surprising in it but accounted for it easily in various ways without any two having to use the same way meanwhile she was begging me not to be afraid herself having now overcome all fear and she signed to the boatmen who had fallen back with their frank faces wrinkled as a puzzle is that they might come forward and be kind to me it was not in their power to do this because they had not yet finished staring therefore she offered me her own white hand and i wished that i had washed mine lately these are my children she said as i followed her down the planks without a word it was laura who saw you first up in the air and roly who ordered the men to row over when that wicked young man put his gun up we thought it was some new kind of bird and so you are a boy bird roly and laura let me introduce you to this young gentleman there is nothing about him to be afraid of although he has come down from the clouds or rather from the clear sky this beautiful evening he declares that he can be scientifically explained and when that can be done there is nothing more to say roly has never known what fear is ever since he cut his teeth from all i have seen of this gentleman since then and i have seen a great deal of him for twenty years and never can see too much of him i can fully confirm what his dear mother said just then he was a boy of about my age or a year or two older he might be but pounds and tens and twenty pounds heavier and an inch or two taller and many shades darker i was as fair in complexion before a great mob of troubles came darkening me as if i had sprung from a boiling of pontic wax besprinkled with roses of cashmere but roly or to give him his full deserts sir roland towers twentifold was a dark and thoughtful and determined lad who meant to make his mark upon our history and is doing it he came up and took my hand as if he would squeeze any cloudiness out of me and nothing but the pinches i had often had at school enabled me to bear it without a squeak he had been at the helm as they call it to direct the boat the right way to catch me and although he was greatly surprised he concluded as all englishmen do upon such occasions that the time to explain things would ensue after they had been dealt with chapter x the new admiral to me who am accustomed to myself it has always seemed much more wonderful that my father should deny my peculiar powers than that i should possess them go up tommy he has said a thousand times don't be so shy about it but up with you the proof of the pudding is in the eating only fly up to the bedroom window sill as that little sparrow from the road has done and i'll own that i'm a fool and you a wonder but until you have done it in my sight my son i shall stick to my old experience that all the human race are liars but not one of them a flyer his strong opinion proved itself as the manner of strong opinions is and instead of being able to arise while he was waiting with his hands in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth i was more inclined to go into the ground whenever it happened to be soft and so even now when some fifty people had seen me in the air and were ready to make oath to a great deal more than i had done father stuck to it that they all were liars or fools or crazy or else tipsy at the least but he scarcely knew what to say at first when just as he was going to sit down to dinner a mighty great noise arose under the window of sailors hurraing and the brass band roaring and grip as loud as any of them barking at his utmost d n it said my father to my mother is this the quiet place john windsor spoke of when a man can't even sit down to his dinner dinner indeed don't think twice of your dinner cried mother from the window in great excitement here is a thing that you never saw before and will never see again if you live to be a hundred our tommy in a flag and all the sailors in the kingdom taking off their hats and cheering him and the dear little poppet as modest as ever exactly like an angel and a beautiful lady you can see by the look that all the place belongs to her you can tell at a glance who she is of course bucephalus how slow you are slow for not knowing at a glance a female i never saw or heard of in all my life and in a strange place i was never in before how should i know her from adam or at least eve bucephalus why of course she must be lady towers twentifold widow of the late and sincerely lamented sir robert towers twentifold who died after tortures surpassing description from swallowing his own corundum tooth every stick and stone for ten miles in every direction belongs to him and he leaves a lovely widow and an only son the present sir roland towers twentifold scarcely any older than our tommy and an only daughter laura bless me how true everything is coming i can believe every word of it now i see them including the man with the corundum tooth in the name of moses sophy how the deuce have you found out all this already i have found out nothing and i am surprised at your low way of putting it bucephalus when i met the chambermaid could i do less than pass the time of day to her but look they have carried our tommy three times with the 'conquering hero comes' twice and a half round the i forget what dear jane windsor says is the right foreign name for it and i think mr upmore the least we can do is to throw up the window and bow our acknowledgments gracefully as the papers say i'm blowed if i'll do anything of the sort half a crown's worth of coppers would be gone in no time keep behind the curtain sophy or back we all go to business to morrow morning and i heartily wish we had never come away at home when i am hungry i can get my dinner oh dear he has spoiled his white ducks with tar and grip is in a dreadful mess of wet and the sailors want to hoist him too if he would only let them i see what it is how stupid of me tommy has been flying all over the sea and grip has been swimming after him oh bucephalus how can you eat your dinner is this a proper time for you to be devouring dinner you are right enough there sophy answered father i ought to have had it five hours ago i call it tempting providence with one's constitution to go so long after breakfast time i only hope the zanies won't come wanting to hoist me alas that the stronger of my parents should have shown such incredulity did it follow that inasmuch as he was heavy all his productions must draw the beam if so dead must drop all the wit of falstaff and all the sweet humour of thackeray and how could my father have made light sperm or the soap that he labelled the froth of the sea such questions however come dangerously near to science and its vast analogies enough that my father paid dear in the end for all this incredulity as will be made manifest further on and sorry shall i be to tell it my dear mother was already of opinion that it was a crime upon any one's part even to attempt to explain my achievements and downright treason to deny them when the beautiful lady twentifold as people called her for convenience though her proper name was towers twentifold came when the public was tired of shouting to learn all that could with propriety be learned of the origin of her great little wonder few people verily would believe what my mother was fanciful enough to do the lady to whom the hotel belonged and all the people there in my opinion sat down in the parlour downstairs with my hand in hers for she had taken dear liking to me because i resembled a child she had lost and she begged the landlady to go to my mother without any card or formality and ask whether she might have the pleasure of seeing and telling her about her boy it is a very clumsy thing for me to find fault with the behaviour of my parents and i am not prepared to do so now there may have been fifty reasons clear to people much wiser than myself but certainly i was amazed and angry when mrs roaker came back to say that the lady from london was so fatigued with the dreadful effects of her journey that she begged to thank her ladyship most warmly for very great kindness to her dear son but felt quite unequal to an interview with her how many of you are there tommy lady twentifold asked without my knowing why but she always went straight to the meaning of things only me ma'am if you please i answered looking up in fear that there ought to have been more but i did hear a woman say that there had been another but he went to heaven before me i believe the lady looked at me with her eyes quite soft which they had not been when she received that message and she seemed to be uncertain whether she was right in putting her next question has your father been married more than once my dear i mean is this lady your own dear mother or become your mamma since you can remember i told her that i could not remember any one thing about it though i often thought but this was my mother mrs upmore everybody said so and more than that there was nobody else in all the world who made a quarter so much of me tommy i am quite satisfied upon that point she answered there may be some reason which i do not know of or perhaps your dear mother is not at all strong give her my compliments and say that i hope she will be better soon and the happystowe air relieve her weakness now shake hands with roly and little laura and good bye till we see you again flying tommy i had told her that my name was flying tommy and she was much pleased to hear it because it showed that the happystowe air was not to blame for my adventure then sir roland came up and took my hand and said that he hoped i would take him for a fly and then the most beautiful child i had ever set eyes on stole up shyly and put her little hand in mine and left me to say good bye to her on the following day i felt as heavy as grip who weighed half a pound for every ounce that a human being of his size would weigh and my father and my mother agreed from different points of view about me that i must be kept indoors and fed and put at my books to steady me we had brought some greek in the bottom of a box which father considered great nonsense though it might be very good for children and he told me to find out the greek for soap and spermaceti and steam engine and write them down so that he could read them which i entirely failed to do meanwhile he set off with his admiral's coat to inspect the sea and the shipping and mr barlow's boiling premises the day after that again was sunday when the rule of our house and of most houses in maiden lane was to lie in bed until nine o'clock and have breakfast at ten and attend to the dinner till dinner time and saunter in the fields towards highgate if the weather was fine in the afternoon and to go to church or chapel sometimes if there was nothing else to do in the evening and then have a good supper and be off to bed but now mother said and my father was quite unable to gainsay it that being in a country place like this where everything depends upon example with my father acknowledged to be an admiral not only because of his coat and occasional d ns and general demeanour but also because he had shaken his head when requested to look at a ship through a spy glass for twopence and told the ancient tar that he had seen a deal too much of that moreover with tommy adored by all the aristocracy of the neighbourhood and by the brave sailors and people of less refinement accepted as an angel the least we could do was to make an effort and try to be at church by eleven o'clock my father replied that as concerned himself there need be no difficulty whatever because as soon as he had done his breakfast his only preparation was to smoke a pipe but he did not believe that it was possible for mother who had spent all saturday in the village shops because she had come in such hurry from home that she had brought nothing fit to be seen in to have all her toggery spick and span and her hair done up to the nines so early but if only to show him how little he knew my mother was ready before he was and father declared that she ruined his sleep having got up to see the sun rise upon the sea and stopped up to see herself grow brighter and brighter in the looking glass dear mother had a great mind not to go to church with such a wicked story ringing in her ears until father told her that she looked stunning and was fit to be put on a transparent lid the lid of a box of transparent soap dear bucephalus now you see she said as she placed her primrose glove on the sleeve of his blue coat with brass buttons one little portion perhaps of the reason which led me to decline an interview that night with lady towers twentifold my main reason was of course that i knew so thoroughly well what ladies are if i had allowed her to see me and satisfy all her great curiosity about this wonderful darling of a tommy the chances are ten to one that her ladyship would never have invited him to twentifold towers but now i intend that he shall go there and what will the windsors say to that well that was a very fine reason sophy but i don't see the other that i ought to see then tommy is sharper than you ten times but walk a little better if you please my dear who can take you for an admiral if you drag your feet like that from a joke mr windsor's idea had grown into a great and solid fact mrs roaker and most of the happystowe people had made up their minds by this time that my father was admiral upmore he was too honest and plain a man to encourage this mistake for a moment and whenever he got the chance declared most stoutly that he was no admiral the public however would not believe him having met with some indications in commercial dealings with him that he prized the royal effigy from which it was clear what his motive was in desiring to disguise his rank and the boots of the twentifold arms could swear that he saw admiral printed on the back of the label of a hairy trunk which had only b u on the front of it and so he did to a certain extent for mother had taken an advertising card beginning with admirable and cut it across and put father's initials on the other side they may call me what they like my father said when tired of contradiction so long as they don't charge me for it admiral upmore serves my turn uncommonly well for two things billy barlow would lock his gate if he knew that i am only boiler upmore and i am finding out some fine things there and again if any lawyer comes sneaking after my heels with that chummy's process he'll find his mistake in the visitor's list but tommy you'll catch it if you let out a word of this in maiden lane why i never should hear the last of it and so the whole three of us went to church and the sailors sitting on the tombstones most of which were like chests of drawers but without any handles to the names below touched their hats to the admiral's lady and the gallant admiral himself and the smart little chap who had been for a fly like the cherub aloft who smiles luck to poor jack it was one of dear mother's proudest moments for the men at our works would never touch their hats unless they had been tipped a shilling quite lately and she bowed with her feathers which had been a cock's throwing off quite a flash and a rustle until she was compelled to look very grave by the remark of an ancient tar that he had never seen so fine a woman but alas how fate does ring her changes with articulate speaking mortals the triumph of the chime the hesitation of the back stroke and the toll of disappointment ere ever the bells in the tower had ceased and the organ taken up the tale dear mother was a pensive hearted female and her feathers out of plume for in coming up the aisle she had whispered to the buxom pew opener lady towers twentifold has been seeking to make my acquaintance can we sit anywhere near her pew certainly ma'am said mrs button turning the handle of a large enclosure the admiral and yourself can have her ladyship's pew this morning and this evening too if you come again her ladyship has fifteen pews in the fifteen parishes she owns and she takes them all in turn and it won't be our turn for ten sundays yet chapter xi large ideas perhaps it was lucky for me that my mother had failed to amaze lady twentifold with the elegance of her apparel but after having taken all that trouble and lost all her comfort of the morning she felt it no less than a personal slight that her ladyship should have disgraced herself so by neglecting divine worship but she went to some other church said father i don't believe a word of it answered mother with both hands on her prayer book she spent her whole morning in bed no doubt i never could endure those slothful ways and the less we have to do with such people the better why who ever dreamed of our having anything to do with them my father was astonished at any new idea always sophy i won't have this rubbish any more i came down here to enjoy myself and live well and improve my liver as well as to bilk the vile harpies of the law and find out billy barlow's tricks but if i'm to put out my pipe and smoke wet rolls like tom's taffy sucks and never be seen in my shirt sleeves and never get a smell of hot meat till the bats are about and be cut short of my d ns indoors and backed up in them out of doors why the world will have come to such a stuck up pitch as would soon turn me into a radical my mother said less but pondered more in bygone days she had seemed content with the place in which she found herself proud of the works and the sample boxes and our renown for quality and insisting upon it that we should be styled in all transactions upmore co but lately or indeed for a long time now her mind had been taking an elevated tone which lowered the quality of our victuals she talked a great deal more of honour and much less of honesty she began to look down upon the sunday papers and she would not let her friends say ma'am to her my father declared that this disease began with my going to the partheneion and was made much worse by mrs windsor and the four professors and was now turned into a pestilence by these bathing machines and the sailors at the church and the brass horn rogues coming round with the cap and my lady if you please upon the sands this growth of refinement as dear mother called it spread of humbug was my father's name for it turned her attention quite suddenly to what she called my associations the habit of my body and mind had been that of london boyhood in general to rush into anything going on without waiting for an introduction to give my opinion without invitation upon any public spectacle or even a proceeding intended to be private until i came round the corner and upon every occasion to ignore humanity's false exclusiveness but on monday morning when we sat down to look at the people bathing which my father from some old fashioned feeling would never stop to do but kept his distance mother began to give me a lesson concerning the duties of society tommy she said did you remark that the little boys go into one machine and the little girls into the other and they are not allowed by the board of health to be less than fifty yards apart yes mother i replied i was looking at that and it seems to be the order on the board but somehow they seem to contrive in spite of it to get all together in the water and the girls if i can make out which they are seem to go all the way over to the boys the board says that they will be prosecuted with the extreme rigour of the law there goes another girl i declare hush tommy hush or society will expel us like a pair of pariahs what i want you to notice for your own good is that high society has rules quite different from what the children in the street have you unluckily have been permitted while your father was in a smaller way of business to associate with almost any boy of respectable trousers in the roadway i admit that i have not been as strict as i should be partly because it was no good but now it is high time to draw the line you see how they put a cord along down there now what do you suppose they do it for i am sure i don't know mother unless it is for people to tumble over it no tommy no it is to keep the people out the inferior classes must not come interfering with those who can pay for all the room they want your father is a tory but i begin to think that i shall be a radical because i find them make people pay more for getting into anything a ticket for a week for both of us to see the people bathe and dress their hair and everything was only half a crown for me and fifteenpence for you my dear and you may sit all the time on the ground of the earth which is so much cleaner than the seats they make come into this hole with the rushes on the top where i dare say some wild animal has lived and never mind the people in the waves my dear what i want you to be is a great man tommy a very great man who may look down upon the little ones and remember when he has lost his own dear mother that he owes all his greatness to her counsel and high principles my dear mother spoke with such depth of feeling especially in reference to her own end that i had not the least idea what to say and did not like to cry until i had waited for some more school life is hardening you my son she said i have known the day when you would have been crying long ago at the description of all that i go through however it is all for the best and my own doing i must expect you to grow up and grown up men must never cry tommy you can have two bull's eyes out of my pocket if you know where to find them while i am wiping my poor eyes they were under my handkerchief right side down and the old pair of gloves on the top of them that i put on when the promenade is over you have got them my son well take one at a time and don't bite them until i have said a few words don't be afraid tommy i am not going to deliver a lecture such as nobody ever that knows me could expect of me you will have a great mind my dear as well as five talents of the body that will come to five and twenty when the woman begins to sweep the house and with all these great blessings of the lord upon you your first duty is to keep them all to yourself that was one reason why i would not come out when they made such a fuss about you the other night they had no right to come between you and me and heartily thankful as i felt to them is it likely that i would put up with that sort of thing but mother i could not help saying suppose there had been nobody there when i came down you were out of sight altogether and though i might not have gone down through the water if my legs had gone in they would have stuck there don't talk of such dreadful things my dear i am speaking sincerely out of gratitude no one has ever accused your poor mother of any deficiency in that but i think that the least lady twentifold could do was to come to church on sunday if only to thank the lord for the service she had been enabled to render you few ladies have had such a chance afforded them but she thinks much more of her fifteen pews now tommy if you meet her on the beach or any of the members of her family you are not to rush up to them as if you were under a great obligation and make them talk large you may show yourself but wait for them to accost you as mrs windsor says you know what to accost a person means yes mother from costa the latin for a rib and it often comes in homer 'and thus accosting him in reply spake sovereign agamemnon' old rum does it like that nearly always tommy what a clever boy you are i love to hear a bit of latin from you but whatever you say to the twentifold people you never must speak of your master as 'old rum' it sounds quite low and it contains no learning you may speak of dr rumbelow if you like and your place of education the pantheon though why it should have the same name as a bazaar i am very much afraid i shall never understand but mind more than anything else my son what i am going to tell you now you say that none of them asked you on friday what was your father's path in life no mother none of them said a word about it all they wanted to know was about myself but i'm not sure i did not tell about old rum well it won't matter much if you did my dear but the boys at school call you 'soap' and 'tallow' and 'bubbles' and 'dips' and a quantity of things all of which prove how low they are themselves now we will not allow these great people to do that and the only way to stop them is not to let them know private matters that can be no concern of theirs above all things be truthful as the day my son your father is not an admiral and you must acknowledge that he is not supposing that the question should come up and if they want to know any more about him which people of any good manners would not just tell them in so many words the truth that your father is a gentleman the head of his own firm of merchants in the metropolis and invited to dine at the mansion house from his eminence in politics but suppose they should ask about the boiling mother and the things that we sell and the smell in the lane what a stupe you are as if you didn't know by this time after all the schooling you have had that in good society nobody knows of anything that doesn't smell nice the highest of them do all that themselves but as for talking of it and in the presence of ladies why it makes them faint your mother is of a good family tommy and you get your distinguished appearance from her and though i did marry a lightbody first and after his time an upmore i have often been told that my ancestors had a knighthood in their family which makes it improper for a son of mine to say anything about soap boiling moreover i will tell you as a very great secret which you must not say a word about in maiden lane what your father was saying in his sleep the other night it was the first night we came down here and the strange bed and the kicking noise the sea makes and the late dinner and the welsh rabbit to top up with perhaps interfered with his natural rest for he has not told a word of his dreams for years he thought he was talking to you my dear and you were at the top of a ladder or a tree so far as i could make out his words 'tommy come down' he said 'come down tommy and i'll show you where all the money is put for you to go into parliament' and then i suppose that you wouldn't come down for he slapped at his leg where he keeps his money and he called out louder 'they meddle with me i'll meddle with them when it comes to a plum and let them know who upmore is and if i am too old my son shall do it' and then he got sore where he knocked himself for his hand is heavy and his veins are large and he awoke very grumpy and rubbed his leg and i could not get any more out of him why bill chumps is going into parliament i cried being struck by this strange coincidence and i should like to go very much wherever he is and roly twentifold is sure to go too and we ought to do something between us mother for the good of the country and all the poor people and to make things fetch more money i was reading about a great man the other day i don't want to hear about any great men until you are one of them tommy go and play on the sands while i rest for an hour this air does make me yawn so are you sure you have got your dumbbells in your pockets and your fisherman's lead round the top of your stomach then whistle for grip for there might be professors down here for aught we know of and come back as soon as the london papers are down if there is anything about any of us in spite of the weight i had now to carry for fear of going out to sea again i ran away joyfully down the sands as they call the gravel where the sand should be at the ring of the steel whistle which i carried round my neck grip came bounding from the inn to meet me and with mutual confidence we began to poke about for something to afford a hunt then i heard a voice holloaing out hi tommy and with a long stride quite like that of a man sir roland twentifold came down to me why i thought you had given us the slip he shouted for he always spoke as if he wanted every one to hear i came down with my pony on saturday but i could not see a sign of you and i did not like to call at the inn because of your mother's bad health you know and on sundays my mother won't let me go far because she is religious and so am i there are so few fellows who care for that now that i stick up for it and mean to do so i won't have everything turned upside down take care that my grip doesn't roll you over i exclaimed for the dog had no muzzle on i can't always hold him when he takes a dislike grip come here he said and talk to me i have got a dozen dogs who could eat you grip but if you are good they shall be good to you i could not help laughing at this idea for grip could thrash any three dogs i knew but to my astonishment grip came up and wagged his tail softly to sir roland and sniffed about him pleasantly and then offered his grisly ears for a loving rub don't be nervous doggy went on sir roland as if he were talking to an italian greyhound you smell rather doggy but i don't mind that if your master goes for a fly every day and you swim after him you'll soon be cured only fancy i said as i pulled his tail that he might not take up with a stranger so he had never seen the sea before any more than i had but the moment he knew i was in your boat in he dashed to come and look after me and he is not at all a water dog as you must know having such a lot of dogs of your own he swallowed such a lot of salt water that he could only gurgle instead of growling when the sailors petted him and i do believe if you had not managed to get hold of his collar with that long stick he would have been a drowned dog the same as i have seen twenty of together when the wind blows down the reservoir of the water company oh how sad it must be for their master and mistress if grip was to die i never should get over it what a soft you are why you are crying now with grip all alive to lick your face such a chap as you would never do at harrow we should call you 'fanny' instead of tommy upmore now don't be offended you can't expect to be anything but a muff after going to a private school you know bill chumps is not a muff and he was there six years if bill chumps heard you talk like that he'd take you by the back of the neck and throw you over the top of that bathing waggon i beg your pardon tommy said sir roland whose nature was truly generous it was cowardly of me to talk like that when you can't help yourself of course every fellow should stick up for his own hole but what bill chumps are you talking about there can't be very many bill chumpses i should think i should rather think not there is nobody like him he is gone to pope's eye college now at oxford with a scholarship founded by his own father for the benefit of all descendants and they say he gets on wonderfully though everybody cut him for a week or so well what a wonderful thing cried roly as he told me immediately that i must call him unless i wanted to get a flyer i was at oxford last commemoration time to see my cousin who went up from harrow just at the time when chumps went up he is two years older than i am and a decent kind of fellow in his way but sadly short of what we call go though he belongs to a bigger lot than i do the earl of counterpagne is his name as the song says about somebody and your chumps everybody calls him bill chumps had pulled him out of sandford lasher at the very last moment to save him from croaking there were other men there who were ready to go in but chumps was first and though he was not a great swimmer in he jumped and pulled him up when he was all but done for bad luck for me as some people would say but splendid luck as i think for i don't want to go into the house of lords and what's the good of your own way unless you make it that was just like bill i said he never stopped to think unless there was lots of time for it he means to be a great man and he will be too that's the sort of fellow i should like to be i have often thought of running away from home and the land and the money and all that stuff and setting up properly on my own account with two night gowns and six day shirts who can give any cuds to a fellow who starts with a heap of money round his neck if it were not for my mother and little laura i would have started long ago whatever i do i shall get no credit because of what those dirty radicals call my 'enormous social advantages' by the bye i do hope you're not a radical tommy i should rather hope not i said with grand contempt my father is a conservative and so am i though i don't pretend yet to know so very much about it all the better for that i will teach you cried sir roland i know all about it ever since i can remember and when my cousin went to call upon bill chumps as he was bound to do after that the first thing he saw was a great card stuck in the corner of the glass above his chimney piece with a baron of beef and a haunch of mutton trimmed with ribbons at the top and then 'w chumps butcher' in big letters and a great lot more about meat below ending with 'house lamb when in season' my cousin was surprised but of course he said nothing about it until he knew chumps well and then he asked him why and chumps said 'just to see whether you were a snob or not' and now i tell you tommy that my cousin just opens his door and shows out any swell who pretends to patronise his friend bill chumps but chumps keeps his distance and does not want them well i wonder i never heard anything about it if butcher chumps had heard of it wouldn't he talk i don't suppose chumps ever said a word about it he is just that sort of fellow as they say they wanted to get him a medal but he would not hear of it at any price i shall make his acquaintance when i go up and i intend to get him into parliament and you too tommy as soon as you are old enough only you must try to grow a bit you are to come and stop at our place when the admiral goes back to london chapter xii twentifold towers although i had seen the tower of london when our van went to a wharf close by and even the new city prison and several magnificent houses built by brewers all these were nothing but dirt in my eyes when they lit upon twentifold towers this grand building was too long for a far sighted man to see it all at once and too high for me to think of flying over it and the depth that it went to below the ground was enough to make one giddy and the number of servants and the way they did things and the little they thought about money was amazing but in spite of all this i was sad in my heart to stop behind even in so grand a place when my father and mother were gone back home for i thought of all the corners that i knew so well and the places in the cinders where the wind blew warm and the holes where you might roast a big potato if you watched the proper time for clinkering and the grassy remainders of great green fields where the lark after warbling in the sky so long shut both his wings and shot down in silence to run about and feel the land where he felt that he had been an egg and then i thought of several fellows by no means grand in trousers or in manners such as joe grimes the blacksmith's boy and charley turps son of the carpenter who could enter into my views and let me into theirs without a bit of language wasted and who had forgiven me by this time for being what they called a latin tea kettle and of whom by this time there could not be one without a long tale of his own to unfold and a long one of mine to feel for moreover i am not ashamed to own for the true shame ought to be upon the other side that fat polly windsor had promised now for more than five years to be my bride and i wanted to amaze her with a true account of the things i saw the girls do down here and as i thought of all these delights i did not care twopence to be a great man if my greatness would rob me of half of them but before going further i am bound to stop and do justice to a man who was not so very great any more than i shall ever be but that which is tenfold rarer now a truthful honest and courageous man it was not the loss of two sunday hats which changed my father's politics but the running away of the man who stole them without leaving his name in the lining my father began to look beneath the surface having taken all he heard on trust till now and as soon as he hit upon facts he found that he must not find fault with this man for running for now he was enabled to perceive that the essence of the liberal is to run to run with the current of opinion first judging from the froth which way it goes and to run away from his own principles next because they are bad while his conscience still is good to run with all speed from the voice of reason and above all to put his best foot foremost in running for his pocket from the enemies of england having set his mind and heart against that style of going my father discovered that his own life grew more honest and open in little dealings from a firmer standard in larger ones and though he was here to some extent with a view to smooth the way for a government contract and test the true value of billy barlow's tricks the sterling weight of his principles never fell into the scale of his interests how tommy may turn out is more than i can say he exclaimed after reading lady twentifold's letter in which she apologised most gracefully for the liberty she had been tempted to take in begging them to spare their dear bright boy for a few days' visit at the towers though she had been prevented by absence from calling upon admiral and mrs upmore but her dear son roland who would bring this note would explain that she had only just been told of their sudden return to london etc etc all most pleasing and put in the kindest and prettiest way whether tommy will stick to the business said father and make it pay better than his poor governor as he calls me when my back is turned and be able by the time he is fifty years old to pay his way into parliament and represent the boiling interest which is abominably treated there it lies in the doom of the future to bring forth but after all the years i have lived in the world although i have only been on committees and never more than vice chairman i know too well what statesmen are if they can fish up against one another so much as the passing of a bad penny piece when they were at school together the man at the top of the tree will never hear the last of it if our tommy goes on as his schooling shows he may happen to be heard of by and by though there's nothing wonderful about him yet except these lies about his flying and none the rads if he turns out a tory and none of the tories if he turns into a rad shall ever be able to say of him then that he started under false colours hand me one of my invoice slips there are three or four over in that pocket book i'll be as straight forward as bill chumps was with the earl according to tommy's tale oh what are you going to do cried mother after all the lecture i gave tommy and all i have done on the sands oh dear it is flying in the face of providence the lord if you mean him by 'providence' loves the men he has made to tell the truth and the women likewise to the extent of their powers though not so much insisted on sir roland is gone to the beach with his pony to wait for your answer i believe tommy shall take it down to him read it as you go my son and then put it in this envelope what i had to read and deliver to my affable yet rather arrogant friend ran as nearly as may be to this effect bucephalus upmore son and successor to the late s upmore of the old established boiling and refining works etc etc in large type and then in good round hand this presents his respects to lady towers twentifold and begs to thank her on behalf of self and wife for your kind invitation to our son thomas the same is a good boy and well brought up so far as can be seen to and his schoolmaster ready to answer for him and will never do any disgrace to the business unless he gets into bad company but from experience of the world b u expects to hear no more from your ladyship as soon as she knows all about our tommy he can't fly no more than his father can and he goes from happystowe by railway bus as soon as all of us has had our dinner which was a great mistake in coming down to start with breakfast only offering your ladyship all good wishes from a happy stay here at happystowe remain your obedient servant to command bucephalus upmore of address above now it went very much against my grain to deliver this letter to my friend roly for my friend i may call him by this time after the things we had done and enjoyed together for i had taught him several ingenuities such as a london boy can show of clogging the wheels of the bathing waggons and pouring a little tar into the shoes left on the beach by paddlers and other devices even better so that we had made rare larks together and he would find it dull without me all up now i cried as he came at full gallop for his answer the governor has done for all my chance of ever going up to your place look what he says and not half of it is true we are boilers but we don't make dips like that sir roland was looking at a bunch of rushlights very well done but much older than i was for night lights had long superseded them and he could not help laughing though he tried severely and i had talked rather largely about commerce once or twice when we got into abstract subjects as we used when the last chance of a lark was gone he has done it on purpose i said to pull me down why he might have used his new bill heading quite like a picture you can look at with a palm in the middle and an olive full of oil and two great cannons made into candlesticks for his virgin honey patent that burns like bees and land steam on one side and sea steam on the other to show the extent of his transactions tell my dear lady that wretched old thing came down i am sure from my grandfather oh what was mother about to let him admirals are wilful men replied sir roland seriously regarding that vile bill head and they won't always listen to their wives did i ever call him an admiral did he ever say he was an admiral did any of us ever tell a single lie about it tommy my boy don't be excited sir roland said as gravely as he could contrive i have seen a great deal of the world though i am young and of course i was aware from the very first moment that you belonged to the commercial classes which as i read the other day are rapidly becoming the mainstay of england against the wild inrush of anarchy you know i told you that the other night after we had cut the mooring ropes of the three machines of the radical very well if you are in trade where is the difference between big and little the retail dealers are the loftier class because they make less profit i have thought about these things for several hours and i am not misled by what i read and the conclusion i have come to is just this that the retail man is of a higher class in every way than the wholesale one but i said as firmly as i could say it and proudly repressing all tendency to tears we are wholesale wholesale all over even father can't say less than that when he wants to run down all of us to keep our ideas from spending never mind tommy what you are sir roland replied as he buttoned up his coat you may be a gentleman in any calling if you don't run other people down that is the surest sign of a cad and i've never seen any sign of that in you now i must be off like the wind for home because i am resolved to come back in time for you we shall want you all the more for this friend tommy i won't come now if you ask me i called out as he stuck his legs round his pony because i shall know you are thinking about the dips keep out your things from the rest and have them ready the station bus goes at two o'clock i shall come with a light trap at half past one and nobody will ask you about coming by this he meant that i should have to come nolens volens as we said at school but having more faith in my father's knowledge of the world i did not expect it however with mother's consent my clothes and books were packed in my own little box while father laughed and said please yourselves so long as they go safe to maiden lane but soon he was obliged to confess his mistake and let mother triumph over him for while the bus was standing at the door and our luggage was going down heavily and my father in the window was taking his last look at a great ship in the distance a quick light sound of wheels came up the staircase and running out that way i saw a horse with his forehead pulled up right against the forehead of the bus horse as if they were playing at conquerors the new horse was beautiful and full of pride and the bus horse looked at him with mild reproach between his shabby blinkers as if he were saying wait till you grow old and you won't come flustering a poor horse brother with your dash and frippery and self conceit this for you ma'am cried the boots to my mother running up as if he had no breath left from the labour and peril of our boxes and young master roland ma'am please ma'am his compliments and he is waiting for master tommy ma'am most polite and most kind of her ladyship indeed bucephalus what do you say to that which of us understands good society best if you please my dear if you please to answer me what did i tell you on monday week tommy about what had been in my family it requires that kind of preparation to understand these things my dear but he can't go with less than a guinea in his pocket pull out mr upmore my father was obliged to do all that except that he took five per cent as the style of the age is from the beauty of the guinea and dear mother bearing a tear of pride in one eye and a bigger one of sorrow in the other went to the bag that her purse was locked in and got out half a sovereign and looked at it don't change it tommy she said until you don't know at all how to help it you are going to be with great people my pet and you will have to do things handsomely but they won't expect a little boy like you to stand treat or tip the maids or anything of that sort and if you bring this back to me you shall have it all to go to school with thus with more money than i ever had before or ever could have dreamed of owning i sat by the side of sir roland towers twentifold and watched him drive his horse which he did as he did everything with the greatest vigour and capacity we seemed to go as fast as i could fly with science and a strong breeze after me and grip had to use all his legs to keep up and i looked back sadly at the poor old bus with father and his german pipe upon the box and mother with her handkerchief waving from the window and roly would not stop for me to say another word to them now i need not have told all this except for the mean charge brought against me that i got into twentifold towers and thence into public life by trickery by false pretences and imposture on the part of all of us having conspired among strangers to present my father as an admiral the admiral of the fleet ditch those unprincipled jokers have dared to call him because the old fleet stream comes down our valley possibly if the general public and especially the inn at happystowe had not endowed my father with that naval rank and therein confirmed him in spite of all protest i might not have got my first invitation which he cast away like a true briton but i leave the world at large to judge the merits for i have always found it waste of time to reason with malicious persons have i patience to think of such small fry when i speak of the greatness of everything at twentifold towers and for miles around not a cold rigid and stuck up greatness such as you must fold your arms to look at and thank the lord in private that you are not like it but a warmth of beauty and of kindness shed abroad which set me on the flutter when i came to feel it though my mother had provided me with fifteen pounds of lead in the hollow at the bottom of my chest but at first i was frightened as you may suppose and kept asking myself what good would be my best clothes even to play in at such a place then lady twentifold came out and kissed me and looked at the tears in my eyes with love because she had lost a little boy like me and my heart went to her so that i saw nothing of the height or size of anything so long as i could see her and think about her and feel how good she was to me you will see a great friend by and by she said what a distinguished boy you are to have formed such lofty friendships and chiefly because of your bodily gift of weighing less than you ought to weigh why a boy with the mind of a shakespeare to come might pour forth poem after poem and nobody care to inquire into him even professor megalow universal as he is might never even chance to hear of him oh is it professor megalow i asked with glad excitement i am not afraid of any place when i know that he is near it ariel how unkind of you if we ill treat you spread your wings but i have not even seen your great friend yet he will not be here till dinner time he is carving what he cares for more than anything we can offer a poor dead whale at crowton naze now behold the reward of virtue for in the present state of this wicked world it may be taken as a high reward to escape the pains of punishment if i had gone as an admiral's son to twentifold towers how should i have looked when professor megalow knowing all about us and having smelled our works afar which probably helped to draw him towards us for congenial nutriment now came up with that large sweet smile which spreads all over his face and body and said my dear little friend how are you this was the first time i ever beheld him in evening dress and he astonished me because a very old hat had always been part of his equipment he may have contrived to leave it somewhere for he cannot have come with a good one neither was that the only thing in his present appearance amazing for he had put himself into a black velvet coat as the smartest thing he could find in his trunk and grand i can tell you he looked in it from daybreak until he had to go and wash he had been at work at that great whale not only directing a mob of clod hoppers how to hop about upon a whale but also with his own iron arms performing all work that called for skill and strength and yet there was no sign of work about him neither any talk or thought of work and he would not be made though lady twentifold tried her best to make him and so did sir roland with downright fishers as we used to call tapping a master at school to do a hard sentence for us by no manner of means could he be brought to speak as if he wanted to be listened to this was the very thing that i had known ever since he first came with the other four professors of them there was not one that would leave off talking for the sake of the public or of one another or even for his own sake neither would they breathe enough to let another voice in but the measure of every man's mind was his lungs and to countervail this it has been laid down by nature that the men who have something to say don't say it but though this professor in his leisure time would play round the edge of his learning rather than plunge other people into it it was quite impossible for even me a careless and light headed boy to be with him without learning something and my firm belief is that although i know very little at this time of writing whatever i have learned of larger things than little human creatures was gained upon that whale where the great mind came to study the great body chapter xiii whalebones my dear mother always says and allows no contradiction about it that this whale being all bones and blubber had no right whatever to come ashore there and to set me against my father's trade she declares that all science is full of smells a thousand times worse than we make and that all their fuss about drains is just that they may get themselves cleaned up for nothing all the people before her in generation lived to be ninety without any drain upon them except her own parents and why did they die why because there was a drain carried through their garden and the smell came in and choked them in support of this view there is much to be said and according to my own experience ten people are killed by the making and opening of drains for one who can hope in his lungs that he breathes better air when near them nature has designed the human race to stand well apart on the face of the earth and not huddle up in hillocks as the emmets do and their certainty of fighting when they get too thick shows this without further argument and another thing that proves it is the fact that when they clot together they make drains which destroy everybody who is fond of them my father was as well as any man could be till what they call sanitary engineering broke his constitution and the lively smells that our works had scattered were bottled into deadly poison as yet i was too young to understand such matters or even to give a thought to them but the standing i took upon that whale and the pleasure with which i went into him did a great deal for me in the good opinion than which there could be no better one of the kind professor megalow roly would not come anigh our operations after one experiment and a short one but i with my quickness and lightness of tread was of some little service i do believe in the cause of harmless science i learned all the names of the professor's tools and could bring them to him without wanting any ladder and any little cut that could be made without much strength i could make under his direction while he was at the bigger work he did not attempt to get all the skeleton greatly as he longed to do so for this was no whale to be found every day but one who had no business here and his name was something like chocolate the professor sighed heavily as his bones grew more and more attractive and hung over us like a great arbour drooped with a fine lot of creepers but he knew long since what it is to depend for money upon the government lucky would he be to get the head and fins and tail and some odds and ends if a dozen rival claimants would let him have so much that whale is mine said lady twentifold he chose to land on my property and i give him to professor megalow not to the government that won't pay a penny but to the professor to put in his own garden that whale belongs to me said the local receiver of the droits of the admiralty the foreshore is vested in the crown and the admiralty represents the crown clearly there can be no question said the man who represented the trinity house that the whale is ours and we mean to have him then there came a lawyer employed by the crew of the boat who had first harpooned him and another retained by the men who stuck him last and another by a captain who had espied him go down and another by a fisherman who headed him ashore and one by the coast guard who had seen him stranded first and two by a man who had foretold the weather and kept his ropes ready though he never had to use them but in spite of all these claims the men who got him or at least got all the best of him were the men who made no claim at all but came down with carts and casks and helped themselves for my part i thought it not only unjust but stupid that i should work so hard and establish a right as the professor said to a very considerable share of blubber and my father not get a pailful i wrote to him beginning with a line of latin not so much to accredit my learning as to make him pay proper attention and after that i said that here there was any quantity of stuff such as he could never get for love or money unadulterated and it was to be had for the asking or rather for taking without asking i told him how it shone in the sun and held together and took different colours as you looked at it and i was sure that he would make his fortune because he could get it for nothing and make it mix up into everything and i was certain of stirring him up and getting five shillings by return of post when i added everybody says that mr barlow of happystowe candle works will make a thousand pounds out of this poor whale that is being cut up by me and professor megalow my mother was kind enough to answer but without any sort of reference to business my father took no more notice of my letter than if i had sent him a bark of grip's instead of a pill box filled with sample from my own knife at a place where the blubber was more than fourteen inches thick and this goes some way to prove that his mind was already on the rise above the smaller details and getting into larger views of lofty subjects such as chemical researches political oeconomy and even government contracts and it turned out afterwards as you will see that he was right in attending to these wholesale sizes dear mother sent me half a crown in stamps for fear of my changing the half sovereign and related a beautiful dream she had enjoyed about me and professor megalow standing on the whale with our wings spread out she knew from all the pictures what a whale was like and hoped for the sake of my new overcoat i kept out of the way when he spouted and if i could bring a piece of genuine bone for the sake of her stays it would be such a comfort for everything now was adulterated and their want of spring ran into her and then she added that she did not think i had better write a line to polly windsor though she sent me a message from polly to say that i ought to have done it long ago because it was not so well to go too far and create expectations which might come to nothing her own opinion was that after my last fly and the high society it led to there was no telling what might be before me in the family way and otherwise but above all she begged me for her dear sake not to trust to the grand dinners i got here and their turtle and their venison and their aspic jelly but to keep the tongue of the buckle of my lead belt in the third hole from the end for if the wind took me out over the sea what could lady twentifold and the whale and even the great professor do i was quite content to save fingers from pen in the direction of polly windsor polly was very well in her way when she chose to be pleased and look pretty moreover she was a very well grown girl with broad shoulders and big arms and long brown hair and her feet so truly a pair that she never could tell her right shoe from her left and from her mother she had inherited so much strength of dignity that if i went to kiss her when the mood was not in liking or if she saw me trying it with any of her enemies she would take me up with one hand and lay me on the cinders but i must not say too much of that or sir william chumps will be down upon me we had promised to marry one another ever since she had her first pink slips and i went into trousers but i never vowed not to speak to any other girl nor to let her box my ears and say thank you dear as she seemed to believe that i had done and surely it is no great reproach upon me that now in this busy time i never thought about her unless i got something very good to suck and wished that she were there to have a bit for it must be understood that professor megalow could not do a good stroke of work without me according to the very best of my belief and as he was lodging at crowton naze which was more than three miles from the towers and as he must get to work the moment that the sunlight came over the sea into the wattles of the whale there was no help for it but that i must be up by the crow of a cock who lived under my window for not a serving man or ruling woman at the towers would take sixpence a day to get up so soon sir roland called me a confounded fool and said that i came there to play and not to work and even lady twentifold was vexed with me but like everybody else she fell under the enchantment of the professor's eyes and smile and i did hear my lady's favourite maid declaring to her cousin who had to make my bed that you should have seen my lady's face when she was told by a friend who pretended to know all about him that the professor had been married for several years at any rate he worked as hard as if he had a large small family to keep and i was told afterwards and can well believe because he was under the government that he would have been paid more than twice as much if he had done less than half the work but neither of us gave a thought to that our object was to walk off with the whale or so much of him as was moveable before the twelve lawyers who were hard at work could get an order from the courts to stop us and luckily this was the season of the year when the law like a python retires for three months to digest its swallowings moreover when a boat's crew of people who care for the law about as much as science does that is to say blunt fishermen came with intention of landing at high water and storming the whale who was well drawn up even the professor could not have stopped them though lady twentifold's bailiff was there to back him up through thick and thin if once those fellows could have landed by saying to grip have a care my boy i was able to do a good turn to our cause for he knew a gun better than i did and feared no other thing on earth but that one look into the boat convinced him that these rogues had got no fire arms and as soon as he had knocked over two who desired to land the rest held parley our coast guard will be withdrawn next week the professor assured them in his kind and solid way and whether they misunderstood his meaning and believed the preventive men to be in possession or whether they were glad of some good reason for withdrawal at any rate they withdrew as promptly as every one of english race does now when it might prove troublesome to go on moreover they showed a grand contempt for us which the mere act of running away exhibits and in all probability they were wise for grip had struck back upon ancestral qualities as some few englishmen do even yet by slow and solid holding of his own he had thrashed all the twentifold tower dogs every one of whom was to have eaten him and now he was living on whalebone and every muscle was as hard as wire if mental analogy counts for aught against low physical resemblance grip was far more akin to the english race than the present generation is the professor was delighted with all these works and as soon as we had finished and packed up the results he laid his hand upon my head upon his own he had a velvet cap and the whole of his face was one sweet smile tommy he said looking steadfastly at me and swinging a little from side to side for he always stood with his head well back and his heels a trifle forward what a help you have been my dear little tommy a truly strongsiding champion now before i go to see your good works stowed away in our dark recesses tell me what i can do for you to show the gratitude of the nation he was fond of talking in this style making small things great and great things small if you please sir i said after thinking awhile for i believed that he could do anything i should be so glad if you could stop me from having to go up in the air so professor megalow's bright smile changed into a smile of sadness he began to rub his well established nose in the fork of his finger and thumb and then he whistled and put his hands into his trouser pockets oh yes sir you can if you like i said taking hold of one thumb which he had left out there is nothing of the things that can be done that you can't do when you like sir i only want to be able to take off this lead that makes me blue all round and to leave these heavy things behind and get to feel the ground under my feet go firm as it seems to do with everybody else but me i have longed so often to ask you sir but i did not like until you asked me oh sir megalo micro sauros do try to help me if i have helped you he had told me to call him micro sauros once when i stuck fast with his proper name for our origin now is established my tommy and yet we may modify our pedigrees my proclivities show me to be devolved in a very degenerate and underfed form from the mighty race of saurians and as cause and effect interlace each other he spent his life in dissecting his ancestors thomas he said now for whenever he spoke in a very solid vein he called me that thomas my boy be contented with that which has been ordained concerning you yours is not the only instance of what our friends call meiocatobarysm the meaning of which you have greek enough now as well as experience enough to know the form of life in which you find yourself is perhaps the happiest among all with which we are as yet acquainted to wit that of an english boy of the middle class well fed well taught well played if i may be allowed the expression dressed quite as well as he cares to be and walking about at his leisure with an eye down the manifold vistas of mischief in a few years thomas will have changed all that he will find himself bound to pay rates and taxes and never know when he has paid them right to go to his office with a compressor on his head and measure his words like poison to doubt his very oldest friends and be hearty with people he can't bear the sight of and to go home at night with the certainty that one run of bad luck may ruin him thomas be happy while you can but sir i answered how can i be happy when everybody expects me to go up no one else in the world is expected to go up because he couldn't do it if he tried and i can't go up more than once in a way even if my mother would allow me and yet i am always getting blamed by a number of people for not going up even roly is down upon me now to do it and because i won't try but keep working at the whale he seems to be getting tired of me tommy that is sad and yet a natural result to my far less remarkable self it has happened when kind friends expected me to rise too fast reserve yourself tommy and preserve your self respect but would you be really glad my boy to lose this special gift of yours remember that if you do you cease to attract any public attention doubtful benefit as that may be do you really wish to be unable to pirouette in the air again professor megalow in the kindest manner put both hands on my shoulders and fixed his very large clear eyes on mine it was hopeless for any one looked at thus to tell a lie neither was my nature that if you please sir i said there is nothing i like better than to be taken for a wonder of the world and to read a whole column in the newspapers about me beginning with 'unparalleled phenomenon' but what i can't bear is to be always bothered to do it for people to look at and to be laughed at as if i were a rogue or else a curmudgeon when i don't go up to order sometimes i have been tempted to pull my weights off but i promised my mother that i never would do that and you know sir that i can only go up now and then and always when i don't want to do it and when i come down again i am so stupid and my head goes round for hours the natural result of anything counter to the ordinary laws of earth have you anything more to explain concerning your wishes so far as you know them no sir except that i should like once to go up if it was only as high as his hat when my father was there to see me do it because he is so cock sure that i can't do it and he calls it nothing but a pack of lies and somehow or other i assure you sir i am just like a lump of lead when father is looking at me a common complaint of the mediums tommy of the effect incredulity has on them but my dear little anthropic nautilus i can do nothing either to make or mar your excursions over my own head as i have told you before there is nothing exceptional in your formation only it happens that your bodily contour is exactly such as to promote the tendencies of your specific levity do you understand me noble volant well sir i think that i do a little but not very clearly until i get older bodily contour means the turning of my body when i go up doesn't it no tommy no it means physical outline if that is any clearer to you you give me a lesson in lucidity as the cant of the day calls clearness to put what i mean into the vulgar tongue which is the least vulgar of all just now your outward shape is especially fitted to help the lightness of your material in conquering the power of gravitation your chest is very large and can be much expanded your head is rather small and of little substance but endowed with a mass of curls which take the wind like a mop being trundled your feet are very hollow and receive the air and the palms of your hands are concave above all your stomach my dear little friend or rather your hypogastrium has a curve which requires continual attention in the way of aliment if neglected this lends itself at once to inferior pressure but with all these qualifications tommy you might defy the breezes if you only had a stable mind and bones a little more like mine the professor had goodly bones of his own as behoves a great osteologist whereas mine are very small and slight and it takes some time to find them but i saw no way to increase their size and before i could ask if such there were sir roland came cantering up and behind him appeared his mother in a pony carriage together with her lovely child miss laura oh how we shall miss you exclaimed my dear lady as i was allowed to call her professor megalow if i establish my right to the residue of that whale i shall have it preserved and a gallery made in gratitude for all that we have learned from you i heartily hope that you will he replied gracefully lifting his velvet cap as he always did at a compliment then there will be some excuse for me to come down and have another carve at him professor cried sir roland who was always wanting something there is one thing that you must do before you go for the finishing touch to our gratitude you must send tommy up in this nice quiet reach without any fellow here to shoot at him and we'll tie this kite string to his belt after we have taken the lead out to make sure of his not drifting out to sea tommy and i are very warm allies my great friend answered gravely and unless you behave most respectfully to him i shall tie the kite string to you and with her ladyship's permission send up you that was a very fine moment for me who have been compelled by my peculiar case to keep such a sharp look out what all the people around me are thinking of in every condition of things even my best friends have always considered it a nice little piece of excitement and a pleasure entirely due to them that i should go up and encounter all risk while they remained below with the heartiest wishes for my safe deliverance sir roland towers twentifold looked at the professor as if to say at first you could not do it if you tried the professor regarded him with earnest sadness as much as to say don't make me try because it might be so bad for you then roly in doubt and alarm glanced towards his mother who had said that he knew no fear her eyes were saddened with a gleam of tears for she had long made up her mind that the great professor could do anything permitted by the laws of england yet honour and fine sentiment forbade her to forbid that her son should do a thing which he had urged a friend to do the wise man enjoyed the situation for a moment then perceived that it was painful to kind and good friends and at once relieved them i withdraw my proposal which was rashly made he said to lady twentifold with that wonderful mixture of nod and wink which had neither nod in it nor wink perceptible and yet conveyed the force of both i am truly glad that i did not give your dauntless son time to accept my offer perhaps it would have puzzled me if he had especially as my train will be due in an hour and the drive to the station takes forty minutes is there any gratitude in the sons of men if there be how little time have i left to express it and yet the wisest plan for no length of time would suffice me he lifted her white hand to his lips in the gallant manner which became him well and my dear lady bowed over it and turned to her carriage with a little sigh which conveyed to the ponies if they understood their mistress that it was through no default of hers that they never would be guided by a strong male hand chapter xiv a silly pair i have often been taunted by people who know nothing multiplied into a million fibs about me that my mind is as volatile as my body and goes about in an unsettled manner for want of the leaden belt which motherly care so long kept round my stomach it is equally needless and useless to present reason to such irrationals and i try to be proud in my loftier moments of affording them amusement which amuses me but to reasonable persons who can hearken to a thing and take it into common sense and weigh it whenever it concerns their own affairs enough to these if any i would simply say follow my own history of my own acts and judge by my own account of what nobody else can know so well and any one proceeding upon this fair principle will find more to approve than to condemn in me however much i may tell against myself hoping that fair play will prevail as it generally does in the end i confess that at this very tender age of fifteen i proved for the rest of my holidays untrue to the image of polly windsor polly was not there and even if she had been how would she have looked i should like to know by the side of laura twentifold she was double her size that is certain at the least but in quality oh what a difference and yet again manners and the fear of what i might say greatly against my own interest enable me to speak in a chastened style and to do that i had better leave polly still absent on the very day after professor megalow returned to his duties in london my dear lady comforted her mind by returning to the place still full of him you must understand that the professor had never been actually staying at the towers because without any other fullgrown gentleman dwelling in the house it might have looked amiss so he had his own camping place at crowton on the naze which is ten miles further up the coast than the rising watering place called happystowe yet there had not been many days when he failed to put himself into spruce attire so far as his nature permitted and to dine and make a pleasant evening with my lady and her gallant son sir roland and when he was gone it could not be helped that the evenings should grow long and dull it must have been august and about the middle of it according to our holidays which were sadly near their end when my dear lady walked down the sands to talk to an ancient fisherman about keeping the relics of the whale upright roly was gone with the keeper inland to see about exercising some young dogs in preparation for the shooting time and the lovely little lady and myself were left to look for pretty shells and to amuse each other and i never grew tired of obeying her commands so sweet was her voice and so gentle were her eyes now i want to show all these she said to my darling dorothea that she may choose exactly what she likes and it is high time to put her necklace on that you have made so beautifully ariel she always called me ariel because she had heard her mother do it once or twice and she said it was so much prettier than tommy and although she was more than ten years old she had not outgrown the wholesome joy of a little woman in her baby doll dorothea moreover was quite young at present and sweetly instructive in the newest fashions having only come two days ago from paris with the kind introduction of professor megalow you may sit down quite close to dear dorothea because you are not clumsy and rough like roly who cannot at all enter into the feelings of a lovely and delicate creature like this and ariel i am quite sure that dolly will like you as soon as she opens her eyes which are shut now you must understand from the sea air being too much for her but you must let me put her necklace on although you have made it so beautifully not that i would not trust you to do it but because you cannot understand her hair it would hardly be proper if you did you know she was always like this such a sweet little love so afraid of hurting anybody's feelings and so ready to think everybody good when i sat down near her on a bank of bed rushes with the doll sitting carefully between us i could not help feeling ungrateful in my heart for the prospect of miss polly windsor to morrow and i could not quite fancy that maiden lane though alive with delights of its proper class could supply such contentment to sight and thought not that i put it so grandly then as the place i sate in and the things i saw for the tide was coming in with pleasant feeling of the air and ready briskness of the things that had been waiting for it at every short step that it made in advance for the waves toddled in like babies there was some pretty thing starting up in front to run and to glisten before it but the prettiest thing of all sate there by me you are always at work she said always doing something why do people want us to be educated so those funny letters are all greek i know because roly has got some that he learns at harrow but he doesn't seem to like it more than i like french and he puts it in a cupboard for the holidays ariel why should you work more than roly does he never does a thing unless he likes it i had thought this out and my reply was ready roly will be a rich man and i shall not he belongs to great people and i belong to small ones he will get on all the same whether he works or not then i call that as unfair as anything can be and i could not have believed it though i know you tell the truth unless i had heard of such things before we all ought to work to do good of course but not in the middle of the holidays i have got to go back to old rum on monday i answered with a wistful gaze at her and unless i can say a hundred lines of homer beginning at the place where we left off cracks will be the word and no mistake and he's come to be so sharp from being done so often that there's not a fellow now with the pluck to run a tib or a crib or a leary round the corner ton d' apameibomenos is the only cock that fights what a lucky thing it is to be a girl she cast her eyes down after looking at me to learn my opinion of this sentiment for that opinion showed itself as opposite as could be to hers i only mean because we don't get cracks and we don't jump on one another as they do to you sometimes oh ariel how can you put up with that and then they tie a string to your toe at night what courage it must take to be a boy before bill chumps went to oxford i replied while looking at the tiny foot she put forth on the sand he shut up all bullying in our school there used to be a lot of it and after getting taw or togy in the playground and rats in school a fellow couldn't sleep for fear of cramp but bill set up a different fashion altogether and the little fellows now begin to cock over us who are their seniors i am getting bigger than i used to be and so well up in the school that i am very useful in doing the big fellows' exercises and they never jump on me as they used to do when i couldn't try to fly for them grip would have something to say to them next morning if they tried it oh i do love grip because he is so ugly and i love you ariel because you are so pretty and so kind and gentle and you never do mischief unless roly sets you the example i shall cry when you go away i'm sure i shall and i shall put dorothea into mourning for you i don't believe a bit that your papa makes candles and if he does how could we go to bed without them i should just like to ask people that and what could they say i should be glad to know to me this appeared an extremely sensible and large minded view of the case and i did not hesitate to promote it and what would you do without soap lady laura my father makes soap of the finest quality a great deal better as everybody says than any turned out by mr windsor though he put his name on every cake 'windsor's best brown windsor' and no better than curds every square of it then if i see any of it in my room i shall throw it straight out of the window and say 'please to bring me ariel's soap' but you must not call me 'lady laura' my mother is a lady but i am not till i marry my cousin lord counterpagne as they say i shall have to do when i grow up but i don't care about him at all till then he has got red hair and his eyes are crooked although it was no concern of mine this arrangement appeared to me most unfair but i did not dare to say a word against it oh ariel my little beauty went on after taking up her doll and coaxing it can you think of anything so bad as marrying a person you don't like because you can never get away you know according to the law of the land i believe and according to the bible my mother has never said a word about it but roly declares that i am bound to do it and he is always determined to have his own way oh dorothea what would you do i knew very little of the world as yet and in matters above me i was loth to speak but i could not help saying there is lots of time yet you may trust me to help you if you only let me know how stupid i am i never thought of that she turned over towards me and put up her hands as if for me to help her and then suddenly began to stroke my hair as she had often longed to do but had hitherto refused my invitation i must do it once before you go to see how the whole of it is fastened on don't be afraid i won't hurt you ariel i know how ethel jones does mine and if they want to marry me and i don't like it all you will have to do is this to get into the train and come down here and then take off your lead and fly away with me and come back when the ceremony is over but how could they do it without you i asked you musn't expect me to be reasonable always she answered and began to play with me gently and beautifully and laughing all the time what a pair of silly little things you are lady twentifold came upon us suddenly while laura was trying to uncurl my hair and i was offering to kiss her but afraid to do it while she was dodging in and out to tempt me more ariel you told me this morning that unless you learned a hundred lines of greek to day you had better not be born next monday and you asked me to write a letter of apology to your learned dr rumbelow he is likely to be our new bishop i was told this morning and it will put roly down for he made sure that his master would receive the offer so i hope that you will never call him 'old rum' any more old rum to be the bishop my dear lady i cried as if i had quite lost my place and who is to be our master i should like to know oh i won't learn another line 'twould be trouble thrown away my practical conclusion was borne out by facts sad facts for all sons of the partheneion dr rumbelow's luck was a joy to us at first because we all liked him and got off a lot of work but our joy soon went and a bad time followed as we all found out and pretty quickly too for the new master's name was crankhead ernest mauleverum crankhead ma a cambridge man and a lofty wrangler but without much greek as we soon found out now before i left twentifold towers and returned to the smell of our works which had changed very greatly for the worse while i was away down here sir roland towers twentifold being well sixteen and tall for his age and of long experience at one of our largest public schools took me aside into a saddle room wherein he was learning to smoke cigars and put into a nutshell all the essence of the british constitution how i wish i could remember what he said but it sank into my mind too deeply ever to be brought up again and it blended with and flourished in the flower of my life as liquid manure reappears in bright flowers inscripti nomina regum tommy he went on as soon as ever he had put into ten words the lessons of a thousand years you will see now how it is that we don't get on we never get a man to take the lead who knows his own mind and will stick to it and throw up his situation rather than carry it on against his own lights and then there come a lot of fellows swarming for first pull as we rush to the swipes can after cricket and the louder any cad is for his rights which are sure to mean the wrongs of some quieter chap the surer he is to get served first now can you call this government i don't pretend to know much about it i replied for we had held some conversation of this kind before but my father says that any business carried on as the government of this country is would have to put its shutters up within three months if it started with a hundred thousand pounds but you mustn't tell any one that he said this for i believe by the way he would not answer me that he has got a fine government contract by this time your father is quite right he is a man of strong sense sir roland made answer as soon as he could after taking a large puff of smoke the wrong way let him get every farthing he can from the government and then he will be able to understand them why i might not have got the knowledge that i have except for a trick that they wanted to play about my cousin counterpagne when he comes of age counterpagne is soft and his mother no better and being of an ancient tory race they expected to have things made smooth for them but i can't stop to tell you all that now you are to come back at christmas and you shall hear it then counterpagne is to marry little laura to prevent any mischief to our property and influence and between us we shall send six members up besides counterpagne himself in the peers of course and me in the commons for the towers' own hole but tommy look at me and tell me this if under a government that calls itself conservative as the present fellows do such things can be done as i was going to tell you what is to be expected of the radicals i'll tell you what if the constitution lasts till i am of age which seems a most unlikely thing i shall want you and every man of sense i know to collect and put your shoulders to the wheel remember that i did not at all understand what he meant although he had spoken several times to this effect but i promised to do all i could and was pleased with the thoughts of becoming so important tommy you will rise my friend continued without asking what i was thinking of such a fellow as you are must go up unless he makes a downright fool of himself you can beat me all to fits in greek and latin though you have only been at a dirty little private school you have got a most wonderful face of your own so easy going and sweet tempered that it makes every fellow think you slow and drop all jealousy about you and more than all and that alone should be enough to make your fortune you can draw the attention of the whole world upon you whenever you please by going over their heads i have been very good in letting you off without sending you up a lot of times but you know that i have done it upon one condition you must cultivate the art without any one's knowledge and be ready to go up at some great moment when i give the signal pretend for the present that you can't do it but practise as i told you more and more i have shown you the muscles you must try to strengthen and the places where you must lay on fat it is nothing in the world but a kind of swimming and there everything depends upon your being quite at home now remember what i say and when you come down at christmas i shall put you through your paces and expect to find you perfect oh roly i replied you talk as lightly as all the men of science did about me i will do my very utmost to please you i am sure but i never expect to be of any service to you you are learning to smoke and your smoke goes up and that makes you think that i can do the same exactly so tommy a great deal of it went down until i understood it and now look at that chapter xv political oeconomy by going from home after so many years we had not only done ourselves no good in the opinion of our friends who could not go but we had opened the door to a swarm of changes which came rushing in upon the heels of each other to me the greatest change of all appeared to have taken place in maiden lane itself for the houses had turned black and the windows grimy and the roadway and the pavement wherever there was any seemed to cry aloud for washing and the people too unconscious as they were of such desire excitement appeared to be the main thing now and hurry and suspicion and no time to look about whereas both at happystowe and crowton on the naze the chief business of the natives was to look at one another and when there was no more to be made of that to consider the meaning of the sand and sea and taken on the whole those folk looked wiser and a great deal happier than ours did but to dwell upon that would be ungraceful now when i call to mind that our own boiling and the agitation of my father's engine had a great deal to do with the ferment around us no sooner had my father returned to business with joe cowl and the summons wiped off his conscience and billy barlow's new devices written in his heart than he found on his desk he could never tell how a sealed invitation to tender for soap for the heads of all the convicts with average stated in six great castles for the improvement of our race the consumption of soap per head was given and a number of smaller particulars all in print and proper columns and then the requirement for samples to be delivered at six places and in pencil very faint upon the margin there was written it must not be soft and it must be strong price not to be too low like the rads' stuff tallow will be wanted soon rub this out there was something so touching in this and so full of fine feeling as between man and man that my father immediately filled his pipe and had a good smoke to consider it at one time his heart warmed up with thinking of the goodwill remaining in politics yet and the loyalty every one is bound to show to and expect from his own side and yet again he could not feel sure that he ought to have any faith at all in this why should there be six samples sent of a stone weight each to six different places and all to be left without the money it looked like a hoax with joe cowl at the root of it to get a paltry laugh at him or else a swindle to get three fourths of a hundredweight of soap for nothing he resolved to act warily and so he did if they mean well to me he said they will never examine my samples they meant so thoroughly well to him that they sniffed at his samples and found them shocking for he sent the worst stuff he could lay hand on for fear of having it stolen and then they gave an order for sixty tons to be furnished at once and sixty more to follow our works had never sent out such a lot before at one delivery and no wonder that they could not think of me john windsor shall not have a finger in the pie my father said right manfully i am not at all sure that his politics are sound he would lower my quality to get the next himself you know how he wanted to run away sophy when that great bombardment came let every vat stand upon its own bottom bucephalus you are quite right mother answered as you always are when you get on work double tides bubbly and double your hands don't let them have a penny if you can help it so grand was the commodity thus produced with the help of the lessons at happystowe that it is remembered to the present day and cited as the type of excellence for sanitary purposes it was needed and it not only met but transcended them there was not a convict left with a stub of hair though their hair is always bristly and very few had such constitution as to keep any roots for future trouble universal satisfaction was expressed and my father put up the royal arms twice as big as the knacker's across the road and done in thicker timber thoroughly candid and straight forward he said to every one who spoke of it good value for money good money for value public confidence met by private industry enterprise and honour i serve them exactly as i should serve you just to turn five per cent on my money and no more if any man calls that exorbitant let him come and do it cheaper the only thing at all mysterious was the requirement for six samples to be delivered at six places far apart but that was explained most pleasantly so that my father rubbed his hands and chuckled while he was reading the debates in the early part of the following session a figuresome member of the opposition who thought himself fit to be chancellor of the exchequer had given notice of a question concerning a certain contract for soap to be supplied to her majesty's penal establishments etc with dates and other insinuations and he made a very hasty speech about it confounding the post and the propter hoc quite as if my father whom he dared to call a wholly unknown manufacturer had been preferred for a lucrative contract because of his behaviour at election time so far as wickedness can be good this man spoke well having got up all his facts and he sate down in triumph as he thought but before he had time to digest his cheers the gentleman who was to reply got up with a beautiful smile and a very pleasant glance at a paper laid before him i am furnished with particulars from the head of the department concerning this heinous transaction sir he said and i find that large samples were delivered in six quarters widely apart and wholly unconnected the names of which i will read if desired loud cheers followed from every corner of the house for nobody likes to have his own rights interfered with and the speaker concluded i will ask for no apology from the honourable member for clap trap it would be of no more value than his imputation well said my father when he had read this twice i call that something like a government if we only get a few more contracts sophy we'll send tommy into the house to see about them there might be a stranger thing my dear than a long blue paper for ten thousand pounds with thomas upmore signed for her majesty above and bucephalus upmore for himself below what a rage john windsor will be in when he reads about those six samples and not one of them gone out of his gate i had sense enough to keep the whole of that inside my own waistcoat now it would have been good and even pleasant for the public lustily though they condemned us at the time if the only increase of activity shown in those parts had come out of our chimneys but there always is a mob of people who never will leave well alone and these had got up deputations petitions memorials circulars indignation meetings committees commissions and worst of all missiles concerning the wholesome smell we made and had made before some of their fathers were born when the unenlightened mass of minds falls into this bubonic fever of excitement the right thing to administer is gruel in the form of general promises a desire to hear all that can be said and a thoroughly unselfish gratitude towards those who have made the worst of you but my father had never possessed this wisdom which belongs of sweet right to the liberals and whether on the ground of true british principle or the royal arms or the money coming in he took a firm stand with his hands in his pockets and his legs well apart and defied the public every blessed flue of mine he said have gone ten feet higher since i were a boy and with present foundations can't go no higher before folk grumble their place is to stump up if every cantankerous fellow who don't know a wholesome smell by the touch of it would put down a half crown if he has got one instead of signing lies against me i don't know but what i might lay foundations and change my insurance and go twenty foot higher though a heap of disease would break out i expect look at the plants in my bed room window scarlets and blue things and lilies of the nile is there any man or woman round these parts half so good looking or so sweet to come by they like it rarely and so would you if you understood what is good for you and who was here first you or i and my fathers for three generations of boilers we didn't want the houses they came round us every brick of them was laid with my smoke to set it and very good neighbours they have always been till this scientific stuff came up about cur bones and oxen and the lord knows what i tell you what if you don't like it budge yourself but you won't budge me such speeches only made the fuss grow louder until the authorities felt themselves compelled to do something sanatory there was no metropolitan board of works as yet i believe or if there was it never came up our way but the vestry of st pancras had many stormy meetings which my father deigned not to attend but his workmen were there in great force and made more noise than our new steam engine in short the matter came as every matter does now and the practice already was beginning to what is called a reasonable and satisfactory compromise conciliating all interests the complaint of the public had been about the air and the noxious exhalations and vile odours as they chose to call them but who can see the air who can tell what is in it it varies with every puff of wind let us turn to something tangible the earth is a thing that can be dealt with and the earth is at the bottom of every mischief on the face of it so to cure the smell of our chimneys they ordered a four foot culvert down our valley where the course of the old fleet stream had been and the voice of the public went off to it this being settled my father was enabled to make tenfold the smells he had ever made before without any one hoisting a handkerchief an inquisitive stranger would sometimes ask whether this neighbourhood was always choked with vapours which he coarsely stigmatized a piece of valuable advice common yet neglected universally about the prior claims of his own affairs was the only reward for his sympathies what right had a fellow with a walking stick to come grumbling against our rate payers and their engineers and contractors measures were being taken or at any rate were in contemplation and every man with a horse and cart would get fifteen shillings a day for them but alas how little do we forecast while we vindicate our own welfare it would have been better for my dear father as upright and downright a man as ever lived to have gone to the expense of a new chimney stack one hundred feet high or even to have put out all his fires than to have helped to bring that drain down our hitherto maiden valley the soil in the bottom was of concentrated essence combining all the density of bygone generations with the volatile relics of their labours it would grow almost anything if only scratched and no healthier place for a walk could be found but wisdom is not justified of her fathers when she goes to turn them up in happy ignorance of woes impending i went back to the partheneion and found the whole establishment turned upside down grip came with me as a thing of course and found his old barrel standing on its head and a notice upon it in large letters no dogs allowed if anything rouses the juvenile spirit such rude breach of prescription does it with the help of jack windsor who was quite of my mind i replaced the barrel in its old position which was snug in a corner impregnable to guns and i fastened him there with his own long chain and said now defend yourself old boy i have got lots of money and you shall not starve he fully understood the situation and if any demand for sympathy arose it would be on behalf of the individual attempting to dislodge him then all of us were summoned to the hall to hear an oration from the principal as he styled himself to start with our new schoolmaster ernest mauleverum crankhead a short brisk gentleman quite young with a pale square face a yellow moustache and very quick bronzy eyes which never took two seconds' rest upon anything accustomed as we were to the long grave countenance waving white locks and calm abstracted gaze of our simple old dr rumbelow we could not believe that we saw the new man until he stood up at what he called the rostrum and hit it three times with an ivory hammer going going gone jack windsor whispered and gone was the glory of the partheneion we knew it we felt it without a word uttered our hearts fell into the heels of our socks and no boy thought twice of the things in his pocket our account would be with a sharp hand now a resolute and a malignant one and what was worst of all and which a boy descries at the very first glance we should not have to deal with a gentleman i shall never go up any more thought i i remember very little of what crankhead said and none of it is worth repeating but he gave us to understand that the sooner we forgot everything we had learned hitherto and began on lines entirely new the better it would be for our own minds and what mattered far more our success in life for the few whose parents might still be benighted enough to insist upon greek and latin a classical master would be kept but the college for such he had the cheek to call it would henceforth aim at a loftier mark science was the noble and simple distinction the all absorbing element of this age mankind had been lying on their backs till now looking up at the stars and at imaginary powers now they arose and asserted their rights and their kinship to every organic being and the interchangeability of everything classes for science would be formed to morrow under the charge of the four most eminent professors of the period professors brachipod and jargoon chocolous and mullicles at the sound of their names these gentlemen appeared conscience and prudence alike induced me to push jack windsor in front of me because he was both broad and thick chapter xvi no extras being older now by several years than when i had expected to be cut up all alive and having been taught by professor megalow that science is not of necessity cruel i managed to sleep pretty well that night and resolved to be brave in the morning and truly there was no great need for courage which rather disappointed me and cast a slur upon my value as a boy of exceptional interest not one of the four professors took the trouble to look twice at me each had his whole time taken up in fighting for his own tongue and purse their payment was to be by head of pupils whether they fitted the head or not and being four in number they put universal knowledge into four departments each with a bigger name than the other and each of our chaps without ever having heard what the meaning of these big names was had to put down his own however short it might be under sixteen columns out of thirty two headed with the titles of the mysterious studies each of the professors was to take eight sciences for the subjects of his lectures and most unfairly we were not allowed to know the human names presiding over each humanity every single boy of us wanted to sign to be under professor chocolous not only because as a general rule great fun can be had with a german and he is nearly always easy tempered familiar and kind hearted but also because we had heard of his ambition to transmit a nascent tail to his descendants and what could be finer than to help in its establishment and next to him we wanted to be under mullicles although about him we knew very little except that he looked very soft and expected to be disintegrated without notice into his component particles on the other hand brachipod was as sharp and full of points as a cupping instrument and jargoon as dry and creaky with long words as a slow steam roller pounding granite with heavy dismay i sate down and gazed at the broad sheet laid before me at the top were placed alphabetically the names of the thirty two sciences proposed names which it must have been anguish to conceive agony to pronounce and despair to remember under each name was a column for the hapless victim to inscribe his own and at the bottom a merciful notice no pupil need enter for more than sixteen of the above studies during the present term but all will be expected in the ensuing term to proceed to those which they now pretermit the fee for each course of lectures is one guinea payable in advance although i could get on with homer pretty well and had read the first book of herodotus and one of porson's four and some xenophon it took me a long time to make out the name of any one of those sciences i turned to my lexicon and sought for some and for others i hunted in my latin dictionary and seemed to get near some but not to be sure while of others there was no vestige i was not aware yet that the authors of these words are as rash with the classics as they are with logic and maltreat the dead languages as freely as the living i'll tell you what i'll do jack windsor said i'll go in for all thirty two and let father stump up if he's got the blunt for it here goes 'john windsor' thirty twice over what a flood of light those plain words shed on my foggy and thickly fibred brain unwitting as yet of the athenian prototypes of all the pansophists pea for pea in the pods of aristophanes the blunt was the point of all points with these hungry professors and none could be got out of me and yet i should never have thought of that without jack's plain way of putting it so i squared my elbow and sprang my pen and took care that the ink in it was not too round and i said don't jerk my elbow jack it is no time for larks of any sort and then i wrote in fair hand across all thirty two columns these simple words father don't pay for extras they tried it on before but he would not have it signed thomas upmore witness john windsor this was a bold stroke of mine and it succeeded as a bold stroke often does when it has the force of truth behind it as soon as all these signatures of zealots for new learning of whom a great many could not spell their own names had been received in council by our new principal and his four highly cultured coadjutors oh lord where is good english buried there came a squeaky call from their sacred cell as different from old rum's sonorous send him hither as the cry of a mouse behind the wainscot is from the roar of a lion and the boy who had the longest ears made it out to be the presence of thomas upmore is required now i never had any great amount of pluck which is a steadfast element while all my elements were light and fleeting and never would stand up together as in a fine character they must do without going up into the air and turning round a miserable shiver went through my heart and turned my bright cheeks to a sad pale blue so the other fellows said though it recked me naught what manner of boy i might be to look at tommy keep your pecker up jack windsor hit me a slap on the back to impress this counsel which would have taken all my breath away if it had not been gone already think of your dad and all the money he is making stick well up to them that's the only ticket make them all shake in their shoes dear tommy they will send for me next if you frighten them well you will give me pluck to go on with it this was all very nice from his own point of view but i heartily wished that he had to go first to show me the right way of doing it oh jack you are so brave i said if you would only come with me and make believe you had been sent for too i should take it so very kind of you don't you wish you may catch it he replied turning round to be ready for the path of retreat well at any rate come to the door said i to know that you are there will be better than nothing oh bother don't be such a funk jack answered why tommy they won't eat you and he took good care that they should not eat him by bolting as fast as his fat legs would go none of this tended to relieve my mind but i tried to remember achilles and hector and all the brave men i had been reading of yet in spite of them all i took good care so far as trembling hands allowed to leave the door behind me open it was now in my power after fifteen years of growth to go at such a pace with the wind behind me and any wind blowing from a scientific point would surely find itself behind me that if i could only get one yard's start all the science yet invented with the devil at the tail of it might break its wind without coming up with me dat vires animus the whole of my animus was up and eager i thought of all these wise men in our clot pit and out of despair i plucked hope and defiance the longest dining table in our hall which would take thirty boys and their plates on each side had been proved to be not half long enough for the length of the papers necessary for the lantern jaws of science accordingly three long boards upon which dr rumbelow's hermes had cleaned our knives had been brought from his out house and set up with green baize over them to carry ink and papers our new master sat at the end of this length with a brace of professors on his right hand and his left to my innermost parts i recalled these four and was amazed to find that they knew not me principal crankhead waved his hand for me to stand silent at the bottom of the table and then they all turned round and stared at me with the exception of herr chocolous who stood with his chair pushed under the table to assert his upright principles and he seemed to me to be labouring not to laugh the name of this pupil appears to be thomas upmore began mr crankhead the son of bucephalus upmore a gentleman residing in a place called maiden lane instead of expressing his preference for sixteen of the subjects proposed for his study he has stated very briefly that his father declines to pay for what he calls extras he does not appear to have realized that these are the essential parts of all true education boy what do you come here for if you please sir to be taught i said with a courage which surprised me to learn 'whatever is necessary for a liberal education' according to what dr rumbelow says to parents and guardians in this paper i pulled an old circular of the partheneion from my pocket and spread it on the table but father gave out from the first that he never would pay a shilling for extras unless they agreed to take it out in soap take out science in soap indeed muttered professor brachipod forgetting how much he had done in that way though certainly without intending it well upmore tell us if you can remember principal crankhead went on without deigning to notice old rum's prospectus what are the extras as you call them which your father has refused to pay for drilling and drawing and dancing sir and washing and french and bacon for breakfast sixpence a time for the delicate boys and i think there was something about new laid eggs zere is no sooch ting i vill not allow it pass broke in professor chocolous vat you call ze new laid egg have no right to be so called because because it is generally stale professor well upmore we seem to have ascertained what your father considered objectionable but none of them belong to the domain of science your mind is a little confused perhaps as is only natural at your age after giving so much of it to greek and latin now take a fresh paper and put your initials we shall understand them in the sixteen columns of your selection sit down my lad we shall teach you something yet certainly my mind was now confused neither by latin nor greek but by the proximity of such a mass of learning and its manner of foreclosing me with a fog of big words spreading over my eyes and pouring in at my ears as i tried to sound them i took up the pen which had been thrown to me then i put it in my mouth and said to myself it can't matter much what i sign i'll go in for the biggest of the lot to brag of them father likes something that he can't pronounce there was no word of less than five syllables there and a good many of them went up to eleven these i picked out to learn first with my thumbnail after counting upon all ten fingers and then i fell back on the decasyllabic branches of wisdom and got my sixteen but before putting anything down in ink which my father would have had to pay for unless he went down to the county court i found in my mouth a little bit of the stuff a twisted brittle filmy stuff it is which may be the nerve of the quill for aught i know and it saved me most happily from knowing what its name is for it got very easily into my throat so widely was that poor throat agape at the prospect of all those tremendous words and i put the feather end in to try to pull it out and then i began to chew the harl and who ever did that without improving what he was going to write at first those gentlemen still were as eager as ever that i should be shut up and done with while i became unable to share their hurry and desirous to see the case clearly if you please sir i said from the bottom of the table after getting on a stool to be heard all up it the meaning of this paper is that i am going to learn all this for nothing mr crankhead stared at the men of science and with one accord they stared at him and they would have been amused at my mistake if it had not been too serious upmore you have a great deal yet to learn the principal spoke severely do you imagine that science has ever imparted her blessings for nothing i am sure i did not know sir i replied but you said that all these were essential parts of true education and old rum says dr rumbelow i mean in this paper that all those are included in the money for the term but we have changed all that my boy our ideas of what education is are entirely different from those of the obsolete system under which you have been trained hitherto then if you please sir my father ought to have had a new paper sent him before he sent me back to school or how can he tell what he is to pay i am sure that he won't pay a farthing more than he had to pay last quarter thomas upmore you may go the new principal said quite loftily after whispering and receiving whispers you need not return to the schoolroom at all or to any part of these premises except where your clothes and books are you are too benighted and contumacious to deserve any higher education such as you expect to get for nothing branker see that this boy does not communicate with the other boys pack all his things up and put him in a cab thus was i discharged very rudely as i thought from the poor old partheneion now entitled the epistemonicon and i could not help crying at the manner of it because people would say that i had been expelled but branker the new man of all work who seemed to care little about his place at the sight of a shilling in my hand allowed me to have a word or two in the passage with jack windsor jack they have given me the sack i said because i wouldn't put my name down for father to pay sixteen guineas extra if i had i should have been whacked at both ends for certain he would have whacked me for doing it and they would have whacked me worse for not getting the tin you have put down your dad for thirty two guineas mind that and i wish you luck of it stop the cab tommy stop the cab cried jack i'll come away with you in five minutes i must go in and tell them i did it for a lark why i should get double the hiding that you would my governor has got such a host of kids i ran to fetch grip that he might run behind and i waited in the cab for about two minutes and then out rushed jack without any hat on and jumped in and banged up the glass and shouted jarvey off for maiden lane as hard as you can go then we got out of sight in the back of the cab and laughed through the tears on our cheeks at going home so it came to pass that the boiling interest was not represented any longer in those halls of science when my father heard what i had done he shook my hand very heartily and said that he never could have thought i had so much pluck and he would not mind paying half again as much but honestly and on the square you know for my education to go on all right and he would send them his bills just to let them see what a sight of money their establishment had lost and what language i should like to know was all that science to be put in elamites parthians medes at least he said as he looked at the paper of the fees to be any good value for sixteen guineas no father i answered it was all to be told us in english every word of it only very big words of course such words as you couldn't make head or tail of none the more honest for that said father why they make them out of their own heads i could do that if i chose to try greek and latin is what i pay for and this new lot don't know nought of it if it wasn't for my knowledge of the law i'd have a defamation action against them for sending my only son home in a cab like this and not have the manners to pay the fare they have done the same thing to jack windsor you say every mouth in the lane will be full of it to morrow if john windsor would go snacks i should feel half inclined to consider about consulting a solicitor and i believe it would pay i do believe it would i am a public man now and under government i act and such a man should not have his son kicked out by a bunch of those dirty professors bubbly don't open old wounds advised mother our tommy is come home and i am deeply thankful for it how could they help getting rid of him when they never could have taught him half he knows they knew that he had served his time with their master the great professor megalow and how could they open their mouths before him and how could they hold up their heads before tommy when they thought of the pit he led them into aha i see that's it cried father well i musn't be angry with them after all one good turn deserves another and talking of that we shall have no pits left if what i was told to day is true the vestry are going to send a man and two boys all up through our valley in the course of next month with sticks and a line to take measurements and all the rest of it for this drainage scheme well it won't hurt us but i doubt very greatly whether the smell they are sure to make will be wholesome for my workmen i must try to leave more of my stuff about to keep the air fresh and the bad smells away sophy i must be off you might give me a nip of hollands before i light my pipe and while i am at work you and tommy can put your heads together concerning the next thing to be done with a young scamp who has been expelled from school chapter xvii self defence it appeared to me now that my education might fairly be entrusted to myself at least until after christmas time but whether it was that my dear parents were eager to push me on with learning or else that they had enjoyed enough of my company for the present the issue was settled against me and without another week of holidays jack windsor was in the same box with me and his mother and mine laid their heads together and came to the conclusion that dr rumbelow had acted very badly with the aid of a noble manual of epistolary correspondence they indited a joint letter to the new bishop which must have grieved his upright soul he answered right humbly and in few words that he grieved as deeply as they could do at the utter subversion of a wholesome school which would not have happened if he could have helped it but he had never been the owner and only acted under the will of trustees who had not consulted him when he left feeling the deepest interest in his beloved pupils of many happy years he watched the result with sad apprehension but could not interfere with it but for any whose parents desired their removal from the influence of wild doctrines he could with high confidence recommend an orthodox and most efficient teacher an old pupil of his own at oxford an accurate scholar and most active man now doing excellent work in the church this was the reverend st simon cope curate of st athanasius a district church in kentish town armed with this letter the two ladies went to see mr cope and came back in high feather perfectly full of him and of new ideas i could not understand their talk at all and perhaps that was more than they did themselves however i made out that i was to get up at half past five next monday put a strap load of greek on my back and knock at half past six exactly at the corner house in torriano square all this i accomplished not without some groans and was met at the door by mr cope himself i wanted to have a good look at him but entirely failed to manage it so wholly did my nature fall under the influence of his that when i went home at night and father said well tommy what is the new chap like i could only answer i don't know he is not like any man i ever saw before did he whack you tommy went on my father you must want it after all this time he i exclaimed with a lofty air he need never whack any fellow i can tell that of this wonderful man it might truly be said that he was wholly free from selfishness can anything half so strange as that be declared of any other human being that my own little body should go up into the air is exceptional though not unparalleled but for the human mind to leave the ground is an outrage on the laws of gravitation ten thousandfold as rare as any i have yet accomplished and now that i have time to consider it calmly this must have been the reason why i could not make him out even with my outward eyes and probably this was the reason why we all admired obeyed in an instant and thoroughly revered him and yet we found our spirits rise when we got away to people more of our own cast this gentleman never was in a hurry but always calm and gentle and quite ready to be interrupted yet the quantity of work he got through in a day was enough for ten men of his strength twice every day he had service in his church without even a clerk to help him and four hours every day he spent in visiting poor people moreover he always had in hand some article for the great reviews and a heap of other careful work and besides all this and i dare say the hardest of the lot to deal with a score of us day pupils to be taught and fed and tended yet never was one of us ready with a lesson without the master being there to hear him and he more than heard us he poured his own mind with all its clear and vivid power as far into our thick brains as ever it would go so that even jack windsor who had no more taste in his head than a lignified turnip told me going home one night that horace was a fine chap after all when you came to know what he was driving at no other man in the world could have brought our jack to that conclusion now in spite of all this and the spending of every penny that he earned among the poor the reverend st simon cope was not loved at all in kentish town except by a few half starving outcasts and a good many ladies with nothing to do and the reason of this was as plain as a pole he was one of the high church parsons whom the free will of the briton will never accept under the care of this excellent man i got on very fast in nescience as the epistemonicon gentlemen called the classics and history and theology and everything else except their own fads from my very sad deficiency in weight i never was a fighter though often tempted grievously but jack windsor was happily enabled to prove that which has been proved perpetually in town and gown disputations to wit the clear superiority in conflict of the true academic element for as we came home about noon of a saturday with five days and a half of greek inside us in a place where a bridge was we were met only jack windsor and myself by a maniple if they deserve the term from the now adulterous partheneion these were fellows of the lewder sort who had taken up gladly with all the new stuff and were rank with all chemical mixtures without looking twice at them we could see they desired to give us a hiding and they began the base unequal conflict by casting very hard stones at us with pleasure and without disgrace considering the force of numbers against us we would have fled by the road that had brought us but they had provided against this measure by posting large boys behind us there was nothing around us but a world of thumps and the air was darkened with impending fists stop a bit hold hard cried jack windsor with his back against the coping of the bridge give us fair play you lot of sneaking cowards i see a chap who has been at our house and squibbed a wasp's nest with me let me speak a moment to bob stubbs now bob i know you were an honourable chap till you got among dirty foreigners i don't want to fight you 'cos we always were good friends but pick out the biggest of your scientific lot and let me have a fair turn with him while tommy here tackles some fellow of his size you must all be going to the bad up there if you bring a score of fellows to pitch into two in the old days we always allowed fair play being english boys they were moved by this and after some little talk two rings were formed one for jack and his antagonist and the other alas for me and mine loth as i was to fight it seemed better than to be pounded passively and so i pulled off my coat and squared up as my father had shown me he used to do and whether by reason of his ancient system being more practical than the new lights or whether in virtue of my own quickness in hopping away when knocked at i may say without any exaggeration that i hit the other fellow more than he hit me until i was grieved to see him bleed and then i put down my fists and shook hands with him but my own little combat was no more in comparison with jack windsor's than the skirmish between two charioteers of the iliad while their heroes fight jack was in earnest and knew no remorse he had been hit on the forehead by a stone and could swear that the fellow before him was the one who threw it moreover this boy had shouted come on suds with a most contemptuous toss of his head being bigger than jack though not so strong for our jack was built up like a milestone come on suds he shouted come on my lad of lather i'll lather you if i can said jack the battle was long and quick with a spirit of trenchant valour on either side i did not see the beginning because i was strenuously occupied with my own engagement but that being brought to a happy conclusion the boy i had conquered joined me with much good will in observing the other fight and here let me mention that his name was bellows jeremiah bellows of blackpool a prominent orator as everybody knows of the liberal party by and by when bellows and i came up to look there was no mistaking the nature of the fray very little time had been lost in repose between the rounds and the action had been so vigorous and so well sustained that on either side now it was a harder job to fetch the breath than to give the blow whichever might conquer there could be no doubt that the fight was a credit to his school happily for us the noble science of self defence was not yet one of the thirty two taught by the four professors otherwise jack would have long been vanquished for he had not much of polemical skill and i was astonished at his endurance having always found him peaceful but i knew by the way his lips were set and his square style of going forward that his mind was made up to be knocked to pieces sooner than knock under this was a lesson to me than which i have never had a better one in all my life there was scarcely a pin to choose between those two in the matter of affliction jack had got one eye quite bunged up and his enemy had both eyes half way closed the nose of our jack was gone in at the middle and that of his adversary at the end and their other contusions might pretty nearly match yet jack won all of a heap and why because he would rather be killed than yield the other fellow would rather yield than stand the very smallest chance of being killed so when jack came up for another good round his enemy sate and looked at him and thought it would be wiser to negotiate he was not by any means whacked he declared and he went on to prove it though still sitting down as britannia never lets her tail drop now without elevating her tongue to stand for it but his mind was made up not to incur further danger of blood guiltiness after all the insults put upon him jack would not let him off without a clearer understanding either you are whacked or not said he if you are whacked say so straightforrard and i will shake hands with you if you are not stand up again this was plain english the only sensible thing in a case of that kind the other boy looked about but saw no way to shuffle out of it having not yet been prime minister i don't mean to fight any more he said until i perceive the necessity of it at the same time you can see yourself that i am not a bit afraid of you every one who knows me will bear me out in that i could prove it if i had time but there goes the dinner bell and we all must run not from you mind not from you only because we are obliged to bolt likely enough there are people who would be glad to make light of this victory as they do with all those we always lose while blowing up the trumpet in the very new moon if ever we cannot help winning one but jack and i took a natural view of the facts we ourselves had created science had bitten the dust before the powers of ancient literature though the latter had struggled at fearful odds and seven of the boys who had seen it persuaded their parents to take them from the gorgon and apprentice them again to the gentle muse who only strikes in self defence and as soon as my father and mother heard it by reason of my bruises one of which required raw beefsteak they were for ever confirmed in their perception of their own wisdom but alas i scarcely know how to tell the next event in my sad career gladly would i leave it all untold save by mine enemies if the latter would only tell it truly or leave it untold falsely but this it is hopeless to expect there is a certain rancour in all persons of loose politics wherewith to put it liberally nature abhorring a vacuum has stopped the vast gap of their principles and this pervasive bitterness when not obtaining vent enough as it fairly might do upon one another sometimes sets them raking up the private life and domestic history of those who are not like themselves it has been related some way back that the great authorities of our parish having been urged by fussy people most of whom paid no rates at all to abate what they were pleased to call the nuisance of our wholesome smell had arrived at last at a resolution to cure the air of our chimney tops by carrying a big culvert through the valley a hundred yards below how this was to effect that purpose none of us clearly understood but as it would not come near our works yet saved them from being grumbled at we accepted the conviction of the public that it must prove a perfect cure and reasoning by analogy we expected no stroke to be struck for a score of happy years yet to come but joe cowl that same chimney sweep who had tried to summon father told all his friends till he quite believed that he never had been the same man since the time my father syringed him if this had been true how much it would have been to his benefit and his neighbours' but being scant of introspection he positively made a grievance of it he contrived to push himself on the committee appointed by the vestry for the drainage of maiden valley for no other reason in the world than that he hoped to pester us by carrying out that noisome scheme as everybody said there was no reason for such hurry the valley had been a valley for more thousands of years than we could count without wanting a bodkin put along it in wet weather it drained itself and in dry weather what was there to drain the lord had made it as seemed him best and could any ratepayer improve his works nevertheless by stirring up and rushing about with his best clothes on and grouting like a pig with his ring come out and writing every other day to every paper that would print his stuff chimney sweep cowl robbed all the parish of the pleasure of considering the next thing to be done for he made them actually begin this job at very little more than three years from the time of their voting it urgent and not very much over two years from the time they raised the cash for it but we let him see when it was begun that we were rather pleased than otherwise and father went down and told cowl himself with as pleasant a smile as need be seen that he would lend them a spare wheel barrow if they would put new gudgeons in and as a large ratepayer of st pancras he would try to keep them to their work and it is a sad thing now to think of that if he had been a bad tempered man and shunned them altogether he might have been alive while i write this perhaps no man in london except the reverend st simon cope worked harder now than my father did not from any narrow minded hankering after bullion nor the common doom of our species to find its final cause as well as case in specie but from the stern resolution of a man to turn out a good article at a good figure and to keep his own finger and no others in his pie mr john windsor had been trying very hard to dip his own ladle into our warm vats but while father valued him most highly as a friend and would eagerly have done anything whatever that lay in his power to help him he found it lie more and more beyond his power to let him come into his yard just now plump and portly as mr windsor was and equally blunt at either end my father kept calling him as soon as he was gone the thin end of the wedge and telling dear mother to be very careful not to say a word to let him in this was exactly in accordance with my mother's own view of the case and she said that she first had insisted upon it and that if mrs windsor came sounding her for ever as she did even on a sunday it would take her a long time to discover any hollow place in her presence of mind for she always answered oh my dear what do i care for odious business you know how much sooner you would hear me talk about delightful happystowe and the sun coming over the sea and the shrimps and the shameful proceedings of the bathing females for i never can call them ladies and that dear good lady towers twentifold who longed so extremely to make my acquaintance and has written once more for my tommy to go down and spend the holidays with his old friend sir roland at twentifold towers what a pity it is that we live so far asunder but don't you think dear mrs windsor asked demurely that when the wind was blowing towards the windows of the tower her ladyship might object a little to the the flavour of mr upmore's operations chapter xviii ah me while a fact is under fifty years of age surely it is early days to despise it as if in its dotage and to traduce it as a mere tradition yet this was already at the time i speak of done by the wiseacres of maiden lane to the great and well established fact that the cholera when it first appeared in the year had avoided as if it ran away from the feeding smells and pursued the opposite every house where a man could say that he ever tasted our chimney stack on the other hand it had followed strictly as on any good map can be shown the main lines of the sewage system so far as these could yet be traced for as yet they were very bold in places and then vanished without a mouth now if there had been any medical man with power to think for himself as certainly some do in every century he might have chanced to put these two facts together and breed a conclusion and the conclusion must have been increase your chimneys issuing a fine detergent smell and abolish all drains that bottle up and condense destructive odours sending them out with a fizz at the traps to rush into first floor windows but alas there was no such man just then and i fear that even now he is hard to find drain drain drain was the cry of the period and ventilate all your drains that every one may smell them and inhale a rich interest for his sewage rate my father had never been blessed with any scientific education he had thriven most stoutly as his years increased by dwelling in a feeding atmosphere in an unwise moment he convinced himself that a change of inhalation would improve his lungs which were as sound as a bell used to be in the days when people knew how to cast them the only fault anywhere near them was that from the increase of adipose deposit they had not the room to swing that in thinner years they had but he said to himself and to my mother too though she had the sense to say 'nonsense' that a daily influx of entirely fresh odours would enable him to holloa as he used to do did you ever see tommy look so well he asked as when he came back from the inside of the whale i require something of that sort and i shall go and smoke my pipe every evening after tea in the bracing air of joe cowl's drain that sounds very well dear mother answered but i do think bubbly that you ought to ask dr flebotham first what he thinks about it to me it seems a sufficient proof how grand my dear father's constitution was that for more than two months he pursued this medical course as he loftily termed it without any visible harm to himself and to the last moment of his life so stout and solid was his faith in his own mind he declared that his illness had nothing whatever to do with the cause we assigned for it but after looking blue in the face one sunday and suffering from cold hands and feet he came home at night with a desperate headache such as he had never felt before my mother in alarm gave him brandy and salt but he took the brandy and left out the salt on the following day he was terribly sick and as blue as the men at the indigo works and dr flebotham pronounced it a case of aggravated english cholera he ordered strong measures to be taken at once hot applications and a bottleful of chalk with opium in large quantities we must not be nervous my dear madam he said to my mother who was crying sadly our dear patient has an iron constitution and great strength of will and a rare fund of courage why he won't admit even now that there is much amiss with him and nothing will make him stay in bed the recumbent position is the one he should preserve to give our therapeutic course fair play yet he keeps on calling for his boots and would go to his work without them if you left the door unlocked we must humour him my dear madam we must tell him that he shall go to morrow to his most useful and in many ways i am sure delightful occupation without which this neighbourhood would lose one of its most most pungent associations though mr windsor certainly does in his smaller way make a much stronger st stimulate our olfactory powers to even higher action is what i mean and it seems to be now very generally admitted apart from all incontrovertible statistics i may indeed say that it has been proved a priori by our new lights that the chemical constituents which you liberate by rapid evaporation are for hygienic purposes the very ones which nature has omitted to supply but bless me i have a lady doing well with twins you will remember all my directions i shall have no time to dine to day i hope to look in again at six o'clock he lifted his hat and had scarcely time for me to run after him and say if you please sir mother does so hope that you will not be offended if we have a roast fowl on the table hot when you come from the poor lady with the two babies tommy replied dr flebotham that is the very first nourishment your dear father should take in a solid form he must not touch it to day of course but a very small slice quite cold to morrow it should be roasted this afternoon and it must be excessively tender it might be as well for me to judge of that myself it should be a large one and yet very young such as they call capons tell your dear mother that i will try it for him oh thank you sir thank you how very kind you are i exclaimed with the tears coming into my eyes only please to be punctual at six o'clock he made this promise and made it good unless the case becomes complicated said the doctor three days afterwards with cardiac symptoms or pulmonary or possibly renal derangement or any other resultant cachexy of the organisms we may anticipate my dear madam a condition of gradual convalescence why doctor he is ever so much better already my mother exclaimed impatiently he has ordered our tommy to go himself as far as the shop of the famous mr chumps and to try to be back by twelve o'clock with three pounds cut thick of tender rumpsteak and two dozen of oysters from tester's and he is coming downstairs to dine at one o'clock but he is so weak that i shall have to help him deary me what a thing to think of and a week ago he carried me up when i slipped and hurt my ancle and i am not so light as i was you know sir all that i leave now to my son tommy he will never be good weight very few medical men replied the doctor with a pleasant smile at both of us would like to have the question of diet so completely taken out of their own hands but as soon as therapeusis has reinstated our patients though it be but a little they are apt to think themselves quit of us and then there comes the relapse my dear madam then there comes the sad relapse and the blame of it is cast on us he has taken a great many bottles sir such as i never could have believed my mother answered sorrowfully and it will be a little too hard upon him not to let him have his change how much will you please to allow him sir not an ounce if i could help it liquid nourishment for three days more our poor stomach is still most delicate and unfitted for solid food restrict him at any rate to three ounces and the like number of oysters this was easier said than done my father got through a good pound of steak and at least a dozen oysters and after that he felt so well that he had a pint of ale and some of his healthy red returned to him my mother was so pleased with this that she came to his chair and kissed him and he said my dear i thought at one time i never should kiss you no more nor tommy neither but the lord has shown himself most merciful and i don't see as a pipe would hurt me the next day he was so much better that at nine o'clock i went back to school and worked with a light heart trying to make up for the work i had fallen back with and mr cope was most kind to me and said that i did very well i was let off early in the afternoon as mother had asked that i might be and with a good wind at my back i made my way home at such a pace that every one turned to look at me for my lead had been laid aside through father's illness which was weight enough my mother was equally short of breath with pleasure and excitement when she ran out to kiss me and she said oh tommy your father is as well as ever i do believe he came downstairs without a stick and he wrote for an hour about something and then he made a capital dinner and slept a little in the afternoon and dr flebotham came and saw him and said 'my dear sir not too fast you are getting well at a wonderful rate but you must avoid excitement you are not quite out of our hands yet' and then he turned to me and said 'we must be careful of the heart dear madam the heart has had a sharp trial and has borne it well so far as we can see but we must not be too hard upon it while its action is so weak any sudden shock for instance might have very grave results' your father began to laugh at this until he remembered how very kind the doctor had been and so skilful and then he begged his pardon and shook hands with him and the doctor said 'not a bad grip that mr upmore for a hand that was like a swab on monday keep him quiet and he will do ah i shall boast of this case a little and i am sure you will help me madam' and so i will tommy though i never can approve of being called 'madam' like a frenchwoman for your dear father is in such spirits that he has taken an ounce of bird's eye with him and gone to his favourite corner by the tree where the wind brings down the smoke so well and what the people who write in the papers call the 'pestilential fumes' all he now wants to set him up is that and a quart of fresh drawn stout and he said that he would wait for that till you came home from school to fetch it so don't stop now to do anything my dear except to put your slop coat on but run down to the tree and here is the eightpence a couple of joeys as you call them and there's going to be a crab for supper tommy such a beauty from a friend of yours i'll tell you all about it when you come back and you shall have his toes to suck while you help me to do his cream i did love a crab i always did and as the greatest delight in oysters hovers over opening them for no delight does more than hover so of a crab the finest hope is in getting him ready to be eaten and in tasting stolen bits of him you may look at him tommy my dear mother said and there he lay among lettuces with his sweet legs clasped as if in prayer for some one to come and eat them and his fat claws crossed in resignation to the mallet or the rolling pin it was not a sight to cause depression in the hungry human mind neither could that effect be got from a very well browned backstone cake which mother allowed me to smell before she put it back to crisp a bit oh if she had only said my dear boy put your belt on what a difference it would have made but she never thought of it any more than i did and i always tried not to think of it with all these things to set me up and a holiday and a half to come out of the two ensuing days for this was friday afternoon i set off rather at a dance than walk with my arms thrown up and lungs expanded and my broad brimmed leghorn giving flips at the wind like a pigeon's wing and the tucks and gathers and quilted flounces of my blouse lifting and filling in the air like clouds and scarcely so much as a thread of my curls as mother was fond of expressing it that did not glisten in the sun and hover like a crown of golden gossamer instead of opening the gate i flew over it and could scarcely keep between the walls below and i heard mother calling oh tommy dear tommy come back for your belt and i tried to do it but the breeze was behind me and i must go on then where the old weeping plane tree stands at the bottom of our garden and enjoys the smoke there was father on the bench with his back against the trunk and his red plush waistcoat on and a long churchwarden in his mouth and his favourite pewter waiting for the stout and his face so bright at seeing me that i called out father is quite well again as well as he ever was in all his life and he said yes tommy thank the lord i am i've been thinking of you all day my boy come and give me a kiss why how wonderful you look for the joy was more than i could bear and instead of being able to go to him i was lifted in a moment from the surface of the earth quicker than i ever had gone up before now the faster i go up the faster i go round this seems to be a law of my ascents yet i do not remember to have felt much fear and indeed there was little to be afraid of unless it was a fall into our own chimneystacks and in my vile stupidity i even called down now father now will you believe at last alas that my very last words to him should have been of low and unfilial triumph as i tried to look down at him through the tree to show him how comfortable i was up there i saw him rush out with his pipe in one hand from the bower of the drooping branches and he stood with his legs wide apart and his hat off and threw down his pipe and rubbed his eyes with both hands and then lifted them up and cried the lord forgive me that he hath made a son of mine to fly before he had finished his exclamation i could see him no more because of the way in which i was carried round and thus escaped the awful shock of seeing my own dear father fall and before i could look again in that direction the briskness of the wind which was north west had taken me so far that the plane tree came between and i could not see the fearful thing that i myself had done yet somehow or other my mind misgave me that i had left some harm behind and my weight grew greater and greater as i saw no more of father who ought to have run up the hill to watch me as people do to a balloon this made me come down at the bottom of our yard when i might have gone over the regent's canal my flights are always cut short by grief but no other by such a grief as this chapter xix comfort when i came to know what i had done through shameful levity and heedlessness and selfish triumph and greedy ways for that crab had much to do with it also through laziness and self conceit and the absence of humble gratitude which would have taught me to fall on my knees instead of skipping up like a bubble for many hours i lay and groaned and was much more likely to sink into the earth than ever to mount into the air again my mother in her first great shock and anguish had called me a wicked boy and said that i never ought to have been born and i could only answer oh how much i wish i had never been but it was more your doing than mine mother i believe that i should have gone mad after seeing the people come with father's coffin if i had been left in the house to hear and think of all that they were doing for mother was not at all strong minded but kept on falling from one condition of heart into the opposite and sometimes cried by the hour and sometimes laughed at herself for the soreness of her eyes and then it was so clear what father had been by the way that every one spoke well of him so gentle and generous and kind hearted and living entirely for the good of others that instead of being comforted i cried more to think that it was i who had destroyed all this several people took me by the hand or patted my head and made me look up at them all of them seeming to say the same words so far as i took heed of them don't fret my boy don't knock under like that it can't be helped now why you did not mean to do it and you must bear it like a man you know but all this only made me fret the more my heart was so broken that i touched no food and i kept on asking every man who looked at all like an authority to please to get me sent to prison for seven years' hard labour finding no one ready to do this i banished myself to the coal cellar and had a fresh cry with the maid whenever she came to fill the scuttles for no one else came near me now my poor mother being unwell upstairs and the command of the house handed over to people who called themselves her nearest relatives and were so if uncle bill had met with a watery grave as was supposed these people were the stareys of stoke newington a widow lady and her two unmarried daughters beginning now to be old maids mrs starey was mother's half sister yearly fifteen years the elder and so her daughters were my half first cousins and might have tried to help me mother said afterwards when she came to know of all their conduct that they did their best to send me after father and for a very good reason of their own if i were out of the way they would be the nearest to her if uncle bill were drowned as they had reason to hope of him and under my father's will that might be of no little service to them but it is not in my nature to believe that they would act so and even by seeming so to do they lost all chance of everything so much wiser as well as sweeter is it in the long run for us to be kind to one another but to dwell upon this is hateful to me and i cannot bear ill will most likely the truth was simply this that they had quite enough to do with mother lying ill and father dead and could not be bothered with me as well and therefore were glad to be quit of me saying that a boy's grief soon forgets itself and if i did not eat it was because i was not hungry but time and youth would soon cure that and perhaps they might have done so however a man who was not in the habit of judging people harshly the reverend st simon cope was highly indignant with them as soon as he heard of our sad loss he thought he had a right to come and help us as a minister of the lord though we were not in his district and even belonged to another parish mr cope was not at all the man to move his neighbour's landmark and he knew that our parson who never came near us was largely evangelical as the people who went to hear him said so that mr cope came to visit us and was careful to put it so not as a minister of the word but as my tutor in dead languages in whatever capacity he meant to come no sooner did he see how we were placed than he threw parish boundaries overboard and became the true minister of christ it is not for me to tell what he said such matters are far above me and in truth it was less what he said than did and his manner of doing it that moved us i had thought him a very cold man before so little had he shown of feeling as perhaps was needful among boys but now brave tears were on his firm thin cheeks and i sobbed to look at them tommy he said as he drew me forth from the coal which was all over me and he never had called me tommy before which made it sound so kind to me tommy you must get up and wash and take some food and come with me your dear mother is very poorly and i have promised to take you to her it is the greatest comfort she can have but she must not see you look like this have i been and killed mother too will mother die sir do you think the same as my father did through me no my dear boy your mother will soon be well again when she sees you she keeps on calling 'tommy tommy' but they say that you refuse to go to her they told me sir that she never would bear the sight of me again as long as she lived and she keeps on saying 'wicked tommy wicked tommy why ever were you born' and i wish i never had been sir listen to me for a moment tommy not one word of that is true what she may have said at first i cannot tell and you must not think of for she cannot have known what she said i am sure that you have a tender heart and not a bitter one my child you have been afflicted heavily and you blame yourself unjustly your only fault was sudden and thoughtless joy and your mother sees that now she wants you to forgive her for she behaved unkindly and she feels it and if you wish to make her well go up and see her and give her a kiss and let her talk while you say little then she will get some sleep to night she has not had a wink since her sad shock and to morrow she will be well almost and able to face her sorrow calmly for her illness is more of the mind than body but go and do what i told you first and then i will take you to the door thus it was that this good man saved us or me at least from black despair and consequent insanity for who can be sane when hope is dead everything came to pass exactly as he had foretold it though i will not attempt to describe what passed between dear mother and myself such matters are more for the heart than tongue enough that when she was quite worn out with feeling things and talking of them she fell into a smiling sleep and i smoothed the bows of her night cap and tried not to believe how pale she was and how many little sheaves of silver grief had set up in her fine dark hair then when she was fast asleep after having managed with my help to get through a calf's sweetbread which mr cope himself went all the way to mr chumps to fetch for us and there was no likelihood of her wanting me till morning my tutor said tommy you look respectable which could hardly be said of you just now get your nightclothes and whatever you want and reverse the accustomed walk come with me to kentish town and i will bring you back in a day or two but i cannot give you much time to get ready and you will have to walk six miles an hour if he had told me to take his hand for an urgent appointment with the devil i should have done it without two thoughts but the only engagement he had to keep was with his congregation this was at eight o'clock in the evening and counting me and a baby there were eight of us there for the good of it without including the minister this made me think with a turn of tears of a story my father used to tell of his asking the clerk at some church why the vicar had service at five o'clock of an afternoon on week days instead of seven or eight or nine lord bless you sir the clerk replied if we was to go into them long hours we should never keep up with the time of day five is our number at the outside and no more and although the joke was very small it made me smile as a bad joke does when i never expected to have another smile the service moreover did me good though i never heard a word of it he put me with the other boys next day and they were very kind to me knowing the trouble that i was in jack windsor was not there now because mr cope had plainly told his father that he found it useless to go on with him unless there were any downright need of a standard to pass and it must be a low one for the army or for medicine or for holy orders for all lower purposes his tutor said that he was quite up to the average he could write and spell quite well enough and was up to the mark in arithmetic but of latin and greek if by great pressure any more were ground into him there was no chance of it staying longer than the time his nails which he was always biting would take to grow if he left off mr windsor answered loftily for together with his wife he had always taken jack to be a wonder that he considered his son too good by a d d sight for any of the lines of life mr cope had been kind enough to mention and he would take away poor jack that day and put him into his own office where he would learn life instead of burying dead languages now my dear father was in the habit of speaking his mind quite plainly but he never would have spoken like that so rudely and sooner would he have bitten his tongue very severely i am sure than have sworn in the presence of a parson however although jack was gone there were several fellows who had heard all and a great deal more than all about me and my inborn affliction and although they behaved with extraordinary kindness being all on the way to be gentlemen whenever they thought that i was not looking they were looking at me with desire to form their own opinions silently and compare them freely when my back was turned for the result of any peculiarity less conspicuous perhaps than mine is to attract attention and that becomes a curse far greater than the blessing of even the noblest gifts when the doctor was kind enough to spare my mother all the public pain of an inquest by certifying sudden death from failure of the heart after violent attack of cholera it might have been hoped that outside strangers would have gone on their way without meddling so all right minded persons did they had their little talk among themselves and expressed a very natural surprise and agreed or differed according to the peace or pugnacity of character and the matter would have been a nine days' wonder for the nine or ten beholders but for the prying self conceit of a picker up of news for the pratt street express a penny paper coming out on saturdays i will not speak ill of this gentleman for i came to know him afterwards and found him a pleasant and well meaning man he had no intention of inflicting pain and he freely admitted that a sense of duty compelled him to write what he did not believe a word of lest a rival journal should get the start of his my tutor mr cope sent a line to my mother on tuesday to inform her that he thought it would be for very many reasons wiser that i should not be present at the funeral of my beloved father he did not tell me that it was to be that day and i did not venture to ask about it leaving myself entirely in his hands my mother wrote back as it afterwards appeared that she quite agreed with him and would not expect me until all was over that same evening he took me home and asked me on the road whether i could bear to hear a few words from him i said yes whatever he thought fit for my heart was strengthened while i held his hand after words of religious consolation which fell from his lips as if from heaven for the whole of his life was above this world and the preface to a better one he proceeded partly as follows though i cannot put it quite as he did from all that i hear and allowing much for large exaggerations you have a remarkable gift my boy of which i heard something from my friend the bishop from my own observation i know that your bodily frame is of wonderful buoyancy as your mind was also until this sad distress for the time oppressed it you have very good abilities far above the average an extremely tenacious memory quick apprehension with clearness of insight and a love of whatever is elegant which would make you a very good classical scholar with industry good teaching and above all good health that last is the point which makes me doubt the wisdom of pressing you much in that way although you have never known a day of illness until this trouble fell upon you for a body so light can scarcely contain the substance needful for hard work but your duty as to that will depend very much upon what your father's orders were he has left as i happened to observe a statement in writing of his wishes concerning you one of the ladies in the house had opened his desk which had the key left in while looking for some paper to boil the kettle and i fear that she would have used this important paper in ignorance of what she was doing at the moment if i had not asked her to put it back then i locked the desk and your mother has the key it was not a will your mother has his will but to you it should have all the authority of a will these things are important but what i would speak of is from my point of view more important still you know that whatever is given to us is given for some good purpose your mental gifts are not wonderful although as i have said they are above the average but your bodily gifts are quite exceptional i think i may say though i have never studied physics and for them you will have a good account to render but how sir how i asked with some excitement as yet i have only come to trouble through all that please to tell me any way of doing any good with it at present i cannot mr cope replied but as sure as i am speaking to you tommy upmore the way and the means will appear by and by it is your duty to improve your gift so far as discretion and health permit and to await the opportunity for some great good to your country humanity or religion chapter xx boil no more that very evening it was thought wise that the members of the starey family who had come so kindly to our aid should return to the bosom of their own affairs at that pleasant place stoke newington my dear father was so widely known and so loved and admired by all the trade that he received an exceedingly large funeral my dear mother told me how many high firms nearly all of them wholesale were represented but i was pleased only because of her pleasure or rather of the comfort she drew from it moreover there were ancient friends who came as well as still more of new date and even some nephews of the name of upmore with warm recollections of their dear uncle and hopes of a mutual though posthumous remembrance some of these had a good claim to be fed in the hunger and thirst of unavailing sorrow for none of them was down for sixpence and my mother who had made a great effort to attend naturally left mrs starey and her daughters to offer consolation to these mourners among them so deep a flow of sympathy was opened that when mr cope and myself came in all the members of the starey family for our three had fetched the residue were as mr cope said afterwards totally unable stare this made it incumbent upon us to send them home and two cabs were ordered with drivers of well known integrity who received the whole of them and their goods on condition of getting their money as soon as their job was discharged conscientiously only they must get it from the people they took home and not from those compelled to pack them off like all other sensible arrangements this turned out to all reasonable satisfaction though the stareys made a fearful fuss about it grieving to go away at all and still more to do it at their own expense they seemed to forget altogether that when starvation stared them in the face my father set them up in a small candleshop and supplied them for three months on full credit but such is the way of the world and what right have i to be finding fault with it while yet i continue to belong to it when all this was over and my mother gone to sleep i opened the paper which she had given me and with two of our own best candles lit for my father would never have gas in the house to ruin our eyes and to disgrace our business i read every word of it sighing sometimes and sometimes crying to find how good he had been to me who had paid him out so badly and private as the matter was the public having taken such a kindly interest in me might fairly call me ungrateful if i shut them out of all of it neither could that be done without a confusion arising between us my dear father had clear ideas as to his own will and way and while he enjoyed himself much in the world he carried on his work to suit he had written a letter to me to be read when he could no more talk to me though he little thought how soon that would be after things which i need not enter into he proceeded with these words the whole being written in a plain round hand you will see my son that i have worked hard chiefly that you may do well if anything happens to me of a sudden as may be the case after what i have gone through your mother will be well provided for as she has thoroughly deserved of me everything will be at her discretion but i am sure that she will carry out whatever i wish concerning you cut no capers with my hard earnings i think you have too much sense for that and i have taken good care to prevent it none of your high society nonsense which is not fit for a tradesman's son but a steady rise in the world which is according to the laws of england when the business has been well disposed of after completion of all jobs in hand according to the meaning of my will you must go on with your school learning at the oxford colleges where your friend bill chumps has done so well i have had a long talk with mr cope though i did not tell your mother of it and he says that the money will not be thrown away for it makes you anybody's equal except among the nobility you have quite as good a head piece as bill chumps if you will stick to it as he has done and you will see that it pays as well to boil down animals as to cut them up when a man understands the business when you have been through the colleges i intend to send you into parliament that you may flabergast the radicals these are now making so much bluster and getting their own wicked way so fast that unless a firm stand is made against them no man's life will be his own no more than his land or money will robbery is the beginning and robbery is the end of it and in the middle stands the man with the biggest pair of jaws and laughs as he pockets all their thievery if this goes on a man had better lie down on his back and rant all day than labour hard and be robbed of it you have heard me talk of this my son but we have only turned the first leaf yet if mr panclast gets the power he has set his stubborn heart on tommy i am not a wise man nor even to be called a clever one but i am of a sort that is going by and perhaps will be missed hereafter that is to say an englishman of common sense and of fair play and of tidy pride in his country all these are dragged in the dirt by the people now getting upper hand of us and what will come of it they will drag themselves in the dirt and their children until our grandsons are ashamed to say 'i am an englishman' now mind you this my dear son though you have little chance of doing it fight you tooth and nail against the white livered lot of panclast who is he by right of gab and words no more english than himself to upset the meaning of england and the value of an englishman a change will come among the changes he is always starting when people will try to respect themselves and finding it all too late for that will turn against him who has made it so then a very few men without possessing any quality at all wonderful except their love of their country may lay hold of the sense of our disgrace and make it serve for common sense then good bye to mr panclast tommy i wish that i might live to see a son of mine bear share in such an act of righteousness but i hear your mother with the dinner ready and i will go on about it to morrow the abruptness of this conclusion made me as sad almost as anything although i do not see how my father writing so much in prophetic vein could have added anything of more precision for my future guidance i thoroughly understood his wishes from the above brief sketch of them and they agreed entirely with my own so far at least as i had paid attention to such matters very few boys at school as yet had made up their minds immutably as sir roland twentifold had done already and as every school boy now does at once what side in politics is the only right one and how it may best be promoted as soon as we had the time and spirit to look round and think again we could not help admiring more and more my father's wisdom not by any manner of means on account of the sum he had left for our benefit though this turned out to be three times as much as my mother in her most hopeful moments had ever dreamed of finding it it would be unnatural if this had failed to increase her admiration but she wished everybody to understand that of that she thought nothing in comparison with subjects so much higher when coarse people said he has cut up grandly my dear lady i congratulate you and your most interesting son with all my heart she simply waved her hand and said sir you can never have felt as i do money is only an added trouble when the guiding hand is gone and gross exaggerations are made about it and she felt most deeply the great injustice and cruel hardship of paying for probate a sum which made her weep again because of the utter want of feeling exhibited by the revenue however all this had one good effect perhaps contemplated by the revenue to some extent it helped to turn the channels of her grief towards indignation as well as compelled her to look sharp to baffle the harpies of the law by all the resources of honesty and so well did she manage with the aid of mrs windsor who became a very dear friend now and entered into all her righteous feelings that much disappointment and many low suspicions rankled in the stony heart of somerset house but that which my mother and myself and even the lawyer whom we were obliged to employ found the most remarkable was the skill and forethought displayed by father in the settlement of all trade affairs i need not go into particulars now any more than i need state exactly the value of his net estate upon that point there are always people who know ten times as much as the acting executor can discover and are not to be put down by any process of sworn arithmetic though as yet it had not become the duty of any public journal to measure the depth of a dead man's pocket and tell the world how he divided it it will be enough for those who care to follow my humble fortune to know that kentish town camden town islington and ball's pond were wrong though they all agreed about it and if any stranger doubted doubled it in putting it at considerably over the sum of a hundred thousand pounds with regard to the works my father had provided that any government contracts taken before his death should be executed and if any more were offered upon like terms his executors should accept them so long as the conservatives remained in office but if as he clearly anticipated the kingdom were over run shortly by radicalism and robbery the long established firm of upmore was not to be associated with them for they cut down contracts to the uttermost farthing and no honest man could work under them in that case our works must be offered for sale upon certain conditions and terms etc all of which proved his wisdom but nothing proved his wisdom and clenched his words with a sledge hammer power so much as the speedy result upon his proviso about contracts for fear of spoiling my education and attaching a soapy smell to me it was strictly declared that i must keep away from meddling with a business which i did not understand this alone will show the absurdity of the cries now raised for party purposes of soap and dips and where's the grease pot with which i still have to contend when i rise to address our enlightened operatives my father had foreseen i will not say all for no jeremiah could have ever done that but some of the mumbling and blear eyed decrepitude of the british nation which now sets us longing to be boers or zulus or anything but what we unhappily are and this foresight was shown in the result of the very next general election the radicals who are forced by their own consciences to set every other nation in the world before their own came in with a rampant and blatant the former to the friends of our country and the latter to her foes majority of six score at least no sooner was the result made known with a mighty flourish of trumpets and a proclamation of the millennium than a private and confidential circular was received by all substantial and enterprising boilers in it the very ancient date of this typical firm was stated as well as its rare advantages in position and a thousand other things including a vested right in government contracts and a certainty of being bought out at a very noble figure by the committee of the new cattle market moreover ashes were in great demand for a newly formed building company would take a million loads at once to erect a thousand substantial villas entirely upon and for the most part of them everything was going up and off just then like steam and smoke and bubbles mixed as they used to be at our chimney top when a liberal government first comes in it sets all knaves a dancing and even honest folk prick long ears up at the infectious fanfarade of the great rogue's march there are certain to be at once bright summers kindly winters and vernal springs and autumn will stand so thick with corn that even the british farmer may have some hope to get a gleaning trade shall flourish bubble companies abound adulteration alone of british industries be subsidised and every foreign bullet fired into the back of an englishman shall go back ton for ton in gold national securities went up with the certainty that they might be sacked without outlay in defending them and commercial circles squared themselves with the magic joy which precedes the sure accomplishment of the impossible every sort of investment was in demand and everybody expected ten per cent on his capital without posting it even mr windsor a stout old tory fell into the rush of the liberal flood and longed to buy my father's works but my mother begged him not to do so for she would have been loth to see him disappointed and the price was high she told him of my father's caution and he wisely saw its force i am heartily glad that it was so for without that risk our friend and neighbour lost as much as he could afford when the usual relapse set in from braggart talk and swindling promise but while these were new and bright they served our turn without fault of ours and a radical of high faith and sound cash lost both i am very sorry to say in carrying on our fine old trade when these arrangements were complete my dear mother carried out what she knew to be my father's wishes though he had not found time to state them by removing to a house upon haverstock hill which stood in its own grounds and saw as little of london as a genteel villa could wish to do while the omnibuses passed our gate every twenty minutes both to and fro under the lawyer's advice she bought this house when she had tried it and then she set up a cook and housemaid and a boy to do the knives and a pony twelve hands high to carry me when he went quietly or to pitch me off when he was cross and whatever the weather was every day by 'bus or pony or afoot i went to mr st simon cope to learn the classics on week days and to hear him preach on sundays until i became eighteen years old and obliged to go to oxford chapter xxi the seat of learning on the very day before i went to corpus college oxford my mother did a thing she had never done nor allowed to be done before she took me to the standard man who was ready in fine weather then at the corner of the road where people rest in going up the hill to tell them how much they weighed and measured for a penny apiece and anything more they pleased my mother gave him twopence which she said was such a lucky sum that it might save all the ill effects though mr cope had assured her that there could be no harm done by it and after great deliberation with a view to sixpence and measuring me round the chest thirty nine inches and a half and levelling the top of my head at five feet six and three quarters to which i added two inches afterwards he put me on his plate and started backward in amazement must be zummat wrong with this here he said no young gent of that bigness ever could draw under six stone six there's plenty of grown up people does but then they be dwarfs or mites or scrummies but you be a fair grown young gent sir taller and bigger than the average of the british army now a days though not up to the size of the peelers never can be true weight this ma'am will you please step on to try the machine twopence pays for two you know i am astonished that you should think of such a thing my dear mother answered as she turned away i dare say your machine is as right as usual you don't buy or sell by it tommy my dear have your ticket printed and come after me to our carriage entrance i puts you at eighteen ma'am eighteen stone every pound of it the standard man called after her and thereby lost the sixpence which i was holding in my hand for him but as for this young gent if he ain't flying tommy as i've heer'd of my opinion is that he ought to be i was sorry to find that the like opinion or at least a suspicion to that effect had already reached oxford long before i did mr cope had most kindly accompanied me when i went up to matriculate but certainly he would have kept strict silence as to my sad affliction unless he had thought it his duty perhaps to speak of it confidentially to the tutor appointed me by the college and that appointment was rather a formal than a real matter in my time and would scarcely be made till i went into residence i have known many men who could not tell which of the college tutors was their special mentor though in that respect i was very lucky however that may be i saw at once when the college met for the term at chapel that in some way or other my fame had outrun me and i could not ascribe it to my mental gifts which were by no means eminent all the under graduates looked at me with warm but not rude inquiry and even the dons from their lofty thrones vouchsafed me sidelong glances and before very long there was no doubt left for the captain of the college boat club called upon me quite early in the day and apologized for self introduction on the score of public duty as behoved a fresh man i was rather nervous in the presence of one so exalted but he very soon set me at my ease and as soon as the buttery was open i sent for a tankard of corpus ale at his most kind suggestion in a very pleasant manner he drank my health and said that he saw a great future before me if i would only go in for it i begged him to explain which he did at once after asking whether as a corpus man i would let him drop all formality being proud to be called a corpus man a lucus a non lucendo nuncupative i assured him once for all of my good will and freedom from little prejudices thereupon he stood up and asked me to do the same and without further ceremony took me by the collar and with one arm at full length held me in the air without even putting his lips together at first i was certainly surprised a little having heard so much of oxford etiquette but the smile on his face reassured me noble he exclaimed even better than i hoped upmore we shall be head of the river four nights after the eights begin and the beauty of it is that you look quite unlike a feather weight all this was far beyond my comprehension and he laughed again when i told him so why of course what i mean is that we want a coxswain and you are the very man for it our present man is two stone too heavy as well as a bad hand at the lines and no man fit for it came up last term what lines i asked i can say the georgics and all the odes of horace and the three first books of the 'iliad' except the catalogue of ships but i don't know what a coxswain is we'll soon teach you the catalogue of ships he answered with a laugh at his own wit and the corpus ship shall be the first and as for not knowing what a coxswain is you are all the better for that because you can't have formed a bad style yet can you tell me exactly what your weight is i should say well under eight upon this point i satisfied him by producing the ticket of the standard man which exalted me yet more in his esteem six stone six he cried and nearly forty inches round the chest by jove what a stunning coxswain and another pull we shall get out of you with the wind astern your head of hair will be as good as a lugsail and with the wind ahead we can reef it hard my dear boy what a blessing you will be to old corp first and then to the university no lectures to day as i suppose you know i'll just go and tell the other men what a wonderful piece of good luck has turned up and then i'll go down to the barge with you we'll have a day's practice with a fine old tub and if you can't steer pretty fairly by hall time you're a much bigger muff than you look and i'm no judge of fizzy fizzyoggery my name it is green as the poet observes but you don't see much of it in my eye ta ta upmore for half an hour don't go out till i come back we'll fit you up with the water toggery mr green went down my stairs for i lived in a garret of the highest quality even quicker than i could have gone myself though i gladly would have challenged him to a race up and he chanted as he went a loud song of triumph and all these things amazed me what i had expected to find at oxford from the look of the place and from what i had heard was stiffness formality quiet seclusion and above all a classic and religious air bill chumps of course could have told me better but through a number of causes i had seen very little of him lately and the last time we met he had no idea that i was to go up so soon indeed there had been a little misunderstanding between the chumpses and the upmores we had a sort of an idea that since bill got his double first and fellowship at pope's eye he had not cared to come and have his bit of dinner with us altogether in the ancient way whereas mr chumps as i found out afterwards sticking to business as he always did took it amiss and unreasonably i think that when we went so high up haverstock hill and the gate was a good one to turn in at he was never even asked to send his cart with the young man in blue for orders and what made it worse was that gristles his foreman had set up in business on his own account not more than ten doors from the mother red cap which was all in a straight drive from our place so that when he came hat in hand and solicited our custom and old grip knew him and was greatly pleased to see him my mother and i without harbouring a particle of disrespect towards mr chumps pledged our faith to let him call for orders there were other reasons as well why bill had only made a formal call upon us since we came away from maiden lane but if i am to go through every little in and out the course of my narrative will be as crooked as the voyage of the pair oar tub when i first held rudder lines on the isis only it is possible that miss windsor now grown up into a fine young lady may have had something to do with it not only because of bill's tendency towards her but because she happened to hear my mother say when his double first was announced to us that he might thank his father's meat for it no one should ever repeat a thing said without spite yet growing spiteful by mere repetition even as transfusions harmless at first grow poisonous and i am sorry to say that miss windsor had not enjoyed as she should have done our going up the hill this was the thing that pleased me most of all i found at oxford that there never was any ill will amongst us back biting or scandal about one another every young man settled into his own set whether by introduction or connection taste or accident or whatever it might be if he took a dislike to any one as young men ignorant of the world do more than we old stagers he could drop his acquaintance very easily without saying a word against him and no resentment was shown or felt the two men happened not to suit each other each was likely to despise the other but not to think any further harm of him and when we did take to one another i assure you it was something like among civilized people there can be no warmer heart of friendship combining the weakness of the school boy with the set strength of the man and this was how i felt towards green who was the first to take me up and that is how he has felt towards me even to the time i write these words and whatever i say about him he will think as good as can be said when he took me down to make a coxswain of me his good nature and high spirits rendered my coaching as he called it a pleasure and a pride to me he brought no whose name was brown and after rigging me out in a manner which made me think how proud my mother would have been to look at me they put me on the hindermost seat of what they called a tub but to me it appeared a most alarming vessel however i felt no fear of drowning any more than a cork does and before very long i became quite happy the beauty of the river and the trees beside it bright with the april of their hopes and the meadows where the grass began to dimple as the light wind touched it also the skimming of the boats around us and the flashing of the feathered oar together with the newness and the freedom of the scene exalted my spirits to the flying pitch but never again should i transcend the control of this earthly mass through joy whenever the expansion of high spirits would lift me into the soaring vein there comes the remembrance of what i did to my dear father and down goes all alas all my rise into the air since then springs from a darker and a deeper source and one more active in the present age honest wrath at roguery but of that i knew nothing at oxford and little until i became against my own desire mixed up with political and national affairs with these heavy matters to carry through i dare not linger as i would love among the sweet memories of oxford life with a very few lessons i learned enough to steer our corpus eight at practice first and then in the momentous races which began upon the th of may that year the fright i was in that first evening of the races was more than i can describe and it makes me tremble now to think of it but with green looking at me as calm as a statue and brown behind him smiling i gathered up my courage and did my best and we made our bump below the gut and i sent off a telegram to my mother for the wires were just established then we have made our bump which the people in london turned into something ludicrous but she knew from my letters what was meant i am told that oxford men are now become addicted to total abstinence a craze unheard of in my time save as a last resource for incurables and even when we ran the corpus flag to the top of the rope as we did very soon and held a great supper in the captain's room to celebrate this fine event very few indeed of us could be fairly said to have crossed the large boundary of temperance much of the glory was ascribed to me who had earned it only by inanity of which as a lofty merit there were then far fewer instances than now so often was my bodily welfare pledged first in champagne and then in claret and then in port wine and in rum punch next and finally in champagne again that the fusion of physical and psychical emotions plunged me at length into the last new science whose name is hyle ideology green and brown and the rest of our oars were forbidden to exhibit mutuality lest the corpus flag should come down to morrow but the rudder fell under no such restrictions and hard as i strove to maintain a stiff helm it was more than any hand and head could do however they put me in a deep armchair through the back of which they passed a curtain rope then they gave me a tassel in either hand and lifting ship and all upon their heads bore me with a favourable breeze to bed while all of us chanted a nautical song i steered the ship throughout her course with gravity so accurate and so discreetly was she manoeuvred that she never once capsized now this will show whether any one of us could have had one drop too much after this my popularity not only in the college but throughout the university became so vast that the difficulty was to get a bit of victuals in my own room all my friends enjoyed my simplicity of mind and maiden lane views of the world which were not at all socratic platonic stoic nor even academic moreover they found me so glad to be taught and so grateful and unpretending that they taught me every kind of light learning they knew so that i got on wonderfully in every study never contemplated by founders and benefactors happily indeed for me athletic contests were as yet most crude otherwise my speed of foot before the wind would have hurried me into a world of troubles we had a few college races and even some rudiments of university work but as yet nothing powerful and glorious how should i have felt after being chosen to run against cambridge for the hundred yards the quarter of a mile and the hurdle race if there had been a stiff wind blowing in my teeth at the starting post all this would have probably fallen upon me if the athletic contests had then been in vogue and i might have won everlasting fame or base disgrace for ever as it was i believed though the whole is now forgotten that i had established deathless fame by steering the oxford boat three times to victory over cambridge it was natural perhaps that i should be chosen for this distinguished honour as the coxswain of the first crew on the isis and nearly two stone lighter than any other coxswain on the river while looking as big as bow almost and with some crews bigger yet from my low self estimate i was taken by surprise when the captain of the university boat club wrote to me and even begged me for the sake of our university which had been beaten three years running to accept the office will a duck swim will a dog bark will a frog hop will a liberal run away without a moment's thought i accepted and thus began a course of triumphs for the stronger colour which made the very cabmen shy of mounting the light blue rosette chapter xxii hereditary laws what man has not described or made believe to be describing the race which the journals delight to call the inter university contest what marvel that we have sold our birth right to an acephalous mollusk when the simple use of the tongue has passed into such headless mongreldom self consciousness compels such creatures to befoul their origin i tommy upmore am not a bit better than any of my neighbours not half so good as most of them for i know my own faults and i don't know theirs or at any rate don't want to know them but what should i be if i hearkened to a foe who takes out of me every gift of god and turns me adrift to act by nothing but the standard apes have formed for me truth is great and shall prevail he shouts and to show her greatness proves that she never did exist till now happily this stuff never troubled us while i was at oxford we looked upon the chosen spirits of three thousand years and more as likelier to have left things worthy of our heed and sequence than the half taught men who spring up now and by dint of smashing make a row the pudor and verecundia of youth were still existing and we looked up to our college tutors and university lecturers men who had made a life long study of the work they dealt with who attempted not to gloze our minds with universal smattering but forced us to learn of some few subjects what is knowledge and what is not and this was the distinction mr cope had first tried to drive into me but no man not di cephalous as some of our ancestors have been according to the scientists can manage to serve two masters well and being thus apprenticed to the river i neglected the aonian heights my mother believed and mr cope assisted her in believing that i might have done very well in the schools though not so grandly as bill chumps but i passed all examinations fairly with my solid grounding and in the final one obtained what was called an honorary fourth this satisfied my ambition though some cuts at me have been made about it by people who knew no better grip who had been for so many years my trustful and trustworthy friend and had taken the warmest interest in my trencher cap which he cracked up and leading strings which he pulled off was immensely pleased with my bachelor's gown although himself a benedict throughout the whole of my first term mr luker the celebrated dogman had kept his brain at boiling point as he confessed most frankly when i became his admiring client to make this noble dog his own with the choicest liver he waylaid him and the sweetest female blandishments and grip with either dewlap laughing accepted all kind overtures but enfeoffed himself to none of them at last a very large sack was made of tarred material treble thick and grip overcome by his love of the beautiful was inveigled into it but no sooner did he find his tail shut in and feel the philistines on him than he rent their toils like a bursting shell and flew among them like a charge of grapnel thereupon mr luker came to me and explained his disappointment about the dog and assured me that if he could only have got him he might have made a hundred pounds of him to go to egypt and do more than england can put courage into the native animal and he undertook if i would come to terms to pledge his sacred word of honour that neither himself nor any other gentleman in oxford or in london should interfere with the honesty of the dog alas poor dogs whose honesty depends upon that of their master then mr luker set before me in words whose eloquence i cannot reproduce the loss not only personal but national not only national but universal if grip were allowed to depart this life without issue legitimate and guaranteed to him the survival of the race of grip was of infinitely greater moment than the continuation of the blood of shakespeare or sir isaac newton men comes and they goes he said and the dooce himself couldn't pick half the ins and the outs of them but when it comes to dogs mr up you can follow the breed as true as their own noses is so we came to a compact that he understanding this elevated subject thoroughly should provide for old grip as meet a consort as knowledge of the dog world might produce and that i should have the pick of baby grips whenever i gave a certificate of race as soon as each family was two months old thus i was enabled to fulfil old promises made to sundry friends especially sir roland twentifold and jack windsor and i always knew which pup to choose by following the law of paternity among dogs that the father growls most at his noblest son perhaps it was good for us both for surely i was idle enough without him that my old friend sir roland had made up his mind to have nothing to do with oxford when the institutions of the country are in danger he said the last time he came home from harrow a man in my position must not waste three years the very week after i am twenty one i shall be returned for twentibury toggins will vacate the seat to order i shall stick to it till there is a vacancy for the county and then we put toggins in again upmore it is quite right that you who have never been out of leading strings should go into them for three years more and get among fellows who may do you good but for me it would be folly to waste three years and know less at the end than when i began why at twenty one i should be a 'junior sophist' or whatever they call a man who has passed his little go and i should have to wait a great deal longer if i meant to equal chumps i don't want to equal chumps he is a wonderful fellow and i mean to make him useful but that is not my line of life i don't care a penny for the classics but i care every penny i possess for the reputation of my country and when he came to see me at oxford as he did one summer term his talk was chiefly to the same effect i am afraid you are a very lazy lot he said you don't seem to me to have anything to live for except to play cricket or pull or smoke or spoon upon girls in confectioners' shops this was meant for me who had taken him to see what lovely brown eyes a very nice girl had at a place where we ate ices but master roland clever as he thought himself little knew why i admired those brown eyes which i may or may not have time to explain hereafter and when you have done all that and yawned and perhaps played a horn out of the window very badly or cards yet worse you can go to bed as happy as if you had done a great day's good pish i am very glad i never joined you i want bigger games than yours this made me feel unhappy as if i were despised whereas the wise men of all ages have continually told young men to take their enjoyment while they can going far towards proving at their own expense that folly has more joy than wisdom but sir roland did not mean all this and i took it for nothing but his way of talking because he would have liked to be among us but saw that he had thrown the chance away my idea of life was to spend as much of it for other people's benefit as they permit in which matter they are most contrary and the rest for my own good with honest enjoyment and the certainty of better things to come if i do not labour chiefly to anticipate them here and when i say my own good i mean of course the good of my country and relatives and friends without which my own could not very well exist and after all politics are a very small part of the general life of most of us unless our character becomes involved and our self respect grows downward like a troublesome toe nail that affects our walk by reason of base things done in our name against our consent and conscience and unless we see things given away which our fathers gave their lives for and unless we are plagued by nursery acts of parliament very good for the unbreeched it matters but little to most of us whether the first lord of the treasury be a conservative or a liberal with such things i never troubled my head even when i grew to be a bachelor of arts until sir roland twentifold came driving me about them and his strength of will was tenfold mine roly i said when i had kept my master's term and enjoyed it rarely among old friends without a stroke of work you will never get a bit of good out of me i am not eloquent i have no gift of speech i tried it at the union once and when everybody cried out 'bravo tommy' i could only laugh and thank them and sit down if my father had been a rad when he brought me up as he had been in his early days no doubt i should have been a sound rad too and for that matter so would you i do believe if you had been brought up to it i know at least a dozen very honourable rads some of them very clever fellows too who would no more think of doing anything mean if they had the government of the country than you would yourself if you had it all your own way then why should we cry out before we are hurt because it's too late to cry out when we are what you say is true enough my good tommy those friends of yours are all honourable enough individually i dare say though the less you have to do with them the better but when they fall under the dominance of party what becomes of all their scruples they sink their own wills they efface themselves according to the expression now in vogue they fall under one imperious mind and no difference is left between black and white my father kept hounds as you have heard me say and when i was a small boy i rode my pony with them there was one most obstinate old stager of the pack who had a wonderful nose while he was young and had taken the lead of all of them but when he grew old he went all abroad yet the rest had to follow him all the same on a false scent more often than a true one at his dictation all the younger ones from habit sank their own better perceptions and loyally rushed after sheep or donkeys or anything he gave tongue to but all these things we can talk of better when you come down as you must next month you have only been once to us since you lost your father more than five years ago and my mother always says when i go home 'have you brought ariel with you at last' how wonderfully kind she has always been to me i answered liking soft thoughts better than the hard flash of politics if she wishes to see me again my duty is to go to her well that is one way of putting it a painful duty my dear tommy we will try to make it a pleasant one you can't shoot though people shoot at you when you take a flying fit come down in july and stay three months and i'll make you a first rate shot by the time the partridges are ready you learn everything like smoke you see i'll back you to beat counterpagne on the first though he has been at it all his life you forget one important point i answered hoping that the objection might not prove fatal when a gun goes off it kicks very hard they tell me and it seems too probable that it would kick me over not a bit of it if you lean forward you are easy to take up but you are not at all easy to put down master tommy you are as quick as lightning to begin with nature has provided you with that no doubt to atone for your want of thunder don't be always running down yourself there are very few fellows who can do what you can even if you have altogether dropped your wings through the gross feeding of these oxford butteries but i mean you to put on your wings again i have a whole lot of things for you to do and flying is a most essential part professor megalow is coming down now that i am of age and all that sort of thing he can stop at the towers as long as he likes i am sorry to inform you that he is a rad but a man of his size may be anything he likes without being any the worse for it i intend to consult him about you tommy how we may launch you on the clouds again i have not seen him for years i said if he is going to be there 'twill be enough to make me fly again chapter xxiii a county meeting how easy it is for a good natured man to be taken for the opposite and yet how hard for ill natured people to put on the guise of kindness not that the world is distinctly divided into those two classes for the greater part of it have mixed natures and are operated on by the mixture there scarcely could be any one with a better nature than sir roland twentifold he was large hearted quick hearted soft hearted too when touched at the proper fibre and yet any radical stranger who met him would have thought him the opposite of all these he had private and personal motives which he disdained to speak of as being too small yet perhaps they were the spring of everything for strongly abhorring what he called the faction now ruining this country i never could believe that any faction would be so factious as to harm their country knowingly and of set purpose yet this he believed from the bottom of his heart and it cannot be denied that their words and deeds have gone far to bear out his assumptions it must have been the third week in july and the prime of a glorious summer such as we never are blest with now when i had the happiness of visiting once more the noble towers twentifold the woods and the hills and the meadows and even the hollow places that faced the north had cast away the shivers yet preserved the freshness of the cooler time of growth many of the fields were lined or hillocked with the peaceful tide of hay which is late in coming into harbour there while upon the forward slopes green corn was wavering into fluent pathways for the wandering wind and among all the view of the land flowed in that faint reflection from the distant sea which looks as if light threw a shadow of itself blessed was this neighbourhood to have no railway out shrieking the sea gulls out reeking the whale and even out roaring the sea in a storm the station was so far away that good sound people let their journeys depend very much upon the weather which is the proper thing for them to do and after the abominable rush of london which never should make any fuss about smells that it never has time to blow its nose at there came into my heart such a quietude of comfort that i begged the groom who was sent to fetch me sir roland being absent at a county meeting to drive as slowly as the horse would go for several years now i had been as happy as anybody ought to wish to be i had plenty of money through my father's labour and my mother's liberality to keep myself and to help a friend without wasting any upon that third desirable object in solon's opinion the punishment of an enemy i was blest with plenty of friends but cursed as yet with no single enemy and though many of my friends were poor they had too much pride to sponge on me beyond the mere fringe of a turkish towel i had liked a great number of girls here and there in a strictly moral and moveable way so as never to get any heart ache about them any more than they got it about me and as for polly windsor who had seemed to be marked out by the finger of commerce as my bride she had certainly shown herself kind and obliging after we moved into our new house and had helped my dear mother to spend much cash in adorning it with hideous devices but as soon as bill chumps came back from oxford with his double first and his six feet two to read for the bar at lincoln's inn she became too personal and i might say bodily in her sentiments to suit my taste do you mean to grow any more tommy she had asked as if love were a question of inches why mr chumps must be a foot more than you are though you have got your heels three inches high on account of the curve of my foot i answered and she knew what i meant though too delicate to say it for her feet were like a pair of soles without any right and left to them and this made another little breach between us moreover there was now in my mind as there always had been indistinctly the remembrance of a pair of sweet brown eyes which used to grow bright and dim with mine in the joy and grief of early days i knew without thinking about it that laura twentifold was far above me far out of sight beyond poor me in birth and beauty and goodness also i knew that she was intended to marry her cousin the earl of counterpagne for the good of the family and of the kingdom too none the more for that could i help longing to see what she was like now time was come for her to be quite a full grown young lady with a will of her own as i heartily hoped and a kind recollection of her old playfellow since the time of the whale i had never beheld her except in a great many dreams of the night because she had been sent from home to learn foreign language and every accomplishment the dinner bell was ringing as we drove up to the door for her ladyship held by the good old fashions and would have no new fangled gong in the house and i had only a quarter of an hour to make ready so that i was not at all done up to my liking failing to find as always happens in a hurry some of the things that were most becoming this flurried me doubtless and heightened my colour so that i blushed at my own red cheeks but anything was better as my own sense told me than to keep ladies waiting for an unimportant young chap like me when i entered the drawing room lady twentifold looking more beautiful and sweet than ever came up and took me by both hands and with all the friendliness of early days touched my forehead with her smiling lips at her graceful condescension tears gleamed in my eyes and she took them for the thanks i could not utter then professor megalow with his gentle stateliness enhanced by the silver now appearing in his curls shook hands with me cordially as if i had been his equal and said some of the pleasant things which were always ready for his pleasant voice i could not help feeling ashamed of myself having never done anything to deserve such friends we must call him 'ariel' no more i fear lady twentifold said to the professor with a smile we must get you to invent a new name for him out of the depths of your palaeontology i think we must allow him to name himself as some of my animals have had to do what shall we call you my old confederate everybody seems to call me tommy i answered finding this the truth and it sounds more natural than any other name one of the examiners forgot himself and called me mr tommy in the schools instead of mr upmore then come mr tommy lady twentifold replied and let me show you an old friend whom you have not seen i think i may say ever since you were my ariel laura do you know who this is the loveliest maiden the eye could light on even in a flight among the angels came forward from the shelter of the summer curtains and looked at me with shy surprise it was a very short look and yet it has lasted in my heart all life and will last there through all future life each of us wanted to say something but neither knew exactly what to say so we only shook hands and waited for the easier times of talking we never wait for roland now he is so busy our hostess said to the professor he has scarcely time to feel the necessity which others feel for nourishment when he is an older politician he will not live entirely on politics zeal is the great point in any pursuit he answered as she took his arm unhappily it cools too often before it is replaced by habit but in his case it will not be so he has more than zeal he has constancy sometimes i wish that he had less lady twentifold answered with a little sigh while her daughter came for my timid guidance when there are so few of us it seems hard that the public should claim so large a part we dined in a snug little room and at an oval table i believe for our small company would have looked forlorn in the grand old dining room for my part though the professor talked as he did when he chose most wonderfully with rapid turns of pleasant thought and leaving for slower minds suggestions to bear fruit at leisure i remember nothing but the smiles and gaiety his bright humour spread the smiles especially i rejoiced in not my own but sweeter ones which thus i had the happiness of watching and sometimes of sharing in are not all sweet smiles the offspring of a sweet reflection and therefore can they be complete until themselves reflected beautiful laura at every smile looked up for me to share in it and thus our eyes made bright acquaintance and our minds went on together without any need of words and every now and then she asked me some little question about myself which made me proud to be myself for the sake of such fair memory just when the dinner was over the youthful master of the house came in and after the proper apologies told us that he had glorious news that day toggins the member for twentibury had been brought to see the error of his ways at last being led however lamely to wholesome repentance by a very serious attack of gout his first righteous act had been to sit up in bed and sign an undertaking to apply for the chiltern hundreds at once so that the writ might be issued before the prorogation in august according to sir roland he ought to have made that application a year ago and more in fact upon the very day when the heir became of age but mrs toggins who had a good deal of money liked the mp behind his name and urged him to forego the only honourable course what can be done with a warming pan that slips out of its handle here it is mother he can never get out of that my dear friend shouted as he cast an unfolded letter among the glasses i got hold of his doctor and his parson too could his colchicum work when his conscience would not and between us we beat the old lady altogether and she now declares that it is all her doing ah that's what i call a county meeting something like 'organization' there he began to get better with alarming rapidity as soon as the weight was off his mind and i promised him the best glass of port he ever tasted if he would dine here on the day of my return then i thought it safer to set off with this i have had my dinner let me drink his good health professor megalow was delighted with all this young enthusiasm for anything natural always pleased him whether it were radical or tory and sir roland's sister who loved him dearly got up and embraced and kissed him but his mother tried vainly to look glad and said the very things she thought and felt according to her loving and simple nature i am trying to be glad for your sake roly because you have so long wished for this and no doubt it is right that a gentleman should keep his promise as he has done at last i suppose that the country has a claim upon you as you say and feel so deeply at the same time i think it might have left you to me for a few more years at least there is nothing particularly bad going on just now that i am aware of and even mr panclast seems to promise a great deal more mischief than he carries out if there were any great national disgrace for you to stop i would gladly spare you even if i had to sit up all night but when there is nothing not even for a man to marry his sister why should you work so because said sir roland it is too late to begin when a thing is over the most reckless lot that ever held the reins or flung them on the horse's back and lashed him are now in power and what sort of power the power to go at a furious pace without caring how many people they drive over or what neck they break except their own no power to stop and consider their course or regard the ancient landmarks and no care how they smash up a fine old coach not a stick of which belongs to them professor megalow i beg your pardon i forget things when i get excited that is better than remembering them the professor replied with a courteous bow we have never had a great legislator who did not begin with strong prepossessions this and the sense of his own mistake brought the young host to his manners again the ladies departed gracefully and we had no more politics but a great deal of far more interesting things including some soft sweet songs from laura until my friend took me to smoke a pipe with him in his own little room before going to bed now we can say what we please he began after giving me his own pet meerschaum which he had begun in strict confidence at harrow what strange things we do come across how can such a great man as the professor ever have become a liberal i shall spare some of them for his sake while i slash at the party in general to my mind it seems almost to prove that some of them must have high principles though they keep them out of their performances no thank you no cigars for me a pipe soothes me a cigar only irritates i like to see the fruit of my own works not to cast away the root when done with and now my dear tommy the next job is to bring you in for north larkmount larkmount is a fine constituency consisting of honest freemen or at least they always turn the poll but we can't get you in just at present i'm afraid however that won't matter much i shall not say a word this session but see how they do things and get acclimatised but i don't want to get in at all i said or at any rate not for a long time yet i would rather enjoy myself for a year or two and be an ma before being mp not so you must buckle to at once i have arranged it all with the greatest care not another session must be lost before i have you and chumps to back me the enemy have several evil works on hand and they will invent a lot more in the holidays i shall have in chumps for his great abilities and you beloved tommy for your flying powers i do not like that way of putting it at all i replied with my usual frankness i cannot fly now any more than you can and if i could they would not let me in the house of commons that shows how much you know about it if you had been up in the gallery as i have to see what they were at night after night you would know that they were as larky as a lot of schoolboys i got professor megalow down here as he thinks because of the pelvis or whatever he calls it of a mighty dragon in the cliff at happystowe but really and truly my dear friend that he might put you on your wings again or else show me the proper way to do it then you have behaved very badly i exclaimed and not like a friend but a selfish politician chapter xxiv old bones and young ones so much was i vexed at this idea that sir roland towers twentifold valued me only as a flying puppet a machine to be started from a spiral spring or a little boy's coloured balloon that i assure you although i was on a bed soft as a dew cloud for we did not lie upon cast iron yet scarcely a wink of sleep came near me without being scattered into a fire wheel of dreams if it appeared to me a small thing as it did in modest moments that i should be brought from london like a tailor to take orders or a fellow to exhibit punch and judy yet how could i reconcile it with the fitness of things that professor megalow should be tempted with the very biggest dragon for his bait to come down upon the really ignoble errand of flipping me up like a pith ball of elder between the plates positive and negative at first i thought of consulting him as to what i should do in the morning for who else could advise me so kindly or so well but i saw that his counsel was not to be had without a disclosure of everything and i had no right to tell him of his own mission here so that on the whole i was compelled to act as i nearly always find to be the case with me by the dim light only of my own perceptions i have no right to make any scene i thought neither is it possible for me to leave abruptly without giving reason lady twentifold has been most wonderfully kind to me ever since she first saw me and she can have no paltry political motive such as this one idea'd roland has and then there is beautiful laura sweet laura i suppose i ought to call her miss twentifold but consider the years i have known her there never has been anybody like her since the days of paradise and how dreadfully rude i should appear to her of course i must never think of her at all any more than i might of the pole star still i should like her to think of me if she ever deigns to do it with all kindness and good will ah ha lack is the luck i am a most unhappy fellow my mother said once that i had no right to be born and who should know so well as she but before i had quite finished doing my hair as the ladies express it and mine very often took almost as long as a lady's to do because of there being so much of it sir roland came thumping my dressing room door and with his usual impetuosity rushed in tommy shake hands like a man he exclaimed or i'll pull all your hair out of trim again you cut up as rough as a clinker last night the first time i ever saw you out of temper however a new hope sprang up in my breast do you know what you did as you went along the passage no i remember nothing except that i said to myself 'i am not a machine and i won't be treated as a machine if he only wants me as a jack in the box ' a tommy in the box you mean no no you must lay aside all those small ideas it is not i that want you it is your country your noble but outraged fatherland those are the sentiments that should exalt you instead of petty wrath against your ancient friend but i see a new provision in the laws of gravitation which panclast will bring in a bill to abolish before we are very much older in your anger you tried to stride loftily as behoves the most illustrious of all coxswains but instead of so doing you never touched the ground you flitted without any coarse agency of legs like the ghost of achilles at the great deeds of his son well i thought there was something unusual about it i answered without any heroism but my mind was so occupied with its wrongs that i never noticed how i walked that is another most excellent sign temporary absence of perception the main point will be to enlarge the indignation to ennoble it to make it national instead of individual your course of reading at oxford even though you read nothing there at all except novels has produced in your system a fundamental change in your early days exhilaration carried you over the heads of the public you have seen too much of the world by this time to be exhilarated any more joy can no more elevate you and nature rejoicing as she does in exceptions has found a fresh way to keep you in the list but a perilous turn of the balance for you i am sadly afraid dear tommy joy is not frequent even in the days of boyhood but indignation oh tommy tommy what a lot of lead pipe you must carry round you if you once become liable to leave the earth every time you see wrong being done upon it clear out said i i want to finish dressing and not to be plagued with immoral reflections if you want to spare me all that lead pipe regulate your own conduct first by the lofty standard you want to bring me up to that little business about toggins for instance might force me to put on a pound or two though a lily white act in comparison with the things you do at election time to enter into that matter did not suit him while in his present fine vein of morality so that he only made a face being still a boy as much as i was then he pulled in his tongue and tapped his lips and said not a word about that to the professor mind i have boasted to him about the purity of everything and he has promised to come and be gratified and gratified he shall be by everything that is noble now look alive i shall have a busy day to day i mean to go canvassing though of course i need not do it but i am sure that the women would be angry if i didn't and with this clash of changes coming it is not only wise but necessary to keep them on our side as they are by nature if nothing else showed the conservative cause to be the true one it would be enough that the women always take to it with this which moved me a great deal more than the rest of his arguments put together he set off to shave himself which he insisted upon doing now and then with a competent eye to the future and no sooner was he gone than i set to to get everything about me into the proper place that i might not be taken at breakfast time for a young man at all of a radical turn this made me late though i had got up very early earlier than any other of the party except professor megalow and when i came in he was describing with his usual clearness and quietness the object of his labours it is still in situ in the composite bed none of which is of hard material and indeed it would be easier to extricate it perfect if the matrix were more consistent we shall want a very careful hand to day and at the same time light feet under it unhappily i am a little above the proper scientific stature neither can i any longer claim the flexibility of my earlier days unless i can secure a very able coadjutor such as i once had the good luck to obtain there will be great risk of injuring one of the finest specimens of the noble deino saurians i have ever had the fortune to behold let me try to describe to you the exact position which makes the extraction so difficult this he did so well that i could see the place though without any idea of the treasure it contained he asked if he might take some dry toast and with it built up a rough resemblance of the cliff and excavation then he lodged in the back of the hole three joints of a prawn to represent the relics of the monster and shored up the crumbling of the toast with a stump of lead pencil and some sprigs of parsley the position is rather precarious you perceive he said to lady twentifold and her daughter who watched his frail structure with great interest and of the people you sent most kindly to help me yesterday morning intelligent as they were and very obliging there is not one who goes into this bower without some trembling and a superstitious awe they are not so much afraid of the cliff falling on them as of the outrage they fancy they are doing to some unknown gigantic power 'could he eat me sir if he come to life again' the bravest and biggest of them asked me one of your under keepers i believe 'certainly he could if he were carnivorous' i was obliged to answer and that last word frightened them beyond all former fear now i could extract this grand relic by myself for i am not beneath average human strength if i ventured to make more headway but you see that in brittle material such as this i am afraid that the whole might fall suddenly and perhaps destroy the beauty of the specimen and even without that i want another hand most sadly it need not be a very strong one for i would bear the weight of this the heavier end but it must be a hand that does not shake as i am sure the bold gamekeeper's would why i will come and help you with the greatest pleasure exclaimed sir roland and obey every whisper my canvass at twentibury will do to morrow this is of infinitely more importance it is most kind of an eager politician the professor answered with a grateful smile to show such preference for the bygone world but alas my dear friend you are much too tall there is no room for you at that end of the cave then professor megalow may i go with you miss twentifold asked with her lovely eyes sparkling i am not very strong but my hand is steady and i should enjoy it so dear mother say that i may go and help i would put on my shrimping dress and a thick cloak i could not help looking at her with alarm while i did not yet like to out bid her for her wish lady twentifold glanced at her with pride but serious misgivings about the risk and the professor firmly answered no being thus relieved i was only too glad to offer my services which were at once accepted tommy is the lad cut out by nature for this very operation the professor said kindly as he took my hand which was hardened by long use of the rudder lines he is a model of strength so far as light weight permits and his lightness of touch has long been proved if i had my pick of the young men of england for a job like this i should choose our tommy but i may come and see it without being in the way i am sure mamma will let me do that cried laura and the professor cannot be hardhearted if he tries and i particularly want to go to happystowe to day if you will be burdened with her she may go lady twentifold said to her visitor and i should like to join you in the afternoon or meet you perhaps upon your way back for i must be at home till two o'clock things were soon ready and we three set off in a light waggonette for happystowe and but for one thing it would have been hard to say which of the three was the happiest the professor with his bag of sacred tools was glowing with the prospect of a mighty prize in his special field of glory and the tangible proof of his own inductions published in a treatise ten years ago his fair companion was beaming with the brightness of her own youth and beauty and the joy of the air and of a day among the rocks with her sketch block and her shrimping net but i by reason of that one thing i was happier than three times three or nine times nine of all their happiness a fig for the science and the old dry bones the traces of the lubbers that deformed the earth for they were too big only to disfigure it till beauty was created to make them die of shame and a fig even for the blue sky and gray sea and brown rocks standing up to be painted if only i might watch laura's face without any token of doing so catch the glint of a smile that began far away and sometimes receive to the home of my heart a gaze of good will all intended for me i would gladly have dwelt in that happy waggonette till all the old dragons came to look for their bones with laura sitting by my side and laughing and often saying very simple things and the professor opposite to balance us enjoying as he always did the company of the young and nodding in his humorous way for me to explain to this young lady some of his less recondite terms as if i were an acolyte at least of science he did it on purpose i am very well assured because he perceived the condition of my heart and desired to promote it by the action of the mind being steadfastly liberal and taking a very large view of genealogy he discovered no unfitness of things whatever in my tendency to a deep tenderness towards a member of the race so far above me but that most delicious drive was gone in no time as everything delicious is we put up of course at the twentifold arms where several of the maids remembered me and mrs roaker was most generous and it seemed to me one of the most delightful traits in the character of professor megalow that he should be so wholly wrapped up in his tools as to make it my duty to hand miss twentifold down the three steps of that fortunate carriage she never said oh no thank you i have my bag to hold and i can get down very well as girls do generally whom it is a very small privilege to help down but she gave me her beautiful hand with her beautiful foot on the step and her beautiful eyes for a moment met mine so that altogether i was quite overpowered with the sense of beauty and which is yet greater in the end of goodness the professor's face wore a truly scientific air as he noticed these things for nothing ever really escaped him and he rubbed his nose gently as he gazed at the far offing as if he had descried there a palaeozoic ship chapter xxv on the rocks few and far apart the days are such as came out of the heaven just then when the stoutest briton and his wife can find no hole ready made or to be well picked in the weather and what is the good of the finest weather to him if he employs it in picking holes in his friends or his enemies or even in himself but any one who loves large ways and thoughts or even little ways when they are good natured might have looked with true pleasure at the professor for the first and at laura and me for the latter enjoyment professor megalow heartily enjoyed the company of young people and old hats and to day he had put his great head into a hat with very good reason to assign for it of fine archaeological interest and even if things had been as adverse with me as they were for the moment prosperous no moderate misery could have held its own against the influx of his geniality he marched on before us to the haven of his hopes with a long forked tool upon his shoulder and a bag of learned organs in the other hand and he never turned round unless we called upon him which proved the perfection of scientific insight oh how i should like to be like him said laura but i never can carry a long name long i learn to pronounce them and to try to know their meaning and then the next day i am as wise as ever nearly all the young ladies now are so scientific as one of the books says it is such a manifold addition to their interests not to the interest felt in them i answered though afraid of my own words it makes them so conceited and so full of their own ideas and they talk as if they knew everything with the little bits they pick up from books that is not the way great men get on they get on by their own observations and experiments and by putting this and that together and so they make great discoveries and when they have done it they are always humble because of the quantity they can't find out look at our dear friend there does he ever pretend to know anything at all does he ever lay down the law about anything even upon subjects he understands more thoroughly than any other man yet born he speaks when he does speak at all with more doubt and diffidence and humility than a school girl does who knows nothing about it except from one of his own books the smaller the mind the more positive it is then ladies ought to be very positive at least i mean most of them like me but how slowly we are walking the professor will think that we have no zeal for his bones at all whereas i fully mean to go in and help i hope you won't think of doing that i answered as we turned the corner and could see the excavation unluckily you were not entrusted to me or i should forbid it most decidedly it looks rather dangerous and is sure to be very dirty and what good can you do in there what good can i do anywhere if it comes to that i came here to see everything and i mean to do it unless the professor forbids it and he would not have let me come if he intended that let us go and ask him no he is too busy his attention was wholly engaged as we saw and he was speaking earnestly to the man who had been left in charge of the place last evening you see no difference he said i do and a very considerable difference barnes there has been no rain in the night and no groundswell to produce any vibration your shores are all standing it is true but not quite as they stood yesterday we must have three hours more of work in there before i have exhausted the situs and i would not allow any man to come in with me now tommy keep away and take miss twentifold i shall have to collect all my forces and shore up afresh before i dare use a tool the cliff is quite low but too high to be safe and there is a public footpath along the top the tide is going out in half an hour you might get some good shrimping round the point allow me to commend that pursuit to you for the next two or three hours you are going in and out yourself i said though i took good care to lead miss twentifold away as if there were no sign of danger whatever but if we should do more harm than good the best plan would be to go shrimping as you say but how shall we know sir when you are ready for us or at least for me of course i mean lady twentifold will be down perhaps about three o'clock when all is made safe and i want your good hand the professor answered with a look at me and a wave of his faithful old hat to the lady which said for all his hats said something i like you very much but i don't want you now you will see my dear friends this conspicuous example of the industry of the orient waving on that pole he pulled from his hat a large yellow silk handkerchief spotted with white and shook it at us as a flag signal to be off now what shall we do shall we obey orders or is there anything you would like better perhaps you are afraid of the rocks and the sea weed and the way the waves come running up the hollow places i said this on purpose to stimulate her perceiving the very fine spirit she had which the colour in her cheeks was enough to prove all i was afraid of was that she might doubt the propriety of going round the point with me but she was too simple and good to do that she thought not of harm any more than she had done it and the only expression in her eyes was pleasure where have you put the nets she asked you shall have roly's and i will have my own now if there had been in my nature yet any lingering of the old tendency to rise into the air through exultation could anything have baulked it of its operation now within a mere mile of the spot still shown as the scene of my early exploit with the weather set fair and the wind the right way and with beauty at my side a millionfold more enchanting than any first view of the sea what was the reason that i did not fly let professor brachipod explain that if he can and there is nothing that he will not explain most ably whether he is able or whether he is not some great change had permeated my organisation as they call it as if i were full of pipes which made me cleave rather to the earth in periods of exuberant happiness than soar to the sky to complete it there perhaps when i grow old i shall become less earthy and again seek my happiness by going upward but nothing now sets me on the springs of my system except the most expansive and elevating indignation and to put aside that and all questions whatever of the motives for this or the reasons against that would manners any more than common sense and sound judgment have allowed me to fly away from lovely laura so long as i had her at my side what else in the earth or the air or the sky could i desire no one has noticed to the best of my knowledge what a comfort there is in the pattering of feet when they keep time and answer well to one another not as a single pair i mean each coming after the other with a gap but as a pair of a pair going feet toe and heel exactly to one another with no more space crosswise between them than the other foot requires to come up and fill the gap and when this is done upon a firm gray sand with just enough spring to make it beautiful to walk and just enough yield to take a light impression how can the most scientific human body with a fair human body at the side of it continue to lament that it is not quadruped when we came to the rocks it was even better for here there was such a fine slippery spread of the carpet of the sea and so many green fringes covering traps where a little foot might sink and perhaps get sprained or at any rate get soaked that at every few yards there was need of a hand or sometimes of two for discretion of step and at every such aid there was a smile to pay not to mention the downcast of eyes sometimes and sometimes their uplifting with a soft sweet light and the fluttering of lashes in the fresh wind from the sea and the murmuring of lips more pink and melodious than any clear pacific shell and when the brisk freedom of the salt air shed the dark clusters of her hair upon her face and neck veiling the gentle blush and the shy damask my very best manners and most deep responsibility struggled in vain to prevent me from saying you are the very image of a beautiful moss rose she was not at all offended but looked calmly at me and answered to my horror what a beautiful idea i shall tell mamma that you said that oh please don't do anything of the sort i exclaimed she would be sure or at least she might i cannot exactly make you understand but she might not be altogether pleased you know well i don't see why she is very fond of poetry but if she would not like it you should not have said it but don't be so distressed i will promise not to tell her because i am sure that you meant no harm oh here is my first shrimping pool i will sooner bite my tongue out thought i to myself as in humble confusion i unbound the nets than utter another syllable of admiration what a fool i am but who could help it this put me on my very best behaviour for a while and even when she slipped upon an oozy slab and nearly fell into a pool a foot deep i did not hold her up any more than i could help and after that being under orders not to use my net which i began with upside down until i knew something about it but rather to watch how she managed and to learn to do the like not an inch of advantage did i try to take but with scrupulous honour held my net betwixt us and smiled as if my face was as stiff as were my hands i am afraid you don't enjoy this work she said i am afraid of enjoying it too much said i and that made her laugh for she had not the least idea of the darkness of my meaning now you may fish upon your own account she told me you see how you must draw the net along beneath the ledges with the hinder part of the rim kept higher to brush the rock so that they can't get back over it and go well in under all the fringes of the weeds and then up with the other rim and fetch it out briskly now you fish a little while i look on and applaud you if honesty and facts permit you shall have this large pool all to yourself and it is the best among all the rocks and you can manage roly's net which is half again the size of mine you see now i particularly want two dozen prawns and they are not at all plentiful on this coast i have only got seven yet with all these shrimps but everybody says that you are so lucky and i shall believe it if you catch one prawn they are much quicker to get away than shrimps and so it requires more skill to catch them well i declare you have got at least a dozen i never saw so many in one haul before let me take them out or they will be sure to jump away from you oh what a very spiteful creature a very large prawn with no sense of the beautiful at least as existing in the race that boils him had rasped her most exquisite forefinger which looked in the water as pellucid as himself with the vile long crock saw which he carried on his head and what made it the more meritorious on her part she held fast to him still and dropped him into the bag how wonderfully brave you are i cried it is bleeding two or three large drops put it into your mouth and suck out the poison oh how i should like to do it for you don't be so intrepid you never can tell he may have been living with a water snake i could tell you such stories if it would stop bleeding let me tear up my handkerchief and bind it no it is nothing at all and if they were poisonous how should we eat them i split a piece of popweed and put it on like a thimble and that stops the bleeding immediately it is not the first time they have given me a rasp my dear mother likes me to wear gloves whenever i go shrimping but i always pull them off i like to feel things with my own hands there what a fuss about nothing now go on how wonderfully fortune favours you i have heard it so often and now i can see it try that corner there is always something there roly caught a fine silver mullet there last summer and i caught a little fish we didn't knew the name of let me try to smile nicely i said to myself i always get the best luck when i smile cause and effect are always hugging one another to doubt one's luck is to doubt it nearly always i want to impress her with my good luck for what impression is more favourable faint heart never won fairy prawns that corner looks full of miraculous draught oh please to let go let go miss twentifold he may pull me in but he mustn't pull in you for seeing me engaged with a mighty adversary my lovely companion rushed forward and put fair hands on the pole of the net because my light figure was thrown off its balance by an unexpected weight and force whatever it is you shall have all the glory she answered as she obeyed me only i was afraid you were tumbling in so i will if it is needful i don't mean to let him go i exclaimed as i set my heels firmly in a ledge here he comes what in the world have we caught a giant of a lobster a perfect giant she was clapping her hands with delight as she said it oh i never beheld such a monster in my life and there never was any one with luck like yours there anybody else would have lost him but you i don't mean to lose him if he murders me i shouted as i swung him out mightily and laid hold of him oh he has laid hold of me in the most inhuman manner whatever shall i do to get out of his clutches for this trenchant radical had nipped me by the wrist with one mighty claws and was clutching about with the other to embrace me somewhere else oh tommy take care of your nose she cried forgetting all formality in fright oh what will your mother say if you lose your nose i know an old sailor who has got the mark now there that claw is harmless at any rate now let us consider about the other she had cleverly pushed a large stone between his unoccupied nippers but the villain lay stubbornly on his back in a great tussock of weeds spreading his long whiskers and dappled joints and lashing about the blue fans of his tail and exerting all the leverage of his body to drive his toothed fangs through my poor wrist and if any one else had been there but laura i should have roared with the violence of pain oh i am so sorry oh how very dreadful i would not have had it happen for all the lobsters in the world as she spoke she knelt by me and her cheek touched mine and a shower of her hair came streaming down so that i could put my lips to it let him pinch away as hard as he pleases i exclaimed he'll be tired before i am of this position however it was impossible not to feel that the position would be better without its drawbacks even love's young dream may be sweeter without nightmare and painful is the bravest smile of pain with a quick thought she ran for the handle of her net and slipping it out of the socket entered the taper end in at the heel of the claw and with the aid of my other hand unlocked my horny handcuff chapter xxvi beneath them now let us go back as fast as we can she said when she had wrapped up my wrist very softly with her muslin handkerchief which i took care never to restore to her the tide is coming in and if it gets to the point before us we shall have to go a mile inland and i declare we have forgotten all about the professor's signal which may have been waving for an hour and perhaps my dear mother may be waiting for us but this unequalled lobster will account for all delay how quiet he is since we tied his claws i ought to beg your pardon for the liberty i took in calling you 'tommy' but i was in a fright and it sounds so very natural because of the professor and mamma is almost as bad as he is i will only ask you one thing was my answer try to be as bad or as good in that way call me 'tommy' every time you speak why don't you remember when i put a new leg to your doll and you gave me such a kiss that i have thought of it ever since and you said 'you are to call me lo remember all the people i like best are to call me lo and i think i like you best of almost everybody in the world' but of course you have forgotten all that now what extraordinary creatures children are she exclaimed as if she were the mother of the lo and then she came nearer to me and said i remember that you were a great favourite of mine and i don't like you not to call me anything but look there goes the great handkerchief you shall not get out of it like that i answered with a little groan as if my wrist was in great pain for fear of any wrath on her part people should always understand each other and how can they do that without any names you should call me 'tommy' upon all occasions because i am tommy and nothing else and even the examiners call me 'tommy' because of my steering the eight so much but it never would do for me to call you 'laura' except when we are quite by ourselves you know or with only the professor who never would tell and i don't suppose he would ever notice it in general society i must call you 'miss twentifold' but in particular cases now and then i should be very much obliged indeed if i might just to keep up the practice as one might express it call you only 'laura' i would gladly have put something else before laura but i thought this was far enough to go just yet and it would make it all the nicer that her mother should not know it tommy she replied with as clear an intonation of my friendly and genial but not romantic name as i ever yet was accosted with i shall leave it entirely to your own discretion to call me what you like and when you like and i see no possibility of harm in my calling you what all the examiners at oxford do they gave you the most honourable class of all i hear because you never asked for it the bishop says that you might have beaten mr chumps this must have been an error on the bishop's part or hers because there was no way to beat a double first then though now a man may go into perhaps five and twenty firsts but i did not attempt to contradict her after all her kindness i hope you have never seen mr chumps i said purposely making him as formal as i could for i knew that if bill chumps came down here for canvassing purposes or anything else he would be sure to get elected far in front of me oh yes i have she said a very tall gentleman taller than professor megalow or roly but not to be compared with them in any other way he has very red cheeks and rather high cheek bones according to my recollection and a nose that sticks up a good deal i replied did you understand when he came down that his father carries on the business still not that it matters as we all think now from by any means a lofty point of view it never came into my mind to ask and herein her simplicity put me down anything at all about his father why should i roly brought him as he brings anybody who can be of use to him in politics it is not my place to have anything to say to them except what is expected from the people of the house and i believe he saved the life of my first cousin lord counterpagne and that alone would make him no stranger here but look if it were possible for the professor to be in a hurry he would be so now we have been a long time and i am afraid he will be angry let us put on steam as roly says i wanted no steam put on at present but found no fair means of preventing it and a few quick steps brought us up to the pebble bank under the cliff of the sacred relics aha the professor cried coming down to meet us no wonder i have waved my bandana in vain what a magnificent specimen and the beauty of him is that he is good to eat which alas was more than i could say for my specimen in there when the lady superior of all the fish women of happystowe asked me just now how i meant to cook my bones she has marched away in sadness at my dreadful waste of time however at last all is perfectly ready and i would have gone to work without you except for the dread of your reproaches we have made all the front quite safe and the fissure at the back is not extending the light is good still but we have no time to lose and my mother asked laura has she not come yet she was to have been here an hour ago she will be so sorry to see nothing of the work she has sent down a groom with a kind little note to say that she cannot come till five o'clock and begging me on no account to wait for her i would gladly have put it off until to morrow but any change of weather might be fatal or even a ground swell with this springtide of which there are some signs already this rock is not like the hard sandstone further north or even firm chalk but a brittle conglomerate we are not our own masters we must set to work at once tommy i will not keep you long inside and miss twentifold should stand behind this high water mark he took off his hat and laid it down upon the shingle and then with a short tool of steel in one hand something like what the police call a jemmy but forked at one end and gouge shaped at the other and a square of soft felt in his left hand he went into the cave or rather excavation and i with my hat off followed him there was plenty of light when the eyes got used to it and i saw that the roof was established with short slabs of wood supported by timber props why there can be no danger whatever i said almost with some disappointment it is as safe as the dome of st paul's i am sure of course you know best sir but i should have gone straight at it can you spare me a tool to work with no he replied you must use no tool but only follow my directions why what is the matter with your wrist the right one nothing but a trifle of a pinch i said i can use it as well as ever i assure you very well then watch me but don't speak loud there is no danger now as you truly observe or else i would have kept you outside my tommy but you see that to secure our object without fracture i have yet to dig out a good bit of the shale for it scarcely deserves to be called rock and when that is done there may be some little risk because we cannot get any shores behind it from what you have seen with me you know at once that the object before us is no pelvis as sir roland insists upon calling it all that part was easily secured but i saw indications of continuance and following them up discovered these which are very grand joints of the vertebrae the weight will be very considerable and we must try to preserve the articulations which might be injured if we got it out piece meal all you have to do is to support the lower end without jerking it lest it should drop from the jarring while i release the upper part then with a good heft out we get it with this felt under it to prevent abrasion barnes keeps his eyes on the cliff outside and will call us at once if the crack grows larger ah you fit exactly as i said you would with your foot in that nick what can be better without a word i watched his skilful work as he followed with his tool every curve of nature's bold carving now brought out into high relief until he had the other part bedded obliquely into the rock wall almost as free as mine was then he inserted one side of the felt under the mighty back bones of the monster and saying now both hands my clever tommy with the leverage of a bigger tool which he caught up from the floor gradually brought out the reluctant mass when the whole of it lay on the edge of the niche which he had lengthened to allow for the jut and was ready to come out being all detached he passed a piece of rope along it upon either side taking advantage of the knuckles of the bones such as i have often sucked in ox tail soup and making fast at either end to hold it altogether then he rubbed his nose and looked at me with a very sweet chuckle and i feared that he would knock his bare head against the roof for he had scarcely had a chance of standing upright all the time except just where there was a sort of pudding basin in the shale stuff shall we call in barnes he asked i am afraid his hands would shake it looks like a death's head and cross bones combined in its present most tantalizing attitude i thought i heard a crack my young friend listen run you outside and reconnoitre it is impossible for me under any circumstances to abandon these bones of rapture now impavidum ferient ruinae but i beg you to try a little alibi go out and see how things look and if all is serene return and help me no sir i answered if there was a crack no doubt it was barnes cracking nuts outside he fills his pockets with brazilian nuts fit only for a blacksmith if you are ready sir so am i why it is not half so big as i am it weighs tommy at least five times your weight we will put up this plank and slide it down here it comes gently what you here laura you see if i don't tell your ma as the children say to one another let it drop tommy let it drop if it hurts you for whether from sudden alarm about laura or the damage done to my own wrist my end of the mass slipped away from me and turned and the three inch plank we were guiding it down flew up as if struck by a cannon ball and just missing my head knocked away the main bearers of the roof above us i saw a great mass coming down upon laura and before i could think i had her in my arms and under me then a roar and a flash of light and black darkness came and the last sense of spreading arms over her when i came to know what i was about again lo there i was lying in a bed of sea weed with my head supported by a soft smooth arm coming under the curls at the back of my neck and my breast laid bare to the wind of the sea and a great deal of water gone into it moreover i seemed to be dirty all over as if i had been rolled along a knife board and a quantity of grime was in my mouth so that i could hardly speak for grit i don't seem to know where i am i gasped never mind about that till by and by a soft voice whispered into my ear and soft lips felt nice and warm upon my cheek are you better oh darling tommy are you better i should be if i could blow my nose i said there is nothing the matter with me except that but what is all this roaring noise if you please is it coming down again if it does i am done for no dear there is nothing coming down at all except the waves of the sea there is a heavy ground swell but none of it can come near you dear tommy the professor said there would be a ground swell i answered with some nerve of memory touched there seems to be nothing that he does not know he seems not to have known everything this time did he know that the rock would come down upon laura and must have killed her but for you the rock come down oh i remember now something came down but it was all my fault and perhaps i have killed her oh please to let me die if i have killed beautiful laura hush you are not to excite yourself you have not killed laura you have saved her life she is not hurt at all or at least very little not a quarter so much as you are my poor darling here you are to take this as soon as you can swallow she put some vessel to my lips and i saw large dark eyes and a trembling smile and fair cheeks flowing with a flood of tears then i swallowed something warm and said oh you must be laura no i am not i am laura's mother your dear lady as you used to call me now rest a few minutes and you will be better you must not try to get up by yourself nor even with my help till the professor has examined you he is up at the inn with darling laura who cannot be induced to go home until she hears that you are well enough to come with us i sent a boy for him the moment you revived here he comes he will soon tell us all about you don't be afraid you are a hero not a goose i felt more like a goose and one going to be cooked when my learned patron after some kind words began to make search for my injuries by calling he was a physician and if he had only stuck to art and discarded science made the most of his talents and the least of his genius and preferred the twinkles to the broad light of knowledge doubtless he would have been making his twenty thousand a year with a baronetcy and the fame that breathes its last with its owner and the laying of his fingers on my poor body would have cost fifty guineas instead of nothing but some groans the more he groans the better i am pleased with him he observed with the spirit of the true philosopher it proves that his sufferings are capable of expression and that he has power to put them into form the greater the damage to his outward husk for he could not expect to come off unhurt the smaller the injury to the kernel of this tommy his bones are as sound as my deino saurian's which rolled on my feet and most happily inflicted without receiving injury there now my dear friend did you feel that i should rather think that i did groaned i oh it was dreadful it was as bad as the way the four professors poked at me i hope you won't have to do that again sir no i think not he replied in a tone which would have been blessed if less dubious the fact of his perceiving my light touch there convinces me lady twentifold so far as we may trust observations which we have not verified that he has taken no internal harm in the part that was most exposed to it the brattice came down and protected his head being clear of the fall myself i could see the beginning of the accident at that end the main weight fell upon his back just here you told me that you wished to have everything stated as plainly as i could state it otherwise i would not give you these details and when we dug him out the main weight was there still i rejoice to assure you that he will be none the worse after a week or two of good nursing any frame of stiff construction would probably have been broken but our dear young friend this heroic youth tommy has a frame of unusual elasticity partaking rather of the pterotic character and his internal organs are adapted to it but i would not advise that he should walk as yet or attempt any movement not absolutely needful we will send for the cushions of your carriage if you please and lay them on these planks and our tommy on the top and then with the strong arms of barnes and my own we will take our young hero to the waggonette you may thank him for the safety of your dear child i was too far away to be of any use you will candidly acquit me of all blame i am sure your daughter disobeyed me in entering the place and even after that there would have been no disaster except for the accident to our young friend's wrist all the rest of the excavation is still firm as you see i will have every bit of it pulled down to morrow now that you have got all you want professor and to blame you would be almost as wicked as to fail to thank the almighty i know that she discharged that latter duty but i doubt if she ever acquitted herself so thoroughly as to the former point chapter xxvii pleasant and unpleasant things everybody said without one exception unless it were that of some low minded fellow that i had performed a most gallant valiant and you might fairly term it heroic deed but i could not at all take this view of it myself not only because of that modesty which sometimes suffers misunderstanding from its terror of becoming conspicuous but also because i had acted purely from instinct and without two thoughts if there had been two thoughts the first would have been to save laura an act of mere selfishness and the second would have been to save myself an act of almost equal selfishness however casuistry is not in my line and if people chose to think me a very fine fellow i should have been guilty of self assertion if i had kept on contradicting them nobody was allowed to contradict me for at least a fortnight and everything was done to anticipate my wishes i lay on a beautiful couch and read novels for fear of any harm to my system and although there was a great deal of debris in them and most of the heroes had been pushed off cliffs and some of them overwhelmed in caverns i did not find one who had saved at a stroke his lady love's bones and his own and a dragon's and the best thing of all was that laura made a point of coming to see me three times every day her mother was generally with her it is true but there are methods of exchanging glances over kind shoulders or behind beloved backs and sometimes lady twentifold was called away while her daughter must be left just to say good bye in another thing also i was very lucky my affection for my mother was intense and deep but to be assured of her welfare was enough just now by no means did i want her indefatigable love and assiduous devotion at this crisis lady twentifold had written in the kindest manner to suggest that she could come to assuage anxiety and contribute her tender care but the letter had arrived at placid bower as we had beautifully named our house to distinguish it from the boiling scenes one hour after my dear mother's hasty departure for the port of liverpool by the earlier post she had received a letter from the manager of a sailor's refuge there requesting her to set off by the next express train if she wished to see her dear brother william alive this was that very same uncle bill of mine who had tossed me through the ceiling as above recorded and partly in consequence of that exploit had betaken himself to the briny waves again and had long been supposed to be lying beneath them that however he had forborne to do contriving on the contrary to keep above them during many adventurous years until he was landed quite lately at liverpool in the last stage as every one declared of a long low african fever he had not heard a word of our changes in life but had given the address of the soap works and the new boiler had forwarded the letter my mother's kind heart was affected deeply and she left home in such a hot flurry with nothing but a few clothes and her cheque book that she never even thought of leaving any address or orders concerning her letters and we might have heard none of all this for a month for she was rather superstitious about sending bad news and had not heard a word about my accident except for the kindness of miss windsor who happened to call at placid bower as she often did for a good luncheon the cook gave her this with much good will being troubled with the knife boy who had tried to kiss her and did not care how or when he came home at night as well as in distress about her wages and the emptiness of the beer cask and then polly like the mistress of the house sat down and examined the outsides of all the letters not in any spirit of curiosity in which as she confessed she had always been too deficient but to find whether she could be of any service knowing lady twentifold's letter at a glance not so much by the post mark or the crest as its unstudied air of aristocracy she went to my four legged desk and wrote a letter beginning dear tommy which some one far superior to herself considered a very great liberty indeed and had a great mind not to call me tommy any more and covering four sides with a galloping scrawl all about nothing except that my mother had been suddenly called away to liverpool and no one knew when she would come back again i endeavoured to reconcile my mind to this trusting that my excellent mother would take good care of herself as she generally did and feeling how very much better it was that her mind should be free from anxiety until i could announce my own recovery and for this latter blessing i was not in any haste finding all my medicaments wonderfully nice and clinical treatment exceedingly fine when are you coming downstairs old chap sir roland inquired in his brisk short style when i had endured with all resignation a fortnight of these therapeutics the world won't stand still for the best of us you know the professor has packed up his bones and is going he can't hope for any more big lizards and of this one he has got every bit of scurf left i believe wonderful what fancies people have if you offered him the blue ribbon not a smile would appear on his philosophic countenance but offer him a thread from the tail or the pelvis or the pubes or whatever he calls it of some hideous beast that died when mirrors were invented and you'll get a smile worth walking ten miles to see i tried to take a rise out of him the other day with a big marrow bone i mashed up and stuck together inside out and i rode twenty miles to put the product into a petrifying well for three days and nights i made sure of having him it looked so natural and every bit of join was sawdered over with the drip stuff 'new specimen from our cliff sir' i said 'i hope it may induce you to prolong your stay' and really for a moment he looked puzzled and i made sure of having fetched him then he stood up and put his hand upon my shoulder and you should have seen the laugh in his great eyes 'i hope my young friend you will retire from the house when the question of our next grant is discussed' he said 'i shall put this in a case as a great curiosity and label it specimen of a conservative mp the inversion and the petrification are the leading features of the type' what do you think of that now tommy well i think that it served you most splendidly right and will teach you how to play tricks with great men i should like to have seen you with his strong hand on your shoulder come if you can laugh like that you heartless radical there can't be much the matter with your inner parts unless it is your heartless heart and very little wrong with your outward either to judge by the colour on your cheeks when i came in you were as bright as 'a red red rose newly blown in june' because your sweet sister had just been with me thought i but i only said yes i am a little better my strength is coming back to me gradually i believe with your dear mother's wonderful kindness and the help of a good constitution i hope to be toddling about as usual before very long but professor megalow says that i must shun most carefully every possible form of excitement no doubt of that but you appeared to me to be in a state of excitement when i came in and there was somebody going down the other stairs i thought a quick light foot it seemed to be there are so many echoes in this house i answered throwing one weary arm across my face if you had only got to keep in one room and listen to them hour after hour as i have got to do you would find out that a very little thing excites one well i beg your pardon dear tommy he replied i should be the last to hurry you i am sure after all the great things that you have done for us but i do want you to be about again for a lot of reasons if it were only to canvass larkmount before they forget your exploit and before that very dainty colour has time to get spoilt all the larkmount females will be in love with you and everything is driven by the thimble there the rads are going to be fools enough i hear to bring forward an oily fellow fifty years old pitted with the small pox and with stubby black hair against your soft carmine and ambrosial curls and another thing i forgot to tell you counterpagne will be here to morrow or the next day and he is such an awful stick over the wine he thinks himself wronged with less than two hours of it and what i shall do with him when the professor is gone surpasses my imagination he never says anything except what he has read in the papers of the morning and whatever they have said he repeats word for word for he has got a tremendous memory and he does it all the same if he has happened to get hold of a radical journal before the sound doctrine whichever side he gets first he swallows and his stubbornness pegs him fast to it and whatever the other side says is therefore all rubbish and rot and roguery his temper is none of the best and that makes it so much harder to get on with him but what can you do with him all day long if he is that sort of fellow i asked surely he must be even worse before he has read anything at all because he must want you to settle his mind not at all he would resent it deeply he must have a thing in type and take it in slowly before his opinion as he calls it can be formed and then i am relieved of him for several hours and am only too glad to be out of the way while he marches all over the gardens and shrubberies and even the chase as he calls the home farm for hours of spooning with poor laura what an atrocious thing to do i cried feeling indignation almost lift me from the couch it is bad enough to spoil your evenings but to ruin all her mornings is ten thousand times worse how can you bring yourself to allow it i am thankful for the mercies that i thus ensue he answered with heartless and most infinite levity what can be the value of a girl's time tommy and she likes it of course for he makes fine speeches or if she doesn't like it why she ought to do so and the sooner she learns the way the better she will have to put up with him all day long as soon as they are married which it is high time now to settle i may tell you in confidence that counterpagne is just the fellow to be made a fool of and so we must fix him before that happens not that he is any great catch you know he will take quite as much as he brings and his family is ever so much newer than ours is for he only belongs to us in the female line still this 'alliance' as the cads of the papers call it has been determined on for very good reasons and it plugs up a leak in some wicked old will a very wicked will i call it a very wicked will and a still more wicked deed to bind two persons together for life without asking whether they suit each other if you were a beautiful clever sweet tempered warm hearted pure minded and lovely young lady without a particle of selfishness or two thoughts of a trumpery coronet how would you like to marry lord counterpagne taking him according to your own account his temper is bad to begin with and to end with too for any one who cares about his sister's welfare roly bad temper is the curse of life those who are plagued with it should live apart or only with those they are afraid of unless they have enough of self knowledge and enough strong will to quench it utterly has the earl of counterpagne got those if he has he has concealed them from me thus far he thinks his bad temper a very fine thing but my dear tommy what concern is this of yours none i suppose because she is not my sister but i will say my say and have done with it and you may think me an upstart meddler if you like all of you have been so kind to me and above all your dear mother that i would rather die out of the way than see a great misery falling upon you and the greatest misery in all the world is for a gentle sweet loving and sensitive creature to be shackled for life to a man conceited stuck up narrow minded cold hearted selfish and above all black tempered and if you bring such a thing to pass you will rue it to the last day of your life dear roland come come he is not half so bad as all that sir roland replied with more self command than i expected from him counterpagne is a gentleman in his way and only requires humouring tommy i thank you for your warning which is uncommonly impressive and disinterested here he fixed his piercing eyes on mine but i was not thinking of myself at all in the larger interests my own words had aroused but you have talked a great deal too much for your good go to sleep and allow me to consider what comes next he was going to say something harsher as i saw but his manly sense of my condition and of the service i had been happy enough to render withheld him from speaking out his mind just then and i was glad when he was gone and i could think things over chapter xxviii the welfare of the family a great double blow fell upon me now far worse than the fall of the rocks upon my back for then i had the sweetest of comfort in my arms to wit the departure of professor megalow and the arrival of the earl of counterpagne if the learned professor had been labouring for the union of the two most interesting creatures yet extinct with the prospect of neozoic forms big enough to exhaust even his teratology he could scarcely have exhibited higher powers of match making than he now had exerted for my benefit he looked upon me as an acolyte of science because of my manual services and took any failure of mine as a defeat henceforth of that great power moreover his heart was as soft as a child's and as versatile and as abundant and the dry humour which knowledge of the world had spread over the depth of feeling was no more than the lid of the well of tears what a different nature filled or tried to fill his chair at the plenteous table of the towers next day lord counterpagne had a great many good points he believed so himself and who am i to contradict him but he went a great deal further than that he believed that he had no bad ones and upon that matter a very feeble arguer need not have feared to tackle him he was soft without being soft hearted stubborn without any real firmness and slow witted without solidity far be it from me to make the worst of him because of his presumption about laura his own face was enough to give a clear account of him and how can he object to that i was heartily glad not for my own sake but because it showed the good taste of sweet laura that she strove her very utmost without transgressing the venial limits of truth to keep liberally out of the way of this noble lord my firm belief is that she disliked him with a loftier disgust than i could cherish for i did believe that he had some good points and i made it my business to put these before her with the noblest candour possible ah well she said i am surprised that you should recommend him so i thought you had more more insight i think the fashionable word seems now to be as well as more i will not say regard but consideration for me it was as much as i could do when she spoke thus and looked at me as if her last friend was gone to forbear from a good burst of anger and sorrow and the hardest of all things to keep under great love but i did not presume for a moment to hope that i should find the proper answer yet supposing i were bold enough to show that last in any plainer style than that of sighs and looks and forbearance to look or to speak sometimes and little unaccountable changes of colour and very soft tones and an evident contempt of all low considerations and cold subjects with all these and a thousand more i had been keeping my distance from others and from her before them yet striving imperceptibly to steal nearer as a child sidles towards a shy bird with salt you ought to feel very much obliged to me i answered considering how you are situated for trying to make the best of everything at this her eyes flashed as i meant them to do and she put up her lips in a resolute way i am not situated at all she replied what a word to use about me all the world seems to have made up their minds that i have no will of my own whatever and you who might at least have been hoped to know me better seem to be contented with the general mistake ah i wish that we were young again i couldn't help sighing and taking her hand as i said it and could talk as we used to do at the seaside we never had any misunderstandings then and we won't have any now she answered kindly with a dear little sigh as my heart told my ears after all you have done for me how could i endure it only i don't understand why you should take such a violent fancy to lord counterpagne we had better drop the subject altogether it is scarcely one for us to talk about if anybody knows you ought to know that it is not a pleasant theme for me i said with a look at which she blushed and turned away if i hate anybody on earth it is his lordship well she exclaimed gazing at me with astonishment but certainly no anger in her clear brown eyes i thought you had agreed to drop the subject and after all your praises to say such a thing as that why you must dislike pure virtue but i have been forgetting that i keep my cousin waiting i ought to have met him by the fountain long ago and his dignity is hurt if i am not there first now you must keep quiet and not walk about so much since the good professor went you never lie down at all and he made you lie down all day long good bye now till dinner time i am not going to stick in here i cried as she hurried lightly across the lawn and my words seemed too late to overtake her while that muff of a lord has you all to himself the idea of his showing his nasty huffs to you as soon as i am well i'll have it out with him as sure as my name's tommy let me see him dare to pull his long face out at you and if i don't double up his counterpane if i don't make a milord blanket of him however it was useless to go on like that for she never looked back to encourage me my nature moreover is not pugnacious until the very last straw is piled upon my back or peace is more certain to bring thumps than war my lord had been a little supercilious to me when i tried to save roly from this lonesome plague still there had been nothing that i could show offence at although i might take it inwardly and when i spoke of bill chumps as my earliest friend he had shown some fine feeling and real good will and now when i tried to turn things over calmly and fairly in my mind and put aside hopeless wishes i found it very hard to make right with myself as a gentleman is bound to do my own line of behaviour when i speak of myself as a gentleman of course i do not pretend to be one of the gentry as some people call those who are born of good position in the country and so forth but only to convey that by education association and avoidance of low things i now might claim to be measured by that high standard though a long way from coming up to it and taking this view i was forced to acknowledge that i must not go on as i should like to do and might be said without any power of denial to have already begun to do i found myself treated with extraordinary kindness by people of a far higher rank than myself for a number of reasons which need not be recounted but had all worked up to this fine result and by means of this confidence on their part my behaviour was become of great importance to them i do not refer now to national questions matters of science or politics or even the use of my special faculties but to the nearer and dearer home interests involving the welfare of the family and being still very young and of no experience i puzzled my head in trying vainly to discover what was the right thing for me to do my conscience seemed to tell me that i ought to run away and let everything take its course without me and this i was very near doing once or twice but before i could pack up my trunk which was a big one my heart stood firmly in the way and whether it persuaded my mind or not is more than i can tell but certainly my mind with a good show of reason supported it why should the loveliest and sweetest and best of all maidens in the world be sacrificed for an object so low from a high point of view as a bag of dirty money or a strip of land still dirtier much happier would it have been for her with her warm loving nature and sensitive heart once for all to have been crushed in the cave than slowly and coldly and consciously to be overwhelmed and thus buried alive by the burden of the one who should truly be her light and life and liberty to prevent that most clearly was my first duty and while i was proving to my conscience this which pure inexperience alone could excuse it for not having understood long ago it came to my knowledge that lord counterpagne was not in other ways than those already mentioned as unsuitable fit to be trusted with the sacred love and pure heart of any good maiden into this i shall not enter any more than i can help for the discussion of such matters which even ladies sometimes taunt us with avoiding can cure nobody and may taint many enough that it quenched all further doubt which became at once unmanly squeamishness as to my duty towards him and her and would have made me loathe the sight of him near laura even if she had been nothing to me tommy you are not in your usual spirits sir roland said to me as he sat in the chair of hospitality after the ladies had retired with the earl on his right hand and me on his left i fear that you are walking too much my dear boy before you have got your strength up again if you do that the radical candidate for larkmount will get all the fellows pledged to him before i can even show you he is thinking too much about his election lord counterpagne remarked with that long slow chuckle which proved his enjoyment of his own poor wit and from what i have seen in the papers to day he will have a lot of questions to answer about the cession of gibraltar and the total abandonment of india sir roland answered with a wink at me i saw that you were deep in that subject my cousin and i hope that you found it suit your taste justice is justice the earl replied and narrow considerations should not be allowed to blind us as against the larger view for instance how should we like the spaniards to be in permanent occupation of dover castle and the mouth of the thames and to a spanish mind gibraltar combines the advantages of both those positions i confess that i reflected seriously over the forcible manner in which that was put and supposing that i had been by birth a spaniard which is very easily conceivable not at all you are not a bit like a spaniard and you had better not reflect as one until you are re conceived we have got those places and we mean to keep them as the spaniards would keep dover castle if their ancestors had taken it and they could stick to it the electors of larkmount are englishmen and they would never have tommy if he talked such stuff to morrow you'll get hold of a tory paper first and read all about our glorious heritage and the paramount duty of keeping it intact here my dear fellow take another glass of port you require it for your constitution his lordship looked angry but did as he was bidden for he was heartily afraid of his strong minded cousin and to turn the conversation i broke in saying to sir roland to morrow if it suits you i shall be most happy to go over and see those highly interesting people your twentibury business comes on next friday and you go up to take your seat next monday but if i am to have the honour of being returned it cannot be for some three months yet and when you go to london i think of going too i am rather uneasy about my mother i have not heard from her for a long time and i don't even know where she is at present very well you shall come up with me and be back again to practise at the rabbits for the first counter i mean to educate this tommy and i'll back him to wipe your eye when the long tails come in he will have to beat his tutor before he can do that lord counterpagne answered with his drawling smile which never followed any but his own ideas and then they began to talk about sporting matters such as i had heard of continually at oxford but knew very little of in any other way it grieved me very deeply as i watched this man who scarcely ever deigned to consider me at all to think that i must leave him here with laura for i knew not how long to go sauntering about and sitting upon benches out of doors and poking into flowers or gold and silver fish and droning all his paragraphs from the papers into her poor weary ears sometimes she would rouse her bright spirit as i knew and give him such an answer as of right should do him good but the worst of him was that his wits were not quick enough to enter into anything that went against himself and laura on the whole was so gentle and long suffering and desirous to keep any visitor happy and herself of so lively a disposition that she seemed too likely to try to make the best of him far more than he deserved and nearly as much as he required all this made it more and more miserable for me as the monday for my farewell drew nigh and there came no letter from my mother to relieve me of that sad necessity chapter xxix because he had no pity sunday was a very lovely day and people came from nearly two miles off to church the church was just outside the eastern lodge at the end of the finest avenue and it was very little larger than that lodge and scarcely looked so serious but the parson was a very worthy man to preach and he often said things that could be talked about so that any people who were staying in the neighbourhood for the sake of the air or the views or the moderate price of meat and butter or even the salt water were glad if the sunday was fine and a fly could be found at a reasonable figure to be able to say before they left the neighbourhood that they had heard the famous preacher mr arkles one of the few who can still be heard gratis naturally enough the pews belonging to the towers and its race were three quarters of the church but if any respectable people came in and looked about as if they were used to cushions and objected to the free seats which had none and in fact had no room for them being about as wide and rough as a kidney bean stick there never was any hesitation on the part of the officials of the towers from the housekeeper downwards according to the dresses of the persons that came in and their power of conveying their importance by their looks to push open any door with some yards of room inside it and nod solemnly yet christianly over the top rim of their prayer books in the chief pew of state there was seldom anybody to be found at morning service except a few visitors at the towers not from any turn on the part of lady twentifold against mr arkles though the public very generally put it down to that but simply because she had so many parishes in all of which she liked the clergymen and she felt it a duty in the proper round of sundays to make calls upon all of them in right order and in church but of a sunday evening when the dinner time allowed and the trees of the avenue dropped no drop all the cover parties as the old butler called us for whom he had to lay the table used to march to the little old church for my lady would have no carriage out on a sunday evening and behave ourselves according to our nature there upon this sunday which was to be my last with laura for i could not tell how long sir roland had driven his mother away in the light mail phaeton to some far off church but the young lady stayed at home to attend to the visitors and take them to the parish church lord counterpagne had a great mind not to go and it would have been better for him as it happened if he had persisted in this irreligious tone but even his stupidity was beginning to perceive what a dreadful condition i was in concerning laura and that she would not have me disdainfully spoken of when i was away and could not defend myself and these considerations made him go to church everything went on as well as need be until we had got some distance into the first lesson i had seen a big weather beaten man come in at the beginning of the venite forgetting himself for the moment so that he kept his broad hat on his head until he was reminded where he was this made me look at him with more attention and wonder what had brought him hither for he seemed to be not of the neighbourhood he refused to come up to the grade of the pews though the footmen of the towers cast glances at him as if he were worthy to come in with them which they never did to any below a tradesman or a farmer and when he took his hat off he put it on a stick and sat down upon the free bench and propped himself up then he stood up at leisure with his staff in his hand and began to survey the congregation the clergyman looked at him as much as to say you are not behaving very well my friend but he never returned his gaze nor seemed to know that there was any clergyman his manifest desire was to see everybody that happened to be inside those four walls and a kindred curiosity arose on my part to know all about him i saw that he was stout and at least of middle age with a ruddy face and grizzled whiskers and that candid expression of a puzzled state of mind which generally shows an honest nature it was clear that he had not found what he sought though his eyes were especially turned to our high pew he looked at miss twentifold and he looked at me and i could scarcely help smiling at his disappointment as i watched his lips and could almost hear him say to himself no that is not the man meanwhile the earl of counterpagne was lounging at the back of our deep pew for he was very lazy and had taken a great deal to drink last night as i knew by his behaviour at the billiard table and being out of sight of mr arkles and his flock he was stopping his ears with his dainty fingers to shut out the horrible row as he called it of their hearty but untutored chanting and throughout the reading of the psalms there he stayed putting up his feet which i could see vexed laura the first lesson happened to be the twelfth chapter of the second book of samuel and mr arkles began to read it beautifully for he had a fine voice and loved brave english but before he had gone very far my lord being weary of his lounge stood up to take a stretch and have a look at the inferior people among whom there were some bright comely girls not unwilling to catch a great nobleman's glance the clergyman read in a loud clear voice as if himself were the prophet the man that hath done this shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity and nathan said to david thou art the man a far louder voice than mr arkles' shouted these words like thunder and the big man pointed his staff at the pale face of lord counterpagne yon stands the man that made a harlot of my daughter churchwardens i call upon you to remove that person the clergyman said as soon as he recovered from the breathless astonishment that filled the church two elderly men arose to do his bidding but before they could get near him the big man clapped his broad hat on his head and walked out slowly through the open door by which he had been standing then my lord turned round to us with a very ghastly smile and said aloud it is only some poor madman but he ought to be taken into custody laura who had become as pale as death shrank from him to my side and i took her hands in fear that she might faint but she did not do that though her hands trembled coldly in mine and a large tear rolled down either fluttering cheek to the rest of the service we paid small heed though going through the forms of it and it was all in vain that our companion tried to catch our glances and to smile it off we three were the last to leave the church and mr arkles very kindly followed us from the vestry into which he had called the churchwardens and told us at the churchyard gate how sorry he was for the disgraceful scene and the alarm of the young lady then he shook hands with her and lifted his hat very stiffly to lord counterpagne and left us at the eastern lodge as we entered the avenue leading to the towers which was more than half a mile in length the earl began to walk at a pace very different from his wonted dawdle and seemed to be casting his eyes in a nervous manner between the great trunks of the trees the servants of the house were far in front sometimes in sight and sometimes hidden by the dips of the land and the turns of the road whose beauty he did not appreciate this however i was capable of doing and i did not see why we should be in a hurry because his lordship was perhaps in a fright so i said to break the solemn silence which seemed to have fallen upon us somehow after a little weak talk about the weather why should we go at such a headlong rate the day is very warm and why should we endeavour to beat it at its own business laura who was walking between us gave me a sweet little glance almost the first she had ventured to exchange with me since that occurrence in the church but lord counterpagne said oh very well i forgot that you had not recovered your activity upmore after all that business when you were the pillars of hercules or somebody who was it atlas you are fresh from oxford a remarkable instance of the unexpected your principal gift is of flight i believe though you have never favoured me with a specimen his manner was spiteful to the last degree possibly because i had not sided with him throughout what i considered the confusion of a blackguard your lordship may envy me that gift i said with more irritation than i ought to have shown in the presence of gentle laura but i have never yet used it to escape those i have injured before i could answer his furious stare a man of great substance appeared from behind a big tree and stood before us in one hand he had the staff which had given so much point to his scriptural denunciation and he held the other open with great fingers bent and a rapid growth of tendency towards the collar of the earl mind what you're about i said going up to him with every expectation of being tossed into the hole of the tree that had concealed him and i pointed to laura and he said roight lad teak t' yoong leddy a waa if tho wool a foo pri'ate words is aw' oi ston here fur shall i come back to help you i called out to lord counterpagne as i hurried off with laura to get her out of sight of it and although he was in a very low ebb of heart as his face and legs showed he had the courage to say no this is a private affair an attempt to sponge on me fellow take your hands off to sponnge on e eh i heard the loud voice roar ool't lack a mony sponnges afore oi've a dooed wi' e and desirous as i was to know how this was to happen i durst not look round because of darling laura who was terrified so that i had no resource but to help her along with both comfort and support oh what does that mean she asked with the saddest forebodings in her tearful eyes and i answered it must be the way the grasshoppers are always going on in this hot weather it is the way they make love you know to one another it sounds much heavier than a grasshopper she whispered as a yet louder stroke awoke the echoes and if that's the way they make love i am sure it is not at all what i should like oh that i knew what way of doing it you do like i murmured even in that crisis and she seemed not to hear me except with her cheeks it struck me that she should have been more anxious for me to hurry back to the succour of the earl but either from not knowing what was toward or from a readiness to keep me out of danger or even perhaps some resignation to the code of justice she took me quite up to the steps of the terrace before she could at all dispense with me and though i ran back at full speed with three or four men after me to the spot where i had left lord counterpagne there was no evil doer there for us to apprehend unless it was my lord himself and we found him in such a very sad condition that we were all afraid to lift him up chapter xxx perfidy anything of that kind makes me sad because i am in such a struggle to believe what everybody now has settled long ago and the younger he is the more he feels it that all our forefathers in comparison with us were low savages fools and brute beasts of the earth and doubtless to this perception of the nature from which we ourselves descend or rather by some gift more marvellous a thousandfold than mine ascend tower above their wretched loins and soar into the seventy seventh heaven or at least as much as we have left of it undemolished to this pure disdain of the brutes who begot us are due our strong yearning towards and reverend faith in the great father of us all a little snail without a head but so long as my nature is so disloyal to that great all father as to want a hat thoughts will come into that superfluous and therefore universally weak part of the present human being which goes into the chimney pot evolved alas as a penalty for that disloyalty oh that father mollusk could only have foreseen a tithe of the woes which the evolution of a head would entail upon his headstrong descendants unwise was he in his generation and some satan must already have been in posse or why did mother mollusk but such questions are not science which allows no question of her bashful physiology happier would have been my position now if the survival of the fittest had omitted me or at least had restored me to the patriarchal state of headless existence at the bottom of the sea all birds are now proved to have been evolved from lizards which accounts for my complicity with the saurian race and their influence upon my destiny and another piercing genius has certified us that the canine race being threatened with extinction after milliards of years by hydrophobia lay down and eccnested the protoplastic flea who took to his labour of love with congenital tripudiation and rescued the author of his origin from impending annihilation thus hydrophobia was the product of ennui of lying chained up in the sun and meditating too profoundly as all dogs do thus a dread of the depths of reflection was instituted in the mind of towser which developed in the intellect of his descendants into hydrophobia and must have undone them to the ends of their tails without the evolution of the genial flea he with an infusion of fresh blood sprang forth developed his saltatory powers by development of long legs or vice versa for i am not sure which way that link goes and has ever since satisfied the exigency that developed him by preserving every son of a dog thence generated from the paraphrenitis of nothing to scratch acrior illum cura donat i thought of all this though without any room for the moral lesson it so well conveys as i came upon old grip spread out largely in the sun upon the pet flower bed upon the pet lawn of that elegant rus in urbe as the house agent called it placid bower grip had caught a lizard which he did not care to eat getting more in the trencher way than he could away with and finding his teeth more and more like a hay rake which has done its work upon a score of farms by august but it was against all the principles of his life and the time honoured policy of the nation he belonged to to let go a hold he once had laid and yet as i could see by the twitching of his shoulder and munch of his lip he could scarcely tell how to defer the crisis and climax of a thoroughly exhaustive scratch for no one durst wash him except myself and i had never been near him for six hot weeks poor old chap it made all my low spirits go lower to think that he could never more hear me or see me until i came as nigh him as the length he once could jump there was no need to chain him up any more for fear of his flying at some visitor he had lived in the world such a length of time now that he cared not to strive any more against vice unless it came meddling with his own dear belongings all that old interest of sticking up for honesty he had long since resigned to his oxford son grapple whom he now approached with great consideration through the loss of his teeth and the stiffness of his loins grapple was bodily as good as grip had been in his fighting hey day neither was his pluck inferior but the difference between them in warmth of heart and faith and steadfast loyalty was almost as great as that grown up between our grandfathers and ourselves but i did not expect well aware as i was of his staunch and well proven fidelity such warmth and i might say such wildness of welcome as the ancient dog afforded me when i called out grip he pricked up his ears as if he could never more believe them and then he turned his poor eyes spread with film and looked at me as if i were a memory beginning to get an idea of some bliss he slowly arose and shook himself but still with his dull eyes set on me and a tremulous inquiry of his worn out tail grip i said grip what an old stupe you are and the sudden joy made a young dog of him with a mighty bark such as he never expected to compass again he leaped up at me and put his great ossified paws on my breast and offered me the delicate refreshment of his tongue then he capered about and made such a proclamation that the servants rushed out and seeing me rushed back to get things a little tidy before they let me in i found that my mother was still from home but expected to come back that night and had written to have the best bedroom prepared for an invalid gentleman whom she would bring this would of course be her brother william of whom i had fully thought to hear as dead and was greatly pleased to find it otherwise having kind memories of him and being uncommonly short of relatives as there was still a good piece of daylight and it seemed dull to sit there by myself i resolved to reward the faithful grip by taking him to see his native land as he fairly might consider maiden lane so we set forth together to call on mr chumps who still carried on his nutritious business and wore the blue apron more stoutly than ever ha my lad he cried as i opened the shop door which rang a sharp tocsin against beef and mutton reivers you are come just in time for a glass of the fizzing have you heard the good news no i s'pose not you've been down among all them swells so long wonder almost you would deign to look us up go on into the parlour with the missus and our linda in ten minutes thirty seconds i shall put the shutters up and wouldn't take 'em down for the dook or his royal highness leastways i might for hrh if he were going to give a supper party but not for his grace won't have shanks with his legs bill will be back in ten minutes go in lad in the parlour i found mrs chumps and her daughter belinda and some one else sitting in the corner who seemed to be doubtful about turning round at the sound of my voice or whatever it might be the room was rather gloomy from a balcony over the windows and the evening now set in and i thought what a very shy young lady they have got or perhaps she has had too much tea and cake and is gone fast asleep in the corner not to disturb her i sat down far away poor dear said mrs chumps who was looking very well and you might say ten years younger with a new front to her hair and a pink binding to her bosom and a pair of long skirted kid gloves on her lap and a juvenile jacket with bohemian scollops hung behind her as if she had just pulled it off which she never could have done unless born in it poor dear she naturally feels it so deeply oh tommy upmore you men never feel don't we i replied while wondering who the poor dear was and what her feelings were mrs chumps if you had only seen the stroke of our eight that beat cambridge three years running when he was compelled to have his wise tooth out and he had only cut it two years i can assure you and the dentist attributed its state entirely to the way the wind came over his left shoulder and he begged me to support him with my moral presence that was how he put it from his demoralisation how exactly you do talk like your dear mother mrs chumps answered and rather shut me up for a bachelor of arts ought to do more than that i dare say the young man felt that deep enough and my very best sympathies would be with him having had out from first to last five and forty of 'em ma cried miss belinda now how can you be so wicked mr upmore knows better when he sees them all there and as for five and forty and at fifty shillings each oh mr upmore how many have we got that depends upon circumstances i replied for fear of being wrong having never been told at oxford nor yet by mr cope nor yet by dr rumbelow nor any of the classics i had dealt with yet some have got more and some have less no doubt never mind that mrs chumps resumed such subjects are meant for young people or those who have never known what ill health means but my dear tommy the exact sum is twelve thousand one hundred and twenty five pounds deducting the duty of three per cent and hard it is to have to break the even money but the poor dear does her best to feel resigned and the other will have to pay six per cent that's one comfort at any rate and lucky she may count herself to get it at that reckoning when the whole twenty five should have come this way but there we must be easier to please as i'm sure has always been my motto it will fetch me back to the church it will just when i was going to join the congregation they provides in the church such a tenderness of feeling as i first learned out of the catechism n or m it says and he was both for his name was 'nathaniel matthew' and he sat at the receipt of customs and my godfather and godmother in my baptism wherein i was made an inheritor there is no such fine feeling among them dissenters poor dear it is a sad blow for her there was tears in her eyes when she told us of it and no mammon of unrighteousness could stop them rolling my son william who was first of all the colleges is gone to the lawyer now to give the proper orders as a barrister of lincoln inn is bound to do she have just dropped in to talk about the mourning her dear mamma says black but her mind is too distressful and not at all suitable to her bright complexion lavender to my mind is as deep as need be and the poor dear never seen him till his funeral that took place at highgate yesterday give us your opinion mr upmore if you please after coming from all their ladyships but i don't understand mrs chumps i answered wondering at my own stupidity i have not the least idea what the circumstances are no more don't i altogether the whole have come such a sudden blow to us belinda darling run and fetch the papers oh bless the girl she's gone without the keys i do believe mrs chumps laid down her gloves and began hunting in her pockets then hurried from the room upon her daughter's track while i sat bewildered then a sad sigh issued from the gloomy corner and a melancholy whisper followed it oh tommy tommy will you ever forgive me for years you were the chosen of my heart but but you slighted me you know you did ever since you became so rich and grand whatever has happened is all your own fault and and he is so many sizes bigger polly windsor i exclaimed going up to look at her have you been there all that time and never spoke a word to me oh how could i do it in the presence of spectators and i was so afraid that you would make a dreadful scene when you heard of all this money and my perfidy oh no you must never call it that dear tommy you would break my poor heart when i think of the many times we have settled almost everything sitting in the cleanest of the cinder holes my dress and yours and what the breakfast was to be and where we would have our holidays and now oh now you can be nothing more to me than the best man if they even allow you to be that but i shall insist upon it and bill in return may settle all about the bridesmaids oh here they come again for my sake control your feelings i found no difficulty at all in doing this and was heartily glad when i got at last to the kernel of the story which was simply this mrs windsor who had always spoken very highly of her grand connexions had an uncle well posted in the custom house and for many years enjoying fine opportunities such as they seldom seem to get there now of making due provision for the benefit of himself this thoroughly honest old gentleman contrived by strict economy and frugal speculations to die of the value of more than half a plum and having neither chick nor stick to care for had left the sum of five and twenty thousand pounds to be divided equally between his two god daughters polly windsor and another yet more distantly related whose name i have forgotten but can find out if required it must not be supposed for a moment that these facts had any influence whatever on the heart of our bill chumps which had found its purer half and more exalted aim in polly ever since he passed his little go still there were so many of the windsor family and soap had been so dull of late and candles had looked down so much that the paternal purveyor of meat more stubborn of fibre than a clare market steak steeled his heart and his block knife against an alliance which would cost a fellowship of three hundred pounds a year now this custom house money had redressed all that bill who was sure to have his way in the end as he always had done hitherto was welcome to have it at once with the blessing of the slaying and the boiling interest i alone was to be left in the cold and sympathy was felt for me whenever i was present but no sooner was i gone than i found out once by coming back sharply for my walking stick that everybody laughed and made a good joke of it as if i had been served quite right and taught not to give myself airs which i am sure i never did and this imbued me with such a sense of wrong that i declined to be the bride's best man at the wedding any more than i would be bill's bridesmaid and instead of feeling any envy for him i was sorry being morally certain that he would pay out for it for polly windsor's mother had a temper of her own as my dear father a very sound judge of women had said in my presence at least fifty times when she had taken up her glass with her gloves on a thing no right minded woman ever thinks of doing and such things can seldom or i might say never be thrown off in the female line however it was no concern of mine what sort of a handful bill chumps had got and the public will perceive that i should not have gone into this question at all as i have been obliged to do except for the stories put about concerning my share in the matter which as you see was none but no sooner does a man become highly distinguished in politics as i have been compelled to do than everything he has handled from the time he used his coral is raked up and ransacked and rifled against him fifty times have i been charged at elections and five times in the house itself by irish members with having jilted the daughter of a brother and far superior soap maker to my father it is below my dignity to explain such matters at the crisis of a very important debate or even when they are throwing eggs at me but i do hope that now having set down the facts with every word ready to be sworn to i have heard the last of that vile calumny footnote alas that the newest and perhaps noblest of all scientific discoveries the doctrine of creation by eccnesis cannot be claimed by an english or even as a priori should have been a learned scotch professor but passes to the credit of a french savant hitherto unknown but now immortal chapter xxxi free trade when one has been wronged by the outer world the sooner he gets back to the bosom of his family the likelier will he be to bear it well and as soon as the champagne was finished i made off it was useless to be in any hurry with old grip for he knew how undignified it is to pant though the formal cause thereof be portliness so that by the time we both got back to placid bower my mother had been at home more than an hour and had packed uncle william off to bed oh darling tommy so weak he is she told me as soon as we had heard all about one another and finished dinner i have only got to hold up my finger and he does it and i know the day when it was 'get away sophy' or 'do you think i'd put up with such something rubbish' or 'pack up my traps if you want to try that game' and he seems to have something on his mind that he cannot quite bring himself to tell me in the few times when he is at all fit to do it you must understand that he goes up and down pretty regular according to the time of day whenever the weather keeps side with it let him have his breakfast and get up at his leisure and have the barber in to shave him and the doctor to tell him that his pulse is better and then let him sit and see the sun come in even through a shrubbery of chimney pots and tell him that he shall have one pipe supposing he manages to eat his dinner well and you should see how happy and how smiling he lies back but as soon as the dusk comes on and the daylight goes and we can find no star to show him but only dull lamps in the narrowness of the streets then he seems to lose all hope altogether and turn over on his back and put his hands together and he says 'let me die sophy i should like to die if i thought there was any hope of going up to heaven' and i say to him 'william don't think of such dreadful things you are not an old man yet you know' and then he looks at me more pitiful than you could endure if you had known what a lively boy he was and he doesn't say another word as if it was all useless but sighs till you can see his great ribs shake oh tommy he brings me down so low sometimes that i feel only fit to see a clergyman mother you don't look at all like yourself i answered for she had always been so pleasant you never must give way to such melancholy thoughts uncle bill will soon be better in this fine air here and we'll show him the sun through the trees every morning and the cock that flies up into the weeping ash to crow and the lambs on the hill that have just been shorn and play like a lot of white mice in the distance and then in the evening if he feels down hearted we'll shut out the darkness before it comes on and light up the gas and a dozen best candles and play a game of cards to amuse him or tell stories i can tell stories now like fun of all the larks we had at oxford and sailors are like children so easy to amuse well my dear said mother we will do the best we can and your cheerful countenance is enough to scare the blues but he is not long for this world i am sure of that poor william but i do feel so thankful that he will die among his friends nonsense i replied for i had not seen him yet as he had fallen into light sleep after painful journey you have caught the infection of his lowness mother 'however bad the case is never pull long faces' as you used to sing to me when i got caned but when i went to look at uncle bill that night as he lay fast asleep upon his little narrow bed for nothing would induce him to go into a four poster i felt very much afraid that dear mother was too right i never should have guessed that this could be my uncle bill of whom i had such playful memories and to whose buoyant spirits and frolicsome nature nothing had ever been known to come amiss the great frame was there and the big tarry hands and the brown wrists tattoed with a true lover's knot and a union jack and blue anchors and i still could descry the short stubby nose which used to give such a merry lift to his mouth and the scar on his cheek that filled up when he laughed as to my recollection he was generally doing for if ever there had been a man who was fond of his joke it was my uncle william but alas there were very few more for him now in the morning i carried his bit of breakfast up as my mother had arranged it on a little tea tray but he took a long time to make out who i was though my mother of course had said a great deal about me tommy what tommy i remember lots of tommies he said with a pleasant smile still on his face although it was so gray and wasted there was tommy the cook's mate on board the saucy lass and tommy the cabin boy in the erysipelas and tommy the cheating old nigger at rio and tommy that had the dodge for catching flying fish and tommy no sir no your own nephew tommy tommy upmore that used to be a little boy at the soap works when you came back from sea and you tossed him through the ceiling and his head stuck fast but you are not to talk you must only think about it he obeyed me like a child looking at me now and then as if to refresh his memory while i held the tea cup to his lips and put some buttered toast into his mouth between whiles and the great jaws that used to lift a kitchen table could scarcely crush the soft toast without the tea to help them mother will come in and sit with you now i said when he had eaten as much as he could manage and at eleven o'clock you will have a bowl of soup and a glass of port wine and after that you go to sleep we are not going to bother you with any doctor at least until the afternoon and then perhaps dr flebotham a very clever man who almost saved my dear father's life will look in to have a little chat with you no tommy no he answered looking at me steadily as if his breakfast had supported him 'twould only be running up a bill for nothing and your mother has paid a deal too much for me already but she shall have it all back again my boy and a pretty penny on the top of it if you can keep a secret i can call you to mind pretty clearly now though not a bit like what you used to be except for the swab on the top of your head can you keep a secret tommy boy sir i replied with my eyes upon his and my countenance full of decision it is the very thing that i have always been most famous for of all the many things that i can do in spite of this very strong assurance he seemed to be doubtful as if i had said too much how can you be famous for it he asked perhaps with some reason unless you are accustomed to brag about them but 'tis hobson's choice with me tommy between you and your mother and the youngest lad is safer than the very oldest woman get your dear mother to go upon an errand the longer the better when i am at my best about noon of the day and then get me a pipe to improve my breath and you shall know what there is so far as i can fetch my wind to tell it i remember all about you my lad now i put my fingers to my lips to convince him what an enemy i was to excess of conversation and i saw that he was pleased and it helped to satisfy him that there could be no mistake in trusting me and the way in which i managed to get my mother off the premises was enough to establish my repute in this way for i told her what was true that after all the many years mrs windsor and she had been such hearty and warm friends never falling out except once for three years upon the question whether when you sew a button on a shirt the thread should be wound round the stitches that go through it before fastening off or whether as my mother said that does more harm than good after all this staunch and uninterrupted love it would seem a very heartless thing on her side if she failed to set off at the first hour allowed by good breeding for call which in maiden lane was always eleven o'clock except upon a washing day and congratulate her cordially and find out everything about the engagement of polly to bill chumps my dear mother was quite as eager to do this as i to persuade her of the duty of it supposing only that uncle bill could get on without her for two hours and a half two hours and a half meant five i knew for two hours at least would be spent in cabs inasmuch as my mother never got into a cab without making the driver go all the way according to her own directions this being to him an increase of income he was glad to navigate accordingly and enjoyed a geographical lecture at the end of the journey which was worth another shilling to him for my dear mother felt a great truth which has never been properly felt by our school boards so that the foundation of their scheme is rotten viz that people must be paid for learning which is perhaps the saddest trial of the human life uncle bill should have been depressed and frightened by this first parting from his kindly watchful nurse but he took quite a different view of the matter and resolved to have all the pipes that he could get and a glass of hot grog with the window open surely it is bad for you sir i said but he answered my son what do you know about it i am making my accounts up for a better world and what good will can i hope for if i cast them up all dry as soon as he had made himself quite comfortable with an ounce of best bird's eye and three clean pipes and the appearance of more rum not far off he said tommy lock the door and put the key beneath the baccy box and let me know if your dear mother happens to turn back for women are very liable to do that sort of thing very well now come and sit close by me i can't spin a long yarn for want of wind nor yet a very plain one but you must help it out about three years ago after knocking about in a lot of little craft in the indian seas sometimes up and sometimes down according to the fortunes of seafaring men i was skipper of a schooner in the sponge and coral trade or the beachymess or anything that might turn up from a terrapin to a tarpaulin as we say we were trading with the natives between whiles every man on his own hook with his own ventures while we waited for the super cargo's orders according as he landed to get freight and not being full he took us to the well never mind what islands but a very savage part where the people are idolaters and cannibals here there was a settlement of white men hailing from every land under the sun almost where it doesn't turn them black and make niggers of them as lazy a lot as could be found pretty well but they kept themselves with fire arms against the natives and collected goods for shipment in a fort they had set up we had orders from the factor who was also part owner of the craft whose name was the saucy lass to leave him at the fort for a couple of days while we made the opposite coast about three leagues off to traffic for ourselves if we could and to lay in provisions and our stock of water for the water at the fort though very good while fresh would not keep three days in cask when out at sea he showed us where beautiful water could be got and plenty of cassavas yams and such like and fruit none of us knew the names of but he warned us to be on our guard and stand off at night and keep the brass guns loaded for the natives of that island were much worse than this and these were bad enough in all conscience there was no reef between the two islands but one enormous reef round both of them with water as clear as plate glass inside and a light air and sands that shone like snow we found the pretty stream of good water as he told us and began to take in our supply with the boats for we carried more hands than is usual aboard a schooner of three hundred tons several having shipped without much wages on the chance of doing something for themselves and there was not a lascar among them but mostly british and two or three germans so that we were not afraid of half a thousand savages without treachery or surprise or some other dirty trick but the part where we landed showed no sign at first of having any living creatures upon it bigger than wild pigs and goats and an animal something like a hare that was very good eating and the quantity of fruit upon the trees was such that most of us found ourselves doubled up with colic but i served out a good supply of cordials for that and afterwards the fine appearance of the place and the softness of the air and the colour of the ground which was almost as good as a meadow to us seemed to make us sleepy and inclined to lie about and it would not be true of me to tell you tommy that i was the breadth of a rope's end better than the hands put under me i never was very strong for discipline from knowing that i should not like to have it done to me and being more used to come under it than over it according to the want of luck and money but we happened to have a very good scotch mate whose name was rob mcalister 'captain' he says to me when i was lying easy on a bank of some stuff that was as soft as feathers and wishing i had somebody to fill my pipe and light it 'captain it mis gi'es me much but we be o'erfeckless' 'you go to jericho rob' i answered 'or fill my pipe first and strike me a light and then go to the top of that rock and look out' before i had finished my pipe he came back and told me that the woods were so thick inland that they might hold a thousand people without showing one but he felt almost sure that he had heard a screech not of a bird or wild beast but a man and this made me pay some attention because i knew that his hearing was wonderfully sharp for he had saved us once by hearing breakers through a full gale of wind at night when no other man could perceive the sound 'call the hands together and draw down to the boats' was the order i gave 'i shall be down there myself by the time you have got them ready' but whether i fell off to sleep or what is more than i can tell only one thing is certain the men were at the boats before i was near them and before i had begun to think at all about it then they sent a lad to fetch me whose name was tommy understrapper to the cook but before he could find me a terrible scream made me sit up and look round upon the slope behind me were a lot of darkies running and in front of them a white man flying for his life who had clearly caught sight of our boats just when his case seemed altogether hopeless our men had seen him and were pushing out a little while others waved their guns and shouted to him to put on his last bit of speed and they would save him from the place where they stood they could see the great multitude of his pursuers which i could not do and this made me wrong them in thinking them cowards for not coming up the hill to help meanwhile he was coming down the hill with his breath too short to be used and his heart pumped out and his naked legs covered with blood and his face as white as birch bark and as resolute as iron three of his pursuers were in front of the rest and not more than thirty yards behind him and each bore a javelin which he would not throw yet for fear of missing aim in the rush of it none of them had seen me where i sat and watched them through the bush that sheltered me i saw that they must pass within a few yards of my lair so i crawled behind a tree which was feathered with some creepers and there stood upright with my double barrelled shot gun which i luckily had brought for the chance of game then i gave a little whistle and the flying man descried me and turned in that direction 'don't stop' i whispered and he saw what i meant and continued down the hill as if he had not seen me then as his three pursuers rushed past the tree i let out with my fist at the left ear of the nearest one and sent him sprawling then i shot the two others as dead as a door nail before they could turn to lance me big limber fellows they were both one of them fell forward on his head and turned a somersault down the steep ridge he was so hastily descending 'on for your life' i cried 'you are too blown to fight tell the mate to come with half a dozen men to meet me' he doubted for a moment about leaving me but seeing me loading again in all haste and the rest of his pursuers standing still in great amazement on he went and i could hear him panting down the hill then as soon as i had loaded i made after him with speed seeing which the other savages set up a fearful whoop and came rushing down the hill perhaps three hundred altogether two javelins hissed over my head and then i turned and dropping on my knee sent two heavy loads of duck shot right into the faces of the foremost this dropped three or four of them and the rest stopped again as if they had never seen a thing like this before and the roar of the gun among the rocks was not a trifle without stopping to load again on i hastened and met bob and six sturdy fellows eager for a shot 'not yet' i cried 'not until we are aboard and then let us give them a general salute' all saw the force of this and as soon as we had lifted the poor runaway into my boat we pushed off when somebody exclaimed 'why wherever is poor tommy' it was this boy's scream which had so luckily aroused me and then in his terror he had tumbled on a rock and lay there stunned until the present moment tommy was a favourite with every one and it was impossible to leave him to be killed so the mate and two others volunteered to go and fetch him although it was no small danger because the savages had rallied and were coming on again but we sat ready with our guns presented and mis liking perhaps the look of them the villains hesitated so our three men brought poor tommy to the water's edge and we gave them a good cheer which they heartily deserved we saw little tommy hoisted on the back of bob mcalister for his legs had quite failed him and just as we were stretching out our arms to ease him in the savages let fly at us a volley of their javelins 'give it them' i cried and every gun rang out with a fine blaze of fire for the evening was set in away scampered every baccy coloured skin that could for at least half a score of them could move no more but alas they had done for our poor little tommy a javelin had passed through his loin and pinned him to the brave mate's shoulder so that he was dead in about five minutes our men were so enraged that they longed to land again and go after the savages but i would not allow it with night coming on and two of our number wounded so we made for the saucy lass and got on board tired with our day's work and very sad about poor little tommy now my lad i am not come to the chief part yet but i can't tell any more for coughing now find something for your mother to be off about to morrow and perhaps if you behave yourself you shall hear the rest of it chapter xxxii a pair of blue eyes my mother who was very sharp about some things could not have failed to discover from me or else from uncle bill who was as simple as a child that he had spent a long time in telling me a portion of one of his manifold adventures which recalled to my mind once or twice the rare doings of that grandest of all rovers captain robinson crusoe but when she returned from a very long visit to mrs windsor she had such a quantity not only to tell but to give her own opinion on and to get it confirmed by mine whenever she could stop that it was next to impossible for her to look about as she generally did or even wait to be talked to unless it was about the matter she was so wrapped up in and she declared that she had not heard a quarter of it yet being forced by her duties here to come away abruptly though she could not have had less than five hours there however well she steered the cabman and if she could only be sure that her dear invalid would not miss her so very much she had promised to go again and give her very humble advice about many things to morrow it was very painful for her she confessed that freely when she remembered what might have been and l might better have stopped in the boiling connection than gone into the meat trade to buy up opposition however her dear boy would not break his heart had he cared to come forward he might have put a spoke in somebody's wheel and there always had been something about polly which she would be the last to remind her mother of when the coast was quite clear as captain william expressed it after looking down the drive as we called it which was very nearly twelve yards long whenever the gate was opened outwards and receiving a wave from a new white handkerchief for my dear mother had taken three that day having wept into her capstrings yesterday he made his preparations or directed me to make them for a very long voyage in the narrative trade he had three pipes ready not to smoke them hot for fear of any tendency towards coughing and a glass of regulation to be served when he made signal and his little spy glass handy that he might see the bus from hampstead at a turn of the road a long way up the hill and he always expected to see sailors on it and if he saw one he would be sure to drink his health tommy he said in a determined tone i mean to have a quid and no mistake it is six months now since i have had a quid in the pocket of that coat behind the door but sir i answered looking at him with surprise you have been most strictly forbidden to do it you spoke of it yesterday and dr flebotham said that congestion at least might ensue try to wait till mother comes and if she allows it don't be crafty tommy now i hate crafty people your mother would never allow it you know well and my only chance for it is when she is gone away do as i tell you i am the skipper here mutiny indeed from a younker just shipped you won't hear another word until you bring my knife from the pocket with the yellow button to it and a cake of cavendish from the little midship locker very good now cut where i scar my nail it's not so much the comfort of it that i want as to keep the throat juicy and prevent me coughing from hauling so many dry words out of my hold very well done tommy i shall promote you now where did i break my yarn off about your all getting safe into the ship sir with two men wounded and poor little tommy dead and you said you hadn't come to the best part yet though i thought it was very good indeed already well my son you shall hear the rest of it and judge as soon as we had brought ourselves round with victuals for the sake of the hard day we had been through i sent for the man we had rescued and held a long talk with him in my cabin as yet i have only been able to meet with two men who had the gift of gratitude and both of those happened to be welshmen the name of this man was rees edwards and a smarter hand never went aloft welshmen as a rule are not first rate seamen but when they are good they beat everything and rees edwards was the best of them i ever came across his last trip had been in an american bark called the beaver engaged in the beachymess and sponge trade among these pacific islands she had struck in the night on the great coral reef surrounding these two islands and a smart breeze from seaward setting in they had found it impossible to haul her off a heavy sea got up and she broached to with the rocks grinding through her timbers but the crew contrived to launch their boats and finding a passage through the reef made land and were very soon surrounded by the natives these fellows shammed to be as good as gold at first though of course they knew nothing of their lingo and supplied them with food and gave them huts to live in and laid themselves out to be obliging so that the castaways eighteen in number began to go about the place as if they were at home and prepared with the rough tools they could make to build a craft big enough to carry them away but suddenly two of their number were missing and then two more and then another couple and the natives endeavoured to persuade them by signs that these had only wandered away into the woods and would soon find their way home again the surviving dozen did their best to hope so but took more care to keep together and not to go abroad at all at night but very soon they found out the horrible meaning of it for suddenly the savages having lost all patience with their appetites whetted by the relish of white flesh fell upon them in the night and killed them all but three leaving nothing but their bones by the morrow night those three they kept alive because they were too thin until they fattened up two and devoured them the third and last was our friend rees edwards who fell into a melancholy frame of mind and refused to grow eatable upon any kind of ration so they put him in the temple where they kept their chief idol believing that this would improve his texture and consecrating him to be sacrificed whether he were fat or whether he were lean upon the appearance of the following moon edwards however was a very clever fellow and pretending to be altogether resigned to his fate obtained some privileges as a holy man now and devoted to the glory of their great idol jumbilug he kept a sharp watch upon the moon as well and took strengthening victuals as he saw her getting thinner he had learned a good deal of their lingo by this time and found out from them about the white man's fort over against the further end of that island and the very night before the new moon would appear he slipped through a hole which he had long been boring in the mud wall of the joss house and escaped into the woods with a long start of his enemies he made his way eastward by the stars till sunrise and eastward the whole of the following day with his enemies upon his track as you have heard already 'now captain' he said when his tale was finished 'you have done me the best turn one man can do another and i wish i could make you some small return jumbilug is the finest woman i ever saw and it would not be so very hard to run away with her' i told him that this was not in my line at all having always been shy of the sex except to make a joke or pass a compliment but he laughed and said 'no fear of her tongue captain although she has got a very handsome one and her teeth are all pearls and her lips are coral and her eyes are as blue as the sky and much brighter and her hair is spun gold you never saw such a beauty' 'i don't care a d n for all that' i replied 'a woman aboard is the devil himself' but when i found that all these beauties were real and could have no deception about them because the fair woman was made of wood i became very eager to possess these charms if it might be done without fool hardiness edwards assured me that with a little dash and management it might well be done for jumbilug's house was a good bit away from the town of these savages and very near the sea and if we desired to punish the barbarians as every man john of us burned to do for the murder of poor little tommy and the massacre roasting and devouring of seventeen helpless white men nothing could be such a desperate blow to them as to lose their idol for generation after generation had spent their best treasures in adorning her 'if she's worth a penny she's worth l and they'd rather lose their biggest chief and all their wives and daughters i'm no judge of jewels captain but her eyes are something to beat all female embellishment they come after you all over the place and they shine by night like a million fire flies the tradition of the people is that they were brought by a bird with great wings from a country far away perhaps an old trading ship from borneo anyhow there they are and the pearls of teeth as big as my thumb pretty nearly and the tongue some red jewel they pick out of the rocks and the hair spun gold almost down to her waist and the whole of the breast covered up with fine pearls ah you should have seen her when the full moon shone as it did upon the night when i was dedicated' this description my dear tommy produced a very fine effect upon my mind i have heard your dear mother say a hundred times that nothing is so elevating to the male nature as admiration of a virtuous female and where could i hope to find any female half so virtuous as jumbilug but i cautioned rees edwards not to let our fellows know what the value of this fair maiden was 'you are right' he made answer 'we should lose half her pearls though the other things won't come out easily at all when the priest was asleep one night i just ventured to feel the bright tip of her tongue but it was firm anchored in good holding ground we must have a scheme to bring her off entire and not let them know that we do it for her value but for the outrage and cruelty of them all that we can plan out afterwards but first find out whether they are up for it of course if they are not we can't drive them to it' i questioned our fellows about this matter and found them not only quite ready but eager and i might say wild to go forth upon this venture and that not only for the spree as sailors call it but with the prospect combined of revenge for the loss of little tommy and of punishing niggers for eating superior flesh and of bringing back snug bits of plunder on their own account for i promised them everything they could lay hold of and carry away except jumbilug herself not for her value as i told them plainly but as a curiosity for a museum which might even give me l for her they knew that i had never been a greedy man and they promised to give me some of their own share if it should be worth my acceptance being hard set for time we resolved to do it on the very next night having made up our minds to keep our allies at the fort outside it because of the claims they might set up there would be no moon and those wretched man eaters would be all fast asleep as rees edwards told us within two hours after sunset they might have set a watch upon the schooner but they could not see boats at that distance from the shore and they had no canoes on this side of the point so we left the wounded men to mind the craft with the two brass carronades loaded and slipped off all in the yawl this time ten of us i think besides the welshman with muffled oars and all guns loaded by water the distance was less than by land and with rees edwards steering we made the land right under the joss house in about three hours it was very dark here for the starlight was shut out by trees overhanging the water and leaving two hands to mind the yawl and just keep her afloat for all was calm as a duck pool nine of us landed with guns and axes and without a word made for the temple we found the very hole by which edwards had escaped only roughly stopped with brushwood which we removed quietly and then the welshman entered and went round the place knowing every corner of it as soft as a mouse and then came back and whispered 'only the old priest here and he's snoring in the lobby captain come in and the rest wait signal' this had been settled between us and first we gagged the old priest and corded him for he was not a bad fellow compared with some and had been pretty good to his captive then we rolled up jumbilug whose eyes were sparkling in a piece of sailcloth which i had brought for the purpose and we lashed it round her ankles and above her golden hair then we ran to the front gate and let in our fellows and they struck a light and looked about them there was plenty of glitter and a lot of little images and brummagem beads and bits of glass and such like but very little gold except jumbilug's own for the island produced none i dare say however there were pearls upon almost every image and a lot of lovely shells and shining spar and coral every man took whatever caught his eye while edwards and myself lifted jumbilug who was about five feet long from her pedestal and carried her though she was a precious weight to the boat and laid her in the stern sheets then we ran back and fetched out our men for fear of accidents and all well laden made off in high feather and it was high time i can tell you master tommy for we heard a tremendous row before we turned the point screeching and wailing and the shrieks of women perhaps they had seen our lights up in the village which was not more than half a mile away and the building had windows in the dome made of talc or some such half transparent stuff we were heartily pleased with our job and gave them three cheers for their liberality in the morning we made sail for the fort all pledged to say nothing about our exploit even to the factor but every man stowing away his own loot without any quarrelling about it and of course giving proper share to those outside but when rees edwards came into my cabin and we unrolled jumbilug privately i can tell you that i stared as i never stared before at any female figure she was ten times as gorgeous as he had described her and the wealth of whole ages was in and upon her i insisted that edwards should take his fair share though he laid no claim to anything we stood her upright against the bulk head as handsome as paint and as bright as a star and then we looked at her and she looked at us as if begging us not to spoil her beauty 'first choice to you captain' said the welshman but i answered 'no let us toss for it' and so we did and i won and made choice of her eyes and then we went on turn and turn until there was nothing left but the wooden block and even that was very clever i can tell you and would fetch l for a museum i believe he got the teeth which i was very glad of a dozen large pearls half as big as my thumb but i got the golden hair and made a present of it all except one lock to rob mcalister who was prouder of it than of his sweetheart also i got but there what's the use of talking of it you have heard what careless scattergoods all honest sailors are there is nothing left of all of it but only these here and they'd have gone long ago but for being in my caul uncle william sighed a little at the end of his long yarn as if he should never spin such another and then from inside the blue woollen thing he wore on the hoops of his ribs out he pulled a little packet something like a worn out piece of bladder from a jam pot rolled and tied with yellow silk open it yourself he said but have a care of my caul young tommy which has saved me fifteen times from drowning though the lord knows i shall never want it any more this old ship is chartered for a voyage to kingdom come perhaps that coast fever has been and spoiled the colour of them i haven't seen them now for a twelvemonth or more though i feel 'em going into my ribs pretty often one will be for you and one for your mother as soon as you have put me under ground uncle bill i said we don't mean to do anything of that kind you shan't go aloft as you call it for forty years yet why what most wonderful things i declare what lovely gold and what amazing stones he looked at me with a very pleasant smile something like your hair the gold is spun up tommy ain't it only yours have got more touch of nut colour in it indian work that is i reckon stolen out of some wreck with the stones no doubt no savage work there and no english goldsmith nor french either could come near it mysore or tanjore or trichinopoly but i believe the stones must have come from borneo at least so the only knowing man i ever showed them to thought they must have done though he couldn't say how and jumbilug had worn them for three hundred years at a rough guess for ten men's time the savages told edwards he told me he believed they must be blue diamonds but i never heard of such things i call them sapphires and i wouldn't tell you what the island is why do you think because such a government as we've got now would insist upon what they call 'restitution' they'd send out one of them iron pig troughs things they have turned the british navy into to re build jumbilug and fit her up again with her eyes at our expense and all the rest at the cost of the british taxpayers and then give her a royal salute and steam away for fear of hurting the feelings of the natives and perhaps i replied for this reminded me of roly's views upon that subject they would put half a hundred of plump englishmen ashore as a meet and proper offering to the injured jumbilug chapter xxxiii strong intentions such a weight came off the heart of good uncle william and such a relief was afforded to his ribs where the parcel had made a great hole as he showed me like the postmaster's stamp on a bonnet box that as soon as he restored his caul to its proper and inborn aptitude of comfort he was enabled to be just to another tidy quid and another glass of grog not so very fountain heady don't let me see them any more he said when he found himself ready for a bit to eat they have buttoned up the locker of my poor stomach and i believe that's how i took the fever to which i was never born natural but not a word to your dear mother about them until i tip the signal that old jew wanted oh how he did try to get these beauties out of me he would have given me a thousand pounds apiece for them and that proves them to be worth at least ten times as much get a fair opinion about them my lad and then lock them away unless you want the money i could not help admiring the very clever way in which uncle william had encircled the blue stones with the spun wreath of pure gold as fine as any hair quite as if they were a pair of brooches in gold setting and this fetched the colour up or made them show by contrast with a lustre at once very clear and very dark though both of the crystals were still in the rough they were something like a pear in form which explains little for pears are as different in shape as men are what i mean is a pear of the variety which the dealers call the duchess which tapers less than the jargonelle but much more than the bergamots between the two crystals there was very little difference in size or weight or colour each of them turning an ounce in the scales but much as i admired them and could look at them for hours it did not seem likely that they could be worth what uncle william talked about upon this point i determined to consult professor megalow who knew nearly as much about stones as bones till i saw in the times that he was sent to egypt upon some important scientific errand and then it occurred to me to ask sir roland not that he was likely to know anything about it but that he might commend me to a skilful and upright jeweller such as a family of rank and wealth were likely to have dealings with and even while i was thinking of him up he rode in his usual haste upon a showy looking hack for the twentifolds had given up their london establishment at the death of the previous baronet with very great pleasure i ran down to meet him for although placid bower was not very grand i knew that he would be well pleased with it his nature being very kind and frank and hearty of course he spoke first for he always took the lead why tommy what a beautiful place you have got i envy you my dear boy that i do and such a look out you can see the victoria tower and read the clock over the bridge with a moderate glass and on a clear day you can see the derby run you rogue you never told me of this snug shop the very place for an industrious mp and that is what i'm come about as well as the pleasure of seeing you my dear friend and your good mother mother will be home in an hour or two i said and we'll make your horse comfortable and you too i hope she is gone to see bill chumps' intended and advise about all the great preparations he is going to marry miss windsor who has come into a tidy little lump of money l entirely at her own disposal but of course they will have a settlement holloa he answered well that beats me i thought you were sweet in that quarter master tommy but you look very jolly so i hope it is all right take me into your own den first i want to have a pipe and a chat with you well here we are just the sort of place i like books enough to look at and remind you of past woes with their backs shown like scattered enemies but i don't half like this news of yours i did not mean chumps to get married for ten years it takes all the enterprise out of a man on the other hand the cash will be handy for him and enable him to apply himself to politics though not half enough to live upon but i have very large ideas in my head when do they mean to be made miserable for life somewhere this side of michaelmas my mother seems to say they have long been engaged though old chumps would not have it until her godfather discharged responsibilities you are quite wrong roly in supposing that i have any call for a moment to wear the willow it is true that miss windsor and your most obedient have been very intimate from tender years and ever must cherish sweet memories of playing together in the soapsuds but she does not approach she in no way realizes she never has been to me more than a bubble tommy your metaphor is fine and which is a much greater rarity appropriate now let us consider how all this bears on the one ambition of my life and of every life at all worth living the kicking of the rads off the foul perch they are crowing on they have made it foul mind it was clean enough when they hopped up by cackling and flapping their wings and nudging sideways as if they meant rather to go down than up all the honest cocks on the top bar took it easy and put their heads under their wings and tucked up one leg and spread out the claws of the other till down they went headlong tumbling on their combs at the rush of a cock who had sworn he would not fight and fight he won't now to preserve his hen's eggs but only to keep his own perch to himself and the few little bantams he allows to come up meanwhile rats and weasels increase and flourish not a sound egg of trade is there left in the nest and of all the fat chicks of the colonies not one is allowed to jump up on the mother's broad back and practice a little crow under her protection in fact my dear tommy the big cock of all having crowed himself up to the top of the roost has forbidden every other cock to chuckle in his throat unless it is in chorus with him meanwhile his own run is on every side invaded and his chicks carried off and his corn bin robbed but all he cares for is to keep his own perch and be clucked to as if he were the only cock on earth i dare say that is all true enough i answered but i don't see how we are to better it what can two little cockerels such as you and i do tommy it is that accursed spirit or want of spirit that keeps the pest triumphant i am a very little cockerel as you say and should bite the dust before the old rooster reason and right go down before him and all the old principles of patriotism are a mixen for him to crow on but why there have been infinitely finer cocks who would have rolled in the dirt if they had tried to cut such capers the reason is simply craven terror and the want of firm union against him truth and common sense and common interests must prevail in the end if only they are backed up against crowing humbug and it is the first duty of every one who cares for his country to bear his little share in this eloquence eloquence is all the cry unrivalled eloquence vast experience unparalleled powers of mind and so forth but all of these cannot turn black into white nor prove that we are clean when they have dragged us through the mud we are bad enough now with our country despised our manufactures ruined our agriculture bankrupt our land worth nothing our army made an infant school and our kingdom rent in twain but madness ten times worse than that is threatened and promised for the very next session well let us hear the worst of it i answered very calmly being used to these rodomontades of sir roland's and not having found myself much the worse yet what does the enemy mean to do next year you may smile tommy i am afraid you are as bad as the rest who won't try to stop the blow until their backs are broken what do you think of these three little measures out of seven which the cabinet propose to employ the recess in preparing and maturing as they call it to give the county franchise to every man who has a dust bin or even a dust pan if he lives a hundred miles from london to prohibit landowners from having any children after a date to be settled by the act to abandon malta gibraltar and aden and all other places held unjustly and surrender the british fleet and all ships of war now building to france and russia and the irish land league a pretty fair programme i call that and so should i roly if i believed a word of it but don't carry on with any more such chaff have a glass of good ale good english malt a sound constitutional draught as you call it i ordered in a firkin and it has just got bright now if englishmen drank this exclaimed sir roland after a good pull at the fresh and freshening beverage in my silver pot one of the many i had earned as coxswain of victorious crews if britons instead of whining about their digestions and sipping the flat sourness of half ripened grapes took a good swig of such hearty stuff as that very soon we should be britons again the need of the age is good ale my tommy not the public house stuff but the genuine thing such as every good brewery can turn out when it likes the decay of the nation and the triumph of the hypocrites date from the difficulty of getting decent beer and think of the brotherhood created by good beer i take a pull tommy so do you we look at one another and we trust one another and a mutual warmth goes down into our glad bosoms will you get such a feeling from your sulky glass of claret or your poisonous artificial waters or even the fizz up the nose of your touch and go champagne no my boy one of my most cherished hopes is to supply the noble working man with a real good article in the way of ale and then let him be a rad or let him be a tory at any rate he will be an englishman again let us have another pull to illustrate that sentiment i could not help laughing at sir roland's warmth and confidence whatever he said he had a way of saying without gesticulation or appearance of excitement which made at once a short cut into the mind of any listener perhaps because it came so straight and clear and sure from his own mind and generally in simple words which are the wings of eloquence now tell me what you came for roly i said being tired of politics have you any news from home or anything of interest to the beer quaffing briton i don't care twopence about the government they can't do any harm for six months now can't they indeed why that is the very season when they disgrace us most of all without even having to cut the double shuffle in answer to any honest question however as you don't want any more of that though you must be roused up before february i'll do what i can for you in smaller matters understand then that poor counterpagne who ought to have made a better fight of it i don't think an old man could have punished me like that though i should be devilish sorry to give him such occasion he has got no bones broken any more than you had when the rock gave you such a thumping but it would have been better for him if he had as regards his popularity at our place my mother won't go near him which she must have done if his damage had been more dangerous you know my darling mother is a little bit sentimental and by no means worldly minded but the most stubborn of the stubborn in her quiet and very gentle way she won't argue a point she will let one talk for ever without a word of contradiction and there her conviction remains as unmoved as the table one has been talking over i knew by her face that sunday evening that it was all up with counterpagne's chance of laura thank god i cried for the news was well worth it and then at his look of astonishment i said your dear sister in my opinion is the most perfect of all created beings and i would rather have my eyes put out than see her made miserable by a heartless selfish weak minded cold natured priggish and altogether unprincipled fellow who could never have the smallest idea of her value you seem to be uncommonly warm about it tommy what has poor counterpagne ever done to you he has his faults i know and he is not a sound conservative but he has scarcely enough character to be so bad as you suppose him he has a great deal more character or want of it than you think and now that i can do him no harm with you i will tell you a thing which i have kept to myself though i had a hard job to conceal it from you when i saw him continually at your sister's side some days before that nathan and david business and the very fine thrashing he received i got a letter from an old friend of mine at corpus which was sent on to me from this place and the writer without knowing more of lord counterpagne than that chumps knew him and i knew chumps said that he had met him at his club in london where he was by no means popular and then at the very time when he was preparing to visit you and carry on his courtship he was living with an actress of very low repute and had promised as she said to marry her with that i have nothing to do and i know that it is not supposed now to be any harm at all but i thought it a low thing for him to come fresh from such company and hold your sister's hand you are quite right tommy it was a low thing and no gentleman who thought twice would have done it and over and above all that you know that i have a great contempt for counterpagne i know that you have how can you help it and yet for some trumpery bits of ground or some dirty seat in parliament you have been eager to sacrifice the purest and warmest and sweetest heart in all the world to such a wretch tommy you speak hotly and a little beyond your business what makes you take up this question so intensely sir roland looked at me in such a way that i resolved to have it out with him and sail or sink at least under true colours the simple fact i said looking full into his eyes for no man should frighten me in a manly business that i love your sister as purely and entirely as even she can deserve to be loved there is not the least necessity for you to tell me that i am a presumptuous fool or ass or anything else that you like to call me for daring to do such a thing but i have dared it and shall dare it all my life and though i have very little hope of success it has done me good and has elevated me not in the social scale i mean or any of that stuff but as a man a man who has a right to give his heart though he may get nothing but disdain for it i have wanted for a long time to tell you this that we might understand each other you have seen my reluctance to accept favours from you to get put into the house and so on i could not do that while i kept you in the dark about a thing likely to change all your feelings you cannot say now that i have humbugged you sir roland though generally so quick of reply as almost to snap the words out of one's mouth took so much time to think that i felt my heart beat like the wing of a bird that is rising well tommy he said looking more perplexed than angry and taking me by the hand you have spoken as a man and i thank you for it and you deserve that i should speak with equal candour i will not say anything to hurt your feelings more than may be avoided as regards money and character and education and kindliness of nature and warmth of heart you are all that a man need desire for his sister but as regards birth my dear fellow excuse me you know that i would not say anything to pain you about such an accident if i could help it there comes the point which is hard to get over we twentifolds do not pretend to be of royal or even of noble descent in the direct line though we have intermarried often enough with the best blood in england but this we can say that for five hundred years we have always been of the foremost rank of commoners and baronets ever since such things were in the last hundred years there has only been one taint oh let me hear all about that i exclaimed i am truly delighted that there has been that was it in the tallow line my dear roly no sir it was not it was in oil and beeswax he answered with a frown which was very like a smile the subject is a sore one and pursuit would make it sorer you had better ask my mother what the story is she tells it with simplicity and sympathy but to come back to tallow as you coarsely put it let everything between us be exactly as it was after what you have done for laura who would not be alive to marry any one but for you i shall not attempt to interfere between you like the present government i shall 'maintain an attitude of masterly inactivity' which may or may not have the usual result to wit servile passivity not a word about this subject again between us until i renew it also bear in mind one thing even if you succeed with my mother and with laura you will not have my consent without which nothing whatever can come of it until you have done something great and glorious to win the fame which leaps over all distinctions chapter xxxiv fames famae what is a fame that overleaps distinctions and how may a poor fellow get hold of it i knew a man once who could crackle all his knuckles like a pair of four chambered revolvers and then fire off his wrists and elbows like double barrelled rifles after them we called him the distinguished knuckle duster and he called himself the famous artilleryman would an exploit of that sort overleap the pride of birth and endow our humble candles with the winding sheet of pedigree it was not in my nature to be put down without having something to say for it my mind was of ordinary substance and perhaps rather heavy to balance the body as well as to keep the heart company at times when the pair were in trouble together but my body was not a mere somebody neither an anybody nor a common nobody but a substance in some wise remarkable and surely as distinguished as that of the great knuckle duster he had won fame to his own satisfaction by deeds more surprising to the public ear but far less so to the public eye than those of which i was capable now which is more potent the ear or the eye which throws the quickest flash into the brain and fills it with action the longest even before we have learned enough of speech to be certain that all men are liars how slowly creep in at the sides of the head the things that leap in at the front of it hot are the stings of the eye but cold the pains of the ear says an ancient pithier for once than horace this being so what should prevent me from attaining a hotter fame than even mr panclast's he could beat his drum upon the ear alone and sound his own trumpet into waxy cells but i could fly straight into the retina of the brain and block the whole traffic of the optic nerve i will cultivate the lofty gifts of nature i exclaimed when everybody else was gone to bed for the sake of my country i am bound to do it sir roland was right and the great professor wrong why did he say to me 'fly no more aerial tommy fly no more' why simply because he is a rad and foresees confusion to the rad race in my powers when developed so far as my own convictions go there is scarcely the seed of a fig between a rad and a tory when they are let alone but the difference is that a rad can be lashed up like a half broken horse into any fit of kicking and cares not a rap what he smashes in his rage but a tory is far less impetuous he has a much stronger perception of the rights of others and especially of his country's claim upon him such are the men who are needed now panclast has an extraordinary gift of lashing up quiet folk to kick against their neighbours and of running round the corner when his own legs are in jeopardy however he is the master of the yard for the present in virtue of his powers of swearing roly says but there must be a great deal more than that the upshot of my very callow reflections was that i determined to begin at once to improve my long dormant aerial gifts or rather i should say my repressed and snubbed and even dreaded specialty of rising from the ground although my frame was firmer and more weighty than it used to be and therefore less elastic and expansive than in boyhood there was room enough to hope that some of if not all these losses might be retrieved by care and skill by regimen strict diet and the increased power of the muscles and if these proved insufficient there could be no doubt of one thing a very little artificial aid would liberate me from the growing tyranny of gravitation with all this in my mind i went to bed and dreamed a dream which contrary to the usual laws of such visitants became of the very greatest service to me my conscience had reproached me while i said my prayers for a very unworthy and unjust reflection upon professor megalow as above set down from him i had received the very greatest kindness and to imagine that any party motives could have led him to dissuade me from invading the upper firmament was very mean and nasty of me as well as most absurd he was not at all a partisan or active politician but quietly held his opinions upon reasons which satisfied him and therefore cannot have been weak ones and my last thoughts or nearly so having been about him he appeared to me naturally in my sleep i dreamed that i stood between professor megalow and my old enemy professor brachipod in the schoolroom of the partheneion dr rumbelow also was in the distance with his college cap on and the biggest of all his canes under his arm the two learned professors were discussing my case with very great interest and some warmth he will never fly again said professor megalow he is too solid now and his bones are all set the very reason for his flying all the more quoth brachipod contradictory even in a dream he can not only mount but propel himself now see i manipulate him and off he goes ten times as high as he ever went before then he did something to me and up i went while he shouted that proves my theory can anything be finer chocolous mullicles and jargoon come and confess what a set of fools you are bravo tommy use your arms and legs with such powerful action did i do this while rushing up swift as a rocket that i knocked half the roof of the partheneion off yet stuck fast somehow and could scarcely breathe and no wonder for round my neck when i awoke was the linen sheet tight as a bowstring while my poor arms and legs instead of oaring ambient air were all twisted up in the counterpane and blanket like an apple pie bed combined with what we used to call cat's cradle but the worst of all was that i could not remember though i sat up in the bed and thought as soon as i was free what in the world it was that had been done to me by professor brachipod to send me up over people's heads at such a pace neither in the morning could i call to mind an atom of the thing that i wanted so much to recollect though i knew that it was something very simple and most easy and such as i could manage at almost any moment just the very thing in fact which alone was needed to restore my early powers and perhaps to place them in some measure under my own command after cudgelling my slow brain to no purpose i resolved to take the bull by the horns and do no less than go and see professor brachipod himself on the brink of an enterprise so perilous duty alike to my friends and self demanded all possible precaution the first thing i did was to tell uncle bill for i feared to let my mother know whither he should send for my remains if i did not come home by dinner time also i took a most trusty friend to walk up and down on the opposite side of the street and listen keenly for any squeal at all like vivisection also i had a great mind to buy an american revolver but felt ashamed of such a relapse into savagedom and was satisfied with a bit of english oak such as my quickness of turn might avail with against a robustness above my own so with grip at my heels i rang the bell the professor was at home and in answer to my card sent a nice young lady of brachipod race to say that he was just in the crisis of a very important experiment but would come to me in a few minutes if i could kindly wait so long i am afraid we must hardly let that fine dog in she said with a pleasant smile which made me feel ashamed i am very fond of them but dear papa is a little nervous now he has not been well lately i hope you will pardon me for bringing him i answered but he is very old and a walk is such a treat to him may i put him in some outhouse he is as quiet as a lamb oh thank you that will do beautifully i hope i am not interrupting the professor his time of course is so valuable presently he came down and i was thoroughly ashamed of my own alarm instead of the brachipod who used to jump and gesticulate and poke knuckles into me i beheld an infirm and disabled old man who was killing himself prematurely by wanting to know too much about it his face was melancholy and almost pitiful as if from perpetual disappointment his forehead was channeled with a chart of hopeless soundings and even the vivacity of his eyes was sad i am very glad to see you he said kindly and gazing with a little sigh at me i remember you well but how much you are grown i fear we used to frighten you in the days gone by we took the wrong course altogether if we had only been gentle and patient we might have done much with your singular case and learned things of very deep interest it was bad luck there were too many of us and the spirit of rivalry spoiled everything i should have kept you to myself as i had every right to do but poor jargoon and unhappy chocolous you have heard what a sad loss all science has sustained have you not they have both fallen victims to the spirit of research i ought not to grieve for them for there can be no nobler termination to a scientific life jargoon as you know had a doltish theory though i should not call it that when he cannot contradict me about the universal action on all organisms of what he called gaseous expansion he made a great discovery as he believed of a primary element 'proto hylic nephelin' intensely inflammable in combination he was trying its effects upon the human system by inhalation through a straw when unhappily mrs jargoon struck a match to seal an important letter in a moment the professor and his theories were abolished so exhaustively that they could hold the inquest upon nothing but the calcination of his left glass eye i never heard anything more shocking i exclaimed forgetting all the evil in the sadness of his end and admiring the courage of the great discoverer and poor professor chocolous was he abolished too not so entirely but perhaps more sadly you know that by his theory a perfectly absurd one all causation was referred to the agency of bacilli bacteria we used to call them but the other word is the more correct moreover he was indulging in a life long hope to establish in his own person the one thing which alone convinces the multitude ocular proof as the outsiders term it that the human race has lost its noblest and far more essential member than the head is in a word its tail by assuming an attitude never contemplated in the scientific stages of evolution a learned american has in my opinion cut the ground from under the feet of chocolous by showing that the caudal loss results from the abandonment of the quadrumanous life and that the only chance of recovery lies in the resignation not of chair but house and the reinstitution of arboreal habitude but to pretermit his theories which appear to me weak and outrageous his end before even the nucleolus of a tail was established is a most melancholy tale the very day after he had inoculated his dextral ulna with a new bacillus discovered in the windpipe of a duck he received as the rule is with learned germans and the exception with learned englishmen a most flattering invitation which is in fact a command to present himself in very high quarters you may suppose what a fuss he was in for few of those foreigners have much self respect to put himself into his very best clothes and to have all his theories ready in his hat i suppose that he would not be allowed to carry that but i have never had the opportunity of learning surely sir i said with all your fame and all the immense things that you have discovered no tommy no he replied with much meekness but my scientific status is none the worse for that however herr chocolous the distinguished german was happy to be thought worth looking at and he prepared himself well in every point but one he should have provided himself with cross trees or guttapercha buffers ever so small just to take his bearing 'what will you do if you have to sit down' i asked him with some prescience of the woe in store for him 'bosh' was his answer for he loved that word 'zey vill never ask a poor man like me to seet' 'well i dare say not' i replied having never found any occasion to understand such things and off he went standing up in a hansom and looking more like punch than a man of any science about a fortnight afterwards i was sent for not to court oh no no fear of that for an englishman but to the death bed of our poor chocolous for whom i had always entertained sincere affection and profound respect i found him as lively as ever and jumping to show me how his theories had been established there was no mrs chocolous as perhaps you know and nobody to care for him except the maid of all work but she was crying dreadfully and he was proving to her some new and unsustainable theory of bacilli 'i vill be dead' he cried 'zis time to morrow for vy for because my teory is ze true one both of zem both of zem proved in one second prachibot if you leeve tree tousand year never you vill have sush triomp' of course i could not contradict him then but as soon as i came to hear all about it the only thing proved was the soundness of my advice for it seems that as soon as he had been introduced and received most graciously another great german appeared of even superior eminence in another line and our poor friend chocolous was kindly asked to sit he pretended not to hear and made a very fine retreat with a deep bow and one heel going back behind the other but not even so could he back out very nicely but firmly was he told in total ignorance of all his magnificent theories to sit down which is not supposed to be the proper thing in such a presence the chairs were rather large and had a very slippery covering being at the same time hard and bright nothing could be worse for a man to sit upon who was cherishing hopes of inaugurating the recovery of our lost member what could he do he could neither sit down nor by any means refuse to do so the third course as a great master of shuffling puts it was to sit and yet not to sit and this the poor professor was obliged to do in a posture of cardinal adversity he brought his scapulae to bear against the back of the chair which was upright then he super posed but not imposed the sessile portion of his organisation supporting his weight by his right wrist entirely and maintaining non contact in the critical quarters with the unscientific institution this was most skilfully managed as only a man deeply grounded in organisation could have organised it and but for one little point all had been well this point was the simultaneity of the great bacillar experiment with the peril to caudal aspirations between two stools or rather i should say between the ulnar and the lumbar difficulty science lost one of her very brightest stars the ligatures skilfully placed to confine the experiment to a safe area gave way beneath the whole burden of a well fed frame the issue need not be described although most deeply interesting mortification ensued and our friend acknowledged to be foremost in a most important study left nothing but his papers which i am now preparing with the aid of mullicles for publication what a sad case i could not help exclaiming really it seems as if science destroyed all her great admirers as the female spider does in addition to all the poor flies of the public i do hope professor that you will take care of yourself there is no fear for me because all my theories are sound he replied with a sweet smile of certainty but i have great misgivings about mullicles histic fluxion as he calls it is his craze and he pushes his experiments beyond the bounds of prudence i am sure that it must be a great blow to you to have heard that of the four learned men who desired to promote your interests in early life two alone are left for the study of your case you are come to me i doubt not because you have discovered with the aid of professor megalow from whom i have heard of you more than once as a very promising acolyte that my theory about you was the true one i would only request you to be candid with me i was touched by his diffidence and gladly told him everything how the death of my dear father had entirely deprived me of all my early buoyancy through sudden exultation and how instead of that my only tendency to rise was apparently created now by wrath and sense of wrong but even this i told him was a rare case now especially as i had done my utmost to repress it then i added that i wished for reasons which i need not mention to recover my peculiar gift but keep it under my own control i can promise you all but that last he replied and that you can only secure by returning to your former system of artificial weights see how exactly everything has verified my diagnosis 'organic levigation' was the term i used as if by a happy insight and no better explanation can be rendered now my dear young friend you must place yourself entirely under my directions but unhappily i cannot undertake the matter gratis though my ardour for science would induce me so to do if my circumstances were as they ought to be you are well aware of the disgraceful fact that in england there is no state subvention for the highest of all purposes scientific research we spend all our substance and our brains without emolument or honour while those who make improvements in some trumpery handicraft or poison the public by pure quackery obtain position and title and large fortunes but not the fame i answered with my usual politeness and he smiled and his pale worn eyes glistened through his double glasses then i asked what his terms would be and found them so moderate that i doubled them as was only fair to his high repute but he made me pledge my honour to one thing that during his lifetime i would not divulge his method if it proved successful i am happy to say that he still is living and of very great renown and good position so that my promise remains still in force chapter xxxv national emergency everything seemed to go well with me now except for one sad visitation the loss of my dear uncle william he by his brave resignation and patience childlike simplicity and wonderful yarns as well as pipes and grog and quids whenever he could get them had endeared himself greatly in a few days not only to me but to all at the bower even grip went to see him and took such a fancy to him that he would sit with his chin in the wasted brown hand and look at him sorrowfully by the hour as if they were two poor old broken chaps together and the night uncle bill died grip never stopped howling and he went about the place and scarcely ate a bit of victuals until he had attended the funeral but uncle bill's death though very sad to us was painless and placid and happy to himself he had said that he should like to see the chaplain and accordingly mr cope came in we left them to themselves and there was not much said only they had a little prayer together and mr cope asked him if he had any doubts and he said none whatever in the morning he was passed beyond all doubts and i who sat up with him cannot say exactly the hour when his angel came for him he always felt faith in the lord all his life and though he may not have lived up to it surely his last end was better than that of a man who endeavours to outstrip the devil by growing a tail to frighten him one thing surprised me about uncle bill as soon as i had spirit to think of it and that was why had he never said a word about jumbilug's eyes to my mother or myself when he knew that his last time for business was come i had even gone so far as to ask him when dr flebotham pronounced his own task accomplished whether he would like me to bring them in and show them or whether there was anything he wished to say about them but he put his pipe stem to his lips for he was allowed to do anything now that would make his last hours tranquil and he tried to shake his head as if to say all that is settled and the only provision he made for death as regards this world and its dealings was to have his favourite pipe buried with him and a quarter of a pound of bird's eye and a box of the bottom of the atlantic matches which nothing can prevent from striking for he had been among savage tribes so much that all this became orthodox on his part whether he was lawyer enough to know for sailors do pick up queer things that he saved the family l by this behaviour or whether it was only that he would not now disturb himself and did not wish to be reminded of the only stars that living people care for or whether he would not confuse his last pipe at any rate in the most decisive manner he conveyed to me that he would have no more said about jumbilug's eyes which he would have condemned at any less momentous moment but all was to be as he had once for all directed this made me feel a certain sense of trusteeship as if i were placed in full charge of these stones and must most exactly do whatever he had ordered but when i was told for the first time of their value i found it very hard to trust my ears such a great injustice did it seem to me who have an ardent love of fairness that the cleverest man in the world might work for sixty years the entire parenthesis of anybody's meaning here without earning half of the value of one of the eyes of a barbarous idol for the great jewel merchant in hatton garden to whom sir roland took me could scarcely believe his own eyes at first the day being of london texture until he put on a strong jet of light reflected by white mirrors and took a double magnifier and went into the very bottom of both stones even then he was almost afraid of his own judgment and looked at us doubtfully and shook his head and even the hand that held such treasures if i did not know you to be sir roland twentifold and this young gentleman to be a friend of yours and therefore above all suspicion it would be my duty to call in the police and place these in their charge he said as the produce of some tremendous robbery i have been in the trade for more than forty years and crown jewels and those of the great r family have passed through my hands but until now never such a pair of blue diamonds as these are they must be well known they must have a great history i know all the leading gems of europe but these are entirely new to me is there any reason why i should not know the story none whatever i replied if you will receive it first in confidence and then if you think that my right to them is perfect i care not how the story spreads i told him all i knew while he listened with deep interest and so did sir roland who had not heard all till then i insisted especially upon uncle william's character and his great superiority to piracy or rapine and enforced the fact that he had not run away with that idol with any view to its value but simply as a deed of justice against a most horrible tribe of cannibals who had eaten as much as seventeen white men and had vowed the sole survivor as a sacrifice to the image with these resplendent eyes the jeweller's sympathies went warmly with me and with uncle bill in his operations but he could not help sighing and i asked him why because i never had such a chance myself he answered with a candid smile and to think of your luck in escaping all duty your uncle why let me see three per cent they could not have been valued for probate or administration at less than l and probably i should have had to appraise them since the disappearance of the french blue diamond there is nothing in that line to come near them each of them is worth at least two hope's that is if they cut as i am sure they will but is there not some ground to fear i asked that when all the facts become known our government might insist upon restoring them they seem to exist for the purpose of surrendering every british right whether public or private undoubtedly they do he answered sadly but your very clever uncle has provided against that you can make oath with clear conscience that you do not know the name of the place they came from and if they were there three hundred years how can they be traced from borneo no you need not have the smallest apprehension about that they belong to you as absolutely as the watch now in your pocket and i congratulate you warmly upon such a grand possession then i asked him with some diffidence what the fee for his opinion was but he said none only when you have them cut i should like it to be done through our house if you think fit we are proud to say now that such work can be done in london as well or even better than in amsterdam it is a new industry and deserves to be encouraged and to make a good job of such gems as those would give a fine impetus to the english art this i promised gladly and after some kind words of caution from him and of good advice from roly who never left anything unhandled we took a cab direct to placid bower feeling as important i do believe as any two young men in all london in the presence of sir roland who dined with us that day i handed to my mother that one of the two stones which the jeweller had pointed out as rather the more precious but she was so amazed when we had told her all the story that it was quite impossible to refrain from laughing you expect me to believe a single word of that she cried having scant faith in youthful verity no no master tommy i was born before you were and what would your dear father have said to hear such things your poor uncle william was a man of such a nature that if he had twelve pockets there were twenty four holes in them he would have told me of course not you if he had thought them worth speaking of he had daily opportunity of testing my discretion put them under your pillow tommy and don't let me hear any more of them and she marched away leaving her blue diamond contemptuously in the fingerglass take her at her word you millionaire of a tommy sir roland said to me when he had shut the door and at first i was so touchy that i felt inclined to do so but better sense prevailed and on the following day i left both the jewels at our banker's one in my mother's name and the other in my own locked up in a box with other valuables and this was a great weight off my mind and i said to myself as i came away my blue eye shall never see the light again unless it is to please a pair of lustrous brown ones a million times more beautiful than any jewel ever seen but alas i shall never have such luck as that before i had time to fetch many sighs about it or even to be certain that i need sigh at all for hope has a liking for my heart because she finds herself so well treated there behold there came to pass a thing that drove me to the very place whither i was longing for to go this very day sir roland cried as he jumped off his horse and left grip to mind him this very day mrs upmore if you please you must send your dear son down to larkmount on the hill the powers of evil are conspiring against him and nothing but his lovely face and hair and the way he lets the sunshine come under his heels will scatter the devices of the democrats now you hate all democracy you know you do as far as i understand the nature of it sir roland said my mother who was proud of accuracy i am not much for it as a question of degree they sweep away all degrees or try to do so and how can tommy ever be an ma then you are right too right i am sorry to say sir roland replied quite gravely for he always agreed most warmly with ladies and by so doing generally converted them better had he not attempt to be an ma with the present government in power he will be exposed to the most fearful risk if the measures now proposed are passed next year there are very solid grounds for believing that a bonfire will be made of ma's upon hampstead heath to celebrate the democratic triumph you saw the martyr's memorial at oxford when you went to see what tommy was up to once oh yes sir roland all cut into small ribs not as if they had caught fire at all but as clean as the three holy children but what i thought most of was the college halls and kitchens and the places with a sliding shutter where the butter is buttery and no best dorset not in vain is it that ladies have such powers of observation but how would you like to see all that swept away and instead of it board schools dissenting chapels co operative stores and social science institutes and unless you send tommy down with me to larkmount that is all we shall have to look forward to he alone can save the country from the vast deluge of anarchy now pouring in well i do feel it hard upon me dear mother answered to be losing him again almost before he has had time to get into gray mourning for his uncle but his dear father's foremost principle was and he was putting by money to support it that tommy should go into parliament and speak up courageously for the boiling interest it is useless to hope that jack windsor could do it even if there were no other children he can count sixpennyworth of halfpence but if you ask him why he stares at you but tommy is always as pat with an answer as a cheap jack or a prime minister and sometimes more than he should say to the mother that brought him up and fermented him and now it seems a providence sir roland to speak without offence to any one that he should be ma and mp without paying anything at all expensive and make the one defend the other against the people his dear father could never put up with though many times they promised him their custom and never gave it i'll answer for that sir roland replied most truly tommy you have heard what your kind mother says and i hope you will carry out her principles all of which are of the very highest order this settled everything and next day my dear mother packed me up without more than one tear on the top of my shirts about which she was most particular but she looked at me very hard when she had finished and said why mercy on me child what a fidget you have become about your clothes when you used to go to oxford the trouble always was to get you to look twice into your chest of drawers but now one would think that your own mother knew nothing about what is fit for you to wear there is something going on down there i do believe that you don't think fit to trust me with i have always understood that those voters of the public are very crafty people to have to deal with and they make you promise almost anything they like now don't you go and promise to marry any of their daughters without consulting me about it you are a great catch now and entitled to look high now bear my words in mind although i see that you don't mean to tell me anything you are just like your father when it comes to that for i felt that i had no right to tell her a word about laura twentifold until i knew more and it would have been more than i could bear to have the matter lightly spoken of and constantly referred to as a common love affair while to me it was so deep and sacred and i knew that she would hurry off at once to mrs windsor and perhaps mrs chumps to have a good talk over it which would have been to me a dreadful profanation so i made her mind comfortable and then departed chapter xxxvi vote for tommy it was indeed high time for me to be stirring if i meant to be returned for larkmount about which i cared supremely little except as a stepping stone towards my true love and ambition for although the influence of the towers should have been paramount in the borough as a matter of right and long usage the times were become so perverted that a brisk opposition was got up and some liberal orators had been brought down who had nothing whatever to do with the place and cared not a farthing for its interests my competitor was the owner of a paper mill out of which he had made a good lump of money and he announced his intention to spend it freely for the national good as he presumed to say as yet i had only paid a single visit to the enlightened electors and their wives whereas mr squelch had been working hard for months with his agents committees and organisation of every kind in full activity but sir roland was as confident as ever he could be and made light of the enemy's start in advance they don't understand human nature he said all their promises will have got stale and insipid and all their bolts of clap trap will have been shot in fact they will have bored the poor electors so that we shall be a welcome novelty we shall have all the ladies on our side of course and in these days of ballot that is everything an elector may promise as much as he pleases but he dare not tell a lie about his vote to his wife also concerning my infinitely higher and a thousandfold dearer ambition it was high time for me to be doing my best and i grew hot and cold when i thought of it hot when i heard from sir roland who took the pleasure of a cannibal in telling me while i could only reply oh yes to be sure very nice and such like inanities because of the compact between us how my lord this and sir somebody that had been staying at the towers and were most agreeable and had shot very fairly and had admired the neighbourhood discharging far too well i feared that duty towards their neighbour and had promised most readily to come again for the hunting and the woodcocks in november and cold i became quite as cold as a boy who wants to have his bed warmed and a treacle posset and his head wrapped up in a blanket whenever i fell back upon my own poor chances and knew that i must put them to the trial very soon this was quite certain to require all my skill as well as a great deal of good luck at the moment and one piece of fortune befriended me to wit that none of those owners of the earth were there at the time of my arrival two were to come in about ten days' time but i hoped to get on a good bit before that and talk of them as strangers by the time they came for ladies in the country who have not been spoiled in london like the faces they are accustomed to but in spite of all that my hopes were low not only because of my commercial birth and want of high style and of dashing disdain and a dozen other lofty attributes but also because of my natural deficiency in crass weight and stolid material somebody might say to the most perfect of all created beings somebody perhaps with a foot like a duck and a back like the bole of a churchyard yew well if i did have a husband at all i should like one to make a mark when the ground is wet i should like one who could come round a corner safely without looking for a church tower to see what way the wind is ah i see how he manages so well down here because you've got such a lot of weathercocks miss twentifold what would you say to yourself for slighting good solid englishmen if your bridegroom made it a honey moon indeed by soaring to the moon and leaving you to weigh the honey truly there are people who would say all that however far beyond their own business it might be but would they have the chance of saying it if so they would be welcome for the right word would be mine the word that was worth all the world and its works while i was entering into these thoughts on the road from the station to twentifold towers sir roland was preparing a little device in my opinion neither friendly nor brotherly nor even seemly having returned the day before he sent a groom with a dog cart to bring me and my luggage from the railway according to the train agreed upon and a pleasant drive it would have been except for the troubles invading my heart but just as we came to a little gate opening into the grounds about half a mile from the house the man said to me if you please sir would you mind taking the short cut here to the front i have got a little job to do at the blacksmith's and sir roland said i had better not keep you waiting i shall be home with your traps about a quarter of an hour after you i was rather glad to stretch my legs with a pleasant walk on such a lovely afternoon so i took my bit of oak with which i had gone to encounter professor brachipod and cheerfully entered on the footpath way but when i had walked about a hundred yards swinging my stick in defiance of dull care and indulging in a song which is a favourite of mine because i have steered so many crews to triumph with it the flag that braves a thousand years the battle and the breeze suddenly in a bosky dell i stood face to face with sir roland and his sister laura was amazed and so was i and sir roland maliciously kept his eyes intent upon his sister's face why tommy what a nightingale you are he said we took a little stroll for the chance of this meeting well done old fellow i am very glad to see you i forgot to tell you laura what a treat we might expect why you don't seem at all glad to see friend tommy mr upmore knows that i am always glad to see him the sweet voice which always made me tremble replied as she put her hand in mine and faced the sun with a lovelier blush than he can kindle in the west but i did not in the least expect to see him and in these lonely places one is taken by surprise i should think so indeed i exclaimed with a glance of great indignation at her brother who was smiling as calmly as if he had done nothing but sir roland thought doubtless that it was not worth while to speak of a visitor so insignificant i am sure it was not that she answered softly but he is now so full of politics that we must excuse him everything for an hour i have had to listen to nothing but a lecture upon the constitution oh i do think the trees are so much more glorious than the poor little men who cut them down this was uncommonly clever on her part for it set her brother off upon his favourite tirade which he never missed a chance of delivering and so we walked into the avenue pretending to listen with the deepest interest while i only knew that at my side was laura and she to make up for the slight put upon me gave many kind glances and one or two delicious smiles to morrow remember no waste of time to morrow her brother said firmly as soon as he had got to the bottom of the very deep vials of his wrath by which time we were at the door almost no spooning about trees or the beauties of nature or any other beauties but good solid work we shall breakfast early and have a long day at it i shall drive you to the true blue hotel myself and take with me a fellow who has a brother at the paper mills i have a grand trick against old squelch in the bottom of my turbid heart as some ancient writer calls it you seem to be getting very fond of tricks cried his sister as she ran away to dress for dinner perhaps some will be played upon you before long such was my state now of mind heart and soul as well as of body which had long been in training for a great constitutional effort that the paper mill man might have passed through his mill as waste paper the promises made him sir roland had eight or nine carriages sent from the towers of three generations including some now in use for cock lofts and we took all the children of larkmount in batches for a drive with their pinnies full of sugar plums there was nothing in the bribery acts as yet to make such a proceeding penal though now if a candidate takes a fly out of the eye of a child he is bound to ask firmly my dear is your father an elector oh then i must put that fly back into your eye or else my election will be null and void but the way these children enjoyed their drives in a carriage with two horses for none of them had less and a big coat of arms and a hand sticking up and the way they drummed their feet and holloaed vote for tommy down with squelch down with the paper man brown and old up with young tommy all curls and gold it was indeed a day to make one proud of the british constitution we'll do it again we'll do it three times if you are all good true blue children sir roland said to the biggest voiced ones when the horses had made a good day of it blue jackets for the boys and for the pretty girls blue bonnets or hats if they stand to their principles but no yellow mind you touch no dirty yellow yellow fever and jaundice for you if you do you shall all have the gee gees to go and vote for tommy vote for tommy all curls and gold we heard the clear voices from the hill in chorus for half a mile or more of our homeward road elated as i was by this triumph of pure principles and display of unselfish innocence all i kept asking myself was this will a body worth the constituency piled on the top of the constitution and the kingdom on the top of the continent ever be persuaded to 'vote for tommy' i must know my fate i can't go on like this to night i shall have to carry on again as if all i cared about was piano and back gammon and tobacco and billiards afterwards roly is full of resources but i seem somehow to have lost the very simplest move of tactics where are all my wits gone i am only fit to be in the government but if my wits stood me in no stead luck which is a very far higher power coming immediate from heaven she for beyond any doubt she is female like the angels down she came and stood at my right hand and ordered me to listen while she did my work for me roly lady twentifold said when i had sung my song about the flag which was now become a plague he has done a very hard day's work to day and he is not made of iron as you are to morrow he shall have a whole holiday with me and laura at crowton and sunny bay you have got business at ipswich i know and will not be back till dinner time but if tommy will not find it dull to come with us and the day is as fine as to day has been we will go and see sunny bay such a pretty place and look for shells and sharks' teeth and carnelians unless you would rather go practising tommy with the keeper before they come shooting again there are plenty of pheasants in some places still no he had better go with you sir roland answered for me as he loved to do the fates have been against tommy's shooting so far he has only been out with me twice at the rabbits back in the summer but i find thee apt and duller should'st thou be than the fat cigar tommy none shall teach thy young idea how to shoot but i go thou with the mother and play at periwinkles and sand hoppers and cowries an thou wilt chapter xxxvii sunny bay in all the wide world there are lovelier bays than any to be found upon our eastern coast but people whose happiness is only comparative may hie them away to superlative places of italy or of the cannibal islands but for me there is no place that need be more lovely than sunny bay when there is no sun upon it except what goes out from the shore into the sea a bay in the west takes an unfair advantage it looks at its best when the world is looking at it while nobody gets up to see the best time of an easterly bay or even if he does he has nobody to admire it with him and what use to admire a thing by oneself yet anything fit to be called a bay is so rare upon the weary stretch of coast that it must not be looked in the mouth too closely nor measured by the red tape of government survey if only it have a fairly carven curve and two definite points not too far apart a bay it is to be thankful for and one to be proud of and rejoice in if there are hills and trees around it sunny bay had all of these and as we drove down the crowton lane towards it i thought i had never seen anything so beautiful the sea being gentle and the sky clear and sweet lady twentifold was pleased with my delight for many of her visitors made very little of it it is the prettiest place upon the eastern coast at least in my humble opinion she said though i do not pretend to be much of a judge roly makes light of it after all his travels but to me the familiar places are the sweetest when we think of dear friends who have seen them with us i looked at her eyes still as beautiful as ever and full of the warm home love which gives soft beauty to the simplest things laura is like her i said to myself laura is like her what more can be wished except to share so sweet a heart but the first thing to do was to share the dinner or luncheon perhaps is the stricter word if strict words are needful in a matter where none was the carriage was sent away to the inn at crowton for no house here intruded upon the pleasant meeting of land and sea the rocks were just of the proper height for table chairs and footstools with bright green fringes here and there and mossy banks above the tide and a crystal rill for the weaker vessels and white sand for dainty feet to tap to me it appeared that all was perfect except my clumsy self with hands that trembled and a heart that beat too fast you are not well my dear lady twentifold exclaimed for she often addressed me kindly thus when strangers were not present chiefly perhaps from my fancied likeness to the dear child she had lost that canvassing has been too much for you you are not intended for public life i wish roly would not force you into it so now candidly which do you enjoy the most such a day as yesterday or a day like this with perfect truth i answered oh such a day as this a million times but i am as well as i can be and wonderfully happy i assure you may i come and look for shells with you to be sure you may but don't forget your promise to my loves of burrow ducks you had better begin before the tide comes up here are the flat trowel and the long flag basket mind the least touch brings them off if you take them by surprise but if you let them know that you want them they won't come without being knocked to pieces my little dears were taken from their nest near here and the scenery they prefer to everything is limpets now laura if you mean to try another sketch i think this corner of the rocks will be the best place for you according to the way the light falls now tommy will follow me i dare say as soon as he has done his duty to the little ducks this arrangement was not quite the one i should have made if the ordering had been left to me greatly as i admired and loved my dear lady i certainly should have sent her shell hunting while i stayed in the corner where the light fell so nicely to offer to the nascent work of art the only criticism that ever is judicious downright thick and thin admiration however not being the marshal of the forces i made off with tremendous zeal to get a stock of limpets but whether the tide was coming in too fast or whether it was going out at a pace to make one anxious about the welfare of the sea or whether the limpets took to jumping like sand hoppers carrying their rocks along with them or whether there was no strange phenomenon at all save the one that is strangest yet surest of all the result which i am not in a position to explain even if it concerned any salaried tide waiter was to fetch me very suddenly back to that corner with the loves of the burrow ducks left to woo the waves my own love was gazing and as i hoped dreaming about something that her pencil could not trace that little reed of so many whispers with the secret of midas inside it was lying on her block and the only line it made was its one true production its own shadow but who that ever moved it and made it far more eloquent than any poet's tongue could have granted to it the expression of the face now leaning over it what sympathy have rocks ever since they first began the chief object of their life has been to knock human beings generally on the shins and knees and to petrify them in a cave at every opportunity and to keep them from getting away from the sea when the poor pulse is being beaten out of them typical are they of all that is stubborn rugged and relentless and now one of them fetched me a knock on the knee while my presence of mind was with laura that sent me down into a gulley of sand with my limpet trowel running into me this was a pointed steel implement such as bricklayers use and my escape was narrow a heavy man must have had a very heavy wound and perhaps a fatal one for the handle of the trowel struck the ground before me while the steel was pointing at my breast but nature has allowed me some compensation for the short weight unfairly served out to me especially quickness of eye and of body in a word what there is of me is good stuff though not much to boast of as you will remind me oh what a fearful thing what a very dreadful thing darling tommy are you quite dead again you are always doing it for the good of others oh put your poor head up and let me look at you that is not at all the right thing i answered after a groan or two to ensure attention the proper thing is for me to look at you and that is how i got into all this trouble how good of you tommy how very good of you but do let me see where your dreadful wound is i won't be afraid of it i promise you i won't because you got it all for my sake you are always getting wounds for my sake of course i am and why as i put this question i continued to lie in the pit of my fall the position being very nice with laura added to it because i am all wounds and all dead for you now don't be so stupid she said with one arm going under my side in a spirit of inquiry and the other coming very softly round my neck to coax me to get up if i could only find the power you know that you never are stupid unless you are stunned or bewildered through your dreadful heroism oh do let me try to get this fearful thing from under you i won't cut my hands and if i do what can it matter very likely you are bleeding to death all this time why don't you let me see where your terrible wound is because i have only got a little scratch i answered and i feel so very comfortable as i am if you could put your face the very least bit nearer do you think you could lie quiet while i go and fetch my mother she has so much presence of mind and she is how far away i asked in an earnest whisper oh nearly a mile along the sands i am afraid then i'll get up at once if you will kindly try to help me only promise that you won't be frightened by a little scratch dear it is nothing but the very smallest trifle i assure you i know one thing that would make it well at once but there's no such luck for me as that both hands darling i may call you that now mayn't i just for the moment while you are so sad and helpless oh but it is a very serious wound let me tie it up for you it is bleeding quite fast i know what to do for you i'll put some laver to it the point of the steel had just gashed my chin a narrow shave for me as an inch or two lower would have sent it into my throat no doubt if you could hold the laver to it while i run and fetch dear mother not for the world i want you and you only i love your dear mother very warmly as you know but oh laura you can never know how i love you you are taking an unfair advantage of me now she whispered as she dropped her eyes but not her hands i always thought that you were so upright and manly so i am i answered with my usual candour but i don't care how i sneak or what i do if i can only get you to be fond of me what right have you to talk with your chin in that condition you will undo all the good my stupid hands can do you she raised her sweet eyes to reproach me as she spoke and behold they were full of large bright tears i only said darling darling darling each time if possible with greater fervour and she answered with a smile that is what i like to be chapter xxxviii prepare the government of england never guides us long without guiding itself into a fearful mess the tories and the radicals are much alike in this but they differ very widely in their way of getting out of it the former resign or appeal to the country which seldom responds to their chivalry the latter jumble up instead of joining issue and jump into jack of the lantern vagaries all over any bog where nobody can shoot them this was the policy in practice now our foreign relations being anything but friendly were to be allowed to please themselves at our expense while the gaze of the country should be turned inward and its hands employed in tearing their own vitality very grand measures were being prepared for a fine subversion of established things liberal statesmen being quite convinced by their own condition that the universe was wrong of all these projects the country heard with its usual self complacence growing more and more accustomed to be managed and driven by some half dozen busybodies according to the usage of democracies we must make a stand somewhere said sensible people but left somebody else to make it i draw the line at this or i draw the line at that declared the steadfast briton but if he drew it anywhere it was only in the clouds what could any single hand or even a hundred stout men with a hundred hands apiece avail when things were gone so far the only man who could extinguish the fire was the very man blowing his large bellows at it and in the headstrong weakness of his nature he had shouted for a gentleman smaller than himself but skilful in the manufacture of malignity so little desire had i to share in the rough affray impending and so keenly did i feel my own helplessness that nothing but sir roland's stern resolve could have held me to the pledge of public life all i cared for was to be allowed to take my laura who had promised to give herself to me and it recked me very little how the public might be governed if my home might boast so sweet a queen but although lady twentifold had given her consent and waived all obstacles of pride and birth in the warmth of her good will towards me she made it a condition that we must secure the concurrence of her son as the head of the family and master of the race of twentifold and he while as friendly to me as ever and faithful to his promise not to interfere sternly pronounced that he never would consent until i had rendered some good service to the country how am i to do it i inquired with sound reason your condition amounts to a total forbiddance i have no great abilities as you are well aware i shall never be an orator i cannot even put ten big words together without breaking down to move the public ear now the tongue must thunder forth a thousand thumping words for every hollow tooth of meaning and not only that but a fellow must be able to work his words so as to have two kinds of meaning one for the public and one for himself when he finds it important to deny them no roly i shall never be distinguished no honest man has any chance of that how high can you go now with a little indignation he asked instead of answering me i know that you are practising although you are so crafty that no one has a bit of chance of seeing you why should you be shy of a power so much rarer than the most entrancing eloquence prepare you can never prepare too much if i could only do what you can tommy i would have a dissolution in february and be the premier after a very little practice why don't you let me know how you get on because you don't deserve it i answered with some spirit and by this time he knew that i had some will of my own if you had said to me about my darling laura 'tommy you shall have her and i trust to your own good feeling not to leave a stone unturned for the discomfiture of the radicals' you might have had me for your dog to sit up or dance round the room or jump over your handkerchief at order that would have been the wiser course for you to take i spoke with some emotion and to my mind my words appeared altogether unanswerable but he looked at me steadily and his face expressed no sense of contrition neither did his answer i considered all that but i found it would be an entire mistake so to trust you not from any doubt of your honour my dear fellow or desire to oblige me after date but simply because all your power would be gone for a twelvemonth after you have married laura supposing that such a thing ever comes to pass there will be no possibility of stirring up any indignation in your system she is so confoundedly sweet tempered that you who have got too much of that already doubling your stock as married people do at first would regard the loss of india or even a french invasion with perfect equanimity if they let you alone with your laura and without indignation you have no wings now i have taken the trouble to ascertain that point and my settled conviction is that after you are married you will never fly again until you have a good fight with laura what a very low and coarse way you have of putting things i exclaimed with as our poets say a mixture of emotions rapture at the thought of ever having laura rage at the base idea of ever falling out with her and astonishment at sir roland's foresight and grasp of the matter in all its bearings why you look upon me entirely as a subject for experiments tommy he made answer with a smile so like my laura's whenever she wanted to be funny that his very worst sentiments might no more annoy me you are too fond of regarding things from a narrow point of view science possesses no interest for me i take facts as i find them i care not a stiver why you fly i find that you do so and that is enough science would wander about for years asking everything she met to explain the reason but sense is quite satisfied with the mere fact and proceeds at once to make it useful professor megalow who knows everything except the iniquities of the rads has told me repeatedly that there has not been for some centuries any englishman superior even in his finest moments to the power of gravitation except a certain thomas upmore now i care not two skips of a flea for the fact that there have been and perhaps still are some exceptions among american aboriginals to a law supposed to be universal the british public cannot see those fellows and probably has never heard of them but the british public can see tommy and though capable no longer of amazement after all it has been dragged through it is capable still of a mild surprise and of rubbing its eyes and of trying to think our duty it is to promote that effort a sore and a stiff one at first no doubt after five years of liberal surrender of that right one rare gift if properly used may restore the use of another thought in the national body is as rare as flight in the individual restore the defunct power my dear boy or at least restore the desire for it which alone must prove fatal to the radicals and then but not till then will i hail you as my brother in the flesh and in the spirit it sounds very well if i knew but how to do it i answered with some kindly marvelling at the importance attached to me you make it a sine qua non of brotherhood in the humble being before you 'ut patriae sit idoneus utilis agris' exactly you could not have put it better his country and the agricultural interest very nearly dead and with which dies england as her bitter enemies have long found out i have no fear of you when you once get in which this autumn session will enable you to do the writ will be issued next week the vacancy having been declared already squelch has not a chance and you shall take your seat formally so as to be ready for the great fight in the spring but chumps i asked when is bill coming down he will do you a great deal more good than i can you seem to take it easily about getting him in for silverside because there is no chance of any opposition flanker will not resign until february i have had a little talk with him and made that square the oddest part of all is that i had the hardest work to get out my own warming pan the others have behaved like gentlemen there will be six of us with the three who still remain all staunch fellows and not a fool among them unless it is your humble servant come and have a game of pyramids friend tommy very often when i thought about sir roland twentifold i could not help feeling surprised at his devotion to that dryest and dullest of all games at least in my opinion politics he was fond of field sports a bold rider a good shot a great lover of dogs and of outdoor life and a hater of town existence yet all these were only light pleasures to him while politics and the strife of parties seemed to be his passion handsome as he was and a fine young man with a rent roll even finer and therefore at a high demand in the london market he passed among all the fair snares uncaught with a pleasant smile justly distributed i ventured to ask lady twentifold once how she so free from prejudice and so full of good will to the world at large could have brought up her son with such set convictions and principles perfectly upright but sometimes almost too unbending she looked up with a kind but rather melancholy smile from the paper on which she was making a pencil sketch of a very grand oak tree still in its prime but as rugged as a ruin who brought up this tree she asked nature does everything now i replied it used to be the lord but it is nature now in a few years more it will be science when we tire of that it will be accident and after that something even nobler but the tree will be the tree she answered gently for her fear about me was that i might grow too scientific if led into arguments against it i prefer to say that the almighty made it so though few ladies now would agree with me my dear tommy i have no more to do with the bent of roly's mind than i have with the twists and turns of this tree he inherits it all from his grandfather upon i suppose what the learned people call the system of alternation my dear husband roland's father would never go near westminster although we had a house in london then to see our friends in the season he sat for twentibury in his own chair or in the saddle according to the season and everything went on as nicely as could be but his father had been of an uncomfortable nature desiring to make speeches and to meddle generally his grandfather having been a strong jacobite and the whole of it comes out again in my roly chapter xxxix for public and private benefit the alternate system as lady twentifold called it happily prevails in the national england as well as in the domestic when one batch of statesmen has done a world of harm and are getting skilful at it as in three years or four at the outside they are sure to learn to be a cry of turn them out begins first in the gallery then the people who pay more look up and soon become inclined to rap their sticks before long a general demand arises for the room rather than the company of the individuals on the platform if they are gentlemen they make their bow and retire heartily wishing bad luck to their successors but if they are something that rhymes with rads they pretend to hear nought till a stunning row arises and then they do this they call out policeman let in all the public who had got no tickets they won't have seen any part of our performance and therefore they can judge impartially this was the very thing going on just now the government had no leg left to stand on a very good reason for their not going out but sitting on the quarter which had been well kicked to keep britannia's in countenance they were doing what we little boys in maiden lane were clever at until the new system abstracted our material that is to say making go cartfuls of dust to blow through a pipe at the inquiring public seven measures of primary importance had been promised and hecatons of wise rogues had been sent round to inoculate the public with an itch for home dust as a pleasant little change from the national mud stains and a flourish of trumpets had filled the air of england with a krakatoa volume of that fine material which contains the germs of everything in the gracious speech from their own cracks in the throne ministers solemnly informed the country that internal repairs were its urgent need and the only way to make them was to pull it all in pieces and double all the stuff with the blessing of the lord the good old material had groaned at this but what is the use of groaning with the hatchet in the air the first need of all was to get rid of landowners land belongs to every one and therefore to no one why have men got feet except to plant them where they like nature has implanted in the human heart a profound desire for the ownership of land this proves that everybody must own land but how without kicking every other body out towards that the first step is to kick out present owners when the others get in they must be kicked out too there is no other way to have it cultivated properly but this will ensure a succession of crops a narrow minded man may fight hard to keep his foot upon what he has spent his hands and mind in earning but with a little patience that evil will die out nothing can be simpler than to provide that after a certain date no landowner shall be capable of prolonging his unjust tenure by the suppeditation of heirs to his estate no physical means will be taken to this end he will still remain in full enjoyment of every british right civil moral social and politico oeconomical but he must not have children or if he dares to do so the state will take them from him and enlist them in the army at the usual age of british soldiers sixteen or if they be girls they will have a free passage to the chiefs guaranteed to be ravaged by the boers the second great measure was the dust bin franchise or at sufficient distance from london to ensure intelligence that of the dust pan a sanitary not to say a necessary measure appealing to every heart and hearth the third whose preamble was eloquence itself to such an extent that it cannot be cited enabled the surrender without consideration of all strong places at present held by her majesty's forces upon foreign soil or soil which without such british occupation would be foreign to this realm also of all british ships of war whether built to pass over the waves or beneath them together with all fittings and implements of war in proportions to be defined by the schedules thereafter to the following powers that is to say france russia and the irish republic heretofore better known as the land league the fourth bill provided for the abolition of every municipal corporation or other corporate or incorporate body of burgesses or ancient freemen making claim to deal with their own affairs without licence from the home secretary or the local government board or the railway station that might be nearest unless such municipal body could show that they had not been constituted for more than ten years and consisted entirely of liberals short and sweet was the fifth bill of government it had no preamble but this whereas no englishman knows how to govern himself and then it enacted that no man should play cards chess back gammon quoits skittles billiards bagatelle or any other game of chance or skill except in the presence of a certified policeman at a distance of not less than half a mile from any licensed victualler with no more than two sterling pence at stake every such game to be discontinued immediately upon the home secretary's yawn which would be announced throughout all english counties by telephonic agency but in scotland and wales and wherever else the liberal cause was predominant all people might play whenever wherever and for whatsoever sum they pleased of the sixth bill the man of the greatest experience and insight to be found at any cubeage of mileage from london and all its stupidity could not make head or tail though he sat up until a policeman from the home department ordered him to bed the only theory at all to be entertained about it was that the gentleman entrusted with the draft had taken another to inspire him for his labours or else had imbibed too deeply perhaps the spirit of his subject it was all about ireland from which the great st patrick expelled all the devils on the herd of swine system except that they stopped at home as well as swam the channel for nothing can ever convey to the unmeasurable apogee of radical brains the wisdom of leaving unstirred camerina since that party by means of cold summers and hot ravings stuck their heels into the country's ribs they had never allowed it to chew anything but black wild oats of ireland perish india perish colonies perish england perish everything except savages who stab all kindness and their last panacea was this great measure to govern ireland according to irish ideas whereas no irishman obeys the laws and thereby incurs illegally irrationally and unjustly the stigma of lawlessness be it enacted that after the passing of this act there shall be no laws in ireland with the aid of hibernian members this bill was certain to pass and it could do no harm the seventh and last of the measures upon which the government staked its existence although they had fifty two more which they pledged themselves to carry if shoved on much was sensible and simple and consistent with all legislation in that province it merely prohibited the opening of flowers whether under glass or out of doors after six o'clock pm forasmuch as a scientific member had assured the licensed anti victualler that divers of them are guilty of intoxicating agency chapter xl fair counsel of all truths the surest is the truth well established by the behaviour of britons for many years now one man may steal a horse and canter away with every hat even the owner's tossed up in applause of the brilliant proceeding while the same man's first cousin who peeped through the hedge at the dew on grass or the daisies lies groaning in the stocks and perhaps touches his hat to the luck which rides over everything if any other man of any english era from heptarchy to hecatarchy that last child of hecate had stolen from his happy mead and lashed into foam and thrown upon his knees with his strong back broken that fine old nag the british constitution after the horse he would have had the cart which is not his own order of placing them and the cart would have been the one that drives to tyburn thus said sir roland but owning no land and no sentiments therewith transmitted and tripled at every other generation i scarcely knew who had been stealing the horse and only hoped that the nag would come home again for a horse is the most sacred of all property infinitely dearer than house wife or child according to the precedents of english law and very likely he deserves it but what did i care about horses or hedges or the clever man who made the horse jump the hedge ready saddled that he might steal him or even the state of the british constitution which passes through so many horse chanting hands my convictions were solid and their grounds of the same character all grouted in with concrete and pointed with best portland cement and not a bit of lime blow anywhere nor any sign of job work to be found in them yet i am not ashamed to say because i shall secure all honest sympathies that if my orders had been to make tea for the man who stole the horse and a bran mash and litter for the animal thus stolen and to whistle to both of them while they did their duties the teapot and the bucket and the other necessaries would not have been out of the reach of my arm but why as everybody has taken to ask now why do you do this and why don't you do that the last thing that any man should have to explain because it leads him into a tremendous lot of lies he has not the least idea why he did a single one of them but he can't say that and he sets to with after thoughts like a man who builds his house of the chimney pots in my case however there is no hard why to the youngest or even the oldest intelligence the flexibility of my principles though granitic as above needs no explanation when i set before them laura dear tommy don't be made a party man she said to me just before parliament met and while i was holding a skein of floss silk which is difficult stuff to manage that she might wind it for some lovely work you are the party that makes me one i answered with a sigh to earn some gratitude can anybody question the purity of my motives when he looks at you dear i don't want compliments instead of common sense tommy of politics i know next to nothing although i hear so much every day but all i hear is upon one side so much that i cannot help thinking what the other side may be and sometimes i should like you to try it darling have you any thought that has not its image and counterpart with me whatever passes through your most beautiful mind at the very same moment comes through mine only yours is so very superior no tommy no you must never say that because i shall fear that you are laughing at me now don't drop the silk no i don't look entrancing and there was nothing whatever in the situation to compel you to do it or me to allow it you keep on manufacturing excuses of that sort and a rising statesman should be above such conduct where was i you have quite deranged my thoughts oh about the present state of the nation to be sure roly is a great alarmist but i cannot see any harm at all going on and i do hate wars and faction fights why need you go up to take your seat at all my father was in parliament continually but he took care never to go near it neither would i if i could help it laura but the times are very different now i have not the least chance dear of ever attaining what i long for most in all the world except by going up and more than that doing something to satisfy your dear brother well promise me one thing make beautiful speeches as you ought to do after all your practice in saying fine things to me every day and so become a leader of great principles but try not to be harsh with any one it would spoil your nature which is so sweet and cheerful remember that the gentlemen you disagree with have a right to their own opinions and a claim to be treated as gentlemen instead of being abused oh in shocking language sometimes roland makes me stare he is very hot indeed i could not help admitting as i smiled at the horror on the sweet kind face but remember dearest that they give him reason for they care very little what they say themselves and much worse than that is what they do at least in his honest opinion he believes them to be ruining his country can a warm hearted young man be expected to sprinkle rose water on the destroyers of his country that is the opposite extreme she insisted with more common sense than could be gainsaid surely he might express what he feels in forcible language without imputing bad motives and all sorts of wickedness to people who may be doing harm but are not doing it on purpose at any rate tommy though he is past cure and soon puts me down if i dare to say a word i shall cease to believe that you care for me if i hear of your going on so well here was a cleft stick for me to be in if i should fail to prove myself a red hot tory sir roland would have none of me whereas if i won his good will in that way his sister would throw me over not that she put it so coarsely as that but when a girl says that she will not believe in a man's affection for her it generally means that her own for him will be in still greater danger my fortune is always to get into scrapes and my nature to get out of them when i returned to placid bower as the elected of larkmount on the hill for paper had not the least chance against soap i found my dear mother in a state of much excitement and ready to believe almost anything now why does excitement so multiply the powers of faith when it ought to do the opposite however so it does and the slaves of pure reason are as credulous as any in their ardour for it but my dear mother though the kindest hearted and most liberal minded of nearly all women always considered it an insult to have pure reason in any form applied to her and right she was when the premises were hers and she had bought out even the ground landlord tommy she said i am always most particular in my expressions about the government your father took some excellent government contracts through his heroism with the three inch hose otherwise how could we have bought this house it is useless for you to talk as if that government was not the same as this one that may be true but it proves nothing a government must be the government and the government it was that paid us so much money so that i will hear no complaints against them for this trifle or for that because of all things i have such a scorn for ingratitude we may not like everything they do about cards and policemen and railway stations and preventing my evening primroses because of the great abilities of lord beaconsfield but we must not be selfish my dear son nor expect to have everything to our liking in a penny evening paper which seems to be clever and writes about everything i have found out everything they mean to do and i quite agreed with him that stupid people may misunderstand it for instance i don't like giving up the fleet though no doubt it is a most expensive thing and your dear uncle william is now no more but the first and greatest of the acts they mean to do appears to me like a sign post with the finger of providence upon it not that i should ever feel the very least desire and nothing could come of it in my time of course but it would be so beautiful for you my dear it took me some time to discover what this meant and my mother was not very anxious to explain but at last i found out that the sign post pointed to my possession of the twentifold estates if sir roland were prohibited from having any heirs that one of the best and simplest of her sex should have strayed into the snare of covetousness set by all measures that dabble with property determined me at once to fight that measure to the utmost bill chumps was come back from his wedding tour having been called to the bar and the altar one day after each other but not as yet called into parliament by the voice of sir roland twentifold his father gave a dinner at the best end of the scrag because his own house was not large enough and no man who was there ever tastes a fine joint without saying ah but you should have had a cut from the baron and the saddle of old chumps that day i have often tasted fine meat but by george sir i never knew what velvet was till then there was not a foreign kickshaw handed round but any man who wanted unintelligible compounds might go and fill his spoon at the sideboard sir roland was there and made the speech of the evening a great deal better than bill's for bill got his at the back of his tongue beforehand and then forgot every word of it and his heart being meant to play second fiddle refused to come up and take first one but roly did really roll it out in a style which gave me great hopes that he might upset most of the seven bills of the enemy without calling upon my poor resources and we had a jolly evening i can assure you though there is no time to say any more about it now in return i invited with mother's good leave a snug little party of loyal enlightened and truly large hearted conservatives to dinner at our humble placid bower on the monday evening with the session beginning on the following day mr windsor was there and my old friend jack now growing very partial to belinda chumps as well as mr peelings the great potato dealer mr blewitt of the indigo factory and of course mr chumps and his son william and several other gentlemen one of whom was the owner of the pratt street express a sound and influential journal the object of the dinner was in the foremost place to dine and then to deliver for my comfort and direction the safest most practical and constitutional counsels ever yet vouchsafed to any youthful representative of all these gentlemen jack included there was not one but regarded me as sent into parliament for his own use and benefit as well as for a high example of wisdom after following his advice but the worst of it was that no two of them gave me the same advice beyond general precepts to look sharp to be cautious to keep my pluck up as soon as i wanted to thread my needle and make my coat with their furnishing behold it was not even yarn or i might say wool grown long enough for combing they had thought out none of the things they talked of and the round hand lessons in a copy book would serve me as good a turn as theirs however they all agreed in condemning all the seven great measures of the government although upon widely diverse grounds disagreeing very warmly as to what their badness was and this made me doubt when i came to dwell upon it whether after all they could be so very bad when a dog is tail piped sympathy arises in every bosom that has tails behind it as soon as he is pelted his merits grow on every one who cannot find a stone to throw at him but let him have sticks bottles tiles flints brickbats each expressive of a different stand point yet all promiscuously hurled at him and to every candid mind that cannot get the window open what is he before he turns the corner why a hero a martyr a saint of a dog chapter xli the right way to surrender it is not in my power to describe to you all the mixture or the magnitude of my feelings when i entered what our noble journalists who choose words like oysters by their fatness call the portals of st stephen it is superfluous to say that a policeman met me the differentia of that species being to jump up like the teeth of cadmus outside of all requirement and to vanish like berenice's hair inside it you can't come in here young man he made this remark looking over my head for his stature was six feet four and his mouth opened upwards as all good police mouths do in a tone which conveyed that it was unofficial and required some apology for excess of affability peeler yes he can though he have a right in there exclaimed a voice behind me he don't look very nobby p'raps with all that hair but he have the same right as i have master bobby in marches tommy upmore mp tommy now won't you shake hands with me one old friend is worth a score of new ones without me so help me sammy never would you be here my boy but i bears no malice if your mind is the same shake hands tommy there's worse gen'lemen to be found than joseph cowle esquire mp perhaps i have never received or inflicted a stronger sensation of surprise this may have been to find my own importance which must have been growing too rankly assaulted by a policeman and asserted by a chimney sweep mr cowl i asked while giving him my hand though his own would not have been the worse for a repetatur haustus of the little boiler engine have you quite recovered from your dreadful cold all liberals suffers from throatiness he replied same as tories does from cheekiness mp for chimneystacks now i am tommy with an e to the tail of my name as well the missus would have it with her education though beyond me to pronounce it without 'cowly' how you are going up the tree hot cockles and you up the chimney i replied with a glance at his dress which was worthy of the first of may i never could have guessed who you were and how could you recognise me mr cowly come now come now he spoke as a groom to a horse cutting too many capers after the print of you on the title page of all the leading magazines 'head of hair unparalleled outside the polar regions s d per bottle and then throw away your combs' ah tommy dust comes perfessional to me we know what sends you into this here crib five hundred a week and a royalty on sales pays better than ledgery slating i had heard of these absurd reports ere now and i never hope to hear the last of them is there any credulity among barbarians a hundredth part as wild as that of the british public in such matters people of fair common sense and with some experience of the world believed that i was making an enormous income by lending my name and my countenance full front profile and three quarters to fellows who advertised hair oil balsams electric and fifty other sorts of comb and even my own father's speciality soap such as cured all the convicts not one of whom i deeply regret to assure you upon my honour as the member for larkmount ever paid me a shilling or even asked me to dinner but one is apt to dwell too much upon such trifles if i have put a penny one per cent honest into any enterprising tradesman's pocket i make him a present of the honest portion which would not be worth legal expenses questions of a thousandfold more importance thronged upon me now as i entered the house under convoy of the member for chimneystacks who whispered to me that the dust pan bill was mainly of his own suggestion having been introduced already at the end of the autumnal sitting i did not require his services in that way but found a quiet corner for my hat and thought of the time when i put down my trencher some five years ago in the chapel of corpus then we rushed to hear the royal speech rather like a mob of workmen when the bell rings and sir roland whose strength lay in hurrying others more than himself appeared quite at his leisure and laughed as he shook my hand to find it trembling you'll soon get over that he said as if he had been some fifty years in parliament but who is your friend with the dark complexion i told him the story but he did not laugh at all heartily as i had expected an exceedingly dangerous fellow he exclaimed to be sure i know all about him now one of the cleverest of all the clasts with the true pass word for the cabinet an anarchist a socialist a communist and everything else that rhymes with fist which is the only tool to meet them with chumps is the man for such fellows but we shall not have him here for a fortnight there now faithful commons go home but they will have no homes to go to except a common if all this comes to pass and yet how well it has been made to sound for people who do not care for sense i was not of his opinion upon that point to my simple mind plain english words mainly of english birth and showing one after other what they mean without any tangles or knots in them are the right words to move the english heart whoever speaks thus wins all my ears and goes a long way towards winning my heart because he is my brother englishman and even for sound what power is there whatever the scowl of the cloud may be in long foreign thunder below the horizon and perhaps meaning something in italy or greece but the royal speech as usual meant nothing anywhere any more than the poor man who foretells the weather a greenhorn like you tommy said sir roland as if he had served at least through the long parliament would expect a great fight and a smash up at once to follow up that palaver but thong who knows everything tells me that nothing except little irish rows will be on for a fortnight and we can do a heap more good he says by going down to silverside and making chumps safe than by hanging about for any trumpery divisions it is jolly to see a fellow in his troubles suppose we start to morrow with all my heart i answered and in saying this i had used the right words at the right moment not that i cared to see bill in the straw so much although it is a pleasant spectacle but that i did long with all my heart to hear laura's opinion on politics with the whole of her majesty's speech cut out and pasted up as i had told her to do it in the corner of my little room where i meditated and had left a woolly outline of my head against the wall our work was to be at silverside where bill and his father already were in residence having taken the front that looked over the porch on the high street side of the bull and mouth hotel william chumps esquire had brought down his lady a lovely bride of some nineteen summers as the silverside constitutional described her though i could depose that she was four and twenty being eleven months older than myself and no bride of any summer at all but married to bill for three months of the winter there was no taint of envy in my feelings she certainly looked very handsome and had spent a good lump of her l in apparel and bill of course was mightily proud of her but to dream for a moment that i was pining as her melancholy manner towards me conveyed i longed very often to bring my laura but a scene of that kind was not fitted for her patriotic sentiments repressed my private anger and i worked very hard for bill and wrote him some good posters now i am off for the towers i said to sir roland only two days before the one fixed for the poll i can't stand any more of this and bill cannot want me any longer i have had the very kindest letters from your mother and if you prefer racket to home life i don't i will meet you in london any day you may appoint but i must have a little quiet first 'tis as bad as a boat race every day and at henley once i lost my nerve from too much of it and we got whacked i see he replied as he was fond of doing another man's laurels wreathed with orange blossom are hard to behold philosophically go tommy go and recruit your roses but remember our compact you have won nothing yet he might say what he pleased when he smiled like laura though his smile was strength and hers was sweetness that evening i arrived where i was welcome and the lovely blush and soft whisper of a kiss were worth a world of politics and parliament the privilege of changing their minds has always been handsomely yielded to fair ladies so long as they do not change there with their precious hearts and pure affections i found my laura in a vastly different political vein from her previous one she had taken some peeps into the newspapers not at all for the sake of the public but for mine and all the deep warmth of her nature was stirred by the radical outrage to her country and her home about the suffrage and the constitution and the abstinence cause i know nothing or less than nothing as gentlemen express it though i don't see how there can be less than nothing she said to me the very day after my arrival but about right and wrong everybody has a right to some opinion for poor landowners what is it but robbery downright robbery to take away their land and compel them to start afresh to earn more but oh tommy tommy it takes all my breath away to think of surrendering the english fleet to the bitterest enemies of england oh come in here that i may show you something it will strengthen all your principles to see there are few things more impressive to the model british mind of which mine is i am proud to say a very tidy specimen than a genuine series of ancestors in oil proved by internal and external evidence extraneous to wardour street monuments perhaps have a still grander savour especially recumbent figures of the knight and his lady on a slab together with the little ones that failed to come to harm sculpturally coming up like frogs for the blessing but these are very rarely to be found in any chancel or chapel by the dozen while the pictures have an old family habit of keeping together and to me it appeared that the twentifold race were what our dear cousins who supply our slang after stealing our standards call real grit for never having driven me or anybody else into this caravan of dead twentifolds for my gallery of ancestors was restricted to a photograph of my dear father and an ancient daguerreotype of uncle bill oh laura i cried when i saw them stretching like the windows of a stop at all stations train for a furlong without any corner how can you look at all these great people and come down from them to a nobody like me hush she said how dare you talk like that i didn't bring you here to be impudent tommy but i am astonished i replied astonished that with all these looking at you you can look at me what is there astonishing in it she asked coming up and putting both hands on my shoulders it is because i love you dear at any other time i must have kissed her for those simple and noble words it was no thought of all those ancestors that robbed me of that pleasure but i could not bear that she should look into my eyes and see how full they were of tears then i ventured to put my arm round her waist and she gave me her left hand to comfort me here's the fine old gentleman i brought you in to look at her voice was quite gay again to pass the fuss over does he look as if he would surrender our fleet to the enemies of england he looks fitter to make all her enemies surrender what a resolute face and how his foot is planted ah if we had any man to plant his foot and shut his mouth in that style now all open mouth now as roly says open mouth tongue instead of chin and instead of strong fist chattering fingers a man of that stamp can never have belonged to any time later than nelson's no government would employ him now in any of our trumpery 'demonstrations' let me look at him it does me good the picture being by no well known artist would doubtless be called a daub by all art critics rightly flourishing but to me it seemed full of life and spirit not always to be found in mighty masters an admiral of the ancient days and himself growing ancient stood at a gangway before his men to repel assault of boarders in his right hand was a big sword flashing almost as brightly as his eyes while his left hand pointed to the union jack waving through a cloud of smoke above who was he i asked he means to do it i should have been sorry to board that ship she drew from behind the frame a plate of gilt metal engraved in red admiral sir rupert towers twentifold ad yes he did it she answered with her eyes almost as bright as his he cut three men down with his own hand and then leaped on board the spanish ship drove the crew below and captured it he was the sixth back in straight line from roly and roly sometimes looks exactly like him that makes it my favourite picture of them all though i like roly better when he looks quiet it won't do to look quiet always i replied with the spirit of the conflict caught except for such sweet souls as you darling you make lovely patchwork will you do a little job for me without a word to any one chapter xlii spars the government had intended wisely to deal the first of their seven great blows at the weal of their hostile country with the bill which they were sure to pass for swamping the votes of the enemy with this once done to suit their book any dissolution of parliament must redound to their sole benefit but this pretty plot was not played out according to arrangement for the irish members stopped it these although they had their own bear garden now in college green found treason there too orthodox to afford any pure enjoyment and made a point of coming over to keep their pepper boxes hot which according to the kill england compact were to be at their service for ever and still sticking together like bots in a horse though without any humour apparent they made everything go or not go according to their own appetite their appetite now was all wide mouth for the third part of our fleet protocolled to them and with national ardour and stupidity they roared for the passing of that bill at once and the government of course gave way to them stupidity i say because if they had waited for the dust pan bill they would have had our fleet entire gentlemen i begin to have some little hope now sir roland said to us as soon as we had finished an excellent dinner as his guests at the cockles club for so everybody calls the horatius cocles at westminster bridge there were twenty of us there all mp's and not one would have feared to take a header off the bridge having mr panclast under his arm to morrow the fight begins and the enemy through his own currish nature affords us one more chance if he had taken up the dust pan first with the regiment behind him that sucks his buttons he must have swept everything before him but in dread of o'woundy and digger he takes up the craze every briton cries shame at before he has thoroughly gagged them i need not remind you that public opinion as it used to be called is against this bill more than all the others put together but public opinion is a dead letter now since the press tried to pass their own for it and even if it had the press to back it the hecatons would light their pipes with it to me it appears that our last chance lies in the ghost long expatriated of patriotism if only it might for one half hour revisit the glimpses of this english moon but what says our excellent and powerful ally the newly elected of silverside bill though he had only got his seat three days had already made two speeches and being always full of argument he was glad to make another but as he made another containing the very same observations in the house next day i need not report what he said just now not that i would blame any man for saying the same things twice or twenty times no man can put a new head to his hammer every time he thumps a block of coal and we britons used to be a fine block of wallsend hard to splinter and impossible to crack without fifty good thumps in the hole of each other the government knew this and made their fire of the rubble our case though the best that could possibly be found seemed likely to be a bad one mr thong who knew exactly how every vote would go reported that the best we could hope for was a minority of fifty every irishman of course would vote for the glory of ireland and the disgrace of great britain except some half dozen who had been in our army or navy and still had some regard for the old flag so that our hearts were very gloomy when the great debate began the government introduced their bill with the old clap traps about universal peace goodwill everywhere fraternity of nations symmetry harmony beneficence of commerce expansion of the intellect and so on to all these noble things now there remained one wretched little obstacle which it was our duty and our privilege to remove at once the leprous stain of blood guiltiness and greed in the mill of their eloquence they ground up metaphors and that obstacle was the ambition of england if once we proffered to the world at large this magnificent pledge of our candour confidence and chivalrous resolve not to raise our hands against those who might indeed appear desirous to trample on our bodies but would abstain when they found them so defenceless then and not till then should we be able to claim the proud title of promoters of the glorious cause of humanity there was a great deal more even finer than this but is it not written in the chronicles of hansard the liberal benches were rent with explosions of applause like an ancient fig tree while on our side presently an honourable member gained earnest attention by imitating to a nicety the clucking of a hen that calls her chicks together being new to the manners of the house and zealous upon all points of order up i jumped and began to run about trying to catch with my hat the dame partlet so intrusive in high places roars of laughter were my reward the greatest of great guns joining in and even the omnipotent premier gave me a smile of extraordinary sweetness i had earned the good will of the house for ever and until i am grey i shall be called green tommy now this may seem a very small and childish affair at a time most truly momentous and some will accuse me of my accustomed triviality in recounting it but without fear of contradiction from any then present and able to form opinion whether liberal or conservative i say that the cluck of an imaginary hen changed the fortunes of great britain for at least ten years though her foes will prevail in the end no doubt that is to say unless there is from time to time as there ought to be according to analogy an outbreak of savage fury havoc mad bestiality and wallowing murder in that centre heart soul brain queen star crown sun and deity of the universe which mr windsor calls parree insanity there makes london sane as a man i know well who cut down his best friend too late alas for any but the coroner has been afraid ever since to go near a belfry but the turn by which that cluck saved our capitol had nothing to do with either vigilance or terror but simply led up to a condition of good humour good humour which is sure to come after a laugh and a boyish laugh especially brings back to the mind of a man for a moment that he is not the only man in the world he may not be able to believe it very long and is quite certain not to remember it still even to fancy that there are some others improves his behaviour a good bit the government saw that the vein of the moment was not at all in their favour and two of the cabinet went to crave leave of the irish members to put off the division sir roland told me that he hoped they would get it while i knowing nothing of tactics hoped that the matter might be settled out of hand while the members appeared so light hearted for surely no briton unless in the blues which all rads from disease of the conscience suffer would vote for abandoning every stick and stone that our fathers gave their poor brave lives for but roly was right and i was wrong as appeared most plainly afterwards the irish captain desiring for a reason of his own to oblige the prime minister gave orders that the debate might be adjourned if the government particularly wished it this as you will see proved a good chance for us but to take things in their proper order refreshing my memory by the notes of the member for silverside who had learned shorthand i find pretty nearly as follows when the bill was entirely before the house in all its perfect symmetry according to their language in all its naked enormity according to ours the leader of the opposition rose and in the most courteous and placid manner which alone might have proved by its difference from theirs on which side sense and justice lay moved not the entire rejection of the bill for that appeared too hopeless in the teeth of their vast majority but a moderate amendment which had been considered as half a loaf is better than no bread to be the utmost an englishman could hope for inasmuch as our foreign possessions and our fleet were declared by the voice of the universe to be a standing menace to civilization and an outrage to all foreign sentiment he proposed that the fortresses should be dismantled and the fleet blown up instead of being handed over intact for the use of our enemies this enraged the government almost more than the direct negation would have done the usual outcry against half measures arose and to support it arose mr i beright this was a very great orator one of the greatest of all recent times because he possessed what our ancestors had but we for the most part have lost the power of putting plain meaning into plain words a very great man as well from the clearness and solid consistence of his mind and even yet greater he might have been if nature had endowed him with the power also of saying i be wrong sometimes however it was a real treat to hear him whatever one's opinion of his might be because there was no need to fish for his meaning and be vexed with oneself for not catching it indeed so immense was the force of his words and his aspect so large and commanding that it took me a long time to set up again my own weak convictions against his strong ones luckily however some little fellows followed who doing their utmost to deepen his track succeeded very nicely in obliterating it like a lot of children following a giant in the snow several members also of the opposition spoke appealing to the buried bones of patriotic principle and reading long extracts from obsolete speeches and solemn declarations of the present premier all of which were capable of being explained away whenever there was no denying them and at half past two the debate was adjourned on the motion of lord grando crushbill chapter xliii the battle and the breeze all europe had concluded long ago that the government of england had left itself no other blunder to commit and no further disgrace to fall into but all europe was wrong in this conclusion for before our debate came on again tidings of a new disaster and one more foul scorn to british blood and heart rang through the streets of london those streets were by this time so well used to the sound of surrenders and massacres seizures by russia of this and of that and french bombardment of britons that they took it as calmly as the passing of the plague cart in september men full of business shook their heads at the newsboys who spoil their own traffic with chalk as england has done with her flourish of free trade and the extra editions of the evening papers went back to their offices except a few copies sold to visitors wise enough to live far north in short the public knew it all without paying and kept all their halfpence to pay for the result we who were punctual heard it all after prayers announced in a telegraphic voice as a thing which should go in at one ear and out at the other in every head giving up its brains as every head that has got any does to the only one worth counting the liberal members seemed thankful for the news because we could scarcely have rescued the hero and redeemed our faith for twelve hundred pounds and because it set us free to look after some other who would truckle more kindly and pay his own way but we thought it very bad very bad indeed though of course it was treason to say so and none of us saw any light in it which shows that our eyes were not open this piece of a piece with the rest of foreign news happened to arrive on a saturday and we for the sake of the fifty two reforms had a saturday sitting already which lasted in fact until church time on sunday and must have despatched any other prime minister to a place where even he would scarcely hold all preferment however his influence adjourned the fourth commandment as it used to treat the third even in the souls of scotchmen for the few who like to see one of our disasters discussed upon its merits the best chance is when the news arrives near about noon of saturday it is too late then for the evening papers to shed their mild light upon it even if they all employed the gentleman who settles at a glance and a stroke all the monthly labour of the magazines and as for the sunday papers any that were not out on friday night reversing the premier's chronology have shut their frames now and are working off this is as it should be enabling a sound briton to go to church without praying for the commination service then upon monday morning like a string of horses who have observed the sabbath with a loud neigh and caper rush forth the morning papers they swallow up the earth like the horse of job trample under foot a few writers of fiction as though they had none on their own backs scatter the thunder of their neck or cheek upon every man they have no fear of and with one or two quiet exceptions go down upon their knees for the jockey of the period to mount them if he deigns but on this monday morning they came out mildly the most rampant nag knows where his oats are kept sniffing the air for the direction of the breeze and going gingerly as if some english flint remained and they found very speedily and so did we that the great steam roller had not crushed out every power of spark from our ancient metal the tone of the press is changed at last sir roland twentifold said to me when the house was meeting for the final issue too late to help their country much but in time to give waverers some excuse for wavering there will be as full a house as ever was known but our seats are safe come and let me introduce you to lord grando this was the nobleman who had lately come to the forefront of honour and of justice in right of plain language clear mind and fine pluck whether he were a fine christian or not is more than i can pretend to say but he observed one leading precept infinitely better than his great opponent when men reviled him and persecuted him and said all manner of evil against him he rejoiced and was exceeding glad and of this joy he had ample store to last for many generations horrida grando was his name with the rads and he always came down upon them like a pelt of hail yet he carried no frost in his tail for his manner was vigorous warm and stimulating i am to begin as you know he said with a gay smile to sir roland in whom he had found a fearless spirit equal even to his own i have great hopes what say you he has the true old english spirit he never knows when he is beaten roly said to me as we went to our seats for a crush of members came pouring in and i will tell you another thing tommy he will not be beaten always if we can only dish that dust pan bill or even if we have it i will back him for first lord of the treasury all he wants is mellowing and time will bring it before the resumption of the great debate a few little questions were asked concerning the very sad news of saturday the leader of the government replied that there had scarcely been time as yet to verify the last official despatches however there appeared to be some grounds to apprehend that another unforeseen and inevitable disaster in some measure had befallen the british arms a limited number of british officers appeared to some extent to have lost their lives in the execution of their duty this however was beyond prevision they might have incurred some risk and indeed the result appeared to confirm that view but her majesty's government had incurred no responsibility whatever having simply accepted parenthetical functions under certainly not the man in the moon as an honourable member suggested with a levity incomprehensible and most reprehensible but under the legitimate and legitimately constituted authorities of well of the locality being asked if the dead men were our flesh and blood he replied that to such an interrogation highly impolitic in the present condition of difficult and delicate negotiations seven different forms of reply very naturally and conclusively presented themselves but without further advices and instructions and the necessary period for their consideration it became his duty to deprecate further expenditure of public time being asked whether these men had not been sent with the strongest pledges any words could give to back them up with a british force and under most solemn assurance that every act of theirs would be the direct act of the government of england he replied that no less than fourteen entirely distinct and apparently materially repugnant yet easily reconcilable constructions might be placed upon their sealed instructions each of these interpretations had its own undeniable merits and claim to unbiassed and leisurely discussion and for that purpose each of them as simply as possible and yet essentially presented itself with a convenient quadrifurcation as soon as negotiations were concluded by which he did not mean 'as soon as all our men were killed' though the honourable member was welcome to his croak he would gladly undertake to appoint a day for the discussion of those fifty six issues meanwhile he refused to be badgered wherewith down he sat as no other man can his candour good temper and unusual lucidity were rewarded with an outburst of natural applause while the member for whose brother had been killed arose as if to speak but could not do it but not quite so easily did the great man get off without condescending to consult mephitic oracles lord grando crushbill arose and spoke well upon the main question before us he met the vile bill with no weak amendment no confession and avoidance but the downright damn which every foreigner knows well to be the word whereby we live no precedent could be discovered for this brief form of suggesting rejection and the speaker pronounced that it was not in accordance with strict parliamentary usage for the noble member to move damn the bill or at least for the motion to be entered that speech of lord grando a genuine philippic is well known to every true briton and as no other man will ever read this book unless it be a stout american it is needless for me to cite it here but while he went on there was gnashing of teeth and signs of pale liver disease among the folk who have learned from egypt nothing but egyptian courage and from africa in general the ostrich trick after that it sounded very mild to move that the bill be read this day six months to second this motion chumps arose as had been arranged beforehand and bill spoke uncommonly well so far as i am a judge of such matters he went at it as if he was splitting down a sheep for a good customer come for kidneys his father was the first man in london i believe who put kidneys up to twopence halfpenny and fourpence is the price in that same shop now and my mother stopped her ears when they asked her such a figure and did the same thing when she told me of it however there was no mistake about bill's meaning he had not left oxford long enough as yet to forget all the very plain directions of aristotle cicero and horace and whatever was in him he showed us very honestly with meat saw and chopper and no hems of flank tucked under if any objection could be made it was this that he followed his father in the way of good weight perhaps a little more substance than we wanted for our money as a marrow bone swindles us by being solid things happen oddly in this odd world and a few years ago could anybody have imagined that the brush of joe cowl the chimney sweep would ever come out at the top of the pot of the english constitution and not only so but that you would find it there brandished against and quite covering with smuts the new bright steel cleaver from the shop of mr chumps time works wonders and perhaps you will exclaim that the greatest wonder of all was the fact that the son of bubbly upmore the boiler however let that stop till we come to it joe had a very large command of words irregular perhaps and undisciplined and more than once we had to call out order at first from professional habit he stopped and pulled out his book as if to enter kitchen chimney at five o'clock which made bill and me who understood this motion look at one another and laugh heartily moreover he had a large command of voice as behoved a man who had beaten all the rest on his walk with the shrill cry of se veep i whispered to the honourable member on our side who had done the hen so beautifully and he being gifted with ventriloquism in the middle of one of joe's grandest passages upset the whole effect by producing the loud call of the trade in its longest melancholy se veep so that joe jumped round and stared as if a rival bag and brush were after him this was not fair play perhaps but cowle deserved it for the whole of his eloquence was nothing but abuse he blackened all the people on whose shillings he had lived and besmutted everybody with a slate above his head in short there was no man or woman in existence with any right to be so except joseph cowle we wanted sir roland to deliver his speech next but he said perhaps too loudly i never follow sweeps and presently the house was listening to a gentleman who is always heard with pleasure for his brave manly sentiments impartiality and scorn of all pretences he demolished the bill in most admirable style putting all the arguments against it better than our side had put them and then to my surprise declared that in spite of all that he had made up his mind to vote for it this brought up sir roland and his speech was very fine strong indignation made strong words as the wrath of the billow creates its roar for finicking argument what care i can a man split straws with a dagger at his throat eternal shame falls upon our land that any man in it should have dreamed of such an act the man who proposed such an outrage must have done it as a lesson towards the stabbing of his own mother for this he was loudly called to order but disdained the call and went on reckless where can i find words strong enough the difficulty is not to fashion but to find them language has never been made for such cases for what tongue could have told that such a case would ever be yet perhaps it was as well that there should be this defect for what language could move lunatics here there was a great row but sir roland's voice was strong the word i have used may not be of high courtesy but it is of deepest charity i can look across this house with my hands hanging down solely upon that supposition her majesty's ministers love to leave us in the dark they keep us so still whether common sense demands their consignment to strait waistcoat or to the gallows seldom perhaps has any limited number of human beings made a greater row except in some liberal massacre than was now to be had in all sizes and samples among men whose names are watchwords i saw though he tried to do it quite behind his hat a right honourable member whose name is fame make a trumpet of his hand and blow out the most hideous screech that ever quelled a railway hooter and i could not have believed my eyes unless my ears had been at the back of them in a word there was no word neither any sense among us head being gone universally and body left working about like a worm cut in two in the thick of this turmoil lord grando came up and shook hands with roly who was now as quiet as the stump of the match that has blown up the castle something like a maiden speech that was he said but the guillotine maiden i'm afraid my dear fellow and we shall operate first upon our own heads however better that than slow poisoning at first i did not understand what he meant but seeing that roly did i asked him to explain he seemed to find me wonderfully stupid as i am especially when at all excited and by this time i was all excitement but he managed to explain that he had done more harm than good by his strong short eloquence he had moved many hearts which had been covered up for reasons of inland revenue like a vehicle unused but he had not done it in the way to bring them out comfortably and with himself inside them to do that properly there must be no appearance of call or demand or anything at all unpleasant such as rebukes of conscience are but a gentle opening of a quiet door at first as if one came by accident to find something that belonged to one but who can blame roly for not understanding that he had stirred up right feeling all the wrong way of the grain and it was not at all thankful for being stirred up after many more speeches some right and some wrong and which seemed to be first thought of some good and some bad the prime minister rose to wind up the debate at about ten minutes past midnight the house was as silent as a hive of smoked bees with just one fellow here and there not quite dead i prepared myself for the finest treat of ears and mind and perhaps of heart also though he seldom troubles that and i said to myself no prejudice if you please however it was useless to say that when a man coming out of his front door sees another man hacking down his pet tree is the sense of high art supreme with him does he stop to admire the attitude the muscles the skilful swing the bright implement nay rather in a fine rage out he rushes and shouts what do you mean by this sir but making allowance for all my paltry wrath as his sycophants call it i found it impossible to catch the great man's meaning as it should be caught that is to say well over the heart thrown straight at it as a good fielder throws up and not over one's head or between one's legs or twisting in and out like a left handed bowler's ball but for all that i felt that his voice was grand and his power enormous if he would have used it simply and after the manner of his favourite author the fault perhaps lies in the multiplicity of his mind which does not consider the simplicity of ours perhaps he never had a worse cause to plead and in the bottom of his heart which is sound i do believe he must have known that far better than our shallow natures knew it when at last he broke out of the dense haze of argument into the pure sky of eloquence almost he persuaded me not be an englishman but for the thought that he himself was one all up now tommy sir roland said to me as the last tones of that silvery voice like music for the dead hung hovering after that it is all up with england but i answered hold my belt a minute i will try it whatever comes of it for the last two hours and indeed for the whole of the evening i had felt throughout my system that it was in a very extraordinary state thumping of the heart and great expansion of the chest tingling of arms and legs and great inhalings of hot light air had confused me and whenever a draught from the ventilators which are like a blow of steam came under me i seemed to feel my dress which i had chosen for its lightness fill like the feathers of a bird at rising sometimes indignation sometimes pleasure sometimes lofty ambition to be useful to my country and to laura's had been hoisting at me like a balanced lever don't be afraid i said i can't stop down any longer but try to get me a hearing to the sudden astonishment of the crowded house which could scarcely believe its own eyes at first i tommy upmore went up gently and steadily as a ring of blue smoke rises from a cigar where no draught is honourable members were leaving their seats for the critical division which should split up england but with one accord they all turned round and stared remembering what professor brachipod had told me i used my hands and feet so well with my curls spread out to catch the air that i steered my course as accurately as i ever steered a boat to bump another beneath me there seemed to be breathless amazement but i found myself perfectly calm and smiled avoiding all peril of fire i hovered with buoyant delight in every fibre and a tingle of disdain at the terror of the house for the greatest men looked quite small down there till i came to a large beam of the roof heart of british oak it was and against it i brought up with a perfectly erect and perhaps dignified presentment in this position i caught the speaker's eye and removing my hat which i placed upon the beam made my bow to him and sought permission to address the house the debate being closed and the division bell ringing i could hardly expect to be allowed to speak but the case was exceptional and more than that everybody longed to hear what i had got to say the right honourable the speaker raised his wig to be certain that his head was right under it and with no further symptom of surprise for he had seen a great many stranger sights than this said slowly i find no precedent for a speech from the roof by any honourable member but i am willing to be guided by the sense of the house in a case so unprecedented then the silence which was now becoming painful to me by reason of my loneliness up there was broken with loud cries of speak up larkmount from members who did not know my name speak up tommy from the gentlemen who did and speak down tommy from my private friends who were beginning to understand all about it the honourable member for larkmount has possession of the house said mr speaker sir i replied in a very clear voice at the same time unbuttoning my coat which was made like the one i had flown with at happystowe i will not presume upon your indulgence nor trespass on the kindness of the house below me except with a very brief quotation well known to all british members whom i would ask to join me in reciting it i had now drawn forth a little union jack made for me by my darling and flinging it open from its hollow silver staff waved it in the strong light around my head keeping time with the noble lines i sang in a voice that made the heart of oak resound and the hearts and lungs of men rebound the flaunting flag of liberty of gallia's sons the boast oh never may a briton see upon the british coast the only flag that freedom rears her emblem on the seas is the flag that braves a thousand years the battle and the breeze but fast would flow the nation's tears if traitor hands should seize the flag that braves a thousand years the battle and the breeze and shall we yield to dastard fears our empire of the seas the flag that braves a thousand years the battle and the breeze every face was turned towards me and every throat joined in with mine and every arm was waved even of the irish members to keep time with my waving of the glorious flag and perhaps there has never been a vaster roar even in the british house of commons than when i came down with my flag flying bravely bowed deeply to the speaker for his good grace and took sir roland's arm to go with him to the lobby for my head was giddy with excitement and timidity keep up your pluck tommy whispered sir roland you have done it this time i believe my boy by jove how splendidly you sang you have saved the country and won laura chapter xliv the english lion people who care for nothing are capable of saying almost anything but even of these there are not many who would call the british house of commons a sentimental body but anybody being at all a body must now and then feel its flesh rebel at the ghostly proceedings of its cock loft tenant pure reason like the doctrine of free trade is a very fine existence if it would only work but alas like the other it finds practical issue mainly in keeping people out of work the deep love of our birth which arises with our life rose anew in the heart of every englishman and forced him to scorn petty faction and vote as his father and mother would have made him the infamous and traitorous plot which would have ended in the ancient days at tower hill ended in a very hot majority of more than fifty against the government as a last faint hope they appealed to the country which had long borne patiently its sickness of them pending my second return for larkmount which took to itself all the glory of my deed and pelted every radical who dared to show his nose near the bottom of the hill it stood upon i ventured to pay a little visit to the towers though perhaps i should have waited till the issue was secure but i make bold to say from my own experience that no one who has been through all the ins and outs of love as i have been obliged to do can stop without hurrying to the end of them whether good or bad and in the sad humility which true love feels i was even scared by fancies that my darling might dislike the unusual course i had adopted for her sake it was pretty sure to cause some curiosity about her and perhaps even nasty scientific questions such as seem to have no reverence for the sanctity of home few names were more conspicuous than mine just now as perhaps was only natural and i could not resent it in a very short time that would be wiped out for fame is no better than a schoolboy's slate and the surest way to expunge it is to try to write it deeper my little notoriety soon became a nuisance to me all i cared for was that those i loved should love me for my own sake and any public reputation seems to interfere with that therefore i have never felt more humble in my life than when i sat by laura's side one lovely april day beneath the famous oak tree which her mother was fond of sketching the only leaves upon the tree were a few that had stood the winter and the young buds were not ready yet to push their faded history by i had always been handy with my knife from the time i cut bread and bacon with it and now i carved upon the bench t u while she looked on and encouraged me then i said let me put something much better now over it i shall cut 'l t t' and when you come here after i am gone you will be compelled to think of me how strange you are tommy she said as i sharpened my knife on my boot for my feet are as fine as a lady's any one who did not know you well would think that your fame had been too much for you you are not half so simple as you used to be i suppose you expect to be prime minister when the conservatives come in i took no notice of this because i wanted her to go on with it so i carved a very excellent l t while she kept on looking at the cows and sheep dear me she cried pulling out her watch from a place which was a very great favourite with my arm i had no idea it was so late i must leave you to finish your sculpture i am afraid good bye tommy for a long time now what must be must i replied with great firmness and then up i jumped with my knife in my hand because she was making off so fast don't be in such a dreadful hurry laura why you are crying dear am i indeed and even if i were it need not disturb the condition of your mind all you care about now is politics like roly how i do despise all politics and so do i except for one little thing i answered and you know well what that little thing is yes a very little thing indeed she replied taking good care not to look at me the smallest thing in all the world no doubt do try to have some particle of reason i exclaimed i am all pure reason itself she replied you are all pure beauty and warm heart i answered and what is the good of saying that you don't care about me did i say that i don't believe i ever did i was only trying to think it when you behaved so badly but if i said that it was a great story tommy you know what the penalty for a story is i answered and her eyes shone with sunny tears while she paid it darling sweet i said for i never touched her without being carried quite beyond myself all i was waiting for was to know what last letter i might put here i want to put a 'u' i so long to put a 'u' the one you in the world that just suits me to a t 'laura towers upmore' i won't do it without your full permission well dear she replied after some consideration roly has given his full consent now and my dear mother loves you like her own son and i well never mind about me i am nobody only i feel that your time should not be wasted with all the great things that you will have to do after saving the country to begin with so perhaps it would be wiser dear to put me down with 'u' now what do you suppose that i did next embraced her kissed her shed tears with her as young people do when they agree to get married to practise for the time to come nay such things are not to be talked about or why were trees made and benches and moss the very essence and symbol of silence all the year and houses far off to show what is to come yet not blink a window
