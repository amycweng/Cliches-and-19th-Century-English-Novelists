well again the maid of sker chapter i fisherman davy a fish out of water i am but an ancient fisherman upon the coast of glamorganshire with work enough of my own to do and trouble enough of my own to heed in getting my poor living yet no peace there is for me among my friends and neighbours unless i will set to and tryas they bid me twice aday perhapswhether i cannot tell the rights of a curious adventure which it pleased providence should happen off and on amidst us now for a good many years and with many ins and outs to it they assure me also that all good people who can read and write for ten or it may be twenty miles around the place i live in will buy my bookif i can make itat a higher price perhaps per lb than they would give me even for sewin which are the very best fish i catch and hence provision may be found for the old age and infirmities now gaining upon me every time i try to go out fishing in this encouragement and prospect i have little faith knowing how much more people care about what they eat than what they read nevertheless i will hope for the best especially as my evenings now are very long and wearisome and i was counted a hopeful scholar fifty years agone perhaps in our village school herenot to mention the royal navy and most of all because a very wealthy gentleman whose name will appear in this story has promised to pay all expenses and l down if i do it well and to leave me the profit if any notwithstanding this the work of writing must be very dull to me after all the change of scene and the open air and sea and the many sprees ashore and the noble fights with frenchmen and the power of oaths that made me jump so in his majestys navy god save the king and queen and members of the royal family be they as many as they willand they seem in faith to be manifold but his power is equal to it all if they will but try to meet him however not to enter upon any view of politicsall of which are far beyond the cleverest hand at a bait among usi am inditing of a thing very plain and simple when you come to understand it yet containing a little strangeness and some wonder here and there and apt to move good peoples grief at the wrongs we do one another great part of it fell under mine own eyes for a period of a score of years or something thereabout my memory still is pretty good but if i contradict myself or seem to sweep beyond my reach or in any way to meddle with things which i had better have let alone as a humble man and a christian i pray you to lay the main fault thereof on the badness of the times and the rest upon human nature for i have been a roving man and may have gathered much of evil from contact with my fellowmen although by origin meant for good in this i take some blame to myself for if i had polished my virtue well the evil could not have stuck to it nevertheless i am on the whole pretty well satisfied with myself hoping to be of such quality as the lord prefers to those perfect creatures with whom he has no trouble at all and therefore no enjoyment but sometimes taking up a book i am pestered with a troop of doubts not only about my want of skill and language and experience but chiefly because i never have been a man of consummate innocence excellence and high wisdom such as all these writers are if we go by their own opinions now when i plead among my neighbours at the mouth of the old well all the above my sad shortcomings and my own strong sense of them which perhaps is somewhat overstrong they only pat me on the back and smile at one another and make a sort of coughing noise according to my bashfulness and then if i look pleased which for my life i cannot help doing they wink as it were at one another and speak up like this now davy you know better you think yourself at least as good as any one of us davy and likely far above us all therefore davy the fisherman out with all you have to say without any french palaver you have a way of telling things so that we can see them with this and with that and most of all with hinting about a frenchman they put me on my mettle so that i sit upon the sidestones of the oldwell gallery which are something like the companionrail of a foreandafter and gather them around me with the householders put foremost according to their income and the children listening between their legs and thus i begin but never end the tale i now begin to you and perhaps shall never end it chapter ii hunger drives him afishing in the summer of the year i david llewellyn of newtonnottage fisherman and old sailor was in great distress and trouble more than i like to tell you my dear wife a faithful partner for eightandtwenty years in spite of a very quick temper was lately gone to a better world and i missed her tongue and her sharp lookout at almost every corner also my son as fine a seaman as ever went aloft after helping lord rodney to his great victory over grass the frenchman had been lost in a prizeship called the tonner of guns and crappos which sank with all hands on her way home to spithead under admiral graves his young wife who had been sent to us to see to with his blessing no sooner heard of this sad affair as in the gazette reported and his pay that week stopped on her but she fell into untimely travail and was dead ere morning so i buried my wife and daughterinlaw and lost all chance to bury my son between two bridgend marketdays now this is not very much of course compared with the troubles some people have but i had not been used to this matter except in case of a messmate and so i was greatly broken down and found my eyes so weak of a morning that i would not be seen out of doors almost the only one now to keep a stir or sound of life in my little cottage which faces to the churchyard was my orphan grandchild bunny daughter of my son just drowned and his only child that we knew of bunny was a rare strong lass five years old about then i think a stout and heartyfeeding child able to chew every bit of her victuals and mounting a fine rosy colour and eyes as black as archangel pitch one day when i was moping there all abroad about my bearings and no better than waterballasted the while i looked at my wifes new broom now carrying cobweb trysails this little bunny came up to me as if she had a boardingpike and sprang into the netting hammocks of the best black coat i wore grandda she said and looked to know in what way i would look at her grandda i must have sumkin more to eat something more to eat i cried almost with some astonishment well as i knew her appetite for the child had eaten a barleyloaf and two pigs feet and a dogfish yes more more bexfass grandda and though she had not the words to tell she put her hands in a way that showed me she ought to have more solid food i could not help looking sadly at her proud as i was of her appetite but recovering in a minute or two i put a good face upon it my dear and you shall have more i said only take your feet out of my pocket little heart have i for fishing god knows but afishing i will go this day if mother jones will see to you for i could not leave her alone quite yet although she was a brave little maid and no fire now was burning but within a childs trot from my door and down toward the sandhills was that famous ancient well of which i spoke just now dedicate to st john the baptist where they used to scourge themselves the village church stood here they say before the inroad of the sand and the water was counted holy how that may be i do not know but the well is very handy it has a little grey round tower of stone domed over the heart of it to which a covered way goes down with shallow steps irregular if it were not for this plan the sand would whelm the whole of it over even as it has overwhelmed all the departure of the spring and the cottages once surrounding it down these steps the children go each with a little brown pitcher holding hands and groping at the sides as they begin to feel darker and what with the sand beneath their feet and the narrowing of the roof above and the shadows moving round them and the doubt where the water begins or ends which nobody knows at any time it is much but what some little maid tumbles in and the rest have to pull her out again for this well has puzzled all the country and all the men of great learning being as full of contrariety as a maiden courted it comes and goes in a manner against the coming and going of the sea which is only half a mile from it and twice in a day it is many feet deep and again not as many inches and the water is so crystalclear that down in the dark it is like a dream some people say that john the baptist had nothing to do with the making of it because it was made before his time by the ancient family of de sandford who once owned all the manors here in this however i place no faith having read my bible to better purpose than to believe that john baptist was the sort of man to claim anything least of all any water unless he came honestly by it in either case it is very pretty to see the children round the entrance on a summer afternoon when they are sent for water they are all a little afraid of it partly because of its makers name and his having his head on a charger and partly on account of its curious ways and the sand coming out of its nostrils when first it begins to flow that day with which i begin my story mrs jones was good enough to take charge of little bunny and after getting ready to start i set the thong of our latch inside so that none but neighbours who knew the trick could enter our little cottage or rather mine i should say now and thus with congerrod and prawnnet and a long pole for the bass and a junk of pressed tobacco and a lump of barleybread and a maybird stuffed with onions just to refine the fishiness away i set for a longshore day upon as dainty a summer morn as ever shone out of the heavens fisherman davy as they call me all around our parts was fifty and two years of age i believe that very same july and with all my heart i wish that he were as young this very day for i never have found such call to enter into the affairs of another world as to forget my business here or press upon providence impatiently for a more heavenly state of things people may call me worldlyminded for cherishing such a view of this earth and perhaps it is not right of me however i can put up with it and be in no unkindly haste to say goodbye to my neighbours for to my mind such a state of seeking as many amongst us do even boast of is unless in a bad cough or a perilous calenture a certain proof of curiosity displeasing to our maker and i might even say of fickleness degrading to a true briton the sun came down upon my head so that i thought of bygone days when i served under captain howe or sir edward hawke and used to stroll away upon leave with half a hundred jacks ashore at naples or in bermudas or wherever the luck might happen now however was no time for me to think of strolling because i could no longer live at the expense of the government which is the highest luck of all and full of noble dignity things were come to such a push that i must either work or starve and could i but recall the past i would stroll less in the days gone by a pension of one and eightpence farthing for the weeks i was alive being in right of a heavy wound in capture of the bellona frenchman of twoandthirty guns by his majestys frigate vesta under captain hood was all i had to hold on by in support of myself and bunny except the slippery fish that come and go as providence orders them she had sailed from martinique when luckily we fell in with her and i never shall forget the fun and the five hours at close quarters we could see the powder on the other fellows faces while they were training their guns at us and we showed them with a slap our noses which they never contrived to hit she carried heavier metal than ours and had sixty more men to work it and therefore we were obliged at last to capture her by boarding i like a fool was the first that leaped into her mizenchains without looking before me as ought to have been the frenchmen came too fast upon me and gave me more than i bargained for thus it happened that i fell off in the very prime of life and strength from an ablebodied seaman and captain of the foretop to a sort of lurcher along shore and a man who must get his own living with nets and rods and suchlike for that very beautiful fight took place in the year before i was thirty years old and before his present most gracious majesty came to the throne of england and inasmuch as a villanous frenchman made at me with a cutlash and a power of blue oaths taking a nasty advantage of me while i was yet entangled and thumped in three of my ribs before a kind providence enabled me to relieve him of his head at a blowi was discharged when we came to spithead with an excellent character in a silk bag and a considerable tightness of breathing and leave to beg my way home again now i had not the smallest meaning to enter into any of these particulars about myself especially as my story must be all about other peoplebeautiful maidens and fine young men and several of the prime gentry but as i have written it so let it stay because perhaps after all it is well that people should have some little knowledge of the man they have to deal with and learn that his character and position are a long way above all attempt at deceit to come back once again if you please to that very hot day of july whence i mean to depart no more until i have fully done with itboth from the state of the moon i knew and from the neap when my wife went off that the top of the spring was likely to be in the dusk of that same evening at first i had thought of going down straight below us to newton bay and peddling over the black rocks towards the ogmore river some two miles to the east of us but the bright sun gave me more enterprise and remembering how the tide would ebb also how low my pocket was i felt myself bound in honour to bunny to make a real push for it and thoroughly search the congerholes and the lobsterledges which are the best on all our coast round about pool tavan and down below the old house at sker chapter iii the fish are as hungry as he is to fish at sker had always been a matter of some risk and conflict inasmuch as evan thomas who lived in the ancient house there and kept the rabbitwarren never could be brought to know that the sea did not belong to him he had a grant from the manor he said and the shore was part of the manor and whosoever came hankering there was a poacher a thief and a robber with these hard words and harder blows he kept off most of the neighbourhood but i always felt that the lurch of the tide was no more than the heeling of a ship and therefore that any one free of the sea was free of the ebb and flow of it so when he began to reproach me once i allowed him to swear himself thoroughly out and then in a steadfast manner said black evan the shore is not mine or yours stand you here and keep it and i will never come again for in three hours time there would be a fathom of water where we stood and when he caught me again i answered evan black if you catch me inland meddling with any of your landgoods coneys or hares or partridges give me a leathering like a man and i must put up with it but dare you touch me on this shore which belongs to our lord the king all the way under highwater mark and by the rod of the red sea i will show you the law of it he looked at me and the pole i bore and heavy and strong man as he was he thought it wiser to speak me fair well well dyo dear he said in welsh having scarce any english you have served the king dyo and are bound to know what is right and wrong only let me know good man if you see any other rogues fishing here this i promised him freely enough because of course i had no objection to his forbidding other people and especially one vile scotchman yet being a man of no liberality he never could see even me fish there without following and abusing me and most of all after a marketday that tide i had the rarest sport that ever you did see scarcely a congerhole i tried without the landlord being at home and biting savagely at the iron which came like a rate upon him whereupon i had him by the jaw as the taxcollector has us scarcely a lobstershelf i felt tickling as i do under the weeds but what a grand old soldier came to the portcullis of his stronghold and nabbed the neathide up my fingers and stuck thereto till i hauled him out noluswoluss as we say and there he showed his purple nippers and his great long whiskers and then his sides hooped like a cask till his knuckled legs fought with the air and the lobes of his tail were quivering it was fine to see these fellows worth at least a shilling and to pop them into my basket where they clawed at one another glorious luck i had in truth and began to forget my troubles and the long way home again to a lonely cottage and my fear that little bunny was passing a sorry day of it she should have a new pair of boots and mother jones a good sunday dinner and as for myself i would think perhaps about half a glass of fine old rum to remind me of the navy and a pipe of the short cut bristol tobaccobut that must depend upon circumstances now circumstances had so much manners contrary to their custom that they contrived to keep themselves continually in my favour not only did i fetch up and pile a noble heap of oysters and mussels just at the lowest of the ebb but after that when the tide was flowing and my work grew briskeras it took me by the calves and my feet were not cut by the mussels more than i could walk uponsuddenly i found a thing beating all experience both of the past and future this was that the heat of the weather and the soft south wind prevailing had filled the deep saltwater pools among the rocks of pool tavan and as far as ffynnon wen with the finest prawns ever seen or dreamed of and also had peopled the shallow pools higher up the beach with shoals of silver mulletfrysmall indeed and as quick as lightning but well worth a little trouble to catch being as fine eating as any lady in the land could long for and here for a moment i stood in some doubt whether first to be down on the prawns or the mullet but soon i remembered the tide would come first into the pools that held the prawns now it did not take me very long to fill a great holland bag with these noble fellows rustling their whiskers and rasping their long saws at one another four gallons i found and a little over when i came to measure them and sixteen shillings i made of them besides a good many which bunny ate raw neither was my luck over yet for being now in great heart and good feather what did i do but fall very briskly upon the grey mullet in the pools and fast as they scoured away down the shallows fluting the surface with lines of light and huddling the ripples all up in a curve as they swung themselves round on their tails with a sweep when they could swim no furthernevertheless it was all in vain for i blocked them in with a mole of kelp weighted with heavy pebbles and then baled them out at my pleasure now the afternoon was wearing away and the flood making strongly up channel by the time i came back from ffynnon wenwhither the mullet had led meto my headquarters opposite sker farmhouse at the basin of pool tavan this pool is made by a ring of rocks sloping inward from the sea and is dry altogether for two hours ebb and two hours flow of a good springtide except so much as a little landspring sliding down the slippery seaweed may have power to keep it moist a wonderful place here is for wildfowl the very choicest of all i know both when the sluice of the tide runs out and when it comes swelling back again for as the water ebbs away with a sulky wash in the hollow places and the sand runs down in little crannies and the bladderweeds hang trickling and the limpets close their valves and the beautiful jellyflowers look no better than chilblainsall this void and glistening basin is at once alive with birds first the seapie runs and chatters and the turnstone pries about with his head laid sideways in a most sagacious manner and the sanderlings glide in file and the greenshanks separately then the shy curlews over the point warily come and leave one to watch while the brave little mallard teal with his green triangles glistening stands on one foot in the freshwater runnel and shakes with his quacks of enjoyment again at the freshening of the flood when the round pool fills with sea pouring in through the gate of rock and the waves push merrily onward then a mighty stir arises and a different race of birdsthose which love a swimming dinnerswoop upon pool tavan here is the giant grey gull breasting like a cherub in church before he dowses down his head and here the elegant kittywake and the sullen cormorant in the shadow swimming and the swiftest of swift wings the silvergrey seaswallow dips like a butterfly and is gone while from slumber out at sea or on the pool of kenfig in a long wedge cleaves the air the whistling flight of wildducks standing upright for a moment with their red toes on the water and their strong wings flapping in they souse with one accord and a strenuous delight then ensues a mighty quacking of unanimous content a courteous nodding of quick heads and a sluicing and a shovelling of water over shoulderblades in all the glorious revelry of insatiable washing recovering thence they dress themselves in a soberminded manner paddling very quietly proudly puffing out their breasts arching their necks and preening themselves titivating as we call it with their bills in and out the down and shoulders up to run the wet off then turning their heads as if on a swivel they fettle their backs and their scapular plume then being as clean as clean can be they begin to think of their dinners and with stretched necks down they dive to catch some luscious morsel and all you can see is a little sharp tail and a pair of red feet kicking bless all their innocent souls how often i longed to have a good shot at them and might have killed eight or ten at a time with a long gun heavily loaded but all these birds knew as well as i did that i had no gun with me and although they kept at a tidy distance yet they let me look at them which i did with great peace of mind all the time i was eating my supper the day had been too busy till now to stop for any feeding but now there would be twenty minutes or so ere the bass came into pool tavan for these like a depth of water so after consuming my bread and maybird and having a good drink from the spring i happened to look at my great flagbasket now ready to burst with congers and lobsters and mullet and spidercrabs for bunny who could manage any quantity also with other good saleable fish and i could not help saying to myself come after all now davy llewellyn you are not gone so far as to want a low scotchman to show you the place where the fish live and with that i lit a pipe what with the hard work and the heat and the gentle plash of wavelets and the calmness of the sunset and the power of red onions what did i do but fall asleep as snugly as if i had been on watch in one of his majestys ships of the line after a heavy gale of wind and when i woke up again behold the shadows of the rocks were over me and the sea was saluting the calves of my legs which up to that mark were naked and but for my instinct in putting my basket up on a rock behind me all my noble catch of fish must have gone to the locker of davy jones at this my conscience smote me hard as if i were getting old too soon and with one or two of the short strong words which i had learned in the navy where the chaplain himself stirred us up with them up i roused and rigged my pole for a good bout at the bass at the butt of the ash was a bar of square oak figged in with a screwbolt and roven round this was my line of good hemp twisted evenly so that if any fish came who could master me and pull me off the rocks almost i could indulge him with some slack by unreeving a fathom of line at the end of the pole was a strong loopknot through which ran the line bearing two large hooks with the eyes of their shanks lashed tightly with cobblers ends upon whipcord the points of the hooks were fetched up with a file and the barbs well backened and the whole dressed over with whaleoil then upon one hook i fixed a soft crab and on the other a cuttlefish there were lugworms also in my pot but they would do better after dark when a tumbling cod might be on the feed goodluck and badluck has been my lot ever since i can remember sometimes a long spell of one wing and wing as you might say and then a long leg of the other but never in all my born days did i have such a spell of luck in the fishing way as on that blessed th of july what to do with it all now became a puzzle for i could not carry it home all at once and as to leaving a bit behind or refusing to catch a single fish that wanted to be caught neither of these was a possible thing to a trueborn fisherman at last things came to such a pitch that it was difficult not to believe that all must be the crowd and motion of a very pleasant dream here was the magic ring of the pool shaped by a dance of seafairies and the fading light shed doubtfully upon the haze of the quivering sea and the silver water lifting like a mirror on a hinge while the black rocks seemed to nod to it and here was i pulling out big fishes almost faster than i cast in chapter iv he lands an unexpected fish now as the rising sea came sliding over the coronet of rocks as well as through the main entrancefor even the brim of the pool is covered at high wateri beheld a glorious sight stored in my remembrance of the southern regions but not often seen at home the day had been very hot and brilliant with a light air from the south and at sunset a haze arose and hung as if it were an awning over the tranquil sea first a gauze of golden colour as the western light came through and then a tissue shot with red and now a veil of silvery softness as the summer moon grew bright then the quiet waves beganas their plaited lines rolled onward into frills of whitenessin the very curl and fall to glisten with a flitting light presently as each puny breaker overshone the one in front not the crest and comb alone but the slope behind it and the crossing flaws inshore gleamed with hovering radiance and soft flashes vanishing till in the deepening of the dusk each advancing crest was sparkling with a mane of fire every breaking wavelet glittered like a shaken seam of gold thence the shower of beads and lustres lapsed into a sliding tier moving up the sands with light or among the pebbles breaking into a cataract of gems being an ancient salt of course i was not dismayed by this show of phosphorus nor even much astonished but rather pleased to watch the brightness as it brought back to my mind thoughts of beautiful sunburnt damsels whom i had led along the shore of the lovely mediterranean yet our stupid landsmen far and wide were panicstruck and hundreds fell upon their knees expecting the last trump to sound all i said to myself was this no wonder i had such sport today change of weather soon i doubt and perhaps a thunderstorm as i gazed at all this beauty trying not to go astray with wonder and with weariness there in the gateway of black rock with the offing dark behind her and the glittering waves upon their golden shoulders bearing hersudden as an apparition came a smoothlygliding boat beaded all athwart the bows and down the bends with drops of light holding stem well up in air and the forefoot shedding gold she came as strait toward this poor and unconverted davy as if an angel held the tiller with an admiral in the sternsheets hereupon such terror seized me after the wonders of the day that my pole fell downright into the water of which a big fish wronged me so as to slip the hook and be off again and it was no more than the turn of a hair but what i had run away head over heels for the day had been so miraculous beginning with starvation and going on with so much heat and hard work and enjoyment and such a draught of fishes that a poor bodys wits were gone with it and therefore i doubt not it must have been an especial decree of providence that in turning round to run away i saw my big fishbasket to carry this over the rocks at a run was entirely impossible although i was still pretty good in my legs but to run away without it was a great deal more impossible for a man who had caught the fish himself and beside the fish in the basket there must have been more than two hundredweight of bass that would not go into it three hundred and a half in all was what i set it down at taking no heed of prawns and lobsters and with any luck in selling it must turn two guineas hence perhaps it came to pass as much as from downright bravery of which sometimes i have some little that i felt myself bound to creep back again under the shade of a cold wet rock just to know what that boat was up to a finer floatage i never saw and her lines were purely elegant and she rode above the water without so much as parting it then in spite of all my fear i could not help admiring and it struck me hotly at the heart oh if she is but a real boat what a craft for my business and with that i dropped all fear for i had not been able for many years to carry on my fishing as skill and knowledge warranted only because i could not afford to buy a genuine boat of my own and hitherto had never won the chance without the money as yet i could see no soul on board no one was rowing that was certain neither any sign of a sail to give her steerageway however she kept her course so true that surely there must be some hand invisible at the tiller this conclusion flurried me again very undesirably and i set my right foot in such a manner as to be off in a twinkling of anything unholy but god has care of the little souls which nobody else takes heed of and so he ordained that the boat should heel and then yaw across the middle of the pool but for which black rocks alone would have been her welcome at once my heart came back to me for i saw at once as an old sailor pretty well up in shipwrecks that the boat was no more than a derelict and feeling that here was my chance of chances worth perhaps ten times my catch of fish i set myself in earnest to the catching of that boat therefore i took up my pole again and finding that the brace of fish whom i had been overscared to land had got away during my slackness i spread the hooks and cast them both with the slugs of lead upon them and half a fathom of spare line ready as far as ever my arms would throw the flight of the hooks was beyond my sight for the phosphorus spread confusion but i heard most clearly the thump thump of the two leaden bobsthe heavy and the light oneupon hollow planking upon this i struck as i would at a fish and the hooks got hold or at any rate one of them and i felt the light boat following faster as she began to get way on the haul and so i drew her gently toward me being still in some misgiving although resolved to go through with it but bless my heart when the light boat glided buoyantly up to my very feet and the moon shone over the starboard gunwale and without much drawback i gazed at itbehold the little craft was laden with a freight of pure innocence all for captain crew and cargo was a little helpless child in the sternsheets fast asleep with the baby face towards me lay a little child in white something told me that it was not dead or even ailing only adrift upon the world and not at all aware of it quite an atom of a thing taking gods will anyhow cast no doubt according to the rocking of the boat only with one tiny arm put up to keep the sun away before it fell asleep being taken quite aback with pity sorrow and some anger which must have been of instinct i laid hold of the bows of the skiff and drew her up a narrow channel where the landspring found its way the lift of a round wave helped her on and the bladderweed saved any chafing a brandnew painter by the feel it was that i caught hold of but instead of a hitch at the end it had a clean sharp cut across it having made it fast with my fishingpole jammed hard into a crevice of rock i stepped on board rather gingerly and seating myself on the forward thwart gazed from a respectful distance at the little stranger the light of the moon was clear and strong and the phosphorus of the sea less dazing as the night grew deeper therefore i could see pretty well and i took a fresh plug of tobacco before any further meddling for the child was fast asleep and according to my experience they are always best in that way chapter v a little orphan mermaid by the clear moonlight i saw a very wee maiden all in white having neither cloak nor shawl nor any other soft appliance to protect or comfort her but lying with her little back upon the aftmost planking with one arm bent as i said before and the other drooping at her side as if the babyhand had been at work to ease her crying and then when tears were tired out had dropped in sleep or numb despair my feelings were so moved by this as i became quite sure at last that here was a little mortal that the tears came to mine own eyes too she looked so purely pitiful the lord in heaven have mercy on the little dear i cried without another thought about it and then i went and sat close by so that she lay between my feet however she would not awake in spite of my whistling gradually and singing a little song to her and playing with her curls of hair therefore as nothing can last for ever and the tide was rising fast i was forced to give the little lady not what you would call a kick so much as a very gentle movement of the muscles of the foot she opened her eyes at this and yawned but was much inclined to shut them again till i having to get home that night could make no further allowance for her as having no home to go to and upon this i got over all misgivings about the dirtiness of my jacket and did what i had feared to do by reason of great respect for her that is to say i put both hands very carefully under her and lifted her like a delicate fish and set her crosswise on my lap and felt as if i understood her and she could not have weighed more than twenty pounds according to my heft of fish having been touched with trouble lately i was drawn out of all experience now for my nature is not oversoft towards this little thing so cast in a dream almost upon me i thought of her mother well drowned no doubt and the father who must have petted her and of the many times to come when none would care to comfort her and though a child is but a child somehow i took to that child therefore i became most anxious as to her state of body and handled her little mites of feet and her fingers and all her outworks because i was not sure at all that the manner of her yawning might be nothing more or less than a going out of this world almost for think if you can see it so how everything was against her to be adrift without any food or any one to tend her many hours or days perhaps with a redhot sun or cold stars overhead and the greedy sea beneath her however there she was alive and warm and limp to the best of my judgment sad though i was to confess to myself that i knew more of bass than of babies for it had always so pleased god that i happened to be away at sea when he thought fit to send them therefore my legs went abroad with fear of dandling this one that now was come in a way to disgrace a seaman for if she should happen to get into irons i never could get her out again upon that matter at any rate i need not have concerned myself for the child was so trim and well ballasted also ribbed so stiff and sound that any tack i set her on she would stick to it and start no rope and knowing that this was not altogether the manner of usual babies who yaw about and no steerageway i felt encouraged and capable almost of a womans business therefore i gave her a little tickle and verily she began to laugh or perhaps i should say by rights to smile in a gentle and superior wayfor she always was superior and a funnier creature never lived neither one that could cry so distressfully wake up wake up my deary said i and dont you be afraid of me a fine little girl ive got at home about twice the size that you be and goes by the name of bunny bunny she said and i was surprised not being up to her qualities that she could speak so clearly then it struck me that if she could talk like that i might as well know more about her so i began very craftily with the thing all children are proud about and are generally sure to be up to pretty little soul i said how old do you call yourself at this she gathered up her forehead not being used to the way i put it while she was trying to think it out how old are you deary said i trying hard to suck up my lips and chirp as i had seen the nurses do ise two ise two she answered looking with some astonishment didnt a know that hots a name this proof of her high standing and knowledge of the world took me for the moment a good deal off my legs until i remembered seeing it put as a thing all must give in to that the rising generation was beyond our understanding so i answered very humbly deary my name is old davy baby kiss old davy i ill she answered briskly old davy i likes a ill be a good gal i ill a good girl to be sure you will bless my heart i never saw such a girl and i kissed her three or four times over until she began to smell my plug and bunny was nobody in my eyes but whats your own name deary now you know old davys name ise bardie didnt a know that to be sure i did for a little fib was needful from the way she looked at me and the biggest one ever told would have been a charity under the circumstances pease old davy ise aye hungy she went on ere i was right again and i ants a dink o yater what a fool i am cried i of course you do you darling what an atomy you are to talk stop here a moment setting her on the seat by herself like a stupid as i was for she might have tumbled overboard i jumped out of the boat to fetch her water from the springhead as well as the relics of my food from the corner of the fishbasket and truly vexed was i with myself for devouring of my dinner so but no sooner was i gone than feeling so left alone again after so much desertion what did the little thing do but spring like a perfect grasshopper and slipping under the afterthwart set off in the bravest toddle for the very bow of the boat in fear of losing sight of me unluckily the boat just happened to lift upon a bit of a wave and not having won her sealegs yet in spite of that long cruise down came poor bardie with a thump which hurt me more than her i think knowing what bunny would have done i expected a fearful roar and back i ran to lift her up but even before i could interfere she was up again and all alive with both her arms stretched out to show and her face set hard to defy herself i ont ky i ont i tell a ee see if i does now and ma say hot a good gal i is where did you knock yourself little wonder let old davy make it well show old davy the poor sore place nare it is gardy la nare poor bardie knock herself and she held up her short white smock and showed me the bend of her delicate round knee as simply and kindly as could be i ont ky no i ont she went on with her pretty lips screwed up little brother ky e know but bardie a gate big gal savvy voo bardie too big enough to ky however all this greatness vanished when a drop of blood came oozing from the long black bruise and still more when i tried to express my deep compassion the sense of badluck was too strong for the courage of even two years growth and little bardie proved herself of just the right age for crying i had observed how clear and bright and musical her voice was for such a tiny creature and now the sound of her great woe and scene of her poor helpless plight was enough to move the rocks into a sense of pity for her however while she had her cry out as the tide would never wait i took the liberty of stowing all my fish and fishingtackle on board of that handy little boat which i began to admire and long for more and more every time i jumped from the rock into her foresheets and finding how tight and crank she was and full of spring at every step and with a pair of good ash sculls and most of all discovering the snuggest of snug lockers my conscience always a foremost feature showed me in the strongest light that it would be a deeply ungracious ungrateful and even sinful thing if i failed to thank an ever wise and overruling providence for sending me this useful gift in so express a manner and taking this pious and humble view of the nights occurrence i soon perceived a special fitness in the time of its ordering for it happened to be the very night when evan thomas was out of the way as i had been told at nottage and the steward of the manor safe to be as drunk as a fiddler at bridgend and it was not more than a few months since that envious scotchman sandy macraw a scurvy limb of the coastguards who lived by poaching on my born rights had set himself up with a boat forsooth on purpose to rogue me and rob me the better no doubt he had stolen it somewhere for he first appeared at night with it and now here was a boat in all honesty mine which would travel two feet for each one of his tub by the time i had finished these grateful reflections and resolved to contribute any unsold crabs to the dissenting ministers salary in recognition of the hand of providence and what he had taught me concerning it no longer ago than last sabbathday when he said that the lord would make up to me for the loss of my poor wife though never dreaming i must confess of anything half so good as a boat and by the time that i had moored this special mercy snugly and hidden the oars so that no vile wrecker could make off with her feloniously that dear little child was grown quiet again being unable to cry any more and now beginning to watch my doings as much as i could wish or more she never seemed tired of watching me having slept out all her sleep for the moment and as i piled up fish on fish and they came sliding slippery she came shyly eyeing them with a desire to see each one pushing her mites of fingers out and then drawing back in a hurry as their bellies shone in the moonlight some of the congers could wriggle still and they made her scream when they did it but the lobsters were her chief delight being all alive and kicking she came and touched them reverently and ready to run if they took it amiss and then she stroked their whiskers crying pitty pitty jolly jolly till one great fellow who knew no better would have nipped her wrist asunder if i had not ricked his claw now deary said i as i drew her away you have brought poor old davy a beautiful boat and the least that he can do for you is to get you a good supper for since her tumble the little soul had seemed neither hungry nor thirsty pease old davy she answered i ants to go to mama and papa and ickle bother and susan the devil you do thought i in a whistle not seeing my way to a fib as yet does ee know mama and papa and ickle bother old davy to be sure i do my dearybetter than i know you almost et me go to them et me go to them hot ma say about my poor leggy peggy this was more than i could tell believing her mother to be no doubt some thirty fathoms under water and her father and little brother in about the same predicament come along my little dear and ill take you to your mother this was what i said not being ready as yet with a corker ise yeady old davy she answered ise kite yeady hen ll e be yeady peshy voo ready and steady word of command march said i looking up at the moon to try to help me out of it but the only thing that i could find to help me in this trouble was to push about and stir and keep her looking at me she was never tired of looking at things with life or motion in them and this i found the special business of her nature afterwards now being sure of my boat i began to think what to do with bardie and many foolish ideas came but i saw no way to a wise one or at least i thought so then and unhappily looked to prudence more than to gracious providence for which i have often grieved bitterly ever since it turned out who bardie was for the present however though strongly smitten with her manners appearance and state of shipwreck as well as impressed with a general sense of her being meant for goodluck to me i could not see my way to take her to my home and support her many and many times over i said to myself in my doubt and uneasiness and perhaps more times than need have been if my conscience had joined me that it was no good to be a fool to give way as a woman might do to the sudden affair of the moment and a hothearted mode of regarding it and the harder i worked at the stowing of fish the clearer my duty appeared to me so by the time that all was ready for starting with this boat of mine the sea being all the while as pretty as a pond by candlelight it was settled in my mind what to do with bardie she must go to the old skerhouse and having taken a special liking through the goodness of my nature and the late distress upon me to this little helpless thing most sincerely i prayed to god that all might be ordered for the best as indeed it always is if we leave it to him nevertheless i ought never to have left it to him as every one now acknowledges but how could i tell by this time she began to be overcome with circumstances as might happen naturally to a child but two years old after long exposure without any food or management scared and strange and tired out she fell down anyhow in the boat and lay like a log and frightened me many men would have cared no more but taking the baby for dead have dropped her into the grave of the waters i however have always been of a very different stamp from these and all the wars and discipline and doctrine i have encountered never could imbue me with the cruelty of my betters therefore i was shocked at thinking that the little dear was dead chapter vi finds a home of some sort however it was high time now if we had any hope at all of getting into skerhouse that night to be up and moving for though evan thomas might be late moxy his wife would be early and the door would open to none but the master after the boys were gone to bed for the house is very lonely and people no longer innocent as they used to be in that neighbourhood i found the child quite warm and nice though overwhelmed with weight of sleep and setting her crosswise on my shoulders whence she slid down into my bosom over the rocks i picked my way by the light of the full clear moon towards the old skergrange which stands a little back from the ridge of beach and on the edge of the sandhills this always was and always must be a very sad and lonesome place close to a desolate waste of sand and the continual roaring of the sea upon black rocks a great grey house with many chimneys many gables and many windows yet not a neighbour to look out on not a tree to feed its chimneys scarce a firelight in its gables in the very depth of winter of course it is said to be haunted and though i believe not altogether in any stories of that kinddespite some very strange things indeed which i have beheld at seaat any rate i would rather not hear any yarns on that matter just before bedtime in that house and most people would agree with me unless i am much mistaken for the whole neighbourhoodif so you may call it where there are no neighboursis a very queer onestormy wild and desolate with little more than rocks and sand and sea to make ones choice among as to the sea not only dull and void it is of any haven or of proper traffic but as dangerous as need be even in good weather being full of draughts and currents with a tide like a millrace suffering also the ups and downs which must be where the atlantic ocean jostles with blind narrowings it offers moreover a special peril a treacherous and a shifty one in the shape of some horrible quicksands known as the skerweathers these at the will of storm and current change about from place to place but are for the most part some two miles from shore and from two to four miles long according to circumstances sometimes almost bare at halftide and sometimes covered at low water if any ship falls into them the bravest skipper that ever stood upon a quarterdeck can do no more than pipe to prayers though one or two craft have escaped when the tide was rising rapidly as for the shore it is no better when once you get beyond the rocks than a stretch of sandhills with a breadth of flaggy marsh behind them all the way to the mouth of neath river some three leagues to the westward eastward the scene is fairer inland but the coast itself more rugged and steep and scarcely more inhabited having no house nearer than rhwychyns which is only a small farm nearly two miles from skergrange and a mile from any other house and if you strike inland from skerthat is to say to the northwardthere is nothing to see but sand warren and furze and great fields marked with rubble even as far as kenfig looking at that vast lonely house there were two things i never could make out the first was who could ever have been mad enough to build it therefor it must have cost a mint of money being all of quarried and carried stone and with no rich farm to require it and the second thing was still worse a puzzle how could any one ever live there as to the first point the story is that the house was built by abbots of neath when owners of skermanor adding to it very likely as they followed one another and then it was used as their manorcourt and for purposes more important as a place of refection being near good fisheries and especially kenfig pool stocked with all freshwater fish and every kind of wildfowl but upon the other question all that i can say is this i have knocked about the world a good bit and have suffered many trials by the which i am no doubt chastened and highly rectified nevertheless i would rather end my life among the tombstones if only allowed three farthings worth of tobacco every day than live with all those abbots luxuries in that old grey house however there were no abbots now nor any sort of luxury only a rough unpleasant farmer a kind but slovenly wife of his and five great lads notorious for pleasing no one except themselves also a boy of a different order as you soon shall see thinking of all this i looked with tenderness at the little dear fallen back so fast asleep innocent and trustful with her head upon my shoulder and her breathing in my beard turning away at view of the house i brought the moonlight on her face and this appeared so pure and calm and fit for better company that a pain went to my heart as in welsh we speak of it because she was so fast asleep and that alone is something holy in a very little child so much it seems to be the shadow of the death itself in their pausing fluttering lives in their want of wit for dreaming and their fitness for a world of which they must know more than this also to a man who feels the loss of much believing and what grievous gain it is to make doubt of everything such a simple trust in him than whom we find no better father such a confidence of safety at the very outset seems a happy art unknown and tempts him back to ignorance well aware what years must bring from all the ill they have brought to us we cannot watch this simple sort without a sadness on our side a pity and a longing as for something lost and gone in the scoop between two sandhills such a power of moonlight fell upon the face of this baby that it only wanted the accident of her lifting bright eyes to me to make me cast away all prudence and even the dread of bunny but a man at my time of life must really look to the main chance first and scout all romantic visions and another face means another mouth however pretty it may be moreover i had no wife now nor woman to look after us and what can even a manchild do without their apparatus while on the other hand i knew that however dreary sker might be there was one motherly heart inside it therefore it came to pass that soon the shadow of that dark house fell upon the little one in my arms while with a rotten piece of timber which was lying handy i thumped and thumped at the old oak door but nobody came to answer me nobody even seemed to hear though every knock went further and further into the emptiness of the place but just as i had made up my mind to lift the latch and to walk in freely as i would have done in most other houses but stood upon scruple with evan thomas i heard a slow step in the distance and moxy thomas appeared at lasta kindlyhearted and pleasant woman but apt to be lowspirited as was natural for evans wife and not very much of a manager and yet it seems hard to blame her there when i come to think of it for most of the women are but so round about our neighbourhoodsanding up of room and passage and forming patterns on the floor every other saturday and yet the roof all frayed with cobwebs and the corners such as in the navy we should have been ropeended for by means of nature moxy was shaped for a thoroughly good and lively woman and such no doubt she would have been if she had had the luck to marry me as at one time was our signification god however ordered things in a different manner and no doubt he was considering what might be most for my benefit nevertheless in the ancient days when i was a fine young tar on leave and all sundayschool set caps at me perhaps i was twoandtwenty then the only girl i would allow to sit on the crossing of my legs upon a welldusted tombstone and suck the things i carried for them all being fond of peppermint was this little moxy stradling of good newton family and twelve years old at that time she made me swear on the blade of my knife never to have any one but her and really i looked forward to it as almost beyond a joke and her father had some money whos there at this time of night cried moxy thomas sharply and in welsh of course although she had some english pull the latch if you be honest evan black is in the house by the tone of her voice i knew that this last was a fib of fright and glad i was to know it so much the better chance was left me of disposing bardie somewhere where she might be comfortable soon as mrs thomas saw us by the light of a homemade dip she scarcely stopped to stare before she wanted the child out of my arms and was ready to devour it guessing that it came from sea and talking all the while full gallop as women find the way to do i was expecting fifty questions and no doubt she asked them yet seemed to answer them all herself and be vexed with me for talking yet to want me to go on moxy now be quick i said this little thing from out the sea quick is it quick indeed much quick you are old dyo she replied in english the darling dear the pretty love for the child had spread its hands to her being taken with a womans dress give her to me clumsy davy is it that way you do carry her old davy tarry me aye nicely i tell a old davy good and kind and i ont have him called kumsy so spake up my twoyearold astonishing me as she always has done by her wonderful cleverness and surprising moxy thomas that such clear good words should come from so small a creature my goodness me you little vixen wherever did you come from bring her in yourself then dyo if she thinks so much of you let me feel her not wet she is whereever did you get her put her on this little stool and let her warm them mites of feet till i go for bread and butter although the weather was so hot a fire of coal and driftwood was burning in the great chimneyplace for cooking of black evans supper because he was an outrageous man to eat whenever he was drunk which as a doctor told me once shows the finest of all constitutions but truly there was nothing else of life or cheer or comfort in the great sad stony room a floor of stone six gloomy doorways and a blackbeamed ceilingno wonder that my little darling cowered back into my arms and put both hands before her eyes no no no she said bardie doesnt ike it when mama come she be very angy with a old davy i felt myself bound to do exactly as mrs thomas ordered me and so i carried miss finical to the threelegged stool of firwood which had been pointed out to me and having a crick in my back for a moment after bearing her so far down i set her upon her own legs which although so neat and pretty were uncommonly steadfast to my astonishment off she started before i could fetch myself to think over the rough stone flags of the hall trotting on her toes entirely for the very life of her before i could guess what she was up to she had pounced upon an old kitchentowel newly washed but full of splinters hanging on a threelegged horse and back she ran in triumph with itfor none could say that she toddledand with a want of breath and yet a vigour that made up for it began to rub with all her power as well as a highly skilful turn the top of that blessed threelegged stool and some way down the sides of it whats the matter my dear i asked almost losing my mind at this after all her other wonders dirt she replied degustin dirt never stopping to look up at me what odds for a little dirt when a little soul is hungry bardie a boofley kean gal and this tool degustin cochong was all the reply she vouchsafed me but i saw that she thought less of me however i was glad enough that moxy did not hear her for mrs thomas had no unreasonable illwill towards dirt but rather liked it in its place and with her its place was everywhere but i being used to see every cranny searched and scoured with holystone blest moreover when ashore with a wife like amphitrite who used to come aboard of us could thoroughly enter into the cleanliness of this bardie and thought more of her accordingly while this little trot was working in the purest ignorance of father and of mother yet perhaps in her tiny mind hoping to have pleased them both back came mrs thomas bringing all the best she had of comfort and of cheer for us although not much to speak of i took a little hollands hot on purpose to oblige her because she had no rum and the little baby had some milk and rabbitgravy being set up in a blanket and made the most we could make of her and she ate a truly beautiful supper sitting gravely on the stool and putting both hands to her mouth in fear of losing anything all the boys were gone to bed after a long days rabbiting and evan black still on the spree so that i was very pleasant knowing my boat to be quite safe toward my ancient sweetheart and we got upon the old times so much in a pleasing innocent teasing way that but for fear of that vile black evan we might have forgotten poor bardie chapter vii boat versus bardie glad as i was for the poor childs sake that black evan happened to be from home i had perhaps some reason also to rejoice on my own account for if anything of any kind could ever be foretold about that most uncertain fellows conduct it was that when in his cups he would fightwith cause if he could find any otherwise without it and in the present case perhaps was some little cause for fighting touching as he no doubt would think not only his marital but manorial rights of plunder of course between moxy and myself all was purely harmless each being thankful to have no more than a pleasant eye for the other and of course in really serious ways i had done no harm to him that boat never being his except by downright piracy nevertheless few men there are who look at things from what i may call a large and open standingplace and evan might even go so far as to think that i did him a double wrong in taking that which was his the boat and leaving that which should have been mineto wit the little maidenas a helpless burden upon his hands without so much as a change of clothes and all this after a great days sport among his rocks without his permission feeling how hopeless it would be to reason these matters out with him especially as he was sure to be drunk i was glad enough to say goodnight to my new young pet now fast asleep and to slip off quietly to sea with my little frigate and its freight indulging also my natural pride at being for the first time in my life a legitimate shipowner and independent deepsea fisherman by this time the tide was turned of course and running strong against me as i laid her head for newton bay by the light of the full moon and proud i was without mistake to find how fast i could send my little crank barky against the current having being a fine oarsman in my day and always stroke of the captains gig but as one who was well acquainted with the great dearth of honesty not in our own parish only but for many miles around i could not see my way to the public ownership of this boat without a deal of trouble and vexation happening so that i did not buy it being thoroughly void of money which was too notorious especially after two funerals conducted to everybodys satisfaction big rogues would declare at once judging me by themselves perhaps that i had been and stolen it and likely enough to the back of this they would lay me halfadozen murders and a wholesale piracy now i have by nature the very strongest affection for truth that can be reconciled with a good mans love of reason but sometimes it happens so that we must do violence to ourselves for the sake of our fellowcreatures if these upon occasion offered are only too sure to turn away and reject the truth with a strong disgust surely it is dead against the high and pure duty we owe them to saddle them with such a heavy and deep responsibility and to take still loftier views of the charity and kindness needful towards our fellowbeingswhen they hanker for a thing as they do nearly always for a lie and have set their hearts upon it how selfish it must be and inhuman not to let them have it otherwise like a female in a delicate condition to what extent of injury may we not expose them now sailors have a way of telling great facts of imagination in the most straightforward and simple manner being so convinced themselves that they care not a ropes end who besides is convinced and who is not and to make other people believe the way is not to want them to do it only the man must himself believe and be above all reasoning and i was beginning to believe more and more as i went on and the importance of it grew clearer all about that illfated ship of which i had been thinking ever since the boat came in twelve years ago as nearly as need be and in the height of summernamely on the d of june a large ship called the planters welvard bound from surinam to the port of amsterdam had been lost and swallowed up near this very dangerous place three poor children of the planter whose name was j s jackert on their way home to be educated had floated ashore or at least their bodies and are now in newton churchyard the same must have been the fate of bardie but for the accident of that boat and though she was not a dutchmans child so far as one could guess from her wonderful power of english and no sign of dutch build about her she might very well have been in a dutch ship with her father and mother and little brother and susan in the best cabin it was well known among us that dutch vessels lay generally northward of their true course and from the likeness of the soundings often came up the bristol instead of the english channel and that this mistake which the set of the stream would increase generally proved fatal to them in the absence of any lighthouse that some ship or other had been lost was to my mind out of all dispute although the weather had been so lovely but why it must have been a dutch rather than an english ship and why i need so very plainly have seen the whole of it myself as by this time i began to believe that i had done is almost more than i can tell except that i hoped it might be so as giving me more thorough warrant in the possession of my prize this boat moreover seemed to be of foreign build so far as i could judge of it by moonlight but of that hereafter the wonder is that i could judge of anything at all i think after the long and hard days work for a man not so young as he used to be and rocks are most confusing things to be among for a length of time and away from ones fellowcreatures and nothing substantial on the stomach they do so darken and jag and quiver and hang over heavily as a man wanders under them with never a man to speak to and then the sands have such a way of shaking and of shivering and changing colour beneath the foot and shining in and out with patterns coming all astray to you when to these contrary vagaries you begin to add the loose unprincipled curve of waves and the up and down of light around you and to and fro of seabreezes and startling noise of seafowl and a world of other confusions with roar of the deep confounding themit becomes a bitter point to judge a man of what he saw and what he thinks he must have seen it is beneath me to go on with what might seem excuses enough that i felt myself in the right and what more can any man do if you please however perfect he may be therefore i stowed away my boat well earned both by mind and body snugly enough to defy for the present even the sharp eyes of sandy macraw under newton point where no one ever went but myself some of my fish i put to freshen in a solid mass of bladderweed and some i took home for the morning and a stroke of business after church and if any man in the world deserved a downright piece of good rest that night with weary limbs and soft conscience you will own it was davy llewellyn sunday morning i lay abed with bunny tugging very hard to get me up for breakfast until it was almost eight oclock and my grandchild in a bitter strait of hunger for the things she smelled after satisfying her and scoring at the jolly sailors three fine bass against my shot what did i do but go to church with all my topmost togs on and that not from respect alone for the parson who was a customer nor even that colonel lougher of candleston court might see me and feel inclined to discharge me as an exemplary churchman when next brought up before him these things weighed with me a little it is useless to deny but my main desire was that the parish should see me there and know that i was not abroad on a longshore expedition but was ready to hold up my head on a sunday with the best of them as i always had done at one time while i ate my breakfast i had some idea perhaps that it would be more pious almost and create a stronger belief in me as well as ease my own penitence with more relief of groaning if i were to appear in the chapel of the primitive christians after certain fish were gutted but partly the fear of their singing noise unsuitable to my head that morning after the hollands at skerhouse and partly my sense that after all it was but forecastle work there while the church was quarterdeck and most of all the circumstance that no magistrate ever went there led me on the whole to give the preference to the old concern supported so bravely by royalty accordingly to church i went and did a tidy stroke of business both before and after service in the way of lobsters we made a beautiful dinner that day bunny and i and mother jones who was good enough to join us and after slipping down to see how my boat lay for the tide and finding her as right as could be it came into my head that haply it would be a nice attention as well as ease my mind upon some things that were running in it if only i could pluck up spirit to defy the heat of the day and challenge my own weariness by walking over to skermanor for of course the whole of monday and perhaps of tuesday too and even some part of wednesday with people not too particular must be occupied in selling my great catch of saturday so i resolved to go and see how the little visitor was getting on and to talk with her for though in her weariness and wandering of the night before she did not seem to remember much as was natural at her tender age who could tell what might have come to her memory by this time especially as she was so clever and it might be a somewhat awkward thing if the adventures which i felt really must have befallen her should happen to be contradicted by her own remembrance for all i wanted was the truth and if her truths contradicted mine why mine must be squared off to meet them for great is truth and shall prevail i thought it as well to take bunny with me for children have a remarkable knack of talking to one another which they will not use to grown people also the walk across the sands is an excellent thing for young legs we say being apt to crack the skin a little and so enabling them to grow a strong and hearty child was bunny fit to be rated ab almost as behoved a fine sailors daughter and as proud as you could wish to see and never willing to give in so i promised myself some little sport in watching our bunnys weariness as the sand grew deeper and yet her pride to the last declaring that i should not carry her but here i reckoned quite amiss for the power of the heat was suchbeing the very hottest day i ever knew out of the tropics and the great ridge of sandhills shutting us off from any sight of the waterthat my little grandchild scarcely plodded a mile ere i had to carry her and this was such a heavy job among the deep dry mounds of sand that for a time i repented much of the overcaution which had stopped me from using my beautiful new boat at once to paddle down with the ebb to sker and come home gently afterwards with the flow of the tide towards evening nevertheless as matters proved it was wiser to risk the broiling this heat was not of the sun alone such as we get any summers day and such as we had yesterday but thickened heat from the clouds themselves shedding it down like a burningglass and weltering all over us it was though i scarcely knew it then the summingup and crowning period of whole weeks of heat and drought and indeed of the hottest summer known for at least a generation and in the hollows of yellow sand without a breath of air to stir or a drop of moisture or a firm place for the foot but a red and fiery haze to go through it was all a man could do to keep himself from staggering hence it was close upon three oclock by the place the sun was in when bunny and i came in sight of skerhouse and hoped to find some water there beer of course i would rather have but never was there a chance of that within reach of evan thomas and i tried to think this all the better for half a gallon would not have gone any distance with me after ploughing so long through sand with the heavy weight of bunny upon a day like that only i hoped that my dear little grandchild might find something fit for her and such as to set her up again for never before had i seen her high and strong as her spirit was so overcome by the power and pressure of the air above us she lay in my arms almost as helpless as little bardie three years younger had lain the night before and knowing how children will go off without a mans expecting it i was very uneasy though aware of her constitution so in the heat i chirped and whistled though ready to drop myself almost and coming in sight of the house i tried my best to set her up again finding half of her clothes gone down her back and a great part of her fat legs somehow sinking into her sunday shoes chapter viii children will be children the boys of sker as we always called those rough fellows over at newton were rabbiting in the warren according to their usual practice on a sunday afternoon a loose unseemly lot of lads from fifteen up to twoandtwenty years of age perhaps and very little to choose between them as to work and character all however were known to be firstrate hands at any kind of sporting or of poaching or of any roving pleasure watkin the sixth and youngest boy was of a different nature his brothers always cast him off and treated him with a high contempt yet never could despise him in their rough way they could hardly help a sulky sort of love for him the seventh and last child had been a girla sweet little creature as could be seen and taking after watkin but she had something on her throat from six months up to six years old and when she died some three months back people who had been in the house said that her mother would sooner have lost all the boys put together if you left watkin out of them how that was i cannot say and prefer to avoid those subjects but i know that poor black evan swore no oath worth speaking of for one great market and two small ones but seemed brought down to sit by himself drinking quietly all day long when we came to the ancient hall or kitchen as now they called it for a moment i was vexedexpecting more of a rush perhaps than i was entitled to knowing how much that young child owed me for her preservation and feeling how fond i was of her what did i look for but wild delight at seeing old davy back again however it seems she had taken up with another and forgotten me watkin the youngest boy of sker was an innocent good little fellow about twelve years old at that time bardie had found this out already as quickly as she found out my goodness even by the moonlight she had taken the lead upon watkin and was laying down the law to him upon a question of deep importance about the manner of dancing i could dance a hornpipe with anybody and forward i came to listen no no no i tell a e mustnt do like that yatkin e must go yound and yound like this and e must hold a cothes out same as i does gardy la e must hold a cothes out all the time e must the little atom all the time she delivered these injunctions was holding out her tiny frock in the daintiest manner and tripping sideways here and there and turning round quite upon tiptoe with her childish figure poised and her chin thrown forward and then she would give a good hard jump but all to the tune of the brass jewsharp which the boy was playing for his very life and all the while she was doing this the amount of energy and expression in her face was wonderful you would have thought there was nothing else in all the world that required doing with such zeal and abandonment presently the boy stopped for a moment and she came and took the knee of his trousers and put it to her pretty lips with the most ardent gratitude she must be a foreigner said i to myself no british child could dance like that and talk so and no british child ever shows gratitude as they had not espied us yet where we stood in the passagecorner i drew bunny backward and found her all of a tremble with eagerness to go and help more pay said little missy with a coaxing look more pay yatkin no no you must say more play please watkin see voo pay yatkin i antsmore pay the funny thing laughed at herself while saying it as if with some comic inner sense of her own insatiability in the matter of play but how do you expect me to play the music asked watkin very reasonably if i am to hold my clothes out all the time cant a she replied looking up at him with the deepest disappointment cant a pay and dance too yatkin i thought a could do anything i ants to go to my dear mama and papa and ickle bother here she began to set up a very lamentable cry and watkin in vain tried to comfort her till hearing us she broke from him nares my dear mama nares my dear mama coming she exclaimed as she trotted full speed to the door mama mama here i is and e mustnt scold poor susan it is out of my power to describe how her little flushed countenance fell when she saw only me and bunny she drew back suddenly with the brightness fading out of her eager eyes and the tears that were in them began to roll and her bits of hands went up to her forehead as if she had lost herself and the corners of her mouth came down and then with a sob she turned away and with quivering shoulders hid herself i scarcely knew what to do for the best but our bunny was very good to her even better than could have been hoped although she came of a kindly race without standing upon ceremony as many children would have done up she ran to the motherless stranger and kneeling down on the floor contrived to make her turn and look at her then bunny pulled out her new handkerchief of which she was proud i can tell you being the first she had ever owned made from the soundest corner of mother joness old windowblind and only allowed with a sunday frock and although she had too much respect for this to wet it with anything herself she never for a moment grudged to wipe poor bardies eyes with it nay she even permitted herwhich was much more for a child to doto take it into her own two hands and rub away at her eyes with it gradually she coaxed her out of the cupboard of her refuge and sitting in some posture known to none but women children without a stool to help her she got the little one on her lap and stroked at her and murmured to her as if she had found a favourite doll in the depth of trouble upon the whole i was so pleased that i vowed to myself i would give my bunny the very brightest halfpenny i should earn upon the morrow meanwhile the baby of higher birthas a glance was enough to show herbegan to relax and come down a little both from her dignity and her woe she looked at bunny with a gleam of humour to which her wet eyes gave effect e call that a ponkeyhankerchy does a call that a ponkeyhankerchy bunny was so overpowered by this after all that she had done and at the air of pity wherewith her proud ornament was flung on the floor that she could only look at me as if i had cheated her about it and truly i had seen no need to tell her about mother jones and her blind then these little ones got up having sense of a natural discordance of rank between them and bunny no longer wiped the eyes of bardie nor bardie wept in the arms of bunny they put their little hands behind them and stood apart to think a bit and watched each other shyly to see them move their mouths and fingers and peep from the corners of their eyes was as good as almost any play without a hornpipe in it it made no difference however very soon they came to settle it between them the lowborn bunny looked down upon bardie for being so much smaller and the highborn bardie looked down upon bunny for being so much coarser but neither was able to tell the other at all what her opinion was and so without any further trouble they became very excellent playmates doing my best to make them friends i seized the little stranger and gave her several good tossesup as well as tickles between them and this was more than she could resist being as her nature shows thoroughly fond of any kind of pleasure and amusement she laughed and she flung out her arms and every time she made such jumps as to go up like a feather pretty soon i saw however that this had gone on too long for bunny she put her poor handkerchief out of sight and then some fingers into her mouth and she looked as black as a dog in a kennel but bardie showed goodnature now for she ran up to bunny and took her hand and led her to me and said very nicely give this ickle gal some old davy she havent had no pay at all oh hot boofley buckens oos got jolly jolly keel song grand this admiration of my buttonswhich truly were very handsome being on my regulationcoat and as good as gilt almost with minotaur a kind of grampus as they say done round themthis appreciation of the navy made me more and more perceive what a dear child was come ashore to us and that we ought to look alive to make something out of her if she had any friends remaining and they could scarcely have all been drowned being as she clearly was of a high and therefore rich family it might be worth ten times as much as even my boat had been to me to keep her safe and restore her in a fat state when demanded with that i made up my mind to take her home with me that very night especially as bunny seemed to have set up a wonderful fancy to her but man sees single god sees double as our saying is and her bits of french made me afraid that she might after all be a beggar now go and play like two little dears and remember whose day it is i said to them both for i felt the duty of keeping my grandchild up to the mark on all religious questions and be sure you dont go near the well nor out of sight of the house at all nor pull the tails of the chickens out nor throw stones at the piggywiggy for i knew what bunnys tricks were and now watty my boy come and talk to me and perhaps i will give you a juneating apple from my own tree under the clevice although the heat was tremendous now even inside those threefeet walls the little things did as i bade them and i made the most of this occasion to have a talk with watkin who told me everything he knew his mother had not been down since dinner which they always got anyhow because his father who had been poorly for some days and feverish and forced to lie in bed a little came to the top of the stairs and called requiring some attendance what this meant i knew as well as if i had seen black evan there parched with thirst and with great eyes rolling after helpless drunkenness and roaring with his nightclothes on for a quart of freshdrawn ale but about the shipwrecked child watty knew scarce anything he had found her in his bed that morningmoxy no doubt having been hard pushed with her husband in that state what to do and knowing how kind young watty was she had quartered the baby upon him but watkin though gifted with pretty good english or sassenach as we call it beyond all the rest of his family could not follow the little creature in her manner of talking which indeed as i found thereafter nobody in the parish could do except myself and an englishwoman whose word was not worth taking indeed and indeed then mr llewellyn he went on in english having an evident desire to improve himself by discourse with me i did try and i did try and my mother she try too times and times for sure we tried but no use was the whole of it she only shakes her head and thinks with all her might as you may say and then she says no ise not hot you says ise two years old and ise bardie and my papa he be very angy if e goes on so with me my mama yoves me and i yove her and papa and ickle bother and everybody but not the naughty bad man i doesnt that isnt true english now i dont think is it then mr llewellyn certainly not i answered seeing that my character for good english was at stake and mother say she know well enough the baby must be a foreigner on her dress it is to show it no name as the christians put but marks without any meaning and of clothes so few upon her till mother go to the old cupboard rich people mother do say they must be but dead by this time she make no doubt boy i replied your mother i fear is right in that particular to me it is a subject of anxiety and sorrow and i know perhaps more about it than any one else can pretend to do the boy looked at me with wonder and eagerness about it but i gave him a look as much as to say ask no more at present however he was so full of her that he could not keep from talking we asked who the naughty bad man was but she was afraid at that and went all round the room with her eyes and hid under mothers apron and dreadful she cried at breakfast about her mama and her own spoon to my heart i feel the pain when she does cry i know i do and then of a sudden she is laughing and no reason for it i never did see such a baby before do you think so mr llewellyn chapter ix sandhills turned to sandholes while i was talking thus with the boy and expecting his mother every minute with hope of a little refreshment when the farmer should have dropped off into his usual sunday sleep a very strange thing began more and more to force itself on my attention i have said that the hall of this desolate house was large and long and had six doorwaysnarrow arches of heavy stone without a door to any of them three of these arches were at the west and three at the east end of the room and on the south were two old windows each in a separate gable high up from the floor and dark with stonework and with leadwork and in the calmest weather these would draw the air and make a rattle at the north side of the hall was nothing but dead wall and fireplace and cupboards and the broad oak staircase having used the freedom to light a pipe i sate with my face to the chimneycorner where some woodashes were smouldering after the dinner was done with and sitting thus i became aware of a presence of some sort over my right shoulder at first i thought it was nothing more than the smoke from my own pipe for i puffed rather hard in anxiety about that little darling but seeing surprise and alarm perhaps in watkins face who sate opposite i turned round and there beheld three distinct and several pillars of a brownishyellow light standing over against the doorways of the western end at first i was a little scared and the more so because the rest of the hall was darkening with a pulse of colour gradually vanishing and for an instant i really thought that the ghosts of the wrecked childs father and mother and perhaps her nurse were come to declare the truth about her and challenge me for my hesitation but presently i called to mind how many strange things had befallen me both at sea and on the coast in the way of feeling and vision too designed however by the power that sends them more to forewarn than frighten us and as we get used to them to amuse or edify therefore i plucked my spirit up and approached this odd appearance and found that no part of it was visible upon the spot where it seemed to stand but watkin who was much emboldened by my dauntless carriage called out in welsh that he could see me walking in and out of them like so many haystacks upon this i took yet further courage having a witness so close at hand and nothing seeming to hurt me so what did i do but go outside without any motion of running away but to face the thing to its utmost and watkin keeping along the wall took good care to come after me here i discovered in half a second that i had been wise as well as strong in meeting the matter valiantly for what we had seen was but the glancingor reflection as they call it nowof what was being done outside in a word the thick and stifling heat of the day which had gathered to a head the glaring and blazing power of the last two months of hot summer was just beginning to burst abroad in whirlwind hail and thunder all the upper heaven was covered with a spread of burning yellow all the halfway sky was red as blood with fibres under it and all the sides and margin looked as black as the newtarred bends of a ship but what threw me most astray was that the whole was whirling tossing upward jets of darkness as a juggler flings his balls yet at one time spinning round and at the same time scowling down it is a hurricane said i having seen some in the west indies which began like this watkin knew not much of my meaning but caught hold of my coat and stood and in truth it was enough to make not only a slip of a boy but a veteran sailor stand and fear not a flash of lightning yet broke the expectation of it nor had been a drop of rain but to my surprise and showing how little we know of anything over the high land broke a sandstorm such as they have in africa it had been brewing some time most likely in the kenfig burrows toward the westward and the windward although no wind was astir with us i thought of a dance of waterspouts such as we had twice encountered in the royal navy once i know was after clearing the mouth of the strait of malaccas where the other was i truly forget having had so much to go everywhere but this time the whirling stuff was neither water nor smoke nor cloud but sand as plain as could be it was just like the parsons hourglassonly going up not coming down and quickly instead of slowly and of these funnels spinning around and coming near and nearer there may have been perhaps a dozen or there may have been threescore they differed very much in size according to the breadth of whirlwind and the stuff it fed upon and the hole in the air it bored but all alike had a tawny colour and a manner of bulking upward and a loose uncertain edge often lashing off in frays and between them black clouds galloped and sometimes two fell into one and bodily broke downward then a pile as big as newton rock rose in a moment anyhow hill or valley made no odds sandhill or sandbottom the sand was in the place of the air and the air itself was sand many people have asked me over and over again because such a thing was scarcely known except at the great storm of sand four hundred years ago they sayour people ever so many times assert their privilege to ask me now again especially how many of these pillars there were i wish to tell the truth exactly having no interest in the matterand if i had no other matter would it be to me and after going into my memory deeper than ever i could have expected there would be occasion for all i can say is thislegion was their number because they were all coming down upon me and how could i stop to count them watkin lost his mind a little and asked me with his head gone under my regulationcoat if i thought it was the judgmentday to this question i replied distinctly in the negative as the man of the paper wrote when i said no about poaching and then i cheered young watkin up and told him that nothing more was wanted than to keep a weatherhelm before his wit could answer helm so much as to clear my meaning the storm was on me and broke my pipe and filled my lungs and all my pockets and spoiled every corner of the hat i had bought for my dear wifes funeral i pulled back instantly almost as quickly as boy watkin could and we heard the sand burst over the house with a rattle like shot and a roar like cannon and being well inside the walls we fixed our eyes on one another in the gloom and murkiness as much as we could do for coughing to be sure of something where is bardie gone i asked as soon as my lungs gave speech to me it should have been where is bunny gone but my head was full of the little one who can tell cried the boy in welsh being thoroughly scared of his english oh dyo dear god the great only knows god will guard her i said softly yet without pure faith in it having seen such cruel things but the boys face moved me moreover bardie seemed almost too full of life for quenching and having escaped rocks waves and quicksands surely she would never be wrecked upon dry land ignobly nevertheless at the mere idea of those helpless little ones out in all this raging havoc tears came to my eyes until the sand of which the very house was full crusted up and blinded them it was time to leave off thinking if one meant to do any good the whirlwinds spun and whistled round us now on this side now on that and the old house creaked and rattled as the weather pulled or pushed at it the sand was drifted in the courtyard without any special whirlwind three feet deep in the northeast corner and the sky from all sides fell upon us like a mountain undermined boy go into your mother i said and i thank god for enabling me else might she have been childless tell your mother not to be frightened but to get your father up and to have the kettle boiling oh dyodear dyo let me come with you after that poor little child and after my five brothers go in you helpless fool i said and he saw the set of my countenance and left me though but halfcontent it needed all my strength to draw the door of the house behind me although the wind was bent no more on one way than another but universal uproar and downroar too for it fell on my head quite as much as it jerked my legs and took me aback and took me in front and spun me round and laughed at me then of a sudden all wind dropped and yellow sky was over me what course to take if i had the choice in search of those poor children was more at first than i could judge or bring my mind to bear upon for as sure as we live by the breath of the lord the blast of his anger deadens us perhaps it was my instinct only having been so long afloat which drove me straight as affairs permitted toward the margin of the sea and perhaps i had some desire to know how the sea itself would look under this strange visiting moreover it may have come across me without any thinking twice of it that bunny had an inborn trick of always running toward the sea as behoved a sailors daughter anyhow that way i took so far as it was left to me to know the points of the compass or the shape and manner of anything for simple and short as the right road was no simpleton or shortwitted man could have hit it or come near it in that ravenous weather in the whirl and grim distortion of the air and the very earth a man was walking as you might say in the depth of a perfect calm with stifling heat upon him and a piece of shadow to know himself by and then the next moment there he was in a furious state of buffeting baffled in front and belaboured aback and bellowed at under the swing of his arms and the staggering failure of his poor legs nevertheless in the lull and the slack times i did my utmost to get on having more presence of mind perhaps than any landsman could have owned poor fellows they are when it comes to blow and what could they do in a whirlwind as i began to think of them and my luck in being a seaman my courage improved to that degree that i was able quite heartily to commend myself to the power of god whom as a rule i remember best when the world seems coming to an end and i think it almost certain that this piety on my part enabled me to get on as i did for without any skill at all or bravery of mine but only the calmness which fell upon me as it used to do in the heat of battle when i thought on my maker all at once i saw a way to elude a great deal of the danger this was as simple as could be yet never would have come home to a man unable to keep his wits about him blurred and slurred as the whole sky was with twisted stuff and with yellowness i saw that the whirling pillars of sand not only whirled but also travelled in one spiral only they all came from the west where lay the largest spread of sandhills and they danced away to the northeast first and then away to south of east shaping a round like a ship with her helm up preserving their spiral from left to right as all waterspouts do on the north of the line so when a column of sand came nigh to suck me up or to bury mealthough it went thirty miles an hour and i with the utmost care of my life could not have managed ten perhapsby porting my helm without carrying sail and so working a traverse i kept the weathergage of it and that made all the difference of course i was stung in the face and neck as bad as a thousand musquitoes when the skirts of the whirl flapped round at me but what was that to care about it gave me pleasure to walk in such peril and feel myself almost out of it by virtue of coolness and readiness nevertheless it gave me far greater pleasure i can assure you to feel hard ground beneath my feet and stagger along the solid pebbles of the beach of sker where the sandstorm could not come so much hereupon i do believe that in spite of all my courageso stout and strong in the moment of trialall my power fell away before the sense of safety what could my old battered life matter to any one in the world except myself and bunny however i was so truly thankful to kind providence for preserving it that i cannot have given less than nine jumps and said matthew mark luke and john three times over and in both ways this brought me back to the world again as any power of piety always does when i dwell therein and it drove me thereupon to trust in providence no longer than the time was needful for me to recover breathing when i came to my breath and prudence such a fright at first oppressed me that i made a start for running into the foremost of the waves thinking if i thought at all of lying down there with my head kept up and defying the sand to quench the sea soon however i perceived that this was not advisable such a roar arose around me from the blows of hills and rocks and the fretful eagerness of the sea to be at war again and the deep sound of the distancethe voice of man could travel less than that of a sandpiper and the foot of man might long to be the foot of a sandhopper for the sea was rising fast up the verge of groundswell and a deep hoarse echo rolling down the shoaling of the surges this to me was pleasant music such as makes a man awake the colour of the sun and sky was just as i had once beholden near the pearlgrounds of ceylon where the bottom of the sea comes up with a very mournful noise and the fish sing dirges and no man however clear of eye can open the sea and the sky asunder and by this time being able to look round a littlefor the air was not so full of sand though still very thick and dustyi knew that we were on the brink of a kind of tornado as they call it in the tropicsa storm that very seldom comes into these northern latitudes being raised by violence of heat as i have heard a surveyor say the air going upward rapidly with a great hole left below it now as i stood on watch as it were and being in such a situation longed for more tobacco what came to pass was exactly thisso far as a man can be exact when his wits have long been failing him the heaven opened or rather seemed to be cloven by a swordsweep and a solid mass of lightning fell with a cone like a redhot anvil the ring of black rocks received its weight and leaped like a boiling caldron while the stormy waters rose into a hiss and heap of steam then the crash of heaven stunned me when i came to myself it was raining as if it had never rained before the rage of sand and air was beaten flat beneath the rain and the fretful lifting of the sea was hushed off into bubbles what to do i could not tell in spite of all experience but rubbed the sand from both my eyes as bad as the beard of an oyster and could see no clear way anywhere now the sky was spread and traversed with a net of crossing fires in and out like mesh and needle only without time to look some were yellow some deep red and some like banks of violet and others of a pale sweet blue like gazing through a window they might have been very beautiful and agreeable to consider if they had been further off and without that wicked crack of thunder through the roar worse storms i had seen of course in the hot world and up mountains and perhaps thought little of them but then there was this difference i had always plenty of fellows with me and it was not sunday also i then was young and trained for cannons to be shot at me neither had i a boat of my own but my dear wife was alive these considerations moved me to be careful of my lifea duty which increases on us after the turn of the balance and seeing all things black behind me and a world of storm around knowing every hole as i did with many commendations of myself to god for the sake of bunny in i went into a hole under a good solid rock where i could watch the sea and care for nothing but an earthquake chapter x under the rock for a while the power of the lightning seemed to quench the wind almost and one continuous roar of thunder rang around the darkness then with a bellow the wind sprang forth like a wild bull out of a mountain and shattered the rain and drowned the thunder and was lord of everything under its weight the flat sea quivered and the crests flew into foam and the scourge upon the waters seemed to beat them all together the whirlwinds now were past and done with and a violent gale begun and in the burst and change of movement there appeared a helpless ship she was bearing towards pool tavan as poor bardies boat had done but without the summer glory and the golden wealth of waves all was smooth and soft and gentle as the moonlight in a glass when the little boat came gliding with its baby captain all was rough and hard and furious as a fight of devils when that ship came staggering with its load of sin and woe and yet there had not been so much as twentyfour hours between the two not one of our little coasting vessels but a fullrigged ship she loomed of foreign build although at present carrying no colours i saw at once what her business was to bring from the west indies sugar rum and suchlike freight to bristol or to the dutchmen this was in her clearancebill but behind that she had other import not so clearly entered in a word she carried negroes from the overstocked plantations not to be quite slaves at least in the opinion of their masters but to be distributed for their own christian benefit at a certain sum per head among the bristol or dutch merchants or wherever it might be and it serves them right i always say for the fuss that we now make about those black men must bring down the anger of the creator who made them black upon us as the gale set to its work and the sea arose in earnest and the lightning drifted off into the scud of clouds i saw as plain as a pikestaff that the ship must come ashore and go to pieces very likely before one could say jack robinson she had been on the skerweather sands already and lost her rudder and some of her sternpost as the lift of the water showed and now there was nothing left on board her of courage or common seamanship the truth of it was although of course i could not know it then that nearly all the ships company acted as was to be expected from a lot of foreigners that is to say if such they were they took to the boats in a kind of panic when first she struck among the sands in the whirlwind which began the storm there could have been then no great sea running only quiet rollers and being but two miles off the shore they hoped no doubt to land well enough after leaving the stupid negroes and the helpless passengers to the will of providence however before they had rowed a mile with the floodtide making eastward one of the boats was struck by lightning and the other caught in a whirl vorago as the spaniards call it and not a soul ever came to land and scarcely any bodies both these accidents were seen from porthcawl point by sandy macraw through a telescope and much as he was mine enemy i do him the justice to believe it partly because he could look for no money from any lies in the matter and still more because i have heard that some people said that they saw him see it but to come back to this poor ship the wind though blowing madly enough as a summer gale is often hotter for a while than a winter one had not time and sweep as yet to raise any very big rollers the sea was sometimes beaten flat and then cast up in hillocks but the mighty march of waters fetched by a tempest from the atlantic was not come and would not come in a veering storm like this for it takes a gale of at least three tides such as we never have in summer to deliver the true buffet of the vast atlantic nevertheless the sea was nasty and exceeding vicious and the wind more madly wild perhaps than when it has full time to blow in short the want of depth and power was made up by rage and spite and for a ship not thoroughly sound and stanch in all her timbers it had been better perhaps to rise and fall upon long billows with a chance of casting high and dry than to be twirled round and plucked at thrown on beamends and taken aback as this hapless craft was being in the lash of rocky waters and the drift of gale and scud by this time she was close ashore and not a man except myself to help or even pity her all around her was wind and rocks and a mad sea rushing under her the negroes crouching in the scuppers or clinging to the masts and rails or rolling over one another in their want of pluck and skill seemed to shed their blackness on the snowy spray and curdled foam like cuttlefish in a lump of froth poor things they are grieved to die as much perhaps as any white man and my heart was overcome in spite of all i know of them the ship had no canvas left except some tatters of the foretopsail and a piece of the mainroyals but she drifted broadside on i daresay five or six knots an hour she drew too much water unluckily to come into pool tavan at that time of the tide even if the mouth had been wide enough but crash she went on a ledge of rocks thoroughly well known to me every shelf of which was a razor half a cables length below the entrance to pool tavan it had the finest steps and stairs for congers and for lobsters whenever one could get at it in a low springtide but the worst of beaks and barbs for a vessel to strike upon at halfflow and with a violent sea and a wind as wild as bedlam with the pressure of these she lay so much to leeward before striking and perhaps her cargo had shifted that the poor blackies rolled down the deck like pickling walnuts on a tray and they had not even the chance of dying each in his own direction i was forced to shut my eyes till a grey squall came and caught her up as if she had been a hummingtop and flung her as we drown a kitten into the mashing waters now i hope no man who knows me would ever take me for such a fool as to dream for a momentafter all i have seen of themthat a negro is our own flesh and blood and a brother immortal as the parsons begin to prate under some dark infection they differ from us a great deal more than an ass does from a horse but for all that i was right down gladas a man of lovingkindnessthat such a pelt of rain came up as saved me from the discomfortor pain if you must have the truthof beholding several score no doubt of unfortunate blacks adrowning if it had pleased providence to drown any white men with them and to let me know it beyond a doubt i had rushed in though without so much as a rope to help me and as it was i was ready to do my very best to save them if they had only shown some readiness to be hawled ashore by a man of proper colour but being as negroes always are of a most contrary nature no doubt they preferred to drift out to sea rather than christian burial at any rate none of them came near me kindly disposed as i felt myself and ready to tuck up my sunday trousers at the very first sight of a woolly head but several came ashore next tidewhen it could be no comfort at all to them and such as i have always found is the nature of black people but for me it was a sad and as i thought severe visitation to be forced on a sabbathdaymy only holiday of the weekto meditate over a scene like this as a truly consistent and truthseeking christian especially when i go round with fish on a monday morning among nonconformists it was a bitter trial for me to reflect upon those poor negroes gone without any sense at all except of good christians wickedness to the judgment we decree for all except ourselves and families but there was worse than this behind for after waiting as long as there seemed good chance of anything coming ashore which might go into my pocket without risk of my pension and would truly be mine in all honestyand after seeing that the wreck would not break up till the tide rose higher though all on board were swept awaysuddenly it came into my head about poor bardie and bunny they were worth all the niggers that ever made coal look the colour of pipeclay and with a depth of selfreproach which i never deserved to feel having truly done my utmostfor who could walk in such weatherforth i set resolved to face whatever came out of the heavens verily nothing could come much worse than what was come already rheumatics i mean which had struck me there under the rock as a snake might three hours ago all the world was sweat and now all the air was shivers such is the climate of our parts and many good people rail at it who have not been under discipline but all who have felt that gnawing anguish or that fiery freezing burning at once and benumbing like a dead bone put into the live ones with a train of powder down itall these will have pity for a man who had crouched beneath a rock for at least three hours with dripping clothes at the age of twoandfifty for a hero i never set up to be and never came across one until my old age in the navy as hereafter to be related and though i had served on board of one in my early years off la hague and cape grisnez they told me she was only a woman that used to hold a lantern hero however or no hero in spite of all discouragement and the aching of my bones resolved i was to follow out the fate of those two children there seemed to be faint hope indeed concerning the little stranger but bunny might be all alive and strong as was right and natural for a child of her age and substance but i was sore downcast about it when i looked around and saw the effect of the storm that had been over them for the alteration of everything was nothing less than amazing it is out of my power to tell you how my heart went up to god and all my spirit and soul was lifted into something purer when of a sudden in a scoop of sand with the rushes overhanging i came on those two little dears fast asleep in innocence a perfect nest of peace they had as if beneath their fathers eye and by his own hand made for them the fury of the earth and sky was all around and over them the deep revenge of the sea was rolling not a hundred yards away and here those two little dots were asleep with their angels trying to make them dream bunny being the elder and much the stronger child had thrown the skirt of her frock across poor little bardies naked shoulders while bardie finding it nice and warm had nestled her delicate head into the lap of her young nurse and had tried as it seemed before dropping off to tell her gratitude by pressing bunnys red hands to her lips in a word you might go a long way and scarcely see a prettier or more moving picture or more apt to lead a man who seldom thinks of his maker as for me i became so proud of my own granddaughters goodness and of the little ladys trust and pure repose therein that my heart went back at once to my dead boy harry and i do believe that i must have wept if i could have stopped to look at them but although i was truly loath to spoil this pretty picture the poor things must be partly wet even in that nest of rushes which the whirlwinds had not touched so i awoke them very gently and shook off the sand while they rubbed their eyes and gaped and knew no more of their danger than if they had been in their own dear beds then with bardie in my arms and bunny trotting stoutly with her thumb spliced into my trousers i shaped a course for sker farmhouse having a strong gale still abaft but the weather slightly moderating chapter xi a wrecker wrecked near the gate i met evan thomas the master of the house himself at length astir but still threeparts drunk andif i may say so with due compassion for the trouble then before himin a very awkward state of mind it happened so that the surliness of his liquor and of his nature mingled at this moment with a certain exultation a sense of goodluck and a strong desire to talk and be told again of it and this is the nature of all welshmen directly they have any luck they must begin to brag of it you will find the same in me perhaps or at any rate think you do although i try to exclude it having to deal with englishmen who make nothing of all the great deeds they have done until you begin to agree with them and then my goodness they do come out but the object of my writing is to make them understand us which they never yet have done being unlike somehow in nature although we are much of their fathers having been almost equally among both these nations and speaking english better perhaps than my native tongue of the cymryof which anybody can judge who sees the manner in which i do itit is against my wish to say what evan thomas looked like his dark face overhung with hair and slouched with a night of drinking was beginning to burn up from paleness and from weariness into a fury of plunder scarcely did i know the man although i had so many recollections of evil against him a big strong clumsy fellow at all times far more ready to smite than smile and wholly void of that pleasant humour which among almost all my neighboursthough never yet could i find out whycreates a pleasing eagerness for my humble society as punctual as my pensionday but now his reeling staggering manner of coming along towards us and the hunching of his shoulders and the swagging of his head and most of all the great gun he carried were enough to make good quiet people who had been to church get behind a sandhill however for that it was too late i was bound to face him bardie dropped her eyes under my beard and bunny crept closer behind my leg for my part although the way was narrow and the lift of the storm gave out some light it would have moved no resentment in me if he had seen as rich men do unfit to see a poor man however there was no such luck he carried his loaded gun with its muzzle representing a point of view the very last i could have desirednamely at my midships and he carried it so that i longed to have said a little word about carefulness but i durst not with his coalblack eyes fixed upon me as they were and so i pulled up suddenly for he had given me an imperious nod as good as ordering me to stop wreck ashore he cried out in welsh having scarce a word of englishwreck ashore i smell her dyo dont tell me no lies my boy i smelled her all the afternoon and high time to have one there is a wreck ashore i answered looking with some disgust at him as a man who has been wrecked himself must do at a cruel wrecker but the ebb most likely will draw her off and drift her into the quicksands great god speak not like that my boy the worst you are of everything if those two children came ashore there must have been something better and he peered at the children as if to search for any gold upon them neither child came from that wreck one is my granddaughter bunny bunny show yourself to black evan but the child shrank closer behind me evan black you know her well and the other is a little thing i picked up on the coast last night ha ha you pick up children where you put them i suppose but take them indoors and be done with them cubs to come with a wreck ashore a noble wreck ashore i say but come you down again fisherman dyo he used the word fisherman with a peculiar stress and a glance of suspicion at my pockets come you down again dyo dear i shall want you to help me against those thieves from kenfig bring my other gun from the clockcase and tell the boys to run down with their bandosticks ill warrant well clear the shore between us and then good dyo honest dyo you shall have someyou shall you dog fairplay dyo fair share and share though every stick is mine of right ah dyo dyo you cunning sheeps head you love a keg of rum you dog this i knew to be true enough but only within the bounds of both honesty and sobriety but so much talking had made his brain in its present condition go round again and while i was thinking how far it might be safe and right to come into his views his loaded gun began wagging about in a manner so highly dangerous that for the sake of the two poor children i was obliged to get out of his way and looking back from a safer distance there i beheld him flourishing with his arms on the top of a sandhill and waving his hat on the top of his gun for his sons to come over the warren moxy thomas was very kind she never could help being so and therefore never got any thanks she stripped the two wet children at once and put them in bed together to keep each other warm but first she had them snugly simmering in a milkpan of hot water with a little milk for the sake of their skins bunny was heavy and sleepy therein and did nothing but yawn and stretch out her arms bardie on the other hand was ready to boil over with delight and liveliness flashing about like a little dabchick old davy she said as i came to see her at her own invitation and she sate quite over bunny ill a have a ickle dop with the water up to her neck she put one mite of a transparent finger to my grizzled mouth and popped a large drop in and laughed until i could have worshipped her now having seen these two little dears fast asleep and warmly compassed i began according to evans orders to ask about the boys not having seen any sign of them moxy said that watkin went out to look for his five brothers about an hour after i had left and in spite of the rain and lightning she had tried in vain to stop him something was on his mind it seemed and when she went up to attend on his father he took the opportunity to slip out of the kitchen now moxy having been in the house and the house away from the worst of the storm being moreover a woman and therefore wholly abroad about weather it was natural that she should not have even the least idea of the jeopardy encountered by her five great sons in the warren enough for her that they were not at sea danger from weather upon dry land was out of her comprehension it wanted perhaps half an hour of dusk and had given over raining but was blowing a good reeftopsail gale when i started to search for the sons of sker of course i said nothing to make their mother at all uneasy about them but took from the clockcase the loaded gun as evan had commanded me and set forth upon the track of young watkin better foot foremost for he was likely to know best what part of the warren his five great brothers had chosen for their sport that day and in the wet sand it was easy to follow the course the boy had taken the whirlwinds had ceased before he went forth and the deluge of rain was now soaked in through the drought so long abiding but the wind was wailing pitifully and the rushes swaying wearily and the yellow baldness here and there of higher sandhills caught the light ragged clouds ran over all and streamers of the sunset and the sky was like a school let loose with the joy of wind and rain again it is not much of me that swears when circumstances force me only a piece perhaps of custom and a piece of honesty these two lead one astray sometimes and then comes disappointment for i had let some anger vex me at the rudeness of black evan and the ungodliness of his sons which forced me thus to come abroad when full of wet and weariness in spite of this i was grieved and frightened and angry with no one but myself when i chanced upon boy watkin fallen into a tuft of rushes with his blue eyes running torrents there he lay like a heap of trouble as young folk do ere they learn the world and i put him on his legs three times but he managed to go down again at last i got his knees to stick but even so he turned away and put his head between his hands and could not say a word to me and by the way his shoulders went i knew that he was sobbing i asked him what the matter was and what he was taking so much to heart and not to be too long over a trifle at last i got this out of him oh good mr llewellyn dear i never shall see nothing more of my great brothers five so long as ever i do live and when they kicked me out of bed every sunday morning and spread the basins over me it was not that they meant to harmi do feel it i do feel it and perhaps my knees ran into them under the sands the sands they are and never to kick me again no more of sorrow it is more than ever i can tell watty said i why talk you so your brothers know every crick and corner of this warren miles and miles and could carry a sandhill among them they are snug enough somewhere with their game and perhaps gone to sleep like the little ones of the babies adventures he knew nothing and only stared at me so i asked him what had scared him so under the sands the sands they are so sure as ever i do live or the rabbitbag would not be here and dutch who never never leaves them howling at the rabbitbag looking further through the tussocks i saw that it was even so dutch the mongrel collie crouched beside a bag of something with her tail curled out of sight and her ears laid flat and listless and her jowl along the ground and every now and then she gave a low but very grievous howl now boy dont be a fool i said with the desire to encourage him soon we shall find your brothers five with another great sack of rabbits they left the bitch yonder to watch the sack while they went on for more you see it is the sack the sack it is and no other sack along of them oh mr llewellyn dear here is the bag and there is dutch and never no sign at all of them at this i began to fear indeed that the matter was past helpingthat an accident and a grief had happened worse than the drowning of all the negroes which it has ever pleased providence in a darkness of mood to create for us but my main desire was to get poor watty away at once lest he should encounter things too dreadful for a boy like him go home i said with the bag of rabbits and give poor dutch her supper your father is down on the shore of the sea and no doubt the boys are with him they are gone to meet a great shipwreck worth all the rabbits all the way from dunraven to giants grave but little dutch it is little dutch they never would leave her if wreck there was she can fetch out of the water so good almost as any dog i left him to his own devices being now tired of arguing for by this time it was growing dark and a heavy sea was roaring and the wreck was sure to be breaking up unless she had been swallowed up and the commonsense of our village and parish would go very hard against me for not being on the spot to keep the adjacent parish from stealing for kenfig and newton are full of each other with a fine old ancient hatred so we climbed over the crest of high sand where the rushes lay weltering after the wind and then with a plunge of long strides down hill and plucking our feet out hastily on the watered marge we stood to which the sea was striving among the rocks black evan leaped with white foam rushing under him and sallies of the stormy tide volleying to engulf him strong liquor still was in his brain and made him scorn his danger and thereby saved him from it one timid step and the churning waters would have made a curd of him the fury of his visage showed that somebody had wronged him after whom he rushed with vengeance and his great gun swinging sons of dogs he cried in welsh alighting on the pebbles may the devil feed their fathers with a melting bowl whats the rumpus now i asked what have your sons been doing for he always swore at his sons as freely as at anybodys and at himself for begetting them my sons he cried with a stamp of rage if my sons had been here what man would have dared to do on the top of my head this thing where are they i sent you for them i have sought for them high and low i answered here is the only one i could find watkin what use of watkin a boy like a girl or a baby i want my five tall bullyboys to help their poor fathers livelihood theres little tom tailor gone over the sandhills with a keg of something and teddy shoemaker with a spar and i only shot between them cursed fool what shall i come to not to be able to shoot a man he had fired his gun and was vexed no doubt at wasting a charge so randomly then spying his other gun on my shoulder with the flint and the priming set he laid his heavy hand on it i scarce knew what to do but feared any accident in the struggle and after all he was not so drunk that the law would deny him his own gun ha ha with a pat of the breech he cried for this i owe thee a good turn dyo thou art loaded with rocks my darling as the other was with cowries twenty to the pound of lead for any longshore robbers i see a lot more sneaking down dyo now for sport my boy i saw some people dark in the distance under the brow of a sandhill and before i could speak or think black evan was off to run at them i too set my feet for speed but the strings of my legs hung backward and watty who could run like a hare seemed to lag behind me and behind him there was little dutch crawling with her belly down and her eyes turned up at us as if we were dragging her to be hanged until we heard a shout of people through the roar of wind and sea in front of where black evan strode and making towards it we beheld in glimmering dusk of shore and sky something we knew nothing of a heavy sandhill hung above them with its brow come over and long roots of rushes naked in the shrillness of the wind under this were men at work as we work for lives of men and their sunday shirtsleeves flashed white like ghosts and gone again up to them strode evan black over the marge of the wild march tides and grounded his gun and looked at them they for a breath gazed up at him and seemed to think and wonder and then as though they had not seen him fell again adigging what means this he roared at them with his great eyes flashing fire and his long gun levelled but they neither left their work nor lifted head to answer him the yellow sand came sliding down in wedgeshaped runnels over them and their feet sank out of sight but still they kept on working come away then evan great come away and seek for wreck i shouted while he seemed to stand in heaviness of wonder this is not a place for you come away my man my boy thus i spoke in welsh of course and threw my whole weight on his arm to make him come away with me but he set his feet in sand and spread his legs and looked at me and the strongest man that was ever born could not have torn him from his hold with those eyes upon him dyo i am out of dreaming dyo i must see this wreck only take the gun from me this i would have done right gladly but he changed his mind about it falling back to a savage mood you down there who gave you leave to come and dig my sandhills answer or have skins of lead two or three of the men looked up and wanted to say something but the headman from the mines who understood the whole of them nodded and they held their tongues either they were brave men all which never is without discipline or else the sense of human death confused and overpowered them whatever they meant they went on digging some damned sailor under there cried evan losing patience little mustardspoons of sand cant you throw it faster fine young fellows three of them in the hole their own ship made last march tide it must have been let us see this new batch come they always seem to have spent their wages before they learn to drown themselves he laughed and laid his gun aside and asked me for tobacco and trying to be sober sang the rising of the lark i for my part shrunk away and my flesh crawled over me work away my lads work away you are all of a mind to warm yourselves let me know when you have done and all you find belongs to me i can sit and see it out and make a list of everything earrings gold and foreign pieces and the trinkets they have worn out with them i know them all fools what use of skulking you are on soft stuff i see have out every one of them so they did and laid before him in the order of their birth the carcases of his five sons evan first his eldest born thomas next and rees and hopkin and then with the sigh of death still in him jenkin newly turned fifteen chapter xii how to sell fish what i had seen that night upset me more than i like to dwell upon but with all my fish on hand i was forced to make the best of it for a downhearted man will turn meat as we say and much more fish to a farthingsworth and though my heart was sore and heavy for my ancient sweetheart moxy and for little bardie in the thick of such disasters that could be no excuse to me for wasting good fishor at least pretty goodand losing thoroughly good money here were the mullet with less of shine than i always recommended and honestly wish them to possess here were the prawns with a look of paleness and almost of languishing such as they are bound to avoid until money paid and counted and most of all here were lawful bass of very great size and substance inclined to do themselves more justice in the scales than on the dish i saw that this would never answer to my present high repute concerning questions afterwards and people being hard upon me out of thoughtless ignorance that was none of my affair the whole of that would go of course upon the weather and sudden changes such as never were known before and if good religious people would not so be satisfied with the will of providence to have their fish as fish are made against them i had another reason which never fails to satisfy the burning tide as they called it through which poor bardie first appeared had been heard of far inland and with one consent pronounced to be the result of the devil improperly flipping his tail while bathing although the weather had been so hot this rumour was beyond my belief nevertheless i saw my way if any old customer should happen when it came to his dinnertime to be at all discontented which no man with a fine appetite and a wholesome nose should indulge ini saw my way to sell him more upon the following basketday by saying what good people said and how much i myself had seen of it with these reflections i roused my spirits and resolved to let no good fish be lost though it took all the week to sell them for in spite of the laws laid down in the books for young married women and so forth there is scarcely any other thing upon which both men and women may be led astray so pleasantly as why to buy fish and when to buy fish and what fish to buy therefore i started in good spirits on the monday morning carrying with me news enough to sell three times the weight i bore although it was breaking my back almost good fish it was and deserved all the praise that ever i could bestow on it for keeping so well in such shocking weather and so i sprinkled a little salt in some of the delicate places just to store the flavour there for cooks are so forgetful and always put the blame on me when they fail of producing a fine fresh smell also knowing to my sorrow how suspicious people are and narrowminded to a degree none would give them credit for i was forced to do a thing which always makes me to myself seem almost uncharitable but i felt that i could trust nobody to have proper faith in me especially when they might behold the eyes of the fishes retire a little as they are very apt to do when too many cooks have looked at them and knowing how strong the prejudice of the public is in this respect i felt myself bound to gratify it though at some cost of time and trouble this method i do not mind describing as i am now pretty clear of the trade for the good of my brother fishermen when the eyes of a fish begin to fail him through long retirement from the water you may strengthen his mode of regarding the world and therefore the worlds regard for him by a delicate piece of handling keep a rayfish always readyit does not matter how stale he isand on the same day on which you are going to sell your bass or mullet or cod or whatever it may be pull a few sharp spines as clear as you can out of this good ray then open the mouth of your languid fish and embolden the aspect of either eye by fetching it up from despondency with a skewer of proper length extended from one ball to the other it is almost sure to drop out in the cooking and even if it fails to do so none will be the wiser but take it for a provision of natureas indeed it ought to be now if anybody is rude enough to gainsay your fish in the market you have the evidence of the eyes and hands against that of the nose alone why bless me madam i used to say a lady like you that understands fish a great deal better than i do his eyes are coming out of his head maam to hear you say such things of him afloat he was at four this morning and his eyes will speak to it and so he was well afloat in my tub before i began to prepare him for a last appeal to the public only they must not float too long or the scales will not be stiff enough being up to a few of these things and feeling very keenly how hard the public always tries to get upper hand of me and would beat me down to half nothing a pound if allowed altogether its own way i fought very bravely the whole of that monday to turn a few honest shillings good old davy fine old davy brave old davy they said i was every time i abated a halfpenny and i called them generous gentlemen and christianminded ladies every time they wanted to smell my fish which is not right before payment what right has any man to disparage the property of another when you have bought him he is your own and you have the title to canvas him but when he is put in the scales remember nothing but good of the dead if you remember anything as i sate by the cross roads in bridgend on the bottom of a bucket and with a fourlegged dressingtable hired for twopence in front of me who should come up but the wellknown brother hezekiah truly tired i was getting after plodding through merthyr mawr ogmore and ewenny llaleston and newcastle and driven at last to the town of bridgend for some of my fish had a gamesome odour when first i set off in the morning and although the rain had cooled down the air it was now become an unwise thing to recommend what still remained to any man of unchristian spirit or possessing the ear of the magistrates now perhaps i should not say this thing and many may think me inclined to vaunt and call me an old coxcomb but if any man could sell stinking fish in the times of which i am writingand then it was ten times harder than now because women looked after marketingthat man i verily believe was this old davy llewellyn and right he has to be proud of it but what were left on my hands that evening were beginning to get so strong that i feared they must go over bridgend bridge into the river ogmore the big coach with the london letters which came then almost twice aweek was just gone on after stopping three hours to rest the horses and feed the people and i had done some business with them for london folk for the most part have a kind and pleasing ignorance they paid me well and i served them well with fish of a fine high flavour but now i had some which i would not offer to such kindhearted gentry hezekiah wanted fish i saw it by his nostrils and i knew it for certain when he pretended not to see me or my standing he went a good bit round the corner as if to deal with the ironmonger but for all that i knew as well as if i could hear his wife beginning to rake the fire that fish for supper was the business which had brought him across the bridge therefore i refused an offer which i would have jumped at before seeing hezekiah of twopence apound for the residue from an old woman who sold pickles and i made up my mind to keep up the price knowing the man to have ten in family and all blessed with good appetites what davy brother davy he cried being compelled to begin because i took care not to look at him has it been so ordered that i behold good brother davy with fish upon a monday his object in this was plain enoughto beat down my goods by terror of an information for sabbathlabour the lord has been merciful to me i answered patting my best fish on his shoulder not only in sending them straight to my net at nine oclock this morning but also brother hezekiah in the hunger all people have for them i would that i could have kept thee a taste not soon wouldst thou forget it sweeter fish and finer fish never came out of newton baythis i said because newton bay is famous for high quality but brother hezekiah thou art come too late and i began to pack up very hastily what cried hezekiah with a keen and hungrily grievous voice all those fish bespoken davy every one of them bespoken brother by a man who knows a right down good bass better almost than i do griffy the cat and snuffers now griffith who kept the cat and snuffers was a very jovial man and a bitter enemy to hezekiah perkins and i knew that the latter would gladly offer a penny apound upon griffys back to spoil him of his supper and to make him offend his customers stop brother davy cried hezekiah stretching out his broad fat hands as i began to pack my fish with the freshest smellers uppermost davy dear this is not right nor like our ancient friendship a rogue like griffy to cheat you so what had he beaten you down to davy beaten me down i said all in a hurry is it likely i would be beaten down with their eyes coming out of their heads like that now dear brother dyo do have patience what was he going to give you apound fourpence apound and ten pound of them threeandfourpence for a lot like that ah the times are bad indeed dear brother dyo fourpencehalfpenny threeandnine down for the lot as it stands hezekiah for what do you take me cut a farthing in four when you get it do i look a likely man to be a rogue for fivepence no no davy dont be angry with me say as much as tenpence fourandtwopence ready money and no irish coinage brother hezekiah said i a bargain struck is a bargain kept rob a man of his supper for tenpence oh dyo dyo you never would think of that mans supper with my wife longing for fish so such a family as we have and the weakness in hepzibahs back five shillings for the five davy there there take them along i cried at last with a groan from my chest you are bound to be the ruin of me but what can i do with a delicate lady brother surely you have been a little too hard upon me whatever shall i find to say to a man who never beats me down tell that worldly cat and snuffers that your fish were much too goodwhy davy they seem to smell a little and small use they would be hezekiah either for taste or for nourishment unless they had the seasmell now brother all your money back and the fish to poor griffy if you know not the smell of salt water yet now dont you be so hot old davy the fish are good enough no doubt and it may be from the skewerwood but they have a sort not to say a smell but a manner of reminding one of the savoury stuff they feed on said i and the thorough good use they make of it a fish must eat and so must we and little blame to both of us with that he bade me goodnight and went with alacrity towards his supper scornfully sneering as he passed the door of the cat and snuffers but though it was a fine thing for me and an especial providence to finish off my stock so well at a time when i would have taken gladly a shilling for the lot of it yet i felt that circumstances were against my lingering even if hezekiah unable to enter into the vein of my fish should find himself too fat to hurry down the steep hill after me still there were many other people fit for supper and fresh for it from the sudden coolness whom it was my duty now to preserve from mischief by leaving proper interval for consideration before i might happen to be in front of their dining room windows another day therefore with a grateful sense of goodwill to all customers i thought it better to be off there i had been for several hours ready to prove anything but never challenged by anybody and my spirit had grown accordingly but i never yet have found it wise to overlie success win it and look at it and be off is the quickest way to get some more so i scarcely even called so much as a pint at the cat and snuffers to have a laugh with griffy but set off for newton along the old road with a good smart heel and a fine days business and a light heart inside of me when i had passed redhill and tythegston and clearly was out upon newton down where the glowworms are most soft and sweet it came upon me in looking up from the glowworms to the stars of heaven to think and balance how far i was right in cheating hezekiah it had been done with the strictest justice because his entire purpose was purely to cheat me whereupon providence had stepped in and seen that i was the better man i was not so ungratefullet nobody suppose itas to repine at this result so far from that that i rattled my money and had a good laugh and went on again but being used to watch the stars as an old sailor is bound to do i thought that orion ought to be up and i could not see orion this struck me as an unkindly thing although when i thought of it next day i found that orion was quite right and perhaps the beer a little strong which had led me to look out for him anyhow it threw me back to think of hezekiah and make the worst of him to myself for having had the best of him everybody may be sure that i never would have gone out of the way to describe my traffic with that man unless there were good reason nay but i wanted to show you exactly the cast and the colour of man he was by setting forth his low attempt to get my fish for nothing there was no man of course in my native village and very few in bridgend perhaps to whom i would have sold those fish unless they were going to sell it again but hezekiah perkins a member and leading elder of the nicodemuschristians was so hard a man to cheatexcept by stirring of his galland so keen a cheat himself so proud moreover of his wit and praying and truly brotherlythat to lead him astray was the very first thing desired by a sound churchman by trade and calling he had beenbefore he received his special callno more than a common blacksmith now a blacksmith is a most useful man full of news and full of jokes and very often by no means drunk this however was not enough to satisfy hezekiah having parts as he always told usand sometimes we wished that he had no wholecultivated parts moreover and taken up by the gentry nothing of a lower order came up to his merits than to call himself as follows horologist gunsmith practical turner working goldsmith and jeweller maker of all machinery and engineman to the king and queen the first time he put this over his door all the neighbours laughed at him knowing in spite of the book he had got full of figures and shapes and crossings which he called threegunometry that his education was scarcely up to the rule of three without any guns nevertheless he got on well having sense enough to guide him when to talk large in the presence of people who love large talk as beyond them and when to sing small and hold his tongue and nod at the proper distances if ever his business led him among gentry of any sense or science such as we sometimes hear of hence it was that he got the order to keep the churchclock of bridgend agoing by setting the hands on twice aday and giving a push to the pendulum and so long as the clock would only go nobody in the town cared a tick whether it kept right time or wrong and if people from the country durst say anything about it it was always enough to ask them what their own clocks had to say there were not then many stableclocks such as are growing upon us now so that every horse has his own dinnerbell only for all those that were hezekiah received i daresay from five to ten shillings amonth apiece in order to keep them moving but bless my heart he knew less of a clock than i old davy llewellyn and once on a time i asked him when he talked too much of his ometriesas a sailor might do in his simplenessi asked him to take an observation as i had seen a good deal of it but all he did was to make a very profane and unpleasant one as for this mans outward looks he was nothing at all particular but usually with dirt about him and a sense of oiliness why he must needs set up for a saint the father of evil alone may tell but they said that the clock that paid him best being the worst in the neighbourhood belonged to a nicodemuschristian with a great cuckoo over it having never seen it i cannot say and the town is so full of gossip that i throw myself down on my back and listen being wholly unable to vie with them in depth or in compass of storytelling even when fish are a week on my hands chapter xiii the coroner and the coronet an officer of high repute had lately been set over us to hold account of the mischief and to follow evidence and make the best he could of it when anybody chose to die without giving proper notice he called himself coroner of the king and all the doctors such as they were made it a point that he must come whenever there was a dead man or woman who had died without their help now all about the storm of sand and all about the shipwreck was known in every part of the parish before the church clock had contrived in gratitude to hezekiah to strike the noon of monday every child that went to the well knew the truth of everything and every woman of newton and nottage had formed from the men her own opinion and was ready to stand thereby and defy all the other women nevertheless some busy doctor who had better been in the stocks took it for a public duty to send notice and demand for the coroner to sit upon us the wrath of the parish now just beginning to find some wreck that would pay for the ropes was so honest and so grave that the little doctor was compelled to run and leave his furniture and so it always ought to be with people who are meddlesome it came to my knowledge that this must happen and that i was bound to help in it somewhere about middleday of tuesday at a time when i was not quite as well as i find myself when i have no money for being pleased with my luck perhaps and not content quite to smoke in the dark and a little dry after the glowworms it happened i will not pretend to say how that i dropped into the jolly sailors to know what the people could be about making such a great noise as they were and keeping a quiet man out of his bed there i smelled a new tobacco directly i was in the room and somebody pleased with my perception gave me several pipes of it with a thimblefulas i became more and more agreeableof a sort of rumandwater and confining myself as my principle is to what the public treat me to it is not quite out of the question that i may have been too generous and truly full i was of grief upon the following morning that somebody had made me promise in a bubbling moment to be there again and bring my fiddle on the tuesday night now since the death of my dear wife who never put up with my fiddle except when i was courting her it had seemed to my feelings to be almost a levity to go fiddling also i knew what everybody would begin to say of me but the landlord foreseeing a large attendance after the coroners inquest would not for a moment hear of any breach of my fiddle pledge half of newton and perhaps all nottage went to sker the following day to see the coroner and to give him the benefit of their opinions and another piece of luck there was to tempt them in that direction for the ship which had been wrecked and had disappeared for a certain time in a most atrocious manner was rolled about so by the tide and a shift of the wind on monday that a precious large piece of her stern was in sight from the shore on tuesday morning it lay not more than a cables length from lowwater mark and was heaved up so that we could see as far as the starboard mizzenchains part of the taffrail was carried away and the carving gone entirely but the transom and transomknees stood firm and of the ships name done in gold i could make out in large letters ta lucia and underneath in a curve and in smaller letters ador of course no one except myself could make head or tail of this but after thinking a little while i was pretty sure of the meaning of itnamely that the craft was portuguese called the santa lucia and trading from san salvador the capital of brazils and in this opinion i was confirmed by observing through my spyglass copper boltheads of a pattern such as i had seen at lisbon but never in any british ship however i resolved for the present to keep my opinion to myself unless it were demanded upon good authority for it made me feel confused in mind and perhaps a little uneasy when being struck by some resemblance i pulled from the lining of my hat a leaf of a book upon which i copied all that could be made out of the letters each side of the tiller of my new boat and now i found them to be theseuc from the starboard side just where they would have stood in luciaand dor from the further end of the line just as in san salvador the sands were all alive with people and the rocks and every place where anything good might have drifted for evan thomas could scarcely come at a time of such affliction to assert his claims of wreck and to belabour right and left therefore for a mile or more from where the land begins to dip and the old stone wall like a jagged cord divides our parish from kenfig hundreds of figures might be seen running along the grey wet sands and reflected by their brightness the day was going for two of the clock and the tide growing near to the turn of ebb and the landsprings oozing down from the beach spread the whole of the flat sands so with a silver overlaying that without keen sight it was hard to tell where the shore ended and sea began and a great part of this space was sprinkled with naked feet going patteringboys and girls and young women and men who had left their shoes up high on the rocks to have better chance in the racing now it is not for me to say that all or half of these good people were so brisk because they expected any fine thing for themselves i would not even describe them as waiting in readiness for the force of fortune by the sea administered i believe that all were most desirous of doing good if possible in the first case to the poor people drowned but if too late then to console any disconsolate relations failing of which it would be hard if anybody should blame them for picking up something for themselves what you here mother probyn i cried coming upon a most pious old woman who led the groaning at zoar chapel and being for the moment struck out of all my manners by sight of her indeed and so i am old davy she answered without abashment and almost too busy to notice me the lord may bless my poor endeavours to rescue them poor injuns but i cant get on without a rake if i had only had the sense to bring my gardenrake there are so many little things scarcely as big as cockleshells and the waves do drag them away from me oh there and there goes another gwenny if i dont smack you all these people and all their doings i left with a sort of contempt perhaps such as breaks out on me now and then at any very great littleness and i knew that nothing worth wet of the knees could be found with the ebbtide running and ere the hold of the ship broke up so i went toward the great house whose sorrows and whose desolation they took little heed of and nothing made me feel more sadstrange as it may seem and wasthan to think of poor black evan thus unable to stand up and fight for his unrighteous rights in the great hall were six bodies five of strong young men laid quiet each in his several coffin and the other of a little child in a simple dress of white stretched upon a piece of board death i have seen in all his manners since i was a cabinboy and i took my hat off to the bodies as i had seen them do abroad but when i saw the small dead child a thrill and pang of cold went through me i made sure of nothing else except that it was dear bardie that little darling whom i loved for her gifts direct from god and her ways so out of the way to all other childrenit struck my heart with a power of death that here this lively soul was dead when a man makes a fool of himself anybody may laugh at him and this does him good perhaps and hardens him against more trouble but bad as i am and sharp as i am in other peoples opinion and proud sometimes to think of it i could not help a good gulp of a tear over what i believed to be the body of poor little bardie for that child had such nice ways and took such upper hand of me that expecting to find a captain always especially among women old davy i ants a old davy hen is a coming by the unionjack it was as good as a dozen kegs of rum to me there was no mistaking the sweetest and clearest voice ever heard outside of a flute and presently began pitpat of the prettiest feet ever put in a shoe down the great oak staircase she held on by the rails and showed no fear at all about it though the least slip might have killed her then she saw the sad black sight after she turned the corner and wondered at the meaning of it and her little heart stood still as she turned to me in awe and held out both hands quivering i caught her up and spread my grey beard over her young frightened eyes and took her out of sight of all those cold and very dreadful things i had never been up the stairs before in that dark and ancient house and the length and the width and the dreariness and the creaking noises frightened me not so much for my own sake being never required to sleep there but for the tender little creature full already of timid fancies who must spend the dark nights there and now the house left empty of its noise and strength and boastfulness had only five more ghosts to wander silent through the silent places and this they began the very night after their bodies were in the churchyard the coroner came on an old white pony nearly four hours after the time for which his clerk had ordered us being used for my part to royal discipline and everything done to the minute fixed with the captains voice like the crack of a gun i was vexed and surprised but expected him to give us some reason good or bad instead of that he roared out to us with his feet still in both stirrups is there none of you taffies with manners enough to come and hold a gentlemans horse here you davy jones you are long enough and lazy enough put your hand to the bridle will you this was to me who was standing by in the very height of innocence having never yet seen any man appointed to sit upon dead bodies and desiring to know how he could help them i did for his honour all i could although his manner of speech was not in any way to my liking but my rule has always been that of the royal navy than which there is no wiser if my equal insults me i knock him down if my officer does it i knock under meanwhile our people were muttering sassenach sassenach and from their faces it was plain that they did not like an englishman to sit upon cymric bodies however it was the old old thing the welsh must do all the real work and the english be paid for sitting upon them after they are dead i never sate on a black man yet and i wont sit on a black man now the coroner said when he was sure about oats enough for his pony ill not disgrace his majestys writ by sitting upon damned niggers glory be to god your honour stradling williams cried who had come as head of the jury clerk he was of newton church and could get no fees unless upon a christian burial we thought your honour would hardly put so great a disgrace upon us but we knew not how the law lay the law requires no christian man pronounced the crowner that all might hear to touch pitch and defile himself both in body and soul master clerk to lower and defile himself hereupon a high hard screech which is all we have in wales for the brave hurrah of englishmen showed that all the jury were of one accord with the coroner and i was told by somebody that all had shaken hands and sworn to strike work rather than put up with misery of conscience but your honour said mr lewis bailiff to colonel lougher if we hold no quest on the black men how shall we certify anything about this terrible shipwreck the wreck is no concern of mine answered the crowner crustily it is not my place to sit upon planks but upon christian bodies do you attend to your own business and leave mine to me sir the bailiff being a nice quiet man thought it best to say no more but some of the people who were thronging from every direction to see his honour told him about the little white baby found among the bladderweed he listened to this and then he said show me this little white infant discovered among the black men my business here is not with infants but with five young smothered men however if there be an infant of another accident and of christian colour i will take it as a separate case and damn the county in the fees we assured his lordship as every one now began to call him in virtue of his swearing so which no doubt was right in a man empowered to make other people swear we did our best at any rate to convince the crowner that over and above all black men there verily was a little child and for all one could tell a christian child entitled to the churchyard and good enough for him to sit on and so he entered the house to see it but if he had sworn a little before and more than i durst set down for him he certainly swore a great deal now and poured upon us a bitter heat of english indignation all of the jury were taken aback and i as a witness felt most uneasy until we came to understand that his honours wrath was justly kindled on account of some marks on the babys clothes a coronet he cried stamping about a coronet on my young lords pinafore and you stupid oafs never told me nobody knew except myself who had sailed with an earl for a captain what the meaning of this thing was and when the clerk of the church was asked rather than own his ignorance he said it was part of the arms of the crown and the crowner was bound like a seal by it this explanation satisfied all the people of the parish except a few fargoing baptists with whom it was a point of faith always to cavil and sneer at every wind of doctrine as they always called itthe scent of which could be traced anyhow to either the parson or the clerk or even the gravedigger but i was content to look on and say nothing having fish to sell at least twice aweek and finding all customers orthodox until they utter bad shillings chapter xiv in accordance with the evidence there is no need for me to follow all the crowners doings or all that the juries thought and said which was different altogether from what they meant to think and say and he found himself bound to have two of them with first right of inquest to the baby because of the stamp on his pinafore and here i was foreman of the jury with fifteenpence for my services and would gladly have served on the other jury after walking all that way but was disabled for doing so and only got ninepence for testimony with that however i need not meddle as every one knows all about it only to make clear all that happened and indeed to clear myself i am forced to put before you all that we did about that baby as fully and emphatically as the state of our doings upon that occasion permitted me to remember it for the coroner sate at the head of the table in the great parlour of the house and the dead child came in on his board and we all regarded him carefully especially heeding his coronet mark and then set him by the window a fine young boy enough to look at about the age of our bardie and might have been her twinbrother as everybody vowed he was only his face was bolder and stronger and his nose quite different and altogether a brave young chap instead of funny and delicate all this however might well have come from knocking about in the sea so much i would have given a good halfcrown to have bitten off my foolish tongue when one of the jurymen stood up and began to address the coroner he spoke unluckily very good english and his honour was glad to pay heed to him and the clerk put down nearly all he said word for word as might be this meddlesome fellow being no less than brother hezekiahs self nodded to me for leave to speak which i could not deny him and his honour lost no time whatever to put his mouth into his rummer of punch as now provided for all of us and to bow whenever his mouth was empty to that hezekiah for the man had won some reputation or rather had made it for himself by perpetual talking as if he were skilled in the history and antiquities of the neighbourhood of these he made so rare a patchwork heads and tails prose verse and proverbs histories and his stories that as i heard from a man of real teaching and learning who met him once and kept out of his way ever after any one trusting him might sit down in the chair of canute at king arthurs table not that i or any of my neighbours would be the worse for doing that only the thought of it frightened us and made us unwilling to hearken him much however if there was any matter on which hezekiah deserved to be heard no doubt it was this upon which he was now delivering his opinionsto wit the great inroad or invasion of the sand for miles along our coast of which there are very strange things to tell and of which he had made an especial study having a field at candleston with a shed upon it and a rick of hay all which disappeared in a single night and none was ever seen afterwards it was the only field he had being left to him by his grandmother and many people were disappointed that he had not slept with his cow that night this directed his attention to the serious consideration as he always told us at first start being a lover of threedecked words of the most important contemplation which could occupy the attention of any cambrian landowner show your land cried a wag of a tailor with none to cross his legs upon but we put him down and pegged him down till his manners should be of the patternbook hezekiah went on to tell in words too long to answer the helm of such a plain sailor as i am how the sweep of hundreds of miles of sand had come up from the west and southwest in only two hundred and fifty years how it had first begun to flow about the scilly islands as mentioned by one borlase and came to the mouth of hayle river in cornwall in the early years of king henry viii and after that blocked up bude haven and swallowed the ploughs in the arable land then at llanant it came like a cloud over the moon one winter night and buried fiveandthirty houses with the people in them an act of parliament was passedchapter the second of philip and maryto keep it out of glamorganshire and good commissioners were appointed and a survey made along the coast especially of kenfig nevertheless the dash of sand was scarcely on their ink when swarming driving darkening the air the storm swept on their survey at the mouths of the tawey and afan rivers the two sailors chapels were buried and then it swept up the great roman road a branch of the julian way and smothered the pillars of gordian and swallowed the castle of kenfig which stood by the side of the western road and still rushing eastward took newton village and newton old church beneath it and so it went on for two hundred years coming up from the sea no doubt carried by the perpetual gales which always are from the south and westfilling all the hollow places changing all bright mossy pools into hills of yellow drought and like a great encampment dwelling over miles and leagues of land and like a camp it was in this that it was always striking tent six times in the last few years had the highest peak of sandthe generals tent it might be calledbeen shifted miles away perhaps and then come back towards ogmore and it was only the other day that through some shift or swirl of wind a windmill with its sails entire had been laid bare near candleston of which the last record was in courtrolls of a hundred and fifty years agonea now all this though hezekiah said it was true enough i do believe having heard things much to the same purpose from my own old grandfather the coroner listened with more patience than we had given him credit for although he told us that brother perkins should have reserved his learned speech for the second inquiry which was to be about the deaths of the five young men for to him it appeared that this noble infant must lay the blame of his grievous loss not on the sand but upon the sea hezekiah replied with great deference that the cause in both cases was the same for that the movement of sand went on under the sea even more than ashore and hence the fatal gulfing of that ship the andalusia and the loss of his young lordship the name he had given the ship surprised me and indeed i felt sure that it was quite wrong and so i said immediately without any low consideration of what might be mine own interest but the coroner would not hearken to me being much impressed now with the learning and wisdom of hezekiah perkins and when hezekiah presented his card beginning with horologist and ending with the king and queen he might have had any verdict he liked if he himself had been upon trial therefore after calling in for the sake of form the two poor women who found the dead baby among the seaweed and had sevenpence apiece for doing so and who cried all the while that they talked in welsh each having seen a dear baby like him not more than twenty years ago we came in the most unanimous manner under his lordships guidance to the following excellent verdict found drowned on pool tavan rocks a manchild supposed to be two years old believed to be a young nobleman from marks on pinafore and high bearing but cast away by a storm of sand from the ship andalusia of appledore now i was as certain as sure could be that half of this verdict must be wrong especially as to the name of the ship and her belonging to appledore which never yet owned any craft of more than tons at the utmosta snow or a brig at the very outside nevertheless i was compelled to give in to the rest of them and most of all to the coroner only i said as many who are still alive can remember and are not afraid to speak to and especially my good friend mr lewis the ship was not called the andalusia the ship was never from appledore neither was she of british build as an old seaman it is likely that i know more of the build of a ship than a lubber of a clockmaker or rather a clockmauler but here i was put down sternly and hearing of verdicts a great deal worse without any mischief come of them i was even content to sign the return and have a new pipe of birdseye and a birdseye view this gave me of them at the second inquest wherein i had to give evidence and was not of the jury they wanted to crossexamine me because i had been unpleasant but of that they got the worst and dropped it but as all our jurymen declared upon their oaths that the little nobleman was drowned in a storm of sand so they found that the five young rabbiters came to their end of smothering through a violent seatempest in the days of my youth such judgments perhaps would have tried my patience but now i knew that nothing ever follows truth and justice people talk of both these things and perhaps the idea does them good be that according to gods willas we always say when deprived of our ownat any rate i am bound to tell one little thing more about each quest and first about the first one why was i so vexed and angry with my foolish tongue when hezekiah began to speak only because i knew full well that it would lead to the very thing which it was my one desire to avoid if possible and thisas you may guess at once after what happened on the stairswas the rude fetching and exposing of the dear little maid among so many common fellows and to show her the babycorpse i feared that it must come to this through my own thoughtless blabbing about her ickle bother in the presence of hezekiah and if ever man had a hollow dry heart from overpumping of the tongue i had it when hezekiah came in bearing in a depth of fright and wonder and contempt of him my own delicate bardie i had set my back against the door and sworn that they should not have her but crafty perkins had stolen out by another door while they humoured me now my pretty dear was awed and hushed beyond all crying and even could not move her feet as children do in a kicking way trying to get as far as possible from hezekiahs nasty facewhich gave me a great deal of pleasure because she had never done the like to me unless i were full of tobaccoshe stretched away from his greasy shoulder and then she saw old davy her hands came toward me and so did her eyes and so did her lips with great promise of kisses such as her father and mother perhaps might have been mightily tempted by but nobody now to care for them when hezekiah pretending to dandle this little lady in a jaunty way like one of his filthy low children was taking her towards that poor little corpse so white in the light of the window and when he made her look at it and said is that ickle bother my dear and she all the time was shivering and turning her eyes away from it and seeking for me to help her i got rid of the two men who held me nor hearkened i the coroner but gave hezekiah such a grip as he felt for three months afterwards and with bardie on my left arm kept my right fist ready nobody cared to encounter this for i had happened to tell the neighbourhood how the frenchmans head came off at the time when he tried to injure me and so i bore off the little one till her chest began to pant and her tears ran down my beard and then as i spoke softly to her and began to raise her fingers and to tickle her frizzy hair all of a sudden she flung both arms around my neck and loved me old davy poor ickle bardie not go to e back pithole yet no my dear not for ever so long not for eighty years at least and then go straight to heaven ickle bother go to e back pithole does a think old davy this was more than i could tell though inclined to think it very likely however before i could answer some of the jury followed us and behind them the coroner himself they insisted on putting a question to her and so long as they did not force her again to look at that which terrified her i had no right to prevent them they all desired to speak at once but the clerk of the coroner took the lead having as yet performed no work toward the earning of his salt or rum an innocent old man he was but very free from cleanliness and the child being most particular of all ever born in that matter turned away with her mite of a nose in a manner indescribable he was much too dull to notice this but putting back his spectacles and stooping over her hair and ears which was all she left outside my beard he wanted to show his skill in babies of which he boasted himself a grandfather and so he began to whisper my little dear you will be a good childa very good child wont you now i can see it in your little face such a pretty dear you are and all good children always do as they are told you know we want you to tell us a little thing about pretty little brother i have got a little girl at home not so old as you are and she is so clever you cant think everything she does and says everything we tell her take ayay e nasty old man take ayay e bad old man or i never tis a again old davy she flashed up at me with such wrath that i was forced to obey her while the old man put down his goggles to stare and all the jury laughed at him and i was running away with her for her little breath was hot and short when the coroner called out stop man i know how to manage her at this i was bound to pull up and set her to look at him as he ordered me she sate well up in my arms and looked and seemed not to think very highly of him look at his honour my dear said i stroking her hair as i knew she liked look at his lordship you pretty duck little child began his honour you have a duty to perform even at this early period of your very beginning life we are most desirous to spare your feelings having strong reasons to believe that you are sprung from a noble family but in our duty towards your lineage we must require you my little dearwe must request you my little ladyto assist us in our endeavour to identify i can say dentify old davy tell e silly old man to say dentify same as i does she spread her little open hand with such contempt at the coroner that even his own clerk could not keep his countenance from laughing and his honour having good reason to think her a baby of high position before was now so certain that he said god bless her what a child she is take her away old mariner she is used to high society chapter xv a verdict on the jury as to the second inquest i promised as you may remember to tell something also but in serious truth if i saw a chance to escape it without skulking watch i would liefer be anywhere else almostexcept in a french prison after recording with much satisfaction our verdict upon bardies brotherwhich nearly all of us were certain that the little boy must bethe coroner bade his second jury to view the bodies of the five young men these were in the great dark hall set as in a place of honour and poor young watkin left to mind them and very pale and ill he looked if you please sir they are all stretched out and i am not afraid of them he said to me as i went to console him father cannot look at them but mother and i are not afraid they are placed according to their ages face after face and foot after foot and i am sure they never meant it sir when they used to kick me out of bed and oftentimes i deserved it i thought much less of those five great corpses than of the gentle and loving boy who had girt up his heart to conquer fear and who tried to think evil of himself for the comforting of his brethrens souls but he nearly broke down when the jurymen came and i begged them to spare him the pain and trial of going before the coroner to identify the bodies which i could do as well as any one and to this they all agreed when we returned to the long oak parlour we found that the dignity of the house was maintained in a way which astonished us there had been some little refreshment before especially for his honour but now all these things were cleared away and the table was spread with a noble sight of glasses and bottles and silver implements fit for the mess of an admiral neither were these meant for show alone inasmuch as to make them useful there was water cold and water hot also lemons and sugar and nutmeg and a great black george of ale a row of pipes and a jar of tobacco also a middling keg of hollands and an anker of old rum at first we could hardly believe our eyes knowing how poor and desolate both of food and furniture that old grange had always been but presently one of us happened to guess and hezekiah confirmed it that the lord of the manor had taken compassion upon his afflicted tenant and had furnished these things in a handsome manner from his own great house some five miles distant but in spite of the custom of the country i was for keeping away from it all upon so sad an occasion and one or two more were for holding aloof although they cast sheepseyes at it however the crowner rubbed his hands and sate down at the top of the table and then the foreman sate down also and said that being so much upset he was half inclined to take a glass of something weak he was recommended if he felt like that whatever he did not to take it weak but to think of his wife and family for who could say what such a turn might lead to if neglected and this reflection had such weight that instead of mixing for himself he allowed a friend to mix for him the crowner said now gentlemen in the presence of such fearful trouble and heavy blows from providence no man has any right to give the rein to his own feelings it is his duty as a man to control his sad emotions and his duty as a familyman to attend to his constitution with these words he lit a pipe and poured himself a glass of hollands looking sadly upward so that the measure quite escaped him gentlemen of the jury he continued with such authority that the jury were almost ready to think that they must have begun to be gentlementill they looked at one another gentlemen of the jury life is short and trouble long i have sate upon hundreds of poor people who destroyed themselves by nothing else than want of selfpreservation i have made it my duty officially to discourage such shortcomings mr foreman be good enough to send the lemons this way and when ready for business say so crowner bowles was now as pleasant as he had been grumpy in the morning and finding him so we did our best to keep him in that humour neither was it long before he expressed himself in terms which were an honour alike to his heart and head for he told us in so many wordsthough i was not of the jury now nevertheless i held on to them and having been foreman just now could not be for a matter of form when it came to glasses coldshoulderedworthy crowner bowles i say before he had stirred many slices of lemon told us all in so many wordsand the more the more we were pleased with themthat for a thoroughly honest intelligent and hardworking jury commend him henceforth and as long as he held his majestys signmanual to a jury made of newton parish and of kenfig burgesses we drank his health with bumpers round every man upon his legs and then three cheers for his lordship until his clerk who was rather sober put his thumb up and said stop and from the way he went on jerking with his narrow shoulders we saw that he would recall our thoughts to the hall that had no door to it then following his looks we saw the distance of the silence this took us all aback so much that we had in the witnessesof whom i the head man was there alreadyand for fear of their being nervous and so confusing testimony gave them a cordial after swearing everybody knew exactly what each one of them had to say but it would have been very hard and might have done them an injury not to let them say it the coroner having found no need to charge except his rummer left his men for a little while to deliberate their verdict visitation of god of course it must be stradling williams began to say visitation of almighty god some of the jury took the pipes out of their mouths and nodded at him while they blew a ring of smoke and others nodded without that trouble and all seemed going pleasantly when suddenly a little fellow whose name was simon edwards a brother of the primitive christians or at least of their minister being made pugnacious by ardent spirits rose and holding the arm of his chair thus delivered his sentiments speaking of course in his native tongue headman and brothers of the jury iii do altogether refuse and deny the goodness of that judgment the only judgment i will certify is in the lining of my hatjudgment of almighty god for rabbiting on the sabbathday hezekiah perkins i call upon thee as a brother christian and a consistent member to stand on the side of the lord with me his power of standing on any side was by this time however exhausted and falling into his chair he turned pale and shrunk to the very back of it for over against him stood evan thomas whom none of us had seen till then it was a sight that sobered us and made the blood fly from our cheeks and forced us to set down the glass the face of black evan was ashy grey and his heavy square shoulders slouching forward and his hands hung by his side only his deep eyes shone without moving and simon backed further and further away without any power to gaze elsewhere then evan thomas turned from him without any word or so much as a sigh and looked at us all and no man had power to meet the cold quietness of his regard and not having thought much about his troubles we had nothing at all to say to him after waiting for us to begin and finding no one ready he spake a few words to us all in welsh and the tone of his voice seemed different noble gentlemen i am proud that my poor hospitality pleases you make the most of the time god gives for six of you have seen the white horse with these words he bowed his head and left us shuddering in the midst of all the heat of cordials for it is known that men when prostrate by a crushing act of god have the power to foresee the death of other men that feel no pity for them and to see the white horse on the night of new moon even through closed eyelids and without sense of vision is the surest sign of all sure signs of death within the twelvemonth therefore all the jury sate glowering at one another each man ready to make oath that evans eyes were not on him now there are things beyond our knowledge or right of explanation in which i have a pure true faithfor instance the flying dutchman whom i had twice beheld already and whom no man may three times see and then survive the twelvemonth in him of course i had true faithfor what can be clearer than eyesight many things too which brave seamen have beheld and can declare but as for landsmens superstitions i scarcely cared to laugh at them however strange enough it is all black evan said came true simon edwards first went off by falling into newton wayn after keeping it up too late at chapel and after him the other five all within the twelvemonth some in their beds and some abroad but all gone to their last account and heartily glad i was for my part as one after other they dropped off thus not to have served on that second jury and heartily sorry i was also that brother hezekiah had not taken the luck to behold the white horse plain enough it will be now to any one who knows our parts that after what evan thomas said and the way in which he withdrew from us the only desire the jury had was to gratify him with their verdict and to hasten home ere the dark should fall and no man to walk by himself on the road accordingly without more tobacco though some took another glass for strength they returned the following verdict we find that these five young and excellent menhere came their names with a mister to eachwere lost on their way to a place of worship by means of a violent storm of the sea and the jury cannot separate without offering their heartfelt pitythe crowners clerk changed it to sympathyto their bereaved and affectionate parents god save the king after this they all went home and it took good legs to keep up with them along priest lane in some of the darker places and especially where a white cow came and looked over a gate for the milkingtime i could not help laughing although myself not wholly free from uneasiness and i grieved that my joints were not as nimble as those of simon edwards but while we frightened one another like so many children each perceiving something which was worse to those who perceived it not hezekiah carried on as if we were a set of fools and nothing ever could frighten him to me who was the bravest of them this was very irksome but it happened that i knew brother perkinss pet belief his wife had lived at longlands once a lonely house between nottage and newton on the rise of a little hill and they say that on one night of the year all the funerals that must pass from nottage to newton in the twelvemonth go by in succession there with all the mourners after them and the very hymns that they will sing passing softly on the wind so as we were just by longlands in the early beat of the stars i managed to be at perkinss side then suddenly as a bat went by i caught the arm of hezekiah and drew back and shivered name of god davy whats the matter cant you see them you blindeye there they go there they go all the coffins with palls to them and the names upon the headplatesevan and thomas and hopkin and rees and jenkin with only four bearers and the psalm they sing is the thirtyfourth so it is i can see them all the lord have mercy upon my soul oh davy davy dont leave me here he could not walk another step but staggered against the wall and groaned and hid his face inside his hat we got him to newton with much ado but as for going to bridgend that night he found that our churchclock must be seen to the very first thing in the morning chapter xvi truth lies sometimes in a well the following morning it happened so that i did not get up over early not i assure you from any undue enjoyment of the grand crowners quests but partly because the tide for fishing would not suit till the afternoon and partly because i had worked both hard and long at the jolly sailors and this in fulfilment of a pledge from which there was no escaping when i promised on the night before to grease and tune my violin and display the true practice of hornpipe rash enough this promise was on account of my dear wifes memory and the things bad people would say of it and but for the sad uneasiness created by black evans prophecy and the need of lively company to prevent my seeing white horses the fear of the parish might have prevailed with me over all fear of the landlord hence i began rather shyly but when my first tune had been received with hearty applause from all the room how could i allow myself to be clapped on the back and then be lazy now bunny was tugging and clamouring for her bit of breakfast almost before i was wideawake when the latch of my cottagedoor was lifted and in walked hezekiah almost any other man would have been more welcome for though he had not spoken of it on the day before he was sure to annoy me sooner or later about the fish he had forced me to sell him when such a matter is over and done with surely no man in commonsense has a right to reopen the question the time to find fault with a fish in all conscience is before you have bought him having once done that he is now your own and to blame him is to find fault with the mercy which gave you the money to buy him a foolish thing as well because you are running down your own property and spoiling your relish for him conduct like this is below contempt even more ungraceful and ungracious than that of a man who spreads abroad the faults of his own wife hezekiah however on this occasion was not quite so bad as that his errand according to his lights was of a friendly nature for he pried all round my little room with an extremely sagacious leer and then gazed at me with a dark cock of his eye and glanced askance at bunny and managed to wink like the commodores ship beginning to light pooplanterns speak out like a man i said is your wife confined with a prophecy or what is the matter with you hepzibah the prophetess is well and her prophecies are abiding the fulness of their fulfilment i would speak with you on a very secret and important matter concerning also her revealings then i will send the child away here bunny run and ask mother jones that will not do i will not speak here walls are thin and walls have ears come down to the well with me but the well is a lump of walls i answered and children almost always near it there are no children i have been down the well is dry and the children know it no better place can be for speaking looking down across the churchyard i perceived that he was right and so i left bunny to dwell on her breakfast and went with hezekiah among the sandhills there was no one for fright had fallen on everybody since the sands began to walk as the general folk now declared of them and nobody looked at a sandhill now with any other feeling than towards his grave and tombstone even my heart was a little heavy in spite of all scientific points when i straddled over the stone that led into the sandy passage after me came hezekiah groping with his grimy hands and calling out for me to stop until he could have hold of me however i left him to follow the darkness in the wake of his own ideas a better place for secret talk in a parish full of echoes scarcely could be found perhaps except the old red house on the shore so i waited for perkins to unfold as soon as we stood on the bottom step with three or four yards of quicksand but no dip for a pitcher below us the children knew that the well was dry and some of them perhaps were gone to try to learn their letters what then was my disappointment as it gradually came out that so far from telling me a secret hezekiahs object was to deprive me of my own however if i say what happened nobody can grumble in the first place he manoeuvred much to get the weathergage of me by setting me so that the light that slanted down the grey slope should gather itself upon my honest countenance i for my part as a man unwarned how far it might become a duty to avoid excess of accuracy took the liberty to prefer a less conspicuous position not that i had any lies to tell but might be glad to hear some therefore i stuck to a pleasant seat upon a very nice sandy slab where the light so shot and wavered that a badly inquisitive man might seek in vain for a flush or a flickering of the most delicate light of allthat which is cast by the heart or mind of man into the face of man upon the whole it could scarcely be said at least as concerned hezekiah that truth was to be found just now at the bottom of this well dear brother dyo he gently began with the most brotherly voice and manner it has pleased the lord who does all things aright to send me to you for counsel now as well as for comfort beloved dyo all that i have is at your service i answered very heartily looking for something about his wife and always enjoying a thing of that kind among those righteous fellows and we heard that hepzibah had taken up under word of the lord with the shakersb brother david i have wrestled hard in the nightseason about that which has come to pass my wife to be sure i said my wife who was certified seven times as a vessel for the spirit to be surethey always are and then they gad about so brother you understand me not or desire to think evil hepzibah since her last confinement is a vessel for the spirit to the square of what she was seven times seven is fortynine and requires no certificate but these are carnal calculations all this took me beyond my depth and i answered him rather crustily and my word ended with both those letters which as i learned from my catechism belong to us by baptism unholy david shun evil words pray without ceasing but swear not at all in a vision of the night hepzibah hath seen terrible things of thee why you never went home last night hezekiah how can you tell what your wife dreamed i said not when it came to pass and how could i speak of it yesterday before that loose assembly well well out with it what was this wonderful vision hepzibah the prophetess being in a trance and deeply inspired of the lord beheld the following vision a long lonely sea was spread before her shining in the moonlight smoothly and in places strewed with gold a man was standing on a low black rock casting a line and drawing great fish out almost every time he cast then there arose from out the water a dear little child all dressed in white carrying with both hands her cradle and just like our little maiden martha like your dirty martha indeed i was at the very point of saying but snapped my lips and saved myself this small damsel approached the fisherman and presented her cradle to him with a very trustful smile then he said is it gold and she said no it is only a white lily upon which he shouted be off with you and the child fell into a desolate hole and groped about vainly for her cradle then all the light faded out of the sea and the waves and the rocks began moaning and the fisherman fell on his knees and sought in vain for the cradle and while he was moaning came satan himself bearing the cradle redhot and crackling and he seized the poor man by his blue woollen smock and laid him in the cradle and rocked it till his shrieks awoke hepzibah and hepzibah is certain that you are the man to hear all this in that sudden manner quite took my breath away for a minute so that i fell back and knocked my head purely innocent as i was but presently i began to hope that the prophetess might be wrong this time and the more so because that vile trance of hers might have come from excessive enjoyment of those good fish of mine and it grew upon me more and more the more i disliked her prediction about me that if she had such inspiration scarcely would she have sent hezekiah to buy her supper from my fourlegged table therefore i spoke without much loss of courage brother hezekiah there is something wrong with hepzibah send her i pray you to dr apyollup before she prophesies anything more no blue woollen smock have i worn this summer but a canvas jacket only and more often a striped jersey it is sandy macraw she has seen in her dream with the devil both roasting and rocking him glory be to the lord for it glory be to him dyo whichever of you two it was i hope that it may have been sandy but hepzibah is always accurate even among fishermen even fishermen i answered being a little touched with wrath know the folk that understood them and the folk that cannot even fishermen have their right especially when reduced to it not to be blasphemed in that way even by a prophetess dyo you are hot again what makes you go on so a friends advice is such a thing that i nearly always take it unless i find big obstacles dyo now be advised by me that depends on how i like it was the best thing i could say david llewellyn the only chance to save thy sinful soul is this open thine heart to the chosen one to the favoured of the lord confess to hepzibah the things that befell thee and how the tempter prevailed with thee especially bring forth my brother the accursed thing thou hast hid in thy tent the wedge of gold and the shekels of silver and the babylonish garment thou hast stolen and dissembled also and put it even among thine own stuff cast it from thee deliver it up lay it before the ark of the lord and hepzibah shall fall down and pray lest thou be consumed and burnt with fire like the son of carmi the son of zabdi and covered over with a great heap of stones even such as this is my wrath at this foul accusation and daring attempt to frighten me was kindled so that i could not speak and if this had happened in the open air i should have been certain to knock him down however i began to think for perkins was a litigious fellow and however strict a mans conduct is he does not want his affairs all exposed therefore i kept my knit knuckles at home but justly felt strong indignation perkins thought he had terrified me for perhaps in that bad light i looked pale and so he began to triumph upon me which needs as everybody knows a better man than hezekiah come come brother dyo he said in a voice quite different from the chapelscriptural style he had used you see we know all about it two dear children come ashore one dead and the other not dead you contrive to receive them both with your accustomed poaching skill for everybody says that you are always to be found everywhere except in your chapel on sabbathday now david what do our good people having families of their own find upon these children not so much as a chain or locket or even a gold pin i am a jeweller and i know that children of high position always have some trinket on them when their mothers love them a child with a coronet and no gold david this is wrong of wrong and worse than this you conceal the truth even from me your ancient friend there must be a great deal to be made either from those who would hold them in trust or from those in whose way they stood for the family died out very likely in all male inheritance think what we might make of it by acting under my direction and you shall have half of it all old davy by relieving your mind and behaving in a sensible and religious manner this came home to my sense of experience more than all hepzibahs divine predictions or productions at the same time i saw that hezekiah was all abroad in the dark and groping right and left after the bodily truth and what call had he to cry shares with me because he had more reputation and a higher conceit of himself of course but it crossed my mind that this nasty fellow being perhaps in front of me in some little tricks of machinery might be useful afterwards in getting at the real truth which often kept me awake at night only i was quite resolved not to encourage roguery by letting him into partnership perceiving my depth of considerationfor it suited my purpose to hear him out and learn how much he suspectedit was natural that he should try again to impress me yet further by boasting dyo i have been at a latin school for as much as three months together my father gave me a rare education and i made the most of it none of your ignorance for me i am up to the moods and the tenses the accidents and the proselytes the present i know and the future i know the peterperfection and the hayroost i call that stuff gibberish talk plain english if you can understand you then so much as this i speak in a carnal manner now i speak as a fool unto a fool i am up to snuff good dyo i can tell the time of day then you are a devilish deal cleverer than any of your clocks are but now thou speakest no parables brother now i know what thou meanest thou art up for robbing somebody and if i would shun satans clutches i must come and help thee dyo this is inconsistent nor can i call it brotherly we wish to do good both you and i and to raise a little money for works of love you no doubt with a good end in view to console you for much tribulation and i with a single eye to the advancement of the cause which i have at heart to save many brands from the burning then dyo why not act together why not help one another dear brother thou with the goodluck and i with the brains he laid his hand on my shoulder kindly with a yearning of his bowels towards me such as true nonconformists feel at the scent of any money i found myself also a little moved not being certain how far it was wise to throw him altogether over but suddenly by what means i know not except the will of providence there arose before me that foul wrong which the nicodemuschristian had committed against me some three years back i had forborne to speak of it till now wishing to give the man fairplay hezekiah do you remember i asked with much solemnity do you remember your twentieth weddingday davy my brother how many timesnever mind talking about that now you had a large company coming and to whom did you give a special order to catch you a turbot at tenpence apound nay nay my dear friend dyo shall i never get that thing out of your stupid head you had known me for twenty years at least as the very best fisherman on the coast and a man that could be relied upon yet you must go and give that order not to a man of good welsh bloodwith ten welshmen coming to dinner mindnot to a man that was bred and born within five miles of your dirty housenot to a man that knew every cranny and crinkle of sand where the turbots lie but to a tagrag scotchman it was spoken of upon every pebble from briton ferry to aberthaw david llewellyn put under the feet of a fellow like sandy macrawa beggarly interloping freckled bitter weed of a scotchman well davy i have apologised how many times more must i do it it was not that i doubted your skill you tell us of that so often that none of us ever question it it was simply becausei feared just then to come near your excellent and lamented no excuses no excuses mr perkins if you please you only make the matter worse as if a mans wife could come into the question when it comes to business yours may because you dont know how to manage her but mine well now she is gone dyo and very good she was to you and in your heart you know it whether he said this roguishly or from the feeling which all of us have when it comes to one another i declare i knew not then and i know not even now for i did not feel so sharply up to look to mine own interest with these recollections over me i waited for him to begin again but he seemed to stick back in the corner and in spite of all that turbot business at the moment i could not help holding out my hand to him he took it and shook it with as much emotion as if he had truly been fond of my wife and i felt that nothing more must be said concerning that order to sandy macraw it seemed to be very good reason also for getting out of that interview for i might say things to be sorry for if i allowed myself to go on any more with my heart so open therefore i called in my usual briskness lo the water is rising the children must be at the mouth of the well what will the good wife prophesy if she sees thee coming up the stairs with thy two feet soaking wet master hezekiah chapter xvii for a little change of air on the very next day i received such a visit as never had come to my house before for while i was trimming my hooks and wondering how to get out of all this trouble with my conscience sound and my pocket improved suddenly i heard a voice not to be found anywhere i ants to yalk i tell a yatkin put me down derekkerly i ants to see old davy and old davy wants to see you you beauty i cried as she jumped like a little wild kid and took all my house with a glance and then me does a know i yikes this house and i yikes a and i yikes yatkin and ickle bunny and evelybody she pointed all round for everybody with all ten fingers spread everyway then watkin came after her like her slave with a foolish grin on his countenance in spite of the undertaking business if you please sir mr llewellyn he said we was forced to bring her over she have been crying so dreadful and shivering about the black pithole so and when the black things came into the house she was going clean out of her little mind ever so many times almost no use it was at all to tell her ever so much ayard they was i dont yike back and i ont have back yite i yikes and boo i yikes and my dear papa be so very angy when i tells him all about it she went on like that and she did so cry mother said she must change the air a bit all the time he was telling me this she watched him with her head on one side and her lips kept ready in the most comic manner as much as to say now you tell any stories at my expense and you may look out but watkin was truth itself and she nodded and said ness at the end of his speech and if you please sir mr llewellyn whatever is a belung sir all the way she have been asking for belung belung belung and i cannot tell for the life of me whatever is belung boy never ask what is unbecoming i replied in a manner which made him blush according to my intention for the word might be english for all i knew and have something of high life in it however i found byandby that it meant what she was able to call ummibella when promoted a year in the dictionary but now anybody should only have seen her who wanted a little rousing up my cottage of course is not much to boast of compared with castles and so on nevertheless there is something about it pleasant and good like its owner you might see ever so many houses and think them larger and grander and so on with more opportunity for sitting down and less for knocking your head perhaps and after all you would come back to mine not for the sake of the meat in the cupboardbecause i seldom had any and far inferior men had more but becausewell it does not matter i never could make you understand unless you came to see it only i felt that i had found a wonderful creature to make me out and enter almost into my own views of which the world is not capable every time i took this child up and down the staircase she would have jumps and she made me talk in a manner that quite surprised myself and such a fine feeling grew up between us that it was a happy thing for the whole of us not to have bunny in the way just then mother jones was giving her appleparty as she always did when the red streaks came upon her early margarets but i always think the white juneating is a far superior apple and i have a tree of it my little garden is nothing grand any more than the rest of my premises or even myself if it comes to that still you might go for a long days walk and find very few indeed to beat it unless you were contradictory for ten doors at least both west and east this was admitted silently as was proved by their sending to me for a cabbage an artichoke or an onion or anything choice for a sunday dinner it may suit these very people now to shake their heads and to run me down but they should not forget what i did for them when it comes to pronouncing fair judgment poor bardie appeared as full of bright spirit and as brave as ever and when she tumbled from jumping two steps what did she do but climb back and jump three which even bunny was afraid to do but i soon perceived that this was only a sort of a flash in the pan as it were the happy change from the gloom of sker house from the silent corners and creaking stairs and longfaced people keeping watch and howling every now and thenalso the sight of me again whom she looked upon as her chief protector and the general air of tidiness belonging to my dwellingthese things called forth all at once the play and joyful spring of her nature but when she began to get tired of this and to long for a little coaxing even the stupidest gaffer could see that she was not the child she had been her little face seemed pinched and pale and prematurely grave and odd while in the grey eyes tears shone ready at any echo of thought to fall also her forehead broad and white which marked her so from common children looked as if too much of puzzling and of wondering had been done there even the gloss of her rich brown poll was faded with none to care for it while the dainty feet and hands so sensitive as to a speck of dirt were enough to bring the tears of pity into a careful mothers eyes gardy la ook e see hot degustin naily pailies and poor bardie nuffin to kean em with while i was setting this grief to rest for which she kissed me beautifully many thoughts came through my mind about this little creature she and i were of one accord upon so many important points and when she differed from me perhaps she was in the right almost which is a thing that i never knew happen in a whole village of grownup people and by the time i had brushed her hair and tied up the bows of her frock afresh and when she began to dance again and to play every kind of trick with me i said to myself i must have this child whatever may come of it i will riskwhen the price of butchersmeat comes down this i said in real earnest but the price of butchersmeat went up and i never have known it come down again while i was thinking our bunny came in full of apples raw and roasted and of the things the children said but at the very first sight of bardie everything else was gone from her all the other children were fit only to make dirtpies of this confirmed and held me steadfast in the opinions which i had formed without any female assistance in spite of all her own concerns of which she was full enough goodness knows bunny came up and pulled at her by reason of something down her back which wanted putting to rights a littlea plait or a tuck or some manner of gear only i thought it a clever thing and the little one approved of it and then our bunny being in her best these children took notice of one another to settle which of them was nearer to the proper style of clothes and each admired the other for anything which she had not got herself come you babychits said i being pleased at their womanly ways so early all of us want some food i think can we eat our dresses the children of course understood me not nevertheless what i said was sense and if to satisfy womankindfor which i have deepest regard and respecti am forced to enter into questions higher than reason of men can climbof washing and ironing and quilling and gaufreing and setting up and styles of transparent reefing and all our other endeavours to fetch this child up to her stationthe best thing i can do will be to have mother jones in to write it for me if only she can be forced to spell however that is beyond all hope and even i find it hard sometimes to be sure of the royal manner only i go by the bible always for every word that i can find being taught ever since i could read at all that his majesty james i confirmed it now this is not all the thing which i wanted to put before you clearly because i grow like a tombstone often only fit to make you laugh when i stand on my right to be serious my great desire is to tell you what i did and how i did it as to the managing of these children even for a day or two so as to keep them from crying or scorching or spoiling their clothes or getting wet or having too much victuals or too little of course i consulted that good mother jones five or six times every day and she never was weary of giving advice though she said every time that it must be the last and a lucky thing it was for me in all this responsibility to have turned enough of money through skilful catch and sale of fish to allow of my staying at home a little and not only washing and mending of clothes but treating the whole of the household to the delicacies of the season however it is not my habit to think myself anything wonderful that i leave to the rest of the world and no doubt any good and clever man might have done a great part of what i did only if anything should befall us out of the reach of a sailors skill and the depth of bunnys experience mother jones promised to come straight in the very moment i knocked at the wall and her husband slept with such musical sound that none could be lonely in any house near and so did all of her ten children who could crack a lollipop upon the whole we passed so smoothly over the first evening with the two children as hard at play as if they were paid fifty pounds for it that having some twentyfive shillings in hand after payment of all creditors and only ten weeks to my pensionday with my boat unknown to anybody and a very good prospect of fish running up from the mumbles at the next full moon i set the little one on my lap after a good bout of laughing at her very queer ins and outsfor all things seem to be all alive with as well as to her will you stay with me my dear i said as bold as king george and the dragon would you like to live with old davy and bunny and have ever so many frocks washed soon as ever he can buy them for nothing satisfied her better than to see her one gown washed she laid her head on one side a little so that i felt it hot to my bosom being excused of my waistcoat and i knew that she had overworked herself ness she said after thinking a bit ness i live with a old davy till my dear mama come for me does e know old davy hot i thinks no my pretty i only know that you are always thinking and so she was no doubt of it i tell a old davy hot i thinks noi cant tell a only sompfin et me go for more pay with bunny no my dear just stop a minute bunny has got no breath left in her she is such a great fat bunny what you mean to say is that you dont know how papa and mama could ever think of leaving you such a long long time away she shook her curly pate as if each frizzle were a puzzle and her sweet white forehead seemed a mainsail full of memory and then gay presence was in her eyes and all the play which i had stopped broke upon her mind again tinker tailor soldier sailor she began with her beautiful fingers crawling like white carnelian compasses up the wellmade buttons of my new smockguernsey for though i had begged my hot waistcoat off i never was lax of dress in her presence as i would be in bunnysor in short with anybody except this little lady i myself taught her that tinker tailor and had a right to have it done to me and she finished it off with such emphasis upon button no which happened to be the last of them gentleman ploughboy fief looking straight into my eyes and both of us laughing at the fine idea that i could possibly be called a thief but fearing to grow perhaps foolish about her as she did these charming things to me i carried her up to bed with bunny and sung them both away to sleep with a melancholy dirge of sea into whatever state of life it may please god to call methough i fear there cannot be many more at this age of writingit always will be as it always has been my first principle and practice to do my very utmost which is far less than it was since the doctor stopped my hornpipes to be pleasant and good company and it is this leading motive which has kept me from describingas i might have done to make you tingle and be angry afterwardsthe state of sker house and of evan thomas and moxy his wife and all their friends about those five poor rabbiters also other darkish matters such as the plight of those obstinate black men when they came ashore at last three together and sometimes four as if they had fought in the water and after all what luck they had in obtaining proper obsequies inasmuch as by order of crowner bowles a great hole in the sand was dug in a little sheltered valley and kept open till it was fairly thought that the sea must have finished with them and then after being carefully searched for anything of value they were rolled in all together and kept down with stones like the parish mangle and covered with a handsome mound of sand and not only this but in spite of expense and the murmuring of the vestry a board well tarred to show their colour was set up in the midst of it and their number chalked up and so they were stopped of their mischief awhile after shamefully robbing their poor importer but if this was conducted handsomely how much more so were the funerals of the five young white men the sense of the neighbourhood and the stir and the presence of the coroner who stopped a whole week for sea air and freshness after seeing so many good things come in and perceiving so many ways home that night that he made up his mind to none of them also the feeling which no one expressed but all would have been disappointed of that honest black evan after knocking so many men down in both parishes and the extraparochial manor was designed by this downright blow from above to repent and to entertain every one and most of all the fact that five of a highly respectable family were to be buried at once to the saving of four future funerals all of which must have been fine onesthese universal sympathies compelled the house and the people therein to exert themselves to the uttermost enough that it gave satisfaction not universal but general and even that last is a hard thing to do in such great outbursts of sympathy though moudlin church is more handy for sker and the noble portreeve of kenfig stood upon his right to it still there were stronger reasons why old newton should have the preference and sker being outside either parish crowner bowles on receipt of a guinea swore down the portreeve to his very vamps for moxy thomas was a newton woman and loved every scrape of a shoe there and her uncle the clerk would have ended his days if the fees had gone over to kenfig our parson as well was a very fine man and a match for the whole of the service while the little fellow at moudlin always coughed at a word of three syllables there was one woman in our village who was always right she had been disappointed three times over in her early and middle days and the effect of this on her character was so lasting and so wholesome that she never spoke without knowing something when from this capital female i heard that our churchyard had won the victory and when i foresaw the demented condition of glory impending upon our village not only from five magnificent palls each with its proper attendance of black and each with fine hymns and good howling but yet more than that from the hot strength of triumph achieved over vaunting kenfig then it came into my mind to steal away with bardie a stern and sad sacrifice of myself i assured myself that it was and would be for few even of our oldest men could enjoy a funeral more than i did with its sad reflections and junketings and i might have been headman of all that day entitled not only to drop the mould but to make the speech afterwards at the inn but i abandoned all these rights and braved once more the opinions of neighbours which any man may do once too often and when the advance of sound came towards us borne upon the western wind from the end of newton wayn slowly hanging through the air as if the air loved death of manthe solemn singing of the people who must go that way themselves and told it in their melody and when the clevice rock rung softly with the tolling bell as well as with the rolling dirges we slipped away at the back of itthat is to say pretty bardie and i for bunny was purer of newton birth than to leave such a sight without tearing away and desiring some little to hear all about it i left her with three very good young women smelling strongly of southernwood who were beginning to weep already and promised to tell me the whole of it as we left this dismal business bardie danced along beside me like an ostrichfeather blown at in among the sandhills soon i got her where she could see nothing and the thatch of rushes deadened every pulse of the funeral bell and then a strange idea took me all things being strange just now that it might prove a rich wise thing to go for a quiet cruise with bardie in that boat and on the waves she might remember things recovered by the chance of semblance therefore knowing that all living creatures five miles either way of us were sure to be in newton churchyard nearly all the afternoon and then in the publichouses i scrupled not to launch my boat and go to sea with the little one for if we steered a proper course no funeral could see us and so i shipped her gingerly the glory of her mind was such that overboard she must have jumped except for my sunday necktie with a halfhitch knot around her and the more i rowed the more she laughed and looked at the sun with her eyes screwed up and at the water with all wide open hare is a going old davy she said slipping from under my sunday splice and coming to me wonderfully and laying her tiny hands on mine which beat me always as she had found out is a going to my dear papa and mama and ickle bother no my pretty you must wait for them to come we are going to catch some fish and salt them that they may keep with a very fine smell till your dear papa brings your mama and all the family with him and then what a supper we will have ill a she said and poor bardie too but the distance of the suppertime was a very sad disappointment to her and her bright eyes filled with haze and then she said ness very quietly because she was growing to understand that she could not have her own way now i lay on my oars and watched her carefully while she was shaking her head and wondering with her little white shoulders above the thwart and her innocent and intelligent eyes full of the spreading sky and sea it was not often one had the chance through the everflitting change to learn the calm and true expression of that poor young creatures face even now i could not tell except that her playful eyes were lonely and her tender lips were trembling and a heartful of simple love could find no outlet and lost itself these little things when thinking thus or having thought flow through them never ought to be disturbed because their brains are tender the unknown stream will soon run out and then they are fit again for play which is the proper work of man we open the world and we close the world with nothing more than this and while our manhood is too grand for a score and a half of years perhaps to take things but in earnest the justice of our birth is on uswe are fortunes plaything chapter xviii public approbation if that child had no luck herself except of course in meeting me at any rate she never failed to bring me wondrous fortune the air was smooth and sweet and soft the sky had not a wrinkle and the fickle sea was smiling proud of pleasant manners directly i began to fish at the western tail of the tuskar scarcely a fish forebore me whitingpollacks run in shoals and a shoal i had of them and the way i split and dried them made us long for breakfasttime and bardie did enjoy them so the more i dwelled with that little child the more i grew wrapped up in her her nature was so odd and loving and her ways so pretty many men forego their goodness so that they forget the nature of a little darling child otherwise perhaps we might not if we kept our hearts aright so despise the days of loving and the time of holiness now this baby almost shamed me and i might say bunny too when having undressed her and put the coarse rough nightgown on her which came from sker with the funerals my grandchild called me from upstairs to meet some great emergency granny come up with the stick dreckly moment granny dear missy ont go into bed such a bad wicked child she is i ran upstairs and there was bunny all on fire with noble wrath and there stood bardie sadly scraping the wormeaten floor with her small white toes ise not a yicked shild she said ise a yae good gal i is i ont go to bed till i say my payers to mighty god as my dear mama make me she be very angy with a bunny hen she knows it hereupon i gave bunny a nice little smack and had a great mind to let her taste the stick which she had invoked so eagerly however she roared enough without it because her feelings were deeply hurt bardie also cried for company or perhaps at my serious aspect until i put her down on her knees and bade her say her prayers and have done with it at the same time it struck me how stupid i was not to have asked about this before inasmuch as even a childs religion may reveal some of its history she knelt as prettily as could be with her head thrown back and her tiny palms laid together upon her breast and thus she said her simple prayer pay god bless dear papa and mama and ickle bother gentle jesus meek and mild ook upon a ickle shild and make me a good gal amen then she got up and kissed poor bunny and was put into bed as good as gold and slept like a little dormouse till morning take it altogether now we had a happy time of it every woman in newton praised me for my kindness to the child and even the men who had too many could not stand against bardies smile they made up indeed some scandalous story as might have been expected about my relationship to the baby and her sudden appearance so shortly after my poor wifes death however by knocking three men down i produced a more active growth of charity in our neighbourhood and very soon a thing came to pass such as i never could have expected and of a nature to lift me even more than the free use of my pole for a period of at least six months above the reach of libel from any one below the rank of a justice of the peace this happened just as followsone night the children were snug in bed and finding the evenings long because the days were shortening in so fastwhich seemed to astonish everybodyit came into my head to go no more than outside my own door and into the jolly sailors for the autumn seemed to be coming on and i like to express my opinions upon that point in society never being sure where i may be before ever another autumn moreover the landlord was not a man to be neglected with impunity he never liked his customers to stay too long away from him any more than our parson did and pleasant as he was when pleased and generous in the way of credit to people with any furniture nothing was more sure to vex him than for a man without excuse to pretend to get on without him now when i came into the room where our little sober proceedings area narrow room and dark enough yet full of much good feeling also with hard wooden chairs worn soft by generations of sittinga sudden stir arose among the excellent people present they turned and looked at me as if they had never enjoyed that privilege or at any rate had failed to make proper use of it before and ere my modesty was certain whether this were for good or harm they raised such a clapping with hands and feet and a clinking of glasses in a line with it that i felt myself worthy of some great renown i stood there and bowed and made my best leg and took off my hat in acknowledgment observing this they were all delighted as if i had done them a real honour and up they arose with one accord and gave me three cheers with an englishman setting the proper tune for it i found myself so overcome all at once with my own fame and celebrity that i called for a glass of hot rumandwater with the nipple of a lemon in it and sugar the size of a nutmeg my order was taken with a speed and deference hitherto quite unknown to me and better than that seven men opened purses and challenged the right to pay for it entering into so rare a chance of getting on quite gratis and knowing that such views are quick to depart i called for six oz of tobacco with the bristol stamp a red crown upon it scarce had i tested the draught of a pipewhich i had to do sometimes for half an hour with all to blow out and no drawing inwhen the tobacco was at my elbow served with a saucer and a curtsey well thought i this is real glory and i longed to know how i had earned it it was not likely with all those people gazing so respectfully that i would deign to ask them coarsely what the deuce could have made them do it i had always felt myself unworthy of obscure position and had dreamed for many years of having my merits perceived at last and to ask the reason would have been indeed a degradation although there was not a fibre of me but quivered to know all about it herein however i overshot the mark as i found out afterwards for my careless manner made people say that i must have written the whole myselfa thing so very far below me that i scorn to answer it but here it is and then you can judge from the coarse style and the threedecked words whether it be work of mine felix farleys bristol journal saturday july shipwreck and loss of all handsheroism of a british tarwe hear of a sad catastrophe from the coast of glamorganshire the season of great heat and drought from which our readers must have suffered broke up as they may kindly remember with an almost unprecedented gale of wind and thunder on sunday the th day of this month in the height of the tempest a large ship was descried cast by the fury of the elements upon a notorious reef of rocks at a little place called sker about twenty miles to the east of swansea serious apprehensions were entertained by the spectators for the safety of the crew which appeared to consist of black men their fears were too truly verified for in less than an hour the illfated bark succumbed to her cruel adversaries no adult male of either colour appears to have reached the shore alive although a celebrated fisherman and heroic pensioner of our royal navy whose name is david llewellyn and who traces his lineage from the royal bard of that patronymic performed prodigies of valour and proved himself utterly regardless of his own respectable and blameless life by plunging repeatedly into the boiling surges and battling with the raging elements in the vain hope of extricating the sufferers from a watery grave with the modesty which appears to be under some inscrutable law of nature inseparable from courage of the highest order this heroic tar desires to remain in obscurity this we could not reconcile with our sense of duty and if any lover of our black brethren finds himself moved by this narration we shall be happy to take charge of any remittance marked d l it grieves us to add that none escaped except an intelligent young female who clung to the neck of llewellyn she states that the ship was the andalusia and had sailed from appledore which is we believe in devonshire the respected coroner bowles held an inquest which afforded universal satisfaction deeply surprised as i was to find how accurately upon the whole this paper had got the story of itfor not much less than half was trueit was at first a puzzle to me how they could have learned so much about myself and the valiant manner in which i intended to behave but found no opportunity until i remembered that a man possessing a very bad hat had requested the honour of introducing himself to me in my own house and had begged me by all means to consider myself at home and to allow him to send for refreshment which i would not hear of twice but gave him what i thought up to his mark according to manners and appearance and very likely he made a mistake between my description of what i was ready as well as desirous to carry out and what i bodily did go through ay and more to the back of it however i liked this account very much and resolved to encourage yet more warmly the next man who came to me with a bad hat what then was my disgust at perceiving at the very foot of that fine description a tissue of stuff like the following another account from a highlyesteemed correspondentthe great invasion of sand which has for so many generations spread such wide devastation and occasioned such grievous loss to landowners on the western coast of glamorganshire made another great stride in the storm of sabbathday july a vessel of considerable burthen named the andalusia and laden with negroes most carefully shipped for conversion among the good merchants of bristol appears to have been swallowed up by the sand and our black fellowcreatures disappeared it is to be feared from this visitation of an everbenign providence that few of them had been converted and that the burden of their sins disabled them from swimming if one had been snatched as a brand from the burning gladly would we have recorded it and sent him forward prayerfully for sustenance on his way to the lord but the only eyewitness whose word must never be relied upon when mammon enters into the conflict a wornout but wellmeaning sailor who fattens upon the revenue of an overburdened countrythis man ran away so fast that he saw hardly anything the lord however knoweth his own in the days of visitation a little child came ashore alive and a dead child bearing a coronet many people have supposed that the pusillanimous sailor aforesaid knows much more than he will tell it is not for us to enter into that part of the question duty however compels us to say that any one desiring to have a proper comprehension of this heavy but righteous judgmentfor he doeth all things wellcannot do better than apply to the wellknown horologist of bridgend hezekiah perkins also to the royal family the above yarn may simply be described as a gallowsrope spun by jack ketch himself from all the lies of all the scoundrels he has ever hanged added to all that his own vile heart can invent with the devil to help him the coldblooded creeping and crawling manner in which i myself was alluded toalthough without the manliness even to set my name downas well as the low hypocrisy of the loathsome whitelivered syntax of it made mewell i will say no morethe filthiness reeks without my stirring and indeed no honest man should touch it only if hezekiah perkins had chanced to sneak into the room just then his wife might have prophesied shrouds and weeds for who else was capable of such lies slimed with so much sanctimony like cellar slugs or bilgehole rats rolling in angelica while all their entrails are of brimstone such as satan would scorn to vomit a bitter pain went up my right arm for the weakness of my heart when that miscreant gave me insult and i never knocked him down the well and over and over again i have found it a thorough mistake to be always forgiving however to have done with reflections which must suggest themselves to any one situated like meif indeed any one ever wasafter containing myself on account of the people who surrounded me better than could have been hoped for i spoke because they expected it truly my dear friends i am thankful for your goodwill towards me also to the unknown writer who has certainly made too much of my poor unaided efforts i did my best it was but little and who dreams of being praised for it again i am thankful to this other writer who has overlooked me altogether for the sake of poor sandy macraw we must thank him that he kindly forbore to make public the name you should have seen the faces of all the folk around the table when i gave them this surprise why said one we thought for sure that it was you he was meaning dyo dear and in our hearts we were angry to him for such falsehoods large and black indeed and indeed true enough it may be of a man outlandish such as sandy macraw is let us not hasten to judge i replied sandy is brave enough i daresay and he can take his own part well i will not believe that he ran away very likely he never was there at all if he was he deserves high praise for taking some little care of himself i should not have been so stiff this night if i had only had the commonsense to follow his example all our people began to rejoice and yet they required as all of us do something more than strongest proof what reason is to show then dyo that this man of letters meant not you but sandy macraw to run away so hopkin read it aloud i said neither do i know nor care what the writers meaning was only i thought there was something spoken about his majestys revenue is it i or is it sandy that belongs to the revenue this entirely settled it all our people took it up and neglected not to tell one another so that in less than three days time my name was spread far and wide for the praise and the scotchmans for the condemnation i desired it not as my friends well knew but what use to beat to windward against the breath of the whole of the world therefore i was not so obstinate as to set my opinion against the rest but left it to mr macraw to rebut if he could his pusillanimity as for hezekiah perkins all his low creations fell upon the head from which they sprang i spoke to our rector about his endeavour to harm a respectable newton manfor you might call macraw that by comparison though he lived at porthcawl and was not respectableand everybody was struck with my kindness in using such handsome terms of a rival the result was that perkins lost our churchclock which paid him as well as a many two others having been presented to the parish and therefore not likely to go without pushing for our rector was a peppery man except when in the pulpit and what he said to hezekiah was exactly this what perkins another great bill again to repair of churchclock sevenandsixpence to ten miles travelling at threepence per mileand so on and so on why you never came further than my brother the colonels the last three times you have charged for allow me to ask you a little question to whom did you go for the keys of the church as if i should want any keys of the church there is no churchlock in the county that i cannot open as soon as whistle indeed so you pick our lock do you ever open a churchdoor honestly for the purpose of worshipping the lord i have kept my eye upon you sir because i hear that you have been reviling my parishioners and i happen to know that you never either opened the lock of our church or picked it for the last three times you have charged for but one thing you have picked for many years and that is the pocket of my ratepayers be off sirbe off with your trumpery bill we will have a good churchman to do our clocka thoroughly honest seaman and a regular churchgoer do you mean that big thief davy llewellyn well well do as you please but i will thank you to pay my bill first thank me when you get it sir you may fall down on your canting knees and thank the lord for one thing what am i to thank the lord for for allowing you to cheat me thus for giving me selfcommand enough not to knock you down sir with that the rector came so nigh him that brother perkins withdrew in haste for the parson had done that sort of thing to people who illused him and the sense of the parish was always with him hence the management of the churchclock passed entirely into my hands and i kept it almost always going at less than half hezekiahs price and this reunited me to the church from which my poor wife perhaps had led me astray some little by a monthly arrangement which reflected equal credit on either party and even this was not the whole of the blessings that now rolled down upon me for the sake no doubt of little bardie as with the ark in the bible for this fine felix farley was the only great author of news at that time prevalent among us it is true that there was another journal nearer to us at hereford and a highly good one but for a very clear reason it failed to have command of the publichouses for the customers liked both their pipes and their papers to be of the same origin and go together kindly and hereford sent out no tobacco while bristol was more famous for the best virginian birdseye than even for rum or intelligence therefore as everybody gifted with the gift of reading came to the publichouses gradually and to compare interpretation over those two narratives both of which stirred our county up my humble name was in their mouths as freely and approvingly as the sealingwax end of their pipe stems unanimous consent accrued when all had said the same thing over fifty times in different manners and with finedrawn argument that after all and upon the whole david llewellyn was an honour to county and to country after that for at least a fortnight no more dogs were set at me when i showed myself over a gentlemans gate in the hope of selling fish to him it used to be always at him pincher into his legs growler boy so that i was compelled to carry my congerrod to save me now however and for a season till my fame grew stale i never lifted the latch of a gate without hearing grateful utterance towser down you son of a gun yelp and vick hold your stupid tongues will you the value of my legs was largely understood by gentlemen as for the ladies and the housemaids if conceit were in my nature what a run it would have had always and always the same am i and above even womens opinions but i know no other man whose head would not have been turned with a day of it for my rap at the door was scarcely given louder perhaps than it used to be before every maid in the house was out and the lady looking through the blinds i used to dance on the step and beat my arms on my breast with my basket down between my legs and tremble almost for a second rap and then it was like your imperence none of your stinking stuff and so on but now they ran down beautifully and looked up under their eyelids at me and left me to show them what i liked and never beat down a halfpenny and even accepted my own weight such is the grand effect of glory and i might have kissed every one of them and many even of the good plain cooks if i could have reconciled it with my sense of greatness chapter xix a craft beyond the law colonel lougher of candleston court was one of the finest and noblest men it was ever my luck to come across he never would hear a word against me any more than i would against him and no sooner did i see him upon the bench than i ceased to care what the evidence was if they failed to prove their falsehoods as nearly always came to pass he dismissed them with a stern reprimand for taking away my character and if they seemed to establish anything by low devices against me what did he say why no more than this david if what they say be true you appear to have forgotten yourself in a very unusual manner you have promised me always to improve and i thought that you were doing it this seems to be a trifling chargehowever i must convict you the penalty is one shilling and the costs fifteen may it please your worship i always used to answer is an honest man to lose his good name and pay those who have none for stealing it having seen a good deal of the world he always felt the force of this but found it difficult to say so with prejudiced men observing him only i knew that my fine and costs would be slipped into my hand byandby with a glimpse of the candleston livery this was no more than fair between us for not more than seven generations had passed since griffith llewellyn of my true stock had been the proper and only bard to the great lord lougher of coity whence descended our good colonel there had been some little mistake about the departure of the title no doubt through extremes of honesty but no lord in the county came of better blood than colonel lougher to such a man it was a hopeless thing for the bitterest enemyif he had oneto impute one white hairs breadth of departure from the truth a thoroughly noble man to look at and a noble man to hearken to because he knew not his own kindness but was kind to every one now this good man had no child at all as generally happens to very good men for fear of mankind improving much and the great king of israel david from whom our family has a traditionyet without any jewish blood in ushe says if i am not mistaken that it is a sure mark of the ungodly to have children at their desire and to leave the rest of their substance to ungodly infants not to be all alone the colonel after the death of his excellent wife persuaded his only sister the lady bluett widow of lord bluett to set up with him at candleston and this she was not very loath to do because her eldest son the present lord bluett was of a wild and sporting turn and no sooner became of age but that he wanted no mother over him therefore she left him for a while to his own devices hoping every month to hear of his suddenly repenting now this was a lady fit to look at you might travel all day among people that kept drawingrooms and greenhouses and the new safe of music well named from its colour grand paeony and you might go up and down bridgend even on a fairday yet nobody would you set eyes on fit to be looked at as a lady on the day that you saw lady bluett it was not that she pretended anything that made all the difference only she felt such a thorough knowledge that she was no more than we might have been except for a width of accidents and nothing ever parted her from any one with good in him for instance the first time she saw me again after thirty years perhaps from the season of her beautycharm when i had chanced to win all the prizes in the sports given at candleston court for the manhood of now colonel lougher not only did she at once recognise me in spite of all my battering but she held out her beautiful hand and said how are you mr llewellyn nobody had ever called me mr llewellyn much till then but by good luck a washerwoman heard it and repeated it and since that day there are not many people leaving out clods and low enemies with the face to accost me otherwise however this is not to the purpose any more than it is worthy of me how can it matter what people call me when i am clear of my fishbasket as indeed i always feel at the moment of unstrapping no longer any reputation to require my fist ready i have done my utmost and i have received the money these are the fine perceptions which preserve a man of my position from the effects of calumny and next to myself the principal guardian of my honour was this noble colonel lougher moreover a fine little chap there was lady bluetts younger son honourable rodney bluett by name for his father had served under admiral rodney and been very friendly with him and brought him to church as a godfather this young rodney bluett was about ten years old at that time and the main delight of his life was this to come fishing with old davy the wondrous yarns i used to spin had such an effect on his little brain that his prospects on dry land and love of his mother and certain inheritance from the colonel were helpless to keep him from longing always to see the things which i had seen with his large blue eyes upon me and his flaxen hair tied back and his sleeves tucked up for paddling hour by hour he would listen when the weather was too rough to do much more than look at it or if we went out in a boat as we did when he could pay for hiring and when his mother was out of the way many and many a time i found him when he should have been quick with the bait dwelling upon the fine ideas which my tales had bred in him i took no trouble in telling them neither did i spare the truth when it would come in clumsily like a lubber who cannot touch his hat but they all smelled good and true because they had that character however he must bide his time as every one of us has to do before i make too much of him and just at the period now in hand he was down in my black books for never coming near me it may have been that he had orders not to be so much with me and very likely that was wise for neither his mother nor his uncle could bear the idea of his going to sea but meant to make a red herring of him as we call those poor landsoldiers being so used to his pretty company and his admiration also helping him as i did to spend his pocketmoney i missed him more than i could have believed neither could i help sorrowing at this great loss of opportunity for many an honest shilling might have been turned ere winter by the hire of my boat to him when he came out with me fishing i had prepared a scale of charges very little over captain bobs to whom he used to pay d an hour when i let him come after the whiting with me and now for no more than d an hour he should have my very superior boat and keep her head by my directions for he understood a rudder and bait my hooks and stow my fish and enjoy as all boys should the idea of being useful for as concerns that little barkie i had by this time secured myself from any further uneasiness or troublesome need of concealment by a bold and spirited facing of facts which deserve the congratulation of all honest fishermen the boat like her little captain was at first all whiteas i may have saidbut now before her appearance in public i painted her gunwale and strakes bright blue even down to her watermark and then without meddling with her name or rather that of the ship she belonged to i retraced very lightly but so that any one could read it the name of the port from which she hailed and which as i felt certain now from what i had seen on the poor wrecked ship must have been san salvador and the three last letters were so plain that i scarcely had to touch them now this being done and an old worn painter shipped instead of the new one which seemed to have been chopped off with an axe i borrowed a boat and stood off to sea from porthcawl point where they beach them having my tackle and bait on board as if for an evening off the tuskar where turbot and whitingpollack are here i fished until dusk of the night and as long as the people ashore could see me but as soon as all was dark and quiet i just pulled into newton bay and landed opposite the old red house where my new boat lay in ordinary snug as could be and all out of sight for the ruins of this old red house had such a repute for being haunted ever since a dreadful murder cast a ban around it that even i never wished to stop longer than need be there at night and once or twice i heard a noise that went to the marrow of my back of which however i will say no more until it comes to the proper place enough that no man woman or child for twenty miles round except myself had a conscience clear enough to go in there after dark and scarcely even by daylight my little craft was so light and handy that with the aid of the rollers ready i led her down over the beach myself and presently towed her out to sea with the water as smooth as a duckpond and the tide of the neap very silent the weather was such as i could not doubt being now so full of experience therefore i had no fear to lie in a very dangerous berth indeed when any cockle of a sea gets up or even strong tides are running this was the westend fork of the tuskar making what we call callipers for the back of the tuskar dries at halfebb and a wonderful ridge stops the run of the tide not only for weeds but for fish as well here with my anchor down i slept as only a virtuous man can sleep in the grey of the morning i was up ere the waning moon was done with and found the very thing to suit me going on delightfully the heavy dew of autumn rising from the land by perspiration spread a cloud along the shore a little mist was also crawling on the water here and there and having slept with a watchcoat and tarpaulin over me i shook myself up without an ache and like a good bee at the gate of the hive was brisk for making honey hence i pulled away from land with the heavy boat towing the light one and even sandy macraw unable to lay his gimlet eye on me and thus i rowed until quite certain of being over three miles from land then with the broad sun rising nobly and for a moment bowing till the white fog opened avenues i spread upon my pole a shirt which mother jones had washed for me it was the time when sandy macraw was bound to be up to his business and i had always made a point of seeing that he did it to have a low fellow of itchy character and no royal breed about him thrust by a feeble and reckless government into the berth that by nature was mine and to find him not content with this but even in his hours of duty poaching both day and night after my fish and when i desired to argue with him holding his tongue to irritate mesatisfaction there could be none for it the only alleviation left me was to rout up this man right early and allow him no chance of napping therefore i challenged him with my shirt thus early in the morning because he was bound to be watching the world if he acted up to his nasty business such as no seaman would deign to and after a quarter of an hour perhaps very likely it was his wife that answered at any rate there was a signal up and through my spyglass i saw that people wanted to launch a boat but failed therefore i made a great waving of shirt as much as to say extreme emergency have the courage to try again expecting something good from this they laid their shoulders and worked their legs and presently the boat was bowing on the gentlyfluted sea now it was not that i wanted help for i could have managed it all well enough but i wanted witnesses for never can i bear to seem to set at nought legality and these men were sure upon halfacrown to place the facts before the public in an honest manner so i let them row away for the very lives of them as if the salvage of the nation hung upon their thumbs and elbows only i dowsed my shirt as soon as i found them getting eager and i thought that they might as well hail me first and slope off disappointment hoy there boat ahoy what old davy llewellyn what man had a right to call me old there i was as fresh as ever and i felt it the more that the man who did it was grey on the cheeks with a very large family and himself that vile old sandy nevertheless i preserved good manners ship your starboard oars you lubbers do you want to run me down what the devil brings you here at this time of the morning hereupon these worthy fellows dropped their oars from wonder until i showed them their mistake and begged them to sheer off a little for if i had accepted rope such as they wished to throw me they might have put in adverse claims and made me pay for my own boat when a poor man has been at work all night said i to break off their officiousness while all you lazy galleyrakers were abed and snoring cant he put his shirt to dry without you wanting to plunder him to temper off what might appear a little rude though wholesome i now permitted them to see a stoneware gallon full of beer or at least i had only had two pints out finding this to be the case and being hot with rowing so rapidly to my rescue they were well content to have some beer and drop all further claims and as i never can bear to be mean i gave them the two and sixpence also sandy macraw took all this money and i only hope that he shared it duly and then as he never seemed at all to understand my contempt of him he spoke in that dry drawl of his which he always droned to drive me into very dreadful words and then to keep his distance i am heartily glad ma mon to see the loock ye have encoontered never shall ye say agin that i have the advantage of ye the boit stud me in mickle siller but ye have grappit a boit for nort i cannot write down his outlandish manner of pronouncing english nor will i say much more about it because he concealed his jealousy so that i had no enjoyment of it except when i reasoned with myself and i need have expected nothing better from such a selfcontrolling rogue but when we came to porthcawl pointwhere some shelter is from wind and two publichouses and one privatethe whole affair was so straightforward and the distance of my boat from shore at time of capture so established and so witnessed that no steward of any manor durst even cast sheepseyes at her a paper was drawn up and signed and the two publichouses at my expense christened her old davy and indeed for a little spell i had enough to do with people who came at all hours of the day to drink the health of my boat and me many of whom seemed to fail to remember really who was the one to pay and being still in cash a little and so generous always i found a whole basket of whiting and three large congers and a lobster disappear against chalkmarks whereof i had no warning and far worse no flavour but what i used to laugh at was that when we explained to one another how the law lay on this question and how the craft became legally mine as a derelict from the andalusia drifting at more than a league from landall our folk being short and shallow in the english language took up the word and called my boat all over the parish my relict as if in spite of the creators wisdom i were dead and my wife alive chapter xx confidential intercourse but everybody must be tired of all this trouble about that boat it shows what a state of things we live in and what a meddlesome lot we are that a good man cannot receive a gift straight into his hands from providence which never before rewarded him though he said his prayers every night almost and did his very best to cheat nobody it proves at least to my mind something very rotten somewhere when a man of blameless character must prove his right to what he finds however i had proved my right and cut in colonel loughers woods a larger pole than usual because the law would guarantee me if at all assaulted and truly after all my care to be on the right side of it such a vile attack of law was now impending on me that with all my study of it and perpetual attempts to jam its helm up almost into the very eye of reason my sails very nearly failed to draw and left me shivering in the wind but first for what comes foremost at that particular moment all things seemed to be most satisfactory here was my property duly secured and most useful to me here was a run of fish up from the mumbles of a very superior character here was my own reputation spread by the vigilance of the public press so that i charged three farthings apound more than sandy mac did and here was my cottage once more all alive with the mirth of our bunny and bardie to see them playing at hideandseek with two chairs and a table or french and english which i taught them or come and visit my grandmother or making a cat of the kettleholder with a pair of ears and a tail to it or giving a noble dinnerparty with cockles and oystershells and buttons and applepeel chopped finely or what was even a grander thing eating their own dinners prettily with their dolls beside themscarcely any one would have believed that these little ones had no mothers and yet they did not altogether seem to be forgetful or to view the world as if there were no serious side to it very grave discourse was sometimes held between their bouts of play and subjects of great depth and wonder introduced by dolls clothes for instance hasnt a got no mama poor bunny to thread e needle no my dear i answered for my grandchild looked stupid about it poor bunnys mother is gone to heaven my mama not gone to heaven my mama come demorrowday ise almost tired of yaiting old davy but she sure to come demorrowday but as the brave little creature spoke i saw that the dust was in her eyes this was her own expression always to escape the reproach of crying when her lonely heart was working with its misty troubles and sent the tears into her eyes before the tongue could tell of them demorrowday demorrowday all her loss was to be recovered always on demorrowday not even so much as a doll had been saved from the total wreck of her fortunes and when i beheld her wistful eyes set one day upon bunnys dollalthough only fit for hospital having one arm and one leg and no nose besides her neck being brokeni set to at once and sharpened my knife upon a piece of sandstone then i sought out a piece of abele laid by from the figurehead of a wrecked dutchman and in earnest i fell to and shaped such a carving of a doll as never was seen before or since of course the little pet came and stood and watched every chip as i sliced it along with sighs of deep expectancy and a laugh when i got to the tail of it and of course she picked up every one not only as neatest of the neat but also accounting them sacred offsets of the mysterious doll unborn i could not get her to go to bed and it was as good as a guinea to me to see the dancing in her eyes and the spring of her body returning e can make a boofely doll old davy but e doesnt know the yay to dess a doll you are quite wrong there said i perceiving that i should go up or down according to my assertion and it made her open her eyes to see me cut out with about five snips a pair of drawers quite good enough for any decent woman and she went to bed hugging the doll in that state and praying to have her improved tomorrow at breakfasttime mother jones dropped in for she loved a good saltherring and to lay down the law for the day almost as if i knew scarce anything and i always let her have her talk and listened to it gravely and clever women as a rule should not be denied of this attention for if they are it sours them while she was sucking the last of the tail and telling me excellent scandal my little lady marched in straight having finished her breakfast long ago and bearing her new doll pompously the flyaway colour in her cheeks which always made her beautiful and the sparkle of her gleeful eyes were come again with pleasure and so was the lovely pink of her lips and the proper aspect of her nose also she walked with such motherly rank throwing her legs with a female jerkit is enough for me to say that any newlymarried woman would have kissed her all round the room now mother jones having ten fine children five male and five female going about with clothes up to their forks need not have done what she did i think and made me so bashful in my own house for no sooner did she see this doll than she cried oh my and covered up her face the little maid looked up at me in great wonder as if i were leading her astray and i felt so angry with mrs jones after all the things i had seen abroad and even in english churches that i would not trust myself to speak however to pay her out for that i begged her to cure the mischief herself which she could not well decline and some of the green blind still remaining dolly became a most handsome sight with a crackle in front and a sweeping behind so that our clerk a good natured man was invited to christen her and patty green was the name he gave and bunnys doll was nobody such a babylike thing might seem almost below my dignity and that of all the rest of us only this child had the power to lead us as by a special enchantment back to our own childhood moreover it was needful for me to go through with this dolls birth still more so with her dress of course having her a female because through her i learned a great deal more of bardies history than ever our bunny could extract everybody who has no patience with the ways of childhood may be vexed and must be vexed with our shipwrecked maid for knowing many things but not the right but i think she was to blame only for her innocence in her tiny brain was moving some uncertain sense of wrong whether done by herself or to her was beyond her infant groping if she could have made her mind up in its little milky shell that the evil had befallen without harm on her part doubtless she had done her best to let us know the whole of it her best of course would be but little looking at her age and so on and perhaps from some harsh word or frown stamped into the tender flux of infantile memory a heavy dread both darkened and repressed much recollection hence if one tried to examine her in order to find out who she was she would shake her head and say no sompfin as she always did when puzzled or unable to pronounce a word the only chance of learning even any little things she knew was to leave her to her own way and not interrupt her conversation with wooden or crockery playmates all of these she endowed with life having such power of life herself and she reckoned them up for good behaviour or for bad as the case might be and often was i touched at heart after a day of bitter fighting with a world that wronged me by hearing her in babyprattle tell her playthings of their unkindness to a little thing with none to love her but when i had finished pattys face up to complete expression with two black buttons for her eyes and a cowry for her mouth and a nose of coral also a glorious head of hair of crinkled seaweed growing out of a shell toothed like an ivory comb almost the ecstasy of the child was such that i obtained as well as deserved some valuable information patty geen es been aye good i heard her say in my windowplace one morning after breakfast and e is the most boofely doll ever seen and i tell a sompfin only e musnt tell anybody till my dear mama comes nat wasnt ickle bother patty how do you know miss patty inquired by means of my voice in the distance and a little art i had learned abroad of throwing it into corners i tell a patty i tell a i ouldnt tell e nasty man but i tell old davy some day ickle bother not like nat at all ickle bother not so big enough and only two ickle teeth in front and his hair all gone ayay it is but mama say soon come back again and what is little brothers name said patty in a whisper and what is your name and papas oh e silly patty geen as if e didnt know ise bardie ever since i was anytin and papa is papa he is patty ise kite ashamed of a es such a silly ickle fin well i know i am not very clever miss but tell me some more things you remember i tell a if e stop kiet i ish a many happy turns of the day miss bardie many happy turns of the day to a and poor bardie get off her stool and say what her dear papa tell gentleyums and yadies ise aye much obiged to a and then have boofely appledies and carbies and a ickle dop of good yineypiney does e know hot that means poor patty no my dear how should i know e mustnt call me my dear i tell a e must know as pace in yife why es only a doll patty and bardies a young yady and a streamly cocious gal i is and the gentleyums all say so ickle bother cant say nuffin without me to sow him the yay of it but bardie say almost anyfin anyfin when i yikes to ty bardie say pomyoleanian dog this cost her a long breath and a great effort but patty expressed intense amazement at such power of diction and begged to know something more about that extraordinary animal pomyoleanian dog is yite yite all over sept his collar and his collars boo and hes got hair that long patty ever so much longer than yours and he yun yound and yound he does oh i do so yant my pomyoleanian dog patty waited for two great tears to run quietly down two little cheeks and then she expressed some contempt of the dog and a strong desire to hear some more about the happy turns of the day dont e be jealous now patty i tell a e ickle yite dog can eat but e cant and happy turns of the day is yen a geat big gal is two years old with a ickle bother and he cant say nuffin cos he grow too strong enough and e young yady must repy and ayebody yooks at a and yaffs and put e gasses up and say hot a cocious ickle fin and my dear papa say hot a good gal and mama come and tiss a all over amost and then e all have some more puddenypie overcome with that last memory she could go no further and being unable to give her pies i felt myself bound to abandon any more inquiries for that child scarcely ever roared so as to obtain relief but seemed with a kind of selfcontrolsuch as unlucky people form however early in their livesto take her troubles inwardly and to be full to the very lip of them without the power of spilling this though a comfort to other people is far worse for themselves i fear and i knew that she did love pastry rarely for one day after a fine pair of soles i said to the two children now put your little hands together and thank god for a good dinner bunny did this in a grateful manner but bardie said no i ont old davy ill thank god when i gets puddenypie upon the whole i concluded thus that the little creature was after all and as might have been expected with any other child almost too young in the third year of her age to maintain any clear ideas of place or time or names or doings or anything that might establish from her own words only whence she came or who she was however i now knew quite enough if the right people ever came to seek for her to dentify her as she expressed it to that stupid coroner moxy thomas came to fetch her back to sker in a few days time i was now resolved to keep her and she resolved to stay with meand doubtless i had first right to her but when i saw poor moxys face and called to mind her desolation and when she kissed my fishy hand to let her have this comfort after all the lord had taken from her i could not find it in my heart to stand to my own interest it came across me too that bardie scarcely throve on so much fish and we never had any butchers meat or meat of any kind at all unless i took shares in a pig after saving up money for christmas or contrived to defend myself against the hares that would run at me so when i happened to come through a gate at night so with a clearlypronounced brave roar having more music than bunnys in it and enough to wash a great deal of dust out of her woefully lingering eyes away she went in moxys arms with patty green in her own looking likely to get wet through and bunny stuck her thumbs into my legs which she had a knack of doing especially after sucking them so thus we stood at our cottage door looking after bardie and i took off my hat and she spread her hand out in the intervals of woe and little thought either of us i daresay of the many troubles in store for us both only before that grievous parting she had done a little thing which certainly did amaze me and if anybody knows the like i shall be glad to hear of it i had a snug and tidy locker very near the fireplace wherein i kept some little trifles such as bunny had an eye for but was gradually broken into distant admiration one morning i came suddenly in from looking to my nightlines and a pretty scene i saw the door of my cupboard was wide open and there stood little bardie giving a finishing lick to her fingers bunny also in the corner with her black eyes staring as if at the end of the world itself however her pinafore was full no sooner did my grandchild see me than she rushed away with shrieks casting down all stolen goods in agony of conscience i expected bardie to do the same but to my great wonderment up she walked and faced me must i beat poor patty geen the tears were in her eyes at having to propose so sad a thing and she stroked the doll to comfort her beat poor patty said i in amazement why what harm has patty done nare she have been all e time stealing a soogar old davy and she looked at me as if she had done a good turn by the information i scarcely knew what to do i declare for her doll was so truly alive to her that she might and perhaps did believe it however i shut her in my little bedroom until her heart was almost broken and then i tried to reason with her on the subject of telling lies but she could not understand what they were until i said what i was forced to do when i went among bad people that evening after she was gone and while i was very dull about it finding poor bunny so slow and stupid and nothing to keep me wide awakethere i was bound to be wide awake more than at petty sessions even when mine enemies throng against me for almost before i had smoked two pipes or made up my mind what to do with myself finding a hollow inside of me the great postingcoach from bridgend came up with the sun setting bright on its varnish and at my very door it stopped next to the driver sat a constable who was always unjust to me and from the inside came out first justice anthony stew of pen coed as odious and as meddlesome a justice of the peace as ever signed a warrant and after him came a tall elderly gentleman on whom i had never set eyes before but i felt that he must be a magistrate chapter xxi crossexamination those justices of the peace although appointed by his majesty have never been a comfort to me saving only colonel lougher they never seem to understand me or to make out my desires or to take me at my word as much as i take them at theirs my desire has always been to live in a painfully loyal manner to put up with petty insults from customers who know no better leaving them to selfreflection and if possible to repentance while i go my peaceful way nor let them hear their money jingle or even spend it in their sight to be pleased and trustful also with the folk who trust in me and rather to abandon much and give back twopence in a shilling than cause any purchaser selfreproach for having sworn falsely before the benchnow if all this would not do to keep me out of the sessionbooks can any man point out a clearer proof of the vicious administration of what they call justice around our parts and when any trumpery case was got up on purpose to worry and plague me the only chance left me of any fairplay was to throw up my days work and wear out my shoes in trudging to candleston court to implore that good colonel lougher to happen to sit on the bench that day when those two gentlemen alighted from that rickety old coach and ordered that very low constable to pace to and fro at the door of my house boldly i came out to meet them having injured no man nor done harm of any sort that i could think of lately stew came first a man of no lineage but pushed on by impudence anthony stew can look you through an english poacher said of him and this he tried always to do with me and thoroughly welcome he was to succeed i will not say that my inner movements may not have been uneasy in spite of all my rectitude however i showed their two worships inside in the very host style of the quarterdeck such as i had gathered from that coroneted captain my proud connection with whom perhaps i may have spoken of ere this or at any rate ought to have done so for i had the honour of swabbing his pumps for him almost every morning and he was kind enough to call me davy every briton in his own house is bound to do his utmost so i touched my grey forelock and made two good bows and set a chair for each of them happening to have no more just now though with plenty of money to buy them selfcontrolled as i always am many things had tried me of late almost to the verge of patience such imputations as fall most tenderly on a sorrowful widower and my pure admiration of bardie and certainty of her lofty birth had made me the more despise such foulness so it came to pass that two scandalous men were given over by the doctors for the pole i had cut was a trifle too thick nevertheless they recovered bravely and showed no more gratitude towards god than to take out warrants against me but their low devices were frustrated by the charge being taken before colonel lougher and what did that excellent magistrate do he felt himself compelled to do something therefore he fined me a shilling per head for the two heads broken with s costs which he paid as usual and gave me a very severe reprimand llewellyn he said the time is come for you to leave off this course of action i do not wonder that you felt provoked but you must seek for satisfaction in the legal channels suppose these men had possessed thin heads why you might have been guilty of murder make out his commitment to cardiff gaol in default of immediate payment all this was good and sustained ones faith in the efficacy of british law and trusting that nothing might now be amiss in the minds of these two magistrates i fetched the block of sycamore whereupon my fish were in the habit of having their fins and tails chopped off and there i sate down and presented myself both ready and respectful on the other hand my visitors looked very grave and silent whether it were to prolong my doubts or as having doubts of their own perhaps your worships i began at last in fear of growing timorous with any longer waitingyour worships must have driven far to see you llewellyn squire stew said with a nasty snap hoping the more to frighten me not only a pleasure to me your worships but a very great honour to my poor house what will your worships be pleased to eat butchers meat i would have had if only i had known of it but one thing i can truly say my cottage has the best of fish that i can believe said stew because you sell all the worst to me another such a trick llewellyn and i have you in the stocks this astonished me so muchfor his fish had never died over four daysthat nothing but my countenance could express my feelings i crave your pardon justice stew said the tall grey gentleman with the velvet coat as he rose in a manner that overawed me for he stood a good foot over anthony stew and a couple of inches over me may we not enter upon the matter which has led us to this place certainly sir philip certainly stew replied with a style which proved that sir philip must be of no small position all i meant sir philip was just to let you see the sort of fellow we have to deal with my integrity is well known i answered turning from him to the gentleman not only in this parish but for miles and miles round it is not my habit to praise myself and in truth i find no necessity even a famous newspaper so far away as bristol the celebrated felix farleys journal just so said the elder gentleman it is that which has brought us here although as i fear on a hopeless errand with these words he leaned away as if he had been long accustomed to be disappointed to me it was no small relief to find their business peaceable and that neither a hare which had rushed at me like a lion through a gate by moonlight nor a stupid covey of partridges nineteen in number which gave me no peace while excluded from my drippingpan nor even a pheasant cock whose crowing was of the most insulting tonethat none of these had been complaining to the bench emboldened me and renewed my sense of reason but i felt that justice stew could not be trusted for a moment to take this point in a proper light therefore i kept my wits in the chains taking soundings of them both now llewellyn no nonsense mind began squire stew with his face like a hatchet and scollops over his eyebrows what we are come for is very simple and need not unsettle your conscience as you have allowed it to do i fear keep your aspect of innocent wonder for the next time you are brought before me i only wish your fish were as bright and slippery as you are may i humbly ask what matter it pleases your worship to be thinking of oh of course you cannot imagine davy but let that pass as you were acquitted by virtue of your innocent face in the teeth of all the evidence if you had only dropped your eyes instead of wondering so muchbut never mind stare as you may some day we shall be sure to have you now i will put it to anybody whether this was not too bad in my own house and with the bench seated on my own best chairs however knowing what a man he was and how people do attribute to me things i never dreamed of and what little chance a poor man has if he takes to contradiction all i did was to look my feelings which were truly virtuous nor were they lost upon sir philip you will forgive me good sir i hope he said to squire anthony but unless we are come with any charge against thismr llewellyn it is hardly fair to reopen any awkward questions of which he has been acquitted in his own house moreover and when he has offered kind hospitality to usin a word i will say no more here he stopped for fear perhaps of vexing the other magistrate and i touched my grizzled curl and said sir i thank you for a gentleman this was the way to get on with me instead of driving and bullying for a gentleman or a lady can lead me to any extremes of truth but not a lawyer much less a justice and anthony stew had no faith in truth unless she came out to his own corkscrew british tar he exclaimed with his nasty sneer now for some more of your heroism you look as if you were up for doing something very glorious i have seen that colour in your cheeks when you sold me a sewin that shone in the dark a glorious exploit wasnt it now that it was your worship to such a customer as you while anthony stew was digesting this which seemed a puzzle to him the tall grey gentleman feeling but little interest in my commerce again desired to hurry matters forgive me again i beseech you good sir but ere long it will be dark and as yet we have learned nothing leave it all to me sir philip your wisest plan is to leave it to me i know all the people around these parts and especially this fine fellow i have made a sort of study of him because i consider him what i may call a thoroughly typical character i am not a typical character i answered overhastily for i found out afterwards what he meant i never tipple but when i drink my rule is to go through with it squire stew laughed loud at my mistake as if he had been a great scholar himself and even sir philip smiled a little in his sweet and lofty manner no doubt but i was vexed for a moment scenting though i could not see error on my own part but now i might defy them both ever to write such a book as this for vanity has always been so foreign to my nature that i am sure to do my best and after all think nothing of it so long as people praise me and now in spite of all rude speeches if sir philip had only come without that squire anthony not a thing of all that happened would i have retained from him it is hopeless for people to say that my boat crippled speech on my part tush i would have pulled her plug out on the tail of the tuskar rather than one moment stand against the light for bardie squire stew asked me all sorts of questions having no more substance in them than the blowinghole at the end of an egg or the bladder of a skatefish all of these i answered boldly finding his foot outside my shoes and so he came back again as they do after trying foolish excursions to the very point he started with am i to understand my good fellow that the ship which at least you allow to be wrecked may have been or might have been something like a foreigner therein lies the point whereon your worship cannot follow me any more than could the coroner neither he nor his clerk nor the rest of the jury would listen to commonsense about it that ship no more came from appledore than a whale was hatched from a herrings egg i knew it i knew it broke in sir philip they have only small coasters at appledore i said that the newspaper must be wrong however for the sake of my two poor sons i am bound to leave no clue unfollowed there is nothing more to be done mr stew except to express my many and great obligations for your kindness herewith he made a most stately bow and gave even me a corner of it stay sir philip one moment more this fellow is such a crafty file certain i am that he never would look so unnaturally frank and candid unless he were in his most slippery mood you know the old proverb i daresay put a taffy on his mettle hell boil old nick in his own fishkettle dyo where did your boat come from this question he put in a very sudden and i might well say vicious manner darting a glance at me like the snakes tongues in the island of das cobras i felt such contempt that i turned my back and gave him a view of the boofely buckens admired so much by bardie well done he cried your resources dyo are an infinite credit to you and do you know when i see your back i can almost place some faith in you it is broad and flat and sturdy dyo ah many a fine hare has swung there head downwards nevertheless we must see this boat nothing irritates me more than what low englishmen call chaff i like to be pleasant and jocular upon other people but i dont like that sort of thing tried upon me when i am not in the humour for it therefore i answered crustily your worship is welcome to see my boat and go to sea in her if you please with the plug out of her bottom under porthcawl point she lies and all the people there know all about her only i will beg your worship to excuse my presence lest you should have low suspicions that i came to twist their testimony well said david well said my fine fellow almost i begin to believe thee in spite of all experience now sir philip your pardon good sir i follow you into the carriage so off they set to examine my boat and i hoped to see no more of them for one thing was certainto wit that their coachman never would face the sandhills and no road ever is or ever can be to porthcawl so that these two worthy gentlemen needs must exert their noble legs for at least onehalf of the distance and knowing that squire stews soles were soft i thought it a blessing for him to improve the only soft part about him chapter xxii another disappointment highly pleased with these reflections what did i do but take a pipe and sit like a lord at my own doorway having sent poor bunny with a smack to bed because she had shown curiosity for this leading vice of the female race cannot be too soon discouraged but now i began to fear almost that it would be growing too dark very soon for me to see what became of the carriage returning with those two worships moreover i felt that i had no right to let them go so easily without even knowing sir philips surname or what might be the especial craze which had led them to honour me so and sundry other considerations slowly prevailed over me until it would have gone sore with my mind to be kept in the dark concerning them so when heavy dusk of autumn drove in over the notch of sandhills from the faraway of sea and the green of grass was gone and you hardly could tell a boy from a girl among the children playing unless you knew their mothers i rejoicing in their pleasures quite forgot the justices for all our children have a way of letting out their liveliness such as makes old people feel a longing to be in with them not like bardie of course but still a satisfactory feeling and the better my tobacco grew the sweeter were my memories before i had courted my wife and my sweethearts a dozen and ahalf perhaps or at the outside say two dozen anything more than twice apiece in the gentle cud of memory and with very quiet sighs indeed for echoes of great thumping ones and just as i wondered what execution a beautiful child with magnificent legs would do when i lay in the churchyardall of a heap i was fetched out of dreaming into commonsense again there was the great yellow coach at the corner of the old grey wall that stopped the sand and all the village children left their hideandseek to whisper having fallen into a different mood from that of curiosity and longing only for peace just now or tender styles of going back went i into my own cottage hoping to hear them smack whip and away even my hand was on the boltfor a bolt i had now on account of the cats who understand every manner of latch wherever any fish beand perhaps it is a pity that i did not shoot it but there came three heavy knocks and i scarcely had time to unbutton my coat in proof of their great intrusion before i was forced to show my face and beg to know their business now dyo dyo said that damned stew saving your presence i cant call him else this is a little too bad of you retiring ere dusk aha aha and how many hours after midnight will you keep your hornpipes up among the jolly sailors great davy i admire you i saw that it was not in his power to enter into my state of mind nor could i find any wit in his jokes supposing them to be meant for such well what did your worships think of porthcawl i asked after setting the chairs again while i bustled about for my tinderbox did you happen to come across the man whose evil deeds are always being saddled upon me we found a respectable worthy scotchman whose name is alexander macraw and who told us more in about five minutes than we got out of you in an hour or more he has given us stronger reason to hope that we may be on the right track at last to explain a most painful mystery and relieve sir philip from the most cruel suspense and anxiety at these words of squire anthony the tall grey gentleman with the velvet coat bowed and would fain have spoken but feared perhaps that his voice would tremble macraw thinks it highly probable justice stew continued that the ship though doubtless a foreigner may have touched on the opposite coast for supplies after a long ocean voyage and though sir philip has seen your boat and considers it quite a stranger that proves nothing either way as the boat of course would belong to the ship but one very simple and speedy way there is of settling the question you thought proper to conceal the fact that the coroner had committed to your charge as foreman of the juryand a precious jury it must have beenso as to preserve near the spot in case of any inquiry the dress of the poor child washed ashore this will save us the journey to sker which in the dusk would be dangerous david llewellyn produce that dress under my authority that i will your worship with the greatest pleasure i am sure i would have told you all about it if i had only thought of it ahem was all squire stews reply for a horribly suspicious man hates such downright honesty but without taking further notice of him i went to my locker of old black oak and thence i brought that upper garment something like a pinafore the sight of which had produced so strong an effect upon the coroner it was made of the very finest linen and perhaps had been meant for the child to wear in lieu of a frock in some hot climate as i brought this carefully up to the table squire stew cried light another candle just as if i kept the village shop this i might have done at one time if it had only happened to me at the proper period to marry the niece of the man that lived next door to the chapel where they dried the tealeaves she took a serious liking to me with my navy trousers on but i was fool enough to find fault with a little kink in her starboard eye i could have carried on such a trade with my knowledge of what people are and description of foreign climateshowever it was not to be and i had to buy my candles as soon as we made a fine strong light both the gentlemen came nigh and sir philip who had said so little even now forbore to speak i held the poor dress tattered by much beating on the points of rocks and as i unrolled it slowly he withdrew his long white hands lest we should remark their quivering you are not such fools as i thought said stew it is a coronet beyond doubt i can trace the lines and crossings though the threads are frayed a little and here in the corner a moneygrumah you never saw that you stupesdo you know the mark sir i do not sir philip answered and seemed unable to fetch more words and then like a strong man turned away to hide all disappointment even anthony stew had the manners to feel that here was a sorrow beyond his depth and he covered his sense of it like a gentleman by some petty talk with me and it made me almost respect him to find that he dropped all his banter as out of season but presently the tall grey gentleman recovered from his loss of hope and with a fine brave face regarded us and his voice was firm and very sweet it is not right for me to cause you pain by my anxieties and i fear that you will condemn me for dwelling upon them overmuch but you mr stew already know and you my friend have a right to know after your kind and ready help that it is not only the piteous loss of two little innocent children very dear ones both of them but also the loss of fair repute to an honourable family and the cruel suspicion cast upon a fine brave fellow who would scorn sir who would scorn for the wealth of all this kingdom to hurt the hair of a babys head here sir philips voice was choked with indignation more than sorrow and he sat down quickly and waved his hand as much as to say i am an old fool i had much better not pretend to talk and much as i longed to know all about it of course it was not my place to ask exactly my dear sir exactly squire anthony went on for the sake of saying something i understand you my dear sir and feel for you and respect you greatly for your manly fortitude under this sad calamity trust in providence my dear sir as indeed i need not tell you i will do my best but this is now the seventh disappointment we have had it would have been a heavy blow of course to have found the poor little fellow dead but even that with the recovery of the other would have been better than this dark mystery and above all would have freed the living from these maddening suspicions but as it is we must try to bear it and to say gods will be done but i am thinking too much about ourselves mr stew i am very ungrateful not to think more of your convenience you must be longing to be at home at your service sir philipquite at your service my time is entirely my own this was simply a bit of brag and i saw that he was beginning to fidget for bold as his worship was on the bench we knew that he was but a coward at board where mrs stew ruled with a rod of iron and now it was long past dinnertime even in the finest houses one thing more then before we go answered sir philip rising according to the newspaper and as i hear one young maiden was really saved from that disastrous shipwreck i wish we could have gone on to see her but i must return tomorrow morning having left many anxious hearts behind and to cross the sands in the dark they say is utterly impossible not at all sir philip said i very firmly for i honestly wished to go through with it although the sand is very deep there is no fear at all if one knows the track it is only the cowardice of these people ever since the sandstorm i would answer to take you in the darkest night if only i had ever learned to drive but anthony stew broke in with a smile it would grieve me to sit behind you dyo and i trow that sir philip would never behold appledore again there is nothing these sailors will not attempt although i could sit the bowthwart of a cart very well with a boy to drive me and had often advised the hand at the tiller and sometimes as much as held the whip all this to my diffidence seemed too little to warrant me in navigating a craft that carried two horses sir philip looked at me and perhaps he thought that i had not the cut of a coachman however all he said was this in spite of your kindness mr stew and your offer my good sirthis was to me with much dignityi perceive that we must not think of it and of what use could it be except to add new troubles to old ones sir i have trespassed too much on your kindness in a minute i will follow you anthony stew being thus addressed was only too glad to skip into the carriage by by dyo he cried mend your ways if you can my man i think you have told fewer lies than usual knock off one every time of speaking and in ten years you will speak the truth of this low rubbish i took no heed any more than any one would who knows me especially as i beheld sir philip signalling with his purse to me so that stew might not be privy to it entering into the spirit of this i had some pleasant memories of gentlemanly actions done by the superior classes towards me but longer agone than i could have desired and now being out of the habit of it i showed some natural reluctance to begin again unless it were really worth my while sir philip understood my feelings and i rose in his esteem so that halfguineas went back to his pocket and guineas took the place of them mr llewellyn i know he said that you have served your country well and it grieves me to think that on my account you have met with some harsh words today if your worship only knew how little a thing of that sort moves me when i think of the great injustice but i suppose it must be expected by a poor man such as i am justice stew is spoiled by having so many rogues to deal with i always make allowance for him and of course i know that he likes to play with the lofty character i bear if i had his house and his rich estatebut it does not matterafter all what are we ah you may well say that llewellyn two months ago i could not have believedbut who are we to find fault with the doings of our maker all will be right if we trust in him although it is devilish hard to do but that poor maid at that wretched placewhat is to become of her she has me to look after her your worship and she shall not starve while i have a penny bravely said llewellyn my son is a sailor and i understand them i know that i can trust you fully to take charge of a trifle for her i love the maid i answered truly i would sooner rob myself than her of course you would after saving her life i have not time to say much to you only take this trifle for the benefit of that poor thing from a red leathern bag he took out ten guineas and hastily plunged them into my hand not wishing stew to have knowledge of it but i was desirous that everybody should have the chance to be witness of it and so i held my hand quite open and just at that moment our bunny snored what have you children yourself llewellyn i thought that you were an old bachelor an ancient widower your worship with a little grandchild and how to keep her to the mark with father none and mother none quite takes me off my head sometimes let me light your honour to your carriage not for a moment if you please i wish i had known all this before mr stew never told me a word of this it would have been strange if he had said i he is always so bitter against me because he can never prove anything then llewellyn you must oblige me spend this trifle on clothes and things for that little snorer he gave me a little crisp affair feeling like a childs caul dried and i thought it was no more than that however i touched my brow and thanked him as he went to the carriagesteps and after consulting all the village i found it a stanch pledge from the government for no less than five pounds sterling chapter xxiii into good society in spite of all that poor landsmen say about equinoctial gales and so on we often have the loveliest weather of all the year in september if this sets in it lasts sometimes for three weeks or a month together then the sky is bright and fair with a firm and tranquil blue not so deep of tint or gentle as the blue of springtide but more truly staid and placid and far more trustworthy the sun both when he rises over the rounded hills behind the cliffs and when he sinks into the level of the width of waters shines with ripe and quiet lustre to complete a year of labour as the eastern in the morning so at sunset the western heaven glows with an even flush of light through the entire depth pervading and unbroken by any cloud then at dusk the dew fog wavers in white stripes over the meadowland or in winding combes benighted pillows down and leaves its impress a sparkling path for the suns return to my mind no other part of the year is pleasanter than this end of harvest with golden stubble and orchards gleaming and the hedgerows turning red then fish are in season and fruit is wholesome and the smell of sweet brewing is rich on the air this beautiful weather it was that tempted colonel lougher and lady bluett to take a trip for the day to sker the distance from candleston court must be at least two good leagues of sandy road or rather of sand without any road for a great part of the journey therefore instead of their heavy coach they took a light twowheeled car and a steadygoing pony which was very much wiser of them also which was wiser still they had a good basket of provisions intending to make a long seaside day and expecting a lively appetite i saw them pass through newton as i chanced to be mending my nets by the well and i touched my hat to the colonel of course and took it off to the lady the colonel was driving himself so as not to be cumbered with any servant and happening to see such a basket of food i felt pretty sure there would be some over for the quality never eat like us then it came into my memory that they could not bear evan thomas and it struck me all of a sudden that it might be well worth my while to happen to meet them upon their return before they passed any poor houses as well as to happen to be swinging an empty basket conspicuously it was a provident thought of mine and turned out as well as its foresight deserved they passed a very pleasant day at sker as i was told that evening pushing about among rocks and stones and routing out this that and the other of shells and seaweed and starfish and all the rest of the rubbish such as amuses great gentry because they have nothing to do for their living and though money is nothing to them they always seem to reckon what they find by moneyvalue not colonel lougher of course i mean and even less lady bluett i only speak of some grand people who come raking along our beach and of all of these there was nobody with the greediness anthony stew had a crab that had died in changing his shell would hardly come amiss to him let that passwho cares about him i wish to speak of better people the colonel though he could not keep illwill against any one on earth did not choose to be indebted to skergrange for even so much as a bite of hay for his pony partly perhaps that he might not appear to play false to his own tenantry for the nottage farmers who held of the colonel were always at feud with evan thomas therefore he baited the pony himself after easing off some of the tackle and moored him to an ancient post in a little sheltered hollow their rations also he left in the car for even if any one did come by none would ever think of touching this good magistrates property quite early in the afternoon their appetites grew very brisk by reason of the crisp seabreeze and sparkling freshness of the waves accordingly after consultation they agreed that the time was come to see what crumpy their honest old butler had put into the basket the colonel held his sisters hand to help her up rough places and breasting a little crest of rushes they broke upon a pretty sight which made them both say hush and wonder in a hollow place of sand spread with dry white bones skates pouches blades of cuttlefish seasnail shells and all the other things that storm and sea drive into and out of the sands a very tiny maid was sitting holding audience all alone she seemed to have no sense at all of loneliness or of earthly trouble in the importance of the moment and the gravity of play before her sat three little dolls arranged according to their rank cleverly posted in chairs of sand the one in the middle was patty green the other two strange imitations fashioned by young watkins knife each was urging her claim to shells which the mistress was dispensing fairly and with good advice to each then laughing at herself and them and trying to teach them a nurserysong which broke down from forgetfulness and all the while her quick bright face and the crisp grain of her attitudes and the jerk of her thick short curls were enough to make any one say what a queer little soul therefore it is not to be surprised at that colonel lougher could not make her out or that while he was feeling about for his eyeglass of best crystal his sister was as behoves a female rasher to express opinion for she had lost a little girl and sometimes grieved about it still what a queer little dear little thing henry i never saw such a child where can she have dropped from did you see any carriage come after us it is useless to tell me that she can belong to any of the people about here look at her forehead and look at her manners and how she touches everything now did you see that what a wonderful child every movement is grace and delicacy oh you pretty darling her ladyship could wait no longer for the colonels opinion which he was inclined to think of ere he should come out with it and she ran down the sandhill almost faster than became her dignity but if she had been surprised before how was she astonished now at bardies reception of her done tush knee tushy paw see voo pay all e dollies is yae good just going to dinny and e mustnt poil their appeties and the little atom arose and moved lady bluetts skirt out of her magic circle and then having saved her children she stood scarcely up to the ladys knee and looked at her as much as to ask are you of the quality and being well satisfied on that point she made what the lady declared to be the most elegant curtsy she ever had seen meanwhile the colonel was coming up in a dignified manner and leisurely perceiving no cause to rush through rushes and knowing that his sister was often too quick this had happened several times in the matter of beggars and people on crutches and skincollectors and suchlike who cannot always be kept out of the way of ladies and his worship the colonel had been compelled to endeavour to put a stop to it therefore as the best man in the world cannot in reason be expected to be in a moment abreast with the sallies of even the best womankind but likes to see to the bottom of it the colonel came up crustily eleanor can you not see that the child does not wish for your interference her brothers and sisters are sure to be here from kenfig most likely or at any rate some of her relations and busy perhaps with our basket no said the child looking up at him ise got no lations now all gone ayae but all come back demorrow day why henry what are we thinking of this must be the poor little girl that was wrecked and i wanted you so to come down and see her but you refused on account of her being under the care of farmer thomas no my dear not exactly that but on account of the trouble in the house i did not like to appear to meddle whatever your reason was answered the lady no doubt you were quite right but now i must know more of this poor little thing come and have some dinner with us my darling i am sure you must be hungry dont be afraid of the colonel he loves little children when they are good but poor bardie hung down her head and was shy which never happened to her with me or any of the common people she seemed to know as if by instinct that she was now in the company of her equals lady bluett however was used to children and very soon set her quite at ease by inviting her dolls and coaxing them and listening to their histories and all the other little turns that unlock the hearts of innocence so it came to pass that the castaway dined in good society for the first time since her great misfortune here she behaved so prettily and i might say elegantly that colonel lougher who was of all men the most thoroughly just and upright felt himself bound to confess his error in taking her for a kenfig nobody now as it happened to be his birthday the lady had ordered mr crumpy the butler to get a bottle of the choicest wine and put it into the hamper without saying anything to the colonel so that she might drink his health and persuade him to do himself the like good turn having done this she gave the child a drop in the bottom of her own wineglass which the little one tossed off most fluently and with a sigh of contentment said ise not had a dop of that yineypiney ever sincesompfin why what wine do you call it my little dear the colonel asked being much amused with her air of understanding it doesnt a know she replied with some pity nats hot i calls a dop of good sam paine give her some more said the colonel upon my word she deserves it eleanor you were right about her she is a wonderful little thing all the afternoon they kept her with them being more and more delighted with her as she began to explain her opinions and watty who came to look after her was sent home with a shilling in his pocket and some of the above i learned from him and some from mr crumpy who was a very great friend of mine and a part from little bardie and the rest even from her good ladyship except what trifles i add myself being gifted with power of seeing things that happen in my absence this power has been in my family for upwards of a thousand years coming out and forming great bards sometimes and at other times great storytellers therefore let no one find any fault or doubt any single thing i tell them concerning some people who happen just now to be five or six shelves in the world above me for i have seen a great deal of the very highest society when i cleaned my earls pumps and epaulettes and waited upon him at breakfast and i know well how those great people talk not from observation only but by aid of my own fellowfeeling for them which perhaps owes its power of insight not to my own sagacity only but to my ancestors lofty positions as poets to royal families now although i may have mentioned this to the man of the presswhose hat appeared to have undergone press experiencei have otherwise kept it quite out of sight because every writer should hold himself entirely round the corner and discover his hand but not his face to as many as kindly encourage him of late however it has been saidnot by people of our own parish who have seen and heard me at the well and elsewhere but by persons with no more right than power to form opinionsthat i cannot fail of breaking down when i come to describe great people to these my answer is quite conclusive from my long connection with royalty lasting over a thousand years i need not hesitate to describe the prince of wales himself and inasmuch as his royal highness is not of pure ancient british descent i verily doubt whether he could manage to better my humble style to my liking enough of that i felt doubts at beginning but i find myself stronger as i get on you may rely upon me now to leave the question to your own intelligence the proof of the pudding is in the eating and if any one fears that i cannot cook it i only beg him to wait and see lady bluett was taken so much with my bardie and the colonel the samethough he tried at first to keep it underthat nothing except their own warm kindness stopped them from making off with her the lady had vowed that she would do so for it would be so much for the little souls good and of course so far as legality went the chiefjustice of the neighbourhood had more right to her than a common rough farmer but watty came down being sent by moxy after he went home with that shilling and must needs make show of it he came down shyly from habit of nature to the black eyebrows of the tide where the colonel and bardie were holding grand play with the top of the spring running up to them she was flying at the wink of every wave and trying to push him back into it and he was laughing with all his heart at her spry ways and audacity and the quickness of her smiles and frowns and the whole of her nature one whirl of play till he thought nothing more of his coattails what do you want here boy the colonel asked being not best pleased that a man of his standing should be caught in the middle of such antics watkin opened his great blue eyes and opened his mouth as well but could not get steerageway on his tongue being a boy of great reverence little fellow what are you come for with these words he smiled on the boy and was vexed with himself for frightening him oh sir oh sir if you please sir mother says as miss delushy must come home to bed sir e go ayay now e bad yatkin i ants more pay with my dear colonel yucca i am not at all sure said the colonel laughing that i shall not put her into my car and drive away with her watkin you may go home my good boy and tell your mother that we have taken this poor little dear to candleston this of course was lady bluett you should have seen watkins face they told me when i came to hear of it betwixt his terror of giving offence and his ignorance how to express his meaning and the sorrow he felt on his mothers account and perhaps his own pain also not a word had he to say but made a grope after the babys hands then the little child ran up to him and flung both arms around his leg and showed the stanchness of her breed could any one even of six years old better enter into it i yoves yatkin yatkin is aye good and kind and i yoves poor moky i ont go ayay till my dear papa and my dear mamma comes for me lady bluett being quick and soft could not keep her tears from starting and the colonel said it must be so we might have done a great wrong my dear consider alland here he whispered out of watkins hearing and the lady nodded sadly having known what trouble is but the last words he spoke bravely god has sent her for a comfort where he saw that it was needed we must not give way to a passing fancy against a deep affliction only we will keep our eyes upon this little orphan darling chapter xxiv sound investments the springtides led me to sker the next day and being full early for the ebb i went in to see what the colonel had done for if he should happen to take up the child she would pass out of my hands altogether which might of course be a serious injury as well as a very great hardship for of moxys claim i had little fear if it came to a question of title inasmuch as i had made her sign a document prepared and copied by myself clearly declaring my prior right in virtue of rescue and providential ordinance but as against colonel lougher i durst not think of asserting my claims even if the law were with me and not only so but i felt all along that the matter was not one for money to heal but a question of the deepest feelings and now the way in which moxy came out while bardie was making much of me who always saw everything first of course and the style of her meddling in between us led me to know that a man has no chance to be up to the tricks of a female for the dialogue going on between us was of the very simplest nature as you may judge by the following hyse a been so long old davy afore a come to see poor bardie because my pretty dear i have been forced to work all day long almost hasnt a had no time to pay no my dear not a moment to play work work work money money money till old davy is quite worn out i may have put horns to the truth in this but at any rate not very long ones and the child began to ponder it i tell a old davy hot to do susan say to me one day kite yell i amember ickle bardie made of money does a sink so i think you are made of gold you beauty and of diamonds and the revelations aye yell then i tell a hot to do take poor bardie to markiss old davy and e get a great big money for her she must have seen some famous market for acting everything as she did by means of working face arms and legs she put herself up like a fowl in a basket and spread herself making the most of her breast and limping her neck as the dead chickens do before i could begin to laugh moxy was upon us dyo why for you come again never you used to come like this put down delushy directly moment no fish she is for you to catch when you might have had her here you left her through the face of everything and now because great evans staff is cloven by the will of god who takes not advantage of him i thought you would have known better dyo and this little one that he dotes upon it is enough i answered with a dignity which is natural to me when females wound my feelings madame thomas it is enough i will quit your premises with these words i turned away and never looked over my shoulder even though the little one screamed after me until i felt watty hard under my stern and like a kedgeanchor dragging therefore i let them apologise till my desire was to forgive them and after they brought forth proper things i denied all evil will and did my best to accomplish it mrs thomas returning slowly to her ancient style with me as i relaxed my dignity said that now the little maid was getting more at home with them mr thomas after what had happened in the neighbourhoodthis was the death of her five sonsfelt naturally low of spirit and it was good for him to have a lively child around him he did not seem quite what he was and nothing brought him to himself so much as to watch this shadow of life although she was still afraid of him every word of this was clear to me it meant ten times what it expressed because our common people have a height of kindness some would say and some a depth of superstition such as leads them delicately to slope off their meaning but in my blunt and sailor fashion i said that black evan must i feared be growing rather shaky i had better have kept this opinion quiet for moxy bestowed on me such a gaze of pity mingled with contempt that knowing what sort of a man he had been i felt all abroad about everything all i could say to myself was this that the only woman of superior mind i ever had the luck to come across and carefully keep clear of had taken good care not to have a husband supposing there had been the occasion and i think i made mention of her before because she had been thrice disappointed and all she said was true almost however skerhouse might say just what it pleased while i had my written document and delushy herself as they stupidly called her by corruption of andalusia was not inclined to abandon me and now she made them as jealous as could be for she clung to me fast with one hand while she spread the beautiful tiny fingers of the other to moxy as much as to say interrupt me not i have such a lot of things to tell old davy and so she had without any mistake and the vast importance of each matter lost nothing for want of emphasis patty green had passed through a multitude of most surprising adventures some of them even transcending her larceny of my sugar watty had covered himself with glory and above all little dutch the sheepdog was now become a most benevolent and protecting power hots a think old davy patty geen been yecked she has yecked i dont know what that is my dear ness i said yecked old davy yecked down nare same as bardie was it was clear that she now had taken up with the story which everybody told and she seemed rather proud of having been wrecked and patty she went on quite out of breath patty poiled all her boofely cothes such a mess e never see amost and poor patty go to e back pithole till e boofely dush yun all into e yater oh and dutch pulled her out again did she ness and her head come kite out of her neck but yatty put e guepot on and make it much better than ever amost now delushy what a child you are cried mrs thomas proudly you never told mr llewellyn that you ran into the sea yourself to save your doll and drownded you must have been but for our watkin bardie poil her cothes she said looking rather shy about it bardies cothes not boofely now not same as they used to be but if she regretted her change of apparel she had ceased by this time moxy said to fret much for her father and mother for watkin or some one had inspired her with a most comforting ideato wit that her parents had placed her there for the purpose of growing faster and that when she had done her best to meet their wishes in this respect they would suddenly come to express their pride and pleasure at her magnitude little brother also would appear in state and so would susan and find it needful to ascend the dairystool to measure her as at present her curly head was scarcely up to the mark of that stool the duty of making a timely start in this grand business of growing became at once selfevident to be a geat big gal was her chief ambition inasmuch as hen ise a geat big gal mama and papa be so peased and say hot a good gal e is bardie to do as i tell a often when her heart was heavy in the loneliness of that house and the loss of all she loved and with dirty things around her the smile would come back to her thoughtful eyes and she would open her mouth again for the coarse but wholesome food which was to make a big gal of her believing herself now well embarked toward this desired magnitude she had long been making ready for the joy it would secure e come and see old davy i sow a sompfin she whispered to me when she thought the others were not looking so i gave a wink to moxy thomas whose misbehaviour i had overlooked and humouring the child i let her lead me to her sacred spot this was in an unused passage with the end door nailed to jambs and black oakpanelling along it and a floor of lias stone none in the house durst enter it except this little creature at least unless there were three or four to hearten one another and a strong sun shining the abbots walk was its proper name because a certain abbot of neath who had made too much stir among the monks received as we say his quietus there during a winter excursion and in spite of all the masses said could not keep his soul at rest therefore his soul came up and down and that is worse than a dozen spirits for the soul can groan but the spirit is silent into this dark lonely passage i was led by a little body too newly inhabited by spirit to be at all afraid of it and she came to a cupboard door and tugged and made a face as usual when the button was hard to move but as for allowing me to help hernot a bit of it if you please with many grunts and jerks of breath at last she fetched it outward having made me promise first not to touch however grand and tempting might be the scene disclosed to me what do you think was there collected and arranged in such a system that no bee could equal it why every bit of everything that every one who loved her which amounts to everybody ever had bestowed upon her for her own sweet use and pleasure since ashore she came to us not a lollipop was sucked not a bit of taffy tasted not a plaything had been used but just enough to prove it all were set in portions four two of which were doublesized of what the other two were nearly half these things had come i am almost sure from newton and among the choicest treasures which were stored in scollop shells i descried one of my own buttons which i had honestly given her because two eyelets had run together item a bowl of an unsmoked pipe which had snapped in my hand one evening item as sure as i am alive every bit of the sugar which the dolly had taken from out my locker times there are when a hardy man at sense of things however childish which have left their fibre in him finds himself or loses self in a sudden softness so it almost was with me though the bait on my hooks all the time was drying and for no better reason than the hopeless hopes of a very young child i knew what all her storehouse meant before she began to tell me and her excitement while she told me scarcely left her breath to speak nat for papa with e kean pipe to moke and nat for mamma with e boofely bucken for her coke and nat for my dear ickle bother because it just fit in between his teeth and nis with e ookinggass for susan because she do her hair all day yong she held up the little bit of tin and mimicked susans selfadornment making such a comic face and looking so conceited that i felt as if i should know her susan anywhere in a hundred of women if only she should turn up so and i began to smile a little and she took it up tenfold e make me yaff so i do decare e silly old davy i doesnt know hat to do amost but e mustnt tell anybody this i promised and so went afishing wondering what in the world would become of the queerest fish i had ever caught as well as the highestflavoured one it now seemed a tossup whether or not something or other might turn up in the course of ones life about her at any rate she was doing well with her very bright spirits to help her and even black evan so broken down as not to be hard upon any one and as things fell out to take me from her without any warning upon the whole it was for the best to find the last sight comfortable and a man of my power must not always be poking after babies even the best that were ever born tush what says king david who was a greatgrandfather of mine less distant than llewellyn harper but as much respected in spite of his trying to contribute jewish blood to the lot of us in some of his rasher moments but ancestor though we acknowledge him when our neighbourhood has a revival i will not be carried away by his fame to copy so much as to hearken him the autumn now grew fast upon us and the beach was shifting and neither room nor time remained for preaching under the sandhills even if any one could be found with courage to sit under them and as the nights turned cold and damp everybody grumbled much which was just and right enough in balance of their former grumbling at the summer drought and heat and it was mainly this desire not to be behind my neighbours in the comfort and the company of grumbling and exchanging grumbles which involved me in a course of action highly lowering to my rank and position in society but without which i could never have been enabled to tell this story and yet before entering on that subject everybody will want to know how i discharged my important and even arduous duties as trustee through sir philips munificence for both those little children in the first place i felt that my position was strictly confidential and that it would be a breach of trust to disclose to any person especially in a loquacious village a matter so purely of private discretion three parties there were to be considered and only three whatever point of view one chose to take of it the first of these was sir philip the second the two children and the third of course myself to the first my duty was gratitude which i felt and emitted abundantly to the second both zeal and integrity and for myself there was one course only to which i am naturally addicted namely a lofty selfdenial this duty to myself i discharged at once by forming a stern resolution not to charge either of those children so much as a single farthing for taking care of her property until she was twentyone years of age then as regards the second point i displayed my zeal immediately by falling upon bunny soon after daylight and giving her a smalltoothcombing to begin with till the skin of her hair was as bright as a prawn after which without any heed whatever of roars or even kicks i took a piece of holystone and after a rinsing of soda upon her i cleaned down her planking to such a degree that our admiral might have inspected her she was clean enough for a captains daughter before and dandytrimmed more than need have been for a little craft built to be only a coaster but now when her yelling had done her good and her sunday frock was shipped and her black hair spanked with a rosecoloured ribbon and the smiles flowed into her face again with the sense of all this smartness sir philip himself would have thought her consistent with the owner of five pounds sterling and as touching the money itself and the honesty rightly expected from me although the sum now in my hands was larger than it ever yet had pleased the lord to send me for out and out my own nevertheless there was no such thing as leading me astray about it and this was the more to my credit because that power of evil who has more eyes than all the angels put together or at any rate keeps them wider open he came aft seeing how the wind was and planted his hoof within half a plank of the tiller of my conscience but i heaved him overboard at once and laid my course with this cargo of gold exactly as if it were shippers freight under bond and covenant although in downright commonsense having bunny for my grandchild i also possessed beyond any doubt whatever belonged to bunny just as the owner of a boat owns the oars and rudder also and the same held true as most people would think concerning bardies property for if i had not saved her life how could she have owned any so far however from dealing thus i not only kept all their money for them but invested it in the manner which seemed to be most for their interest to this intent i procured a book for three halfpence paid out of mine own pocket wherein i declared a partnership and established a fishing association under the name style and description of bardie bunny llewellyn and co to this firm i contributed not only my industry and skill but also nets tackle rods and poles hooks and corks and two kettles for bait and a gridiron fit to land and cook with also several wellproven pipes and a perfectly sound tobaccobox every one of these items and many others i entered in the ledger of partnership and mother jones being strange to much writing recorded her mark at the bottom of it one stroke with one hand and one with the other believing it to be my testament with an amen coming after it but knowing what the tricks of fortune are and creditors so unreasonable i thought it much better to keep my boat outside of the association if the firm liked they might hire it and have credit until distributionday which i fixed for the first day of every three months my partners had nothing to provide except just an anchor a mast and a lugsail a new net or two because mine were wearing and one or two other trifles perhaps scarcely worth describing for after all who could be hard upon them when all they contributed to the firm was fifteen pounds and ten shillings it was now in the power of both my partners to advance towards fortune to permit very little delay before they insisted on trebling their capital and so reinvest it in the firm and hence at the age of twentyone be fit to marry magistrates and i made every preparation to carry their shares of the profits over nevertheless things do not always follow the line of the very best and soundest calculations the fish that were running up from the mumbles fast enough to wear their fins out all of a sudden left off altogether as if they had heard of the association not even a twopenny glass of grog did i ever take out of our capital nor a night of the week did i lie abed when the lines required attendance however when fish are entirely absent the very best fishermen in the world cannot manage to create them and therefore our partnership saw the wisdom of declaring no dividends for the first quarter chapter xxv a long goodbye it is an irksome task for a man who has always stood upon his position and justified the universal esteem and respect of the neighbourhood to have to recount his own falling off and loss of proper station without being able to render for it any cause or reason except indeed his own great folly with fortune too ready to second it however as every downfall has a slope which leads towards it so in my case small downhills led treacherously to the precipice in the first place the dogfish and the stingrays which alone came into the nets of our new association set me swearing very hard which of course was a trifling thing and must have befallen st peter himself whose character i can well understand but what was wrong in me was this that after it went on for a fortnight and not even a conger turned up i became proud of my swearing with practice instead of praying to be forgiven which i always feel done to me if desired for my power of words began to please mewhich was a bait of the devil no doubtas every tide i felt more and more that married life had not deprived me of my gift of language or at any rate that widowership had restored my vigour promptly after this being a little exhausted for two days and two nights i smoked pipes not in any mood soever unfit for a christian quite the contrary and quite ready to submit to any discipline being ordered also to lay by and expect a sign from heaven and at this time came several preachers although i had very little for them and was grieved to disappoint their remembrance of the ham that my wife used to keep in cut and in so many words i said that now i was bound to the church by a contract of a shilling aweek and if they waited long enough they might hear the clock strikesomething this combined with a crab whose substance had relapsed to water and the sign of nothing in my locker except a pint of peppermint induced these excellent pastors to go and if they shook off as they declared the dirt of their feet at me it must have been much to their benefit this trifle however heaped up my grievance although i thought scorn to think of it and on the back of it there came another wrong far more serious tidings to wit of a wretched warrant being likely to issue against me from that low tyrant anthony stew on a thoroughly lying information by one of his own gamekeepers it was true enough that i went through his wood with a couple of sailors from porthcawl by no means with any desire to harm but to see if his game was healthy few things occur that exalt the mind more than natural history and if a man dare not go into a wood how can he be expected to improve his knowledge the other men perhaps employed their means to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with the structure and methods of various creatures going on two legs or going on four but as for myself not so much as a gun did any one see in my hands that day at first i thought of standing it out on the strength of all my glory but knowing what testimony is when it gets into the mouths of gamekeepers and feeling my honour concerned to say nothing of the other fellows who were off to sea also cherishing much experience of the way stew handled me upon the whole i had half a mind to let the neighbourhood and the county learn to feel the want of me also what joe jenkins said perhaps had some effect on me this was a young fellow of great zeal newly appointed to zoar chapel instead of the steady nathaniel edwards who had been caught sheepstealing and inasmuch as the chapel stood at the western end of the village next door to the welcome to town my lads all the maids of newton ran mightily to his doctrine for he happened to be a smart young fellow and it was largely put abroad that an uncle of his had a buttershop without any children and bringing in four pounds aweek at chepstow there is scarcely a day of my life on which i do not receive a lesson and the difference betwixt me and a fool is that i receive and he scorns it and a finer lesson i have rarely had than for letting joe jenkins into my wellconducted cottage for no better reason than that the welcome to town was out of beer i ought to have known much better of course with a fellow too young to shave himself and myself a good hearty despiser of schism and above all having such a fine connection with the church of england but that fellow had such a tonguethey said it must have come out of the butter i gave him a glass of my choicest rum when all he deserved was a larruping and i nearly lost the churchclock through it when i heard of this serious consequence i began to call to mind too late what the chaplain of the spitfiregun razyalways used to say to us and a finer fellow to stand to his guns whenever it came to close quarters i never saw before or since go down parson go down we said sir this is no place for your cloth sneaking schismatics may skulk he answered with the powdermop in his hand for we had impressed a methody who bolted below at exceeding long range but if my cloth is out of its place ill fight the devil naked this won over to the side of the church every man of our crew that was gifted with any perception of reasoning however i never shall get on if i tell all the fine things i have seen only i must set forth how i came to disgrace myself so deeply that i could not hope for years and years to enjoy the luxury of despising so much as a lighterman again the folk of our parish could hardly believe it and were it to be done in any way consistent with my story i would not put it on paper now but here it is make the worst of it you will find me redeem it afterwards the famous david llewellyn of his majestys royal navy took a berth in a tradingschooner called the rose of devon after such a fall as this if i happened to speak below my mark or not describe the gentry well everybody must excuse me for i went so low in my own esteem that i could not have knocked even anthony stews underkeeper down i was making notes here and there already concerning the matters at sker house and the delicate sayings of bardie not with any view to a story perfect and clear as this is but for my own satisfaction in case of anything worth going on with and but for this forethought you could not have learned both her sayings and doings so bright as above and now being taken away from it i tried to find some one with wit enough to carry it on in my absence in a populous neighbourhood this might have been but the only man near us who had the conceit to try to carry it on a bit fell into such a condition of mind that his own wife did not know him but in spite of the open state of his head he held on very stoutly trying to keep himself up to the mark with ale and even hollands until it pleased god that his second child should fall into the chickenpox and then all the neighbours spoke up so muchon account of his being a tailorthat it came to one thing or the other either he must give up his trade and let his apprentice have itto think of which was worse than gall and wormwood to his wifeor else he must give up all meddling with pen and ink and the patterns of chickenpox how could he hesitate when he knew that the very worst tailor can make in a day as much as the best writer can in a month upon the whole i was pleased with this for i never could bear that rogue of a snip any more than he could put up with me for making my own clothes and bunnys i challenged him once on a buttonhole for i was his master without a thimble and for this ninth part of a man to think of taking up my pen the name of our schooner or rather ketchfor she was no more than that to tell truth though i wished her to be called a schoonerwas as i said the rose of devon and the name of her captain was fuzzy not a bad man i do believe but one who almost drove me wicked because i never could make him out a tender and compassionate interest in the affairs of everybody whom it pleases providence that we should even hear of has been since our ancestors baffled the flood without consulting noah one of the most distinct and noblest national traits of welshmen pious also for if the lord had not meant us to inquire he never would have sent us all those fellowcreatures to arouse unallayed disquietude but this man fuzzy as every one called him although his true name was bethel jose seemed to be sent from devonshire for the mere purpose of distracting us concerning the other two stonecaptains as we call those skippers who come for limestone and steal it from colonel loughers rocks we knew as much as would keep us going whenever their names were mentioned but as to fuzzy though this was the third year of his trading over there was not a woman in newton who knew whether he had a wife or not and the public eagerness over this subject grew as the question deepened until there were seven of our best young women ready to marry him at risk of bigamy to find out the matter and to make it known therefore of course he rose more and more in public esteem voyage after voyage and i became jealous perhaps of his fame and resolved to expose its hollow basis as compared with that of mine accordingly when it came to pass that my glory though still in its prime was imperilled by that irish stews proceedingsfor he must have been irish by originhaving my choice as a matter of course among the three stone captains i chose that very hard stone to crack and every one all through the village rejoiced though bitterly grieved to lose me and dreading the price there would be for fish with that extortionate sandy macraw left alone to create a monopoly there was not a man in all newton that feared to lay halfacrown to a sixpence that i brought back the whole of old fuzzys concerns but the women having tried skipper jose with everything they could think of and not understanding the odds of betting were ready to lay a crooked sixpence on fuzzy whenever they had one to begin with he caught me on the hop at a moment of rumours and serious warnings and thoroughly pure indignation on my part at the moment i said and he made me sign that i was prepared to ship with him after which he held me fast and frightened me with the landcrabs and gave me no chance to get out of his jaws i tried to make him laugh with some of the many jokes and stories which everybody knows of mine and likes them for long acquaintance sake however not one of them moved him so much as to fetch one squirt of tobaccojuice this alone enabled him to take a strong lead over me every time that he was bound to laugh according to human nature and yet had neither a wag in his nose nor a pucker upon his countenance nor even so much as a gleam in his eye so many times i felt in my heart that this man was the wise man and that laughter is a folly and i had to bottle down the laughs which always rise inside of me whenever my joke has the cream on it until i could find some other fellow fit to understand me because i knew that my jokes were good when i found no means of backing out from that degrading contract my very first thought was to do strict justice to our association and atone for the loss of my services to it therefore in case of anything undesirable befalling mein short if i should be ordered aloft with no leave to come down againthere i made my will and left my property to establish credit for a new start among them chairs and tables knives and forks iron spoons brought into the family by my wifes grandfather several pairs of duds of my own and sundry poles as before described also nets to a good extentthough some had gone under usurybaitkettles i forget how many and even my character in a silkbag item a great many sundry things of almost equal value the whole of which i bravely put into my will and left them and knowing that the proper thing is to subscribe a codicil therein i placed a set of delf and after that my blessing eighteenpence i was compelled to pay for this pious document to a man who had been turned out of the law because he charged too little and a better shillingandsixpence worth of sense with heads and tails to it his lordship the bishop of llandaff will own that he never set seal upon unless i make another one only i felt it just to leave my boat entire to bardie having done my duty thus i found a bracing strength upon me to go through with everything no man should know how much i felt my violent degradation from being captain of a gun to have to tread mercantile boards things have changed since then so much through the parsimony of government that our very best sailors now tail off into the merchant service but it was not so when i was young and even when i was turned of fifty we despised the traders even the largest of their vessels of four or as much as five hundred tons we royal tars regarded always as so many dustbins with three of the clothesprops hoisted and now as i looked in the glass i beheld no more than the mate of a fiftyton ketch for a thirtymile voyage out of newton bay however i had lived long enough then to be taught one simple thing whatever happens one may descry merely by using manly aspect dawning glimpses of that light which the will of god intended to be joy for all of us but so scattered now and vapoured by our own misdoings still it will come home some time and then we call it comfort accordingly though so deeply fallen in my own regard i did not find that people thought so very much the less of me nay some of them even drove me wild by talking of my rise in life as if i had been a pure nobody but on the whole we learned my value when i was going away from us for all the village was stirred up with desire to see the last of me my wellknown narratives at the well would be missed all through the autumn and those who had dared to call them lies were the foremost to feel the lack of them especially the children cried old davy going to be drownded no more stories at the well until i vowed to be back almost before they could fill their pitchers these things having proved to me in spite of inordinate modesty that i had a certain value i made the very best of it and let everybody know how much i wished to say goodbye to them although so short of money from felix farley i had received no less than sevenandtenpencefor saving the drowned black peopleunder initials d l at the office accruing to a great extent from domestic female servants some of these craved my candid opinion as to accepting the humble addresses of coloured gentlemen in good livery and whether it made so much difference and now i thought that newton might have a mark of esteem prepared for me but though they failed to think of thatpurely from want of experienceeverything else was done that could be done for a man who had no money by his neighbours who had less and sixpence never entered twice into the thoughts of any one richard matthews the pilot promised to mind the churchclock for me without even handling my salary as for bunny glorification is the shortest word i know a young man who had never paid his bill put her into twoinch ribbon from the baptist preachers shop also a pair of shoes upon her which had right and left to them although not marked by nature and upon the front of her bosom lace that made me think of smuggling and such as that young man never could have expected to get booked to him if he had felt himself to be more than a month converted moreover instead of mother jones who was very well in her way to be sure the foremost folk in all the village and even master charles morgan himself carpenter and churchwarden were beginning to vie one with the other in desire to entertain her without any word of her fivepound note in short many kind things were said and done enough to make any unbashful man desire to represent them but i for my part was quite overcome and delivered my speech with such power of doubt concerning my own worthiness that they had to send back to the inn three times before they could properly say goodbye chapter xxvi braunton burrows the weather was still as fair as could be with a light wind from the eastnortheast and as our course lay west by south and the ebb was running we slipped along at the rate of six or seven knots an hour though heavilyladen with the colonels rocks and after rounding porthcawl point we came abreast of the old sker house a little after sunset skipper jose would never have ventured inside the skerweathers only that i held the tiller and knew every vein of sand and rock and i kept so close in shore because one of the things that vexed me most in all this sudden departure was to run away without proper ceremony from bardie she was certain to feel it much and too young to perceive the necessity and fried pudding had been promised her at my table come the very next sunday the windows of the old grey mansion gleamed in the fading western light but we descried no smoke or movement neither any life or variance only a dreary pile of loneliness in the middle of yellow sands then i rigged out my perspective glass and levelled it on the cuddy chimneyfor the ketch was a halfdeckerto spy if the little one might so chance to be making her solitary play as she was used to do all day and most of all ere bedtime and if she should so happen i knew how wild her delight would be to discover a vessel so near the shore because whenever a sail went by even at two or three leagues of distance there was no containing her out she would rush with her face on fire and curly hair all jogging and up would go two little hands spread to the sky and the vast wide sea mammy dear i ants a so dear papa i has yaited so yong ickle bother such a lot of things bardies got to tell a and thus she would run on the brink of the waves with hope and sadness fluctuating on her unformed countenance until the sail became a speck however now i saw no token of this little rover unless it were some washed clothes flapping on the rushen tufts to dry and jose called me back to my spell at the helm before i had finished gazing and in less than half an hour the landmark of the ancient house was fading in the dewfog our ships company amounted to no less than four all hands toldviz captain bethel jose alias fuzzy isaac hutchings the mate my humble self who found it my duty to supersede ikey and appoint myself and a boy of general incapacity and of the name of bang making fine weather as we did and with myself at the helm all night and taking command as my skill required we slanted across channel very sweetly and when the grey of morning broke lundy isle was on our leebow hereupon i gave the helm to old ike for beyond this was unknown to me and providence had never led me over barnstaple bar as yet so i tumbled in and turned up no more until we were close on the bar itself about ten oclock of the forenoon this is a thoroughly dangerous place a meeting of treacherous winds and waters in amongst uncertain shoaling and would be worse than our skerweathers if it lay open to southwest gales we waited for the tide and then slipped over very cleverly with hartland point on our starboard beam and presently we found ourselves in a fine broad open water with plenty of grey stretch going along it and green hills tufting away from it everything looked so mild and handsome that i wondered whether these men of devonshire might not be such fools for bragging after all when tested because when i found no means to escape this degrading voyage to devonshire i had said to myself that at any rate it would enable me to peg down those people for the future not that they boasted so to speak but that they held their tongues at our boasts as much as to say you may talk if you please it does you good and our land is such that we never need contradict you but now when i saw these ins and outs and ups and downs and cornering places and the wrinkles of the valleys and the cheeks of the very rocks set with green as bright and lively after a burning summer as our own country can show in may i began to thinkthough i would not say it through patriotic unwillingnessthat the people who lived in such land as this could well afford to hold their tongues and hearken our talk with pleasure captain fuzzy said no word to show that he was home again neither did he care to ask my opinion about the look of it and old ike treating me likewise though he ought to have known much better there i found myself compelled by my natural desire to know all about my fellowcreatures to carry on what must have been a most highly flattering patronage towards the boy who did our slopwork and whose name was bang because everybody banged him this boy forgetting the respect which is due to the mate of a ship of commercefor i now assumed that position legally over the head of old ikey who acknowledged my rank when announced to himthis ignorant boy had the insolence to give me a clumsy nudge and inquire du e knaw thiccy peart over yanner them downplasses and them zandy backs my boy i replied i have not the honour of knowing anything about them very likely you think a good deal of them whai thee must be a born vule them be braunton burrusses be them indeed take this my boy for such valuable information and i gave him a cuff of an earnest nature such as he rarely obtained perhaps and well calculated to be of timely service to him he howled a good bit and attempted to kick whereupon i raised him from his natural level and made his head acquainted with the nature of the foremast preserving my temper quite admirably but bearing in mind the great importance of impressing discipline at an early age and i reaped a welldeserved reward in his lifelong gratitude and respect while bang went below to complete his weeping and to find some plaster i began to take accurate observation of these braunton burrows of which i had often heard before from the devonshire men who frequent our coast for the purpose of stealing coal or limestone an upanddown sort of a place it appeared as i made it out with my spyglass and i could not perceive that it beat our sands as those good people declared of it only i noticed that these sandhills were of a different hue from ours not so bare and yellowfaced not so swept by western winds neither with their tops thrown up like the peak of a new volcano rushes spurge and goosefoot grasses and the ribleafed iris and in hollow places catsmint loosestrife and low eyebrightthese and a thousand other plants seemed to hold the flaky surface so as not to fly like ours ike broke silence which to him was worse than breaking his own windows and said that all for leagues around was full of giants and great spectres moreover that all of it long had been found an unkid and unholy place bad for a man to walk in and swarming with great creatures striped the contrary way to all goodluck and having eight legs every side and a great horn crawling after them and their food all night was known to be travellers skulls and sailors bones having seen a good deal of landcrabs i scarcely dared to deny the story and yet i could hardly make it out therefore without giving vent to opinions of things which might turn out otherwise i levelled my spyglass again at the region of which i had heard such a strange account and suddenly here i beheld a man of no common appearance wandering in and out the hollows as if he never meant to stop a tall man with a long grey beard and wearing a cockedhat like a colonel there was something about him that startled me and drew my whole attention therefore with my perspective glass not long ago cleaned and set shipshape by a man who understood the bearingsafter that rogue of a hezekiah had done his best to spoil itwith this honest magnifier the only one that tells no lies i carefully followed up and down the figure some three cableslengths away of this strange walker among the sandhills we were in smooth water now gliding gently up the river with the mainsail paying over just enough for steerageway and so i got my level truly and could follow every step it was a fine oldfashioned man tall and very upright with a broad ribbon upon his breast and something of metal shining and his hessian boots flashed now and then as he passed along with a stately stride his beard was like a streak of silver and his forehead broad and white but all the rest of his face was dark as if from foreign service his dress seemed to be of a rich black velvet very choice and costly and a long sword hung at his side although so many gentlemen now have ceased to carry even a rapier i like to see them carry their swordsit shows that they can command themselves but what touched me most with feeling was his manner of going on he seemed to be searching ever searching up the hills and down the hollows through the troughs and on the breastlands in the shadow and the sunlight seeking for some precious loss after watching this figure some little time it was natural that i should grow desirous to know something more about him especially as i obtained an idea in spite of the distance and different dress that i had seen some one like this gentleman not such a very long time ago but i could not recall to my mind who it was that was hovering on the skirts of it therefore i looked around for help ike hutchings my undermate was at the tiller but i durst not lend him my glass because he knew not one end from the other so i shouted aloud for captain jose and begged him to take a good look and tell me everything that he knew or thought he just set his eye and then shut up the glass and handed it to me without a word and walked off as if i were nobody this vexed me so that i holloaed out are all of you gone downright mad on this side of the channel cant a man ask a civil question and get a civil answer when he axeth what consarneth him was the only answer captain fuzzy vouchsafed me over his shoulder i could not find it worth my while to quarrel with this ignorant man for the sake of a foolish word or two considering how morose he was and kept the keys of everything for the moment i could not help regretting my wholesome chastisement of the boy bang for he would have told me at least all he knew if i could have taught him to take a good look and as for ike when i went and tried him whether it was that he failed of my meaning or that he chose to pretend to do so on account of my having deposed him or that he truly knew nothing at allat any rate i got nothing from him this was indeed a heavy trial it is acknowleged that we have such hearts and strength of goodwill to the universe and power of entering into things that not a welshman of us is there but yearns to know all that can be said about every one he has ever seen or heard or even thought of and this kind will instead of being at all repressed by discouragement increases tenfold in proportion as others manifest any unkind desire to keep themselves out of the way of it my certy no low curiosity is this but lofty sympathy my grandfather nine generations back yorath the celebrated bard begins perhaps his most immortal ode to a gentleman who had given him a quart of beer with this noble moral precept lift up your eyes to the castle gates and behold on how small a hinge they move the iron is an inch and a quarter thick the gates are an hundred and fifty feet wide and though the gates of my history are not quite so wide as that they often move on a hinge even less than an inch and a quarter in thickness though i must not be too sure of course as to the substance of bangs head however allow even two inches for it and it seems but a very trifling matter to tell as it did upon great adventures the boy was as sound as a boy need be in a couple of hours afterwards except that he had or pretended to have a kind of a buzzing in one ear and i found him so grateful for my correction that i could not bear to urge his head with inquiries for the moment to captain fuzzy i said no more if he could not see the advantage of attending to his own business but must needs go out of his way to administer public reproof to me i could only be sorry for him to ikey however i put some questions of a general tendency but from his barbarous broken englishif this jargon could be called english at allthe only thing i could gather was that none but true devonshire folk had a right to ask about devonshire families this might be true to a certain extent though i never have seen such a law laid down the answer however is perfectly simple if these people carry on in a manner that cannot fail to draw public attention they attack us at once on our tenderest point and tenfold so if they are our betters for what man of commonsense could admit the idea of anybody setting up to be nobody therefore i felt myself quite ready to give a weeks pay and victuals in that state of life to which god alone could have seen fit to call meas mate of that devonshire ketch or hoy or tub or whatever it might befour shillings and a bag of suetdumplings twice aday i would have given to understand upon the spot all about that elderly gentleman it helped me very little indeed that i kept on saying to myself this matters not tis a few hours only the moment we get to barnstaple i shall find some womenthe women can never help telling everything and for the most part ten times that only contradict them bravely and they have no silence left however it helped me not a little when captain fuzzy with a duck of his head tumbled up from the cuddy brimful as we saw of the dinnertime a man of my experience who has lived for six weeks on the horns of seasnails which the officers found too hard for them that time we were wrecked in the palamedewhat can a man of this kind feel when a trumpery coaster dares to pipe all hands to dinner however it so happened for the moment that what i felt was appetite and fuzzy who was a firstrate cook and knew seasoning without counting had brought an iron ladle up so as to save his words and yet to give us some idea soup it was of a sort that set us thinking of all the meat under it i blew upon it and tasted a drop and found that other peoples business would keep till at least after dinner in the midst of dinner we came to the meeting of two fine rivers called tawe and torridge and with the tide still making strong we slanted up the former the channel was given to twists and turns but the fine open valley made up for it and the wealth of land on either side sloping with green meadows gently and winding in and out with trees here were cattle as red as chesnuts running about with tails like spankers such as i never saw before but ikey gave me to understand that the colour of the earth was the cause of it and that if i lived long upon corned beef made of them whose quality no other land could create i should be turned to that hue myself at this i laughed as a sailors yarn but after regarding him steadfastly and then gazing again at the bullocks i thought there might be some truth in it one thing i will say of these sons of devon rough they may be and short of grain and fond of their own opinions and not well up in points of lawwhich is our very naturequeer moreover in thought and word and obstinate as hedgehogsyet they show and truly have a kind desire to feed one well money they have no great love of spending round the corner neither will they go surety freely for any man who is free to run but vittels as they call them vittelsbefore you have been in a house two minutes out come these and eat you must happily upon this point i was able to afford them large and increasing satisfaction having rarely enjoyed so fine a means of pleasing myself and others also for the things are good and the people too and it takes a bad man to gainsay either chapter xxvii a fine spectacle we brought the rose of devon to her moorings on the south side of the river about two miles short of barnstaple where a little bend and creek is and a place for barges and deadmans pill was the name of it what could a dead man want with a pill was the very first thing i asked them but they said that was no concern of theirs there were pills up and down the river for miles as well as a town called pilltown the cleverest man that i came across said that it must be by reason of piles driven in where the corners were to prevent the washing and he showed me some piles or their stumps to prove it and defied all further argument for the time i was beaten until of a sudden and too late to let him know i saw like a stupid that it must be no other than our own word pwll which differs much from an english pool because it may be either dry or wet so long as it lies in a hollow and with that i fell athinking of poor bardie and pwll tavan to be quit of remorse and to see the world i accepted old ikeys invitation to barnstaple fair for the very next day we could not begin to discharge our limestone as even that obstinate fuzzy confessed upon a sacred day like that fuzzy himself had a mind for going as we half suspected although he held his tongue about it and my undermate told me to let him alone and see what would come of it the town is a pleasant and pretty one and has always been famous for thinking itself more noble than any other also the fair was a fine thing to see full of people and full of noise and most outrageous dialect everybody in fine broad humour and no fighting worth even looking at this disappointed me for in wales we consider the offday market a poor one unless at least some of the women pull caps i tried however not to miss it having seen in foreign countries people meeting peaceably of this i could have had no intention to complain to poor ikey hutchings however he took it as if i had and offered to find me a man from bratton or himself to have a square with me and stake halfacrown upon it he must have found early cause for repentance if i had taken him at his word but every one would have cried shame upon me against such a poor little fellow and so we pushed on and the people pushed us after a little more of this and ikey bragging all the time though i saw nothing very wonderful we turned the corner of a narrow street and opened into a broader one here there seemed to be no bullocks such as had made us keep springs on our cables but a very amazing lot of horses trotting about and parading and rushing most of them with their tails uphoisted as if by discharging tackle among them stood men making much of their virtues and sinking their faults if they had any and cracking a whip every now and then with a style of applause toward them now i have a natural love of the horse though i never served long on board of one and i regularly feel at sight of them a desire to mount the rigging many a time i have reasoned to my own conviction and my neighbours that a man who can stand on the mizzentopgallant yard in a heavy gale of wind must find it a ridiculously easy thing to hold on by a horse with the tackle to help him and very likely a dead calm all round nevertheless somehow or other the result seems always otherwise i had just hailed a man with a colt to show off and commodores pendants all over his tail and was keeping clear of his counter to catch the rise of the wave for boarding him when a hush came over all hands as if the street had been raked with chainshot and on both sides of the street all people fell back and backed their horses so that all the roadway stood as clear as if the fair had turned into a sunday morning up the centre and heeding the people no more than they would two rows of trees came two grave gentlemen daintily walking arm in arm and dressed in black they had broadflapped hats long coats of broadcloth black silk tunics and buckled breeches and black polished boots reaching up to the buckles meanwhile all the people stood huddled together upon the pitched stones on either side touching their hats and scarce whispering and even the showing off of the horses went into the sidestreets after all the bowing and legging that i had beheld in the royal navy the double file the noble salutes the manning of the sides and yards the drums the oars all upon the catch and all the other glorious things that fit us to thrash the frenchmen so there was nothing else left for me to suppose but that here were two mighty admirals gone into mourning very likely for the loss of the royal george or come on the sly perhaps to enjoy the rollicking of the fair and sinking the uniform for variety how could i tell and least of all would i think of interfering with the pleasure of my betters therefore i stopped in my throat the cheer which naturally seemed to rise the moment i took my hat off for fear of letting the common people know that i understood their honours but after looking again so long as one might without being inquisitive i saw that neither of these great men could walk the deck in a rolling sea i had been so bold in the thick of the horses that ikey had found it too much for him always to keep close to me but now as the nearest horse must have drifted the length of two jollyboats away this little sailor came up and spoke can e show the laikes of they two in taffyland old taffy now plenty i should hope said i though proud in the end to say not one but what a fuss you make who are they as if thee didnt know cried ikey staring with indignation at me how should i know when i never clapped eyes on either of them till this moment thou hast crossed the water for something then davy them be the two passons two passons i could not say it exactly as he sounded it i never heard of two passons a wants to draive me mad a dooth said ikey in selfcommune did e never hear tell of passon chowne and passon jack man alive now it was hopeless to try any more with him for i could not ding into his stupid head the possibility of such ignorance he could only believe that i feigned it for the purpose of driving him out of his senses or making little of his native land so i felt that the best thing i could do was to look at those two great gentlemen accurately and impartially and thus form my own opinion hence there was prospect of further pleasure in coming to know more about them verily they were goodly men so far as the outer frame goes the one for size and strength and statureand the other for face form and quickness i felt as surely as men do feel who have dealed much among other men that i was gazing upon two faces not of the common order and they walked as if they knew themselves to be ever so far from the average not so much with pride or conceit or any sort of arrogance but with a manner of going distinct from the going of fellowcreatures whether this may have been so because they were both going straight to the devil is a question that never crossed my mind until i knew more about them for our parsons in wales take them all in all can hardly be called gentlemen except of course our own who was colonel loughers brother also the one at merthyr mawr and st brides and one or two other places where they were customers of mine but most of the rest were small farmers sons or shopkeepers boys and so on these may do very well for a parish or even a congregation that never sees a gentleman except when they are summonedand not always then however this sort will not do for a man who has served ay and been in battle under two baronets and an earl therefore i looked with some misgiving at these two great parsons but it did not take mo long to perceive that each of them was of good birth at least whatever his manners afterwardsmen who must feel themselves out of their rank when buttoned into a pulpit for reasoning with devonshire ploughtail bobs if indeed they ever did so and as for their flocks they kept dogs enough at any rate to look after them for they both kept hounds and both served their churches in true hunting fashionthat is to say with a steeplechase taking true country at full gallop over hedges and ditches and stabling the horse in the vestry all this i did not know as yet or i must have thought even more than i did concerning those two gentlemen the taller of the two was as fair and ruddy and as free of countenance as a june rose in the sunshine a man of commanding build and figure but with no other command about him and least of all that of his own self the other it was that took my gaze and held it having caught mine eyes until i forgot myself and dropped them under some superior strength for the time i knew not how i felt or what it was that vanquished me only that my spirit owned this mans to be its master whether from excess of goodness or from depth of desperate evil at the time i knew not it was the most wondrous unfathomable face that ever fellowman fixed gaze upon lost to mankindliness lost to mercy lost to all memory of god as handsome a face as need be seen with a very strong forehead and coalblack eyes a straight white nose and a sharpcut mouth and the chin like a marble sculpture disdain was the first thing it gave one to think of and after that cold relentless humour and after that anything dark and bad meanwhile this was a very handsome man as women reckon beauty and his age not over forty perhaps also of good average stature active and elegant form and so on neither years nor cubits make much odds to a man of that sort and the ladies pronounce him perfect when these two were gone by i was able to gaze again at the taller one truly a goodly man he was though spared from being a good one he seemed to stand over me like sir philip although i was measured for six feet and one inch before i got into rheumatic ways and as for size and compass my parents never could give me food to fetch out my girth as this parsons was he looked a good yard and a half round the chest and his arms were like oaksaplings however he proved to be a man void of some pride and some evil desires unless anybody bore hard on him and as for reading the collects or lessons or even the burial service i was told that no man in the british realm was fit to say amen to him this had something to do with the size of his chest and perhaps might have helped to increase it his sermons also were done in a style that women would come many miles to enjoy beginning very soft and sweet so as to melt the milder ones and then of a sudden roaring greatly with all the contents of enormous lungs so as to ring all round the sides of the strongest weaker vessels and as for the men what could they think when the preacher could drub any six of them this was parson jack if you please his surname being rambone as i need not say unless i write for unborn generations his business in boutport street that day was to see if any man would challenge him he had held the belt seven years they said for wrestling as well as for bruising the condition whereof was to walk the street both at barnstaple fair and at bodmin revels and watch whether any man laid foot across him this he did purely as a layman might but the boxing and bruising were part of his office so that he hung up his cassock always for a challenge to make rent in it there had been some talk of a cornishman interfering about the wrestling and bad people hoped that he might so attempt and never know the way home again but as for the fighting the cassock might hang till the beard of parson jack was grey before any one made a hole in it also the cornish wrestler found after looking at parson jack that the wisest plan before him was to challenge the other cornishmen and leave the belt in devonshire all this i found out at a little gathering which was held round the corner in bear street to reflect upon the business done at the fair and compare opinions and although i had never beheld till then any of our good company neither expected to see them again there were no two opinions about my being the most agreeable man in the room i showed them how to make punch to begin with as had been done by his royal highness with me to declare proportions and as many of the farmers had turned some money they bade me think twice about no ingredient that would figure on the bill even halfacrown by right of superior knowledge and also as principal guest of the evening i became voted the chairman upon the clear understanding that i would do them the honour of paying nothing and therein i found not a man that would think of evading his duty towards the chair i entreated them all to be frank and regard me as if i were born in barnstaple which they might look upon as being done otherwise as the mere turn of a shaving for my father had been there twice and my mother more than once thought of trying it everybody saw the force of this and after a very fine supper we grew as genial as could be and leading them all with a delicate knowledge of the ins and outs of these natives many of which i had learned at the fair and especially by encouraging their bent for contradiction i heard a good deal of the leading people in the town or out of it i listened of course to a very great deal which might be of use to me or might not but my object was when i could gather in their manyelbowed stories to be thoroughly up to the mark on three points first about fuzzy and most important who was he what was he where did he live had he got a wife and if so why and if not more especially why again also how much money had he and what in the world did he do with it and could he have under the rose any reason for keeping our women so distant particularly i had orders to know whether he was considered handsome by the devonshire women for our women could not make up their minds and feared to give way to the high opinion engendered by his contempt of them only they liked his general hairiness if it could be warranted not to come off upon this point i learned nothing at all no man even knew bethel jose or at any rate none would own to it perhaps because ikey was there to hearken so i left that until i should get with the women my next matter was about braunton burrows and the gentleman of high rank who wandered up and down without telling us why and i might hereupon have won some knowledge and was beginning to do so when a square stout man came in and said hush and i would gladly have thrown a jug at him nevertheless i did learn something which i mean to tell next to directly but as concerned the third question before me and to myself the most itching of any satisfaction to at least halfmeasure was by proper skill and fortune brought within my reach almost and this i must set down at leisure soberly thinking over it chapter xxviii something about him it was of course not parson rambone but the parson chowne who aroused my desire of knowledge so strongly and even here i was met at first by failure and disappointment the men would only shake their hands and say ah he is a queer one or well well we cant expect all folk to be alike you know or even some of the ruder spirits you had better go yourself and ask hima most absurd suggestion for never yet had i seen a man less fit to encourage impertinence far more ready would i have been to displease even his great comrade the reverend john rambone and no one who saw them together could doubt which of the two was the master my true course was clearly to bide my time and as chairman to enhance the goodwill and geniality of the evening and this i was ready enough to doay and in the vein for itbearing in mind the wisdom of enjoying to the utmost such favourable circumstances to be on the free boot and well received in a place entirely new to me where i found myself so much ahead of everybody in matter of mind and some of them glad to acknowledge it also where no customer could be waiting to reproach me nor even a justice of the peace well versed in my countenance moreover blessed as i was with a sense of pity for these natives and a largeness of goodwill to them such a chance had never crossed me since the day my wife did ikey and i had a good laugh also at that surly bethel jose who had shown himself so much above the fair in mind yet was there in body none but bang the boy had been left for captain and crew of the rose of devon and before it was dark we had found bang shooting at four shots apenny for cocoanut slices with gingerbeer poured over them now fortune stood my friend that night for before we began to find ourselves in a condition at all uproarious i managed to loosen the tongues of these natives by means of some excellent stories recalling the fame of my grandfather that long david llewellyn who made on his harp three unconquered ballads and won the first prize at all the eisteddfods held during his life for englynion i could not accept it as my business to play second fiddle therefore being in a happy mood i was enabled to recount such stories as made these devonshire folk open their mouths like a man at a great rockoyster while their experience was in contention with faith and perhaps good manners and as their nature is obstinate and most unwilling to be outdone they found themselves driven down at last to tell the most wonderful things they knew or else to be almost nobodies and putting aside what their grandfathers might have seen or heard or even donewhich is a mistake to dwell uponall their stories worth curve of the ear were of parson chowne and no other for this man was a man as we say no other man must have a will that stood across the path of his if he heard of any one unwilling to give way to him he would not go to bed until he had taken that arrogance out of him many people and even some of ten times his own fortune had done their best one after the other not to be beaten by him all of them found that they could not do it and that their only chance of comfort was to knock under to parson chowne and even after that had been done he was not always satisfied but let them know from time to time their folly in offending him and most of all he made a point as was natural perhaps of keeping the lord bishop of the country under him some of these had done their best before they understood him to make his habits hold themselves within some stretch of discipline or if that could not be hoped at any rate to keep silent when he heard of these ideas he was not a little pleased because he descried a rare chance of sport and he followed it up with their lordships the law he knew to its lowest tittle and while he broke it every day himself woe to any man who dared to break it against him and gradually these bishops came one after the other growing a little alive to what the parsons were not so much to let him alone as to desire his acquaintanceout of school if so i may put it in my ignorance of the bench of bishops for well as i know a fish called the pope and also a pear said to be bishops thumb not to mention a grass called timothy it has not been my luck thus far to rise above the bench of magistrates let be is the wisest thing one can say and so everybody said of him so soon as ever it was acknowledged that he could never be put down and thus he might have done well enough if he would have been content with this only it never was his nature to be content with anything which is the only true way to get on if any one cares for that sort of thing who knows mankinds great randomness because the one who shoves and swears without being too particular has the best chance to hoist himself upon the backs of the humble by dint of this and to keep him quiet parson chowne himself they said might have been bishop if so he had chosen for this he had some fine qualifications for his very choicest pleasure was found in tormenting his fellowparsons and a man of so bold a mind he was that he believed in nothing except himself even his own servants never knew how to come nigh him one at the stables would touch his hat and he would kick him for reply then another would come without ceremony and he knocked him down to learn it also in the house the maidens had the same account to give however much they might think of themselves and adorn themselves to that estimate he never was known to do so much as to chuck any one of them under the chin as they had been at all other places much in the habit of feeling neither did he make a joke to excuse himself for omitting it as to that they would scorn themselves ever to think of permitting it being young women of high respect and quite aware how to conduct themselves but they might have liked to stop him and they got no chance of doing it all this smalltalk almost vexed me more than the content it gave every now and then i could see the man in these little corner views but they did not show me round him so as to get his girth and substance think of the devil is an old saying and while i thought of him in he walked at the very first glimpse of him all those people who had been talking so freely about him shrank away and said servant sir and looked so foolish more than usual that he read them with one eye he had his ridingclothes on now and it made him look still sharper talking of me good people eh i hope the subject pleases you open your ranks if you please and show me whether my groom is behind you he cracked a great huntingwhip as he spoke and it seemed a poor prospect for the groom wherever he might be loitering plaize your honour your honours groom have not been here all day amost and if her coomth us ont keep un in that resolution you are wise what you here welshman i marked you today you will come to me by noon tomorrow here is for your charges he threw on the table two crownpieces and was gone before i knew what answer i was bound to make to him the men recovering from his presence ran to the window to watch him as far as the flaring lights of the fair now spluttering low displayed him without being able to see so much as i strongly desired to see of him i could not help admiring now his look and his manner and strong steady gait and the general style of his outward man his free way of going along made clear the excellence of his clothing and he swung his right elbow as i was told from his constant desire to lash a horse he was the devil himself to ride so everybody said of him and parson chownes horse was now become a byword for any one thoroughly thrashed and yet no other man must ever dare to touch his horses if any one did no deadlier outrage could be put upon him hearing these things from fourteen customers able to express their thoughts i was sorry when the corner turned upon parson chowne so walking in the light of long deal tables set with finelyguttering candles and with goods not quite sold out and he left upon my memory a vision of a great commander having a hat of controlling movements and a ridingcoat so shaped that a horse appeared to be under it and lower down buff leathern breeches and boots well over the hinge of his legs and silver heels and silver spurs and nothing to obscure him no topcoat or outer style of means to fend the weather because he could keep it in order always i wish i was like him then said i and what does he mean by insulting me i know a hundred bigger fellows am i at his beck and call i warrn thou wilt be zoon enough answered with a heavy grin a lout of a fellow who had shown no more sense than to leave the room at the very crash and crown of one of my best stories hast heered what passon have now a dooed he was come in primed with some rubbishing tale and wanted the room to make much of him nevertheless the men of perception had not done with me yet wuttever be un wuttever be un spak up oasler jan cried some of the altogether younger men who never know good work from bad but seek some new astonishment goodness knows how hard it was and how wholly undeserved for me to withdraw and let them talk only because their news was newer and about a favourite man to talk of however i pressed down my feelings not being certain about my bill if i offended any one for mercys sake i spare their brogue and tell their story decently and ostler johns tale was as follows so far as i could make it out by means of good luck and by watching his face a certain justice of the peace whose name was captain vellacott a gentleman of spirit who lived in one of the parishes belonging to this parson chowne who happened to have two churches this gentleman had contrived to give as almost every one managed to do deadly offence to parson chowne it was expected that the parson would be content to have him down and horsewhip him as his manner was and burn his house down afterwards but the people who thought this were too hasty and understood not his reverence whether from dislike of sitting upon the bench with him afterwards or whether because mrs vellacott also had dared to shake hands with her gauntlet on or because the baby cried when offered up to kiss the parsonat any rate captain vellacott must have more than a simple chastisement the captain being a quick sharp man who said a hot word and forgot it laughed at every one who told him to see to himself and so on the parson said he is a man of his cloth so am i of mine and i will not insult him by expecting insult so it came to pass that he made the mistake of measuring another man by his own measure after a few months this gentleman felt that the parson had quite forgiven him no evil having befallen him yet except that his rickyard had twice been fired and his wife insulted by the naked people whom chowne maintained upon nympton moor and so when they met in the fair this day the captain bowed to the parson and meant to go on and see to his business but the other would not have it so he offered his hand most cordially and asked how mrs vellacott was and all the five children according to ages using the christian name of each captain vellacott was so pleased by the kindness of his memory and the nobility shown in dropping whatever had been between them that what did he do but invite master chowne to dine with him up at the fortescue arms hotel and see a young horse he had bought in the fair giving his own for it and five guineas for he was not a rich man at all and was come to make a moderate bargain everything might have gone on well and perhaps the parson really meant to forgive him at the moment for having dared in the bygone matter to have a will of his own almost but as bad luck would have it this very horse that the captain had bought turned out to be one which the parson had eye upon ever since last years hunting season however not to paint the devil too black it was confessed that he offered vellacott five pounds for his bargain this ought to have satisfied any man who knew what parson chowne was and that fifty times five pounds would be saved by keeping out of his black books nevertheless the captain stuck to his bargain and ruined himself the two gentlemen parted very good friends shaking hands warmly and having their joke and hoping to dine again soon together for parson chowne could beat all the world at afterdinner stories and the captain was the best man to laugh anywhere round the neighbourhood and so he started rather early on purpose to show his new horse to his wife but the ostler who was a very old codger and had seen a little of parsons ways shook his head after the captains shilling and spat upon it to prevent bad luck and laid it on the shelf where he kept his blacking he was too clever to say one word but every one remembered how he had behaved and the sigh he gavewhen he reminded them it may have been half an hour afterwards or it may have been an hour and a half so much these people differed when captain vellacott on a hurdle came to surgeon cutcliffes door and the horse was led to farrier gould who sent him to the mayor for opinions and his worship sent him on to pilch of the knackers yard poor justice vellacotts collar bone was snapped in two places and his left thigh broken also three of his ribs stoven in and a good deal of breakage abroad in his head however they hoped that he might come round and being a devonshire man he did as i found out afterwards this tale which ostler john delivered at ten times the length of the above caused a very great stir and excitement and comparison of opinions and when these wiseacres had almost exhausted their powers of wonder i desired to know in the name of goodness why the poor parson must be saddled with every man who fell off his horse in the first place he must have been far away from the scene of the misfortune inasmuch as no more than an hour ago he was seeking his groom amongst us and again what could be more likely than that captain vellacott might have taken with a view to good luck for his purchase a bottle or two of wine beyond what otherwise would have contented him and even if notwhy a horse might fall much more a man who has only two legs without anybody having designed it this reasoning of mine made no impression because everybodys opinion was set passon chowne had adooed it they scratched their heads and went into side questions but on the main point all agreedtwor ayther the passon or the devil himzell chapter xxix a visit to a parson my opinion of devonshire now grew fast that most of the people are mad there honest respectable very kindhearted shrewd at a bargain yet trustful simple manly and outspoken nevertheless they must be mad to keep parson chowne among them but here as in one or two other matters i found myself wrong ere i finished with it if a man visits a strange country he ought to take time to think about it and not judge the natives by first appearance however superior he may be this i felt even then and tried my very best to act up to it nevertheless it came back on me always that in the large county of devon there were only two sound people parson chowne for the oneand of course for the other davy llewellyn so i resolved to see this thing out especially as when i came to think nothing could be clearer than that the parson himself had descried and taken me with his wonderful quickness for the only intelligent man to be found how he knew me to be a welshman i could not tell then and am not sure now it must have been because i looked so superior to the rest of them i gazed at the two crownpieces when i came to be active again the next day and finding them both very good i determined to keep them and go to see after some more but if i thought to have got the right side of the bargain so far as the money went i reckoned amiss considerably for i found that the parson lived so far away that i could not walk thither and back again without being footsore for a week and captain fuzzy would not allow it especially as he had bound me to help in discharging cargo and being quite ignorant as to the road to hire a horse would not avail me even supposing i could stay on board of him which was against all experience and by the time i had hired a cart to take me to nympton on the moors as well as a hand to pilot her behold i was on the wrong side of my two crowns without any allowance for rations they told me that everybody always charged double price for going up to the parsons and even so did not care for the job much because though it was possible to come back safe there was a poor chance of doing so without some damage to man or beast and perhaps to the vehicle also hereupon i had a great mind not to go but being assured upon all sides that this would be a most dangerous thing as well as supported perhaps by my native resolution and habits of inquiry i nailed my colours to the mast and mounted the cart by the larboard slings it was a long and tiresome journey quite up into a wilderness and for the latter part of it the track could not have been found except by means of a rough stone flung down here and there but the driver told me that parson chowne took the whole of it three times aweek at a gallop not being able to live without more harm than this lonely place afforded finding this fellow more ahead of his wits than most of those devonshire yokels are i beguiled the long journey by letting him talk and now and then putting a question to him he was full of course like all the town of poor captain vellacotts misadventure and the terrible spell put upon his new horse which had seemed in the morning so quiet and docile this he pretended at first to explain as the result of a compact formed some years back between his reverence and the devil for parson chowne had thoroughly startled and robbed the latter of all selfesteem until he had given in and contracted to be at his beck and call like a good servant until it should come to the settlement and poor parson jack was to be thrown in though not such a very bad man sometimes it being thoroughly understood though not expressed between them that parson chowne was to lead him on step by step with his own pilgrimage all this i listened to very quietly scarce knowing what to say about it however i asked the driver as a man having intimate knowledge of horses whether he really did believe that they like the swine of the gadarenes were laid open to infection from even a man with seven devils in him and the more so as these had been never cast out according to all that appeared of him at this he cracked his whip and thought not being much at theology and not having met it may be until now a man so thoroughly versed in it i gave him his time to consider it out but the trouble seemed only to grow on him until he laid down his whip and said not being able to do any more horses is horses and pigs is pigs every bit the same as men be men if the lord made em both the devil had the right to take em both this was so sound in point of reasoning as well as of what we do hear in church that never another word could i say being taken in my own shallowness and this is the only thing that can happen to a fellow too fond of objections however the driver perceiving now that he had been too much for me was pleased with me and became disposed to make it up by a freedom of further information if i were to put this in his own words who could make head or tail of it and indeed i could not stoop my pen to write such outlandish language he said that his cousin was the very same knacker who had slaughtered that poor horse last night to put it out of misery having an order from the mayor putt thiss here hannimall to deth he did it and thought no more about it until he got up in the morning then as no boiling was yet on hand he went to look at this fine young horse whose time had been so hastened and the brains being always so valuable for mixing with freshbut i will not tell for the sake of honourit was natural that he should look at the head of this poor creature finding the eyes in a strange condition he examined them carefully and lifting the lids and probing round in each he found a berry my coachman said that his cousin now took these two berries which he had thus discovered out of a new hornbox in which he had placed them for certainty and asked him to make out what they were the knacker for his part believed that they came from a creeping plant called the bittersweet nightshade or sometimes the ladys necklace but his cousin my coachman thought otherwise he had wandered a good deal about in the fields before he married his young woman and there he had seen in autumnal days the very same things as had killed the poor horse a red thing that sticks in a cloven pod much harder than berries of nightshade and likely to keep in its poison until the moisture and warmth should dissolve its skin i knew what he meant after thinking a while because when a child i had gathered them it is the seed of a nasty flag which some call the roastbeef plant and others the stinking iris these poisonous things in the eyes of a horse cleverly pushed in under the lids heating and melting according as the heating and working of muscles crushed them then shooting their red fire over the agonised tissues of eyeballswhat horse would not have gone mad with it also finding so rare a chance of a devonshire man who was not dumb i took opportunity of going into the matter of that fine old gentleman whose strange and unreasonable habit of seeking among those braunton burrows as if for somebody buried there had almost broken my rest ever since till i stumbled on yet greater wonders coachman however knew nothing about it or else was not going to tell too much and took a sudden turn of beginning to think that i asked too many questions without even an inn to stand treat at and perhaps he found out with the jerks of the cart that i had a very small phial of rum not enough for two people to think of he may have been bidding for that with his news if so he made a great mistake not that i ever grudge anything only that there was not half enough for myself under the trying circumstances and the man should have shown better manners than ever to cast even half an eye on it at last we were forced on the brow of a hill to come to a mooring in a fine old ditch not having even a wall or a tree or a rick of peat to shelter us and half a mile away round the corner might be found as the driver said the rectory house of parson chowne neither horse nor man would budge so much as a yard more in that direction and it took a great deal to make them promise to wait there till two of the clock for me but i had sense enough to pay nothing until they should carry me home again still i could not feel quite sure how far their courage would hold out in a lonely place and so unkind and even with all that i feel within me of royal blood from royal bardswhich must be the highest form of iti did not feel myself so wholly comfortable and relishing as my duty is towards dinnertime nevertheless i plucked up courage and went round the corner here i found a sort of a road with firtrees on each side of it all blown one way by strong storms and unable to get back again the road lay not in a hollow exactly but in a shallow trough of the hills which these firtrees were meant to fill up if the wind would allow them occasion and going between them i felt the want of the pole i had left behind me and if i had happened to own a gold watch or anything fit to breed enemies the knowledge of my price would have kept me from such temptation of providence a tremendous roaring of dogs broke upon me the moment i got the first glimpse of the house and this obliged me to go on carefully because of that race i have had too much and never found them mannersome one huge fellow rushed up to me and disturbed my mind to so great a degree that i was unable to take heed of anything about the place except his savage eyes and highly alarming expression and manner for he kept on showing his horrible tusks and growling a deep growl broken with snarls and sidling to and fro so as to get the better chance of a dash at me and i durst not take my eyes from his or his fangs would have been in my throat at a spring i called him every endearing name that i could lay my tongue to and lavished upon him such admiration as might have melted the sternest heart but he placed no faith in a word of it and nothing except my determined gaze kept him at bay for a moment therefore i felt for my sailors knife which luckily hung by a string from my belt and if he had leaped at me he would have had it as sure as my name is llewellyn and few men i think would find fault with me for doing my best to defend myself however one man did for a stern voice cried shut your knife you scoundrel poor sammy did the villain threaten you sammy crouched and fawned and whimpered and went on his belly to lick his master while i wiped the perspiration of my fright beneath my hat this is a nice way to begin said chowne after giving his dog a kick to come here and draw a knife on my very best dog go down on your knees sir and beg sammys pardon may it please your reverence i replied in spite of his eyes which lay fiercer upon me than even those of the dog had done i would have cut his throat and i will if he dares to touch me that would grieve me my good welshman because i should then let loose the pack and we might have to bury you however no more of this trifle go in to my housekeeper and recover your nerves a little and in half an hour come to my study i touched my hat and obeyed his order following the track which he pointed out but keeping still ready for action if any more dogs should bear down on me however i met no creature worse than a very morose old woman who merely grunted in reply to the very best flourish i could contrive and led me into a long low kitchen dinnertime for the common people being now at maturity i expected to see all the servants of course and to smell something decent and gratifying however there was no such luck only without even asking my taste she gave me a small jug of sour ale and the bottom of a loaf and a bit of dutch cheese of course this was good enough for me and having an appetite after the ride i felt truly grateful however i could not help feeling also that in the cupboard just over my elbow there lay a fillet of fine spiced beef to which i have always been partial and after the perils i had encountered the least she could do was to offer it down anywhere else i might have taken the liberty of suggesting this but in that house i durst not further than to ask very delicately madam it is early for great people but has his reverence been pleased to dine did he give you leave to ask sir no i cannot say that he did i meant no offence but only i mean no offence but only you must be a stranger to think of asking a question in this house without his leave nothing could have been said to me more thoroughly grievous and oppressive and she offered no line or opening for me to begin again as cross women generally do by not being satisfied with their sting so i made the best of my breadandcheese and thought that sker house was a paradise compared to nympton rectory it is time for you now to go to my master she broke in with her cold harsh voice before i had scraped all the rind of my cheese and when i was looking for more sour beer very well i replied there is no temptation of any sort madam to linger here she smiled for the first time a very tart smile even worse than the flavour of that shrewd ale but without its weakness and then she pointed up some steps and along a stone passage and said exactly as if she took me for no more than a common tramp at the end of that passage turn to the left and knock at the third door round the corner you dare not lay hands on anything my master will know it if you do this was a little too much for me after all the insults i had now put up with i turned and gazed full on her strange square face and into the depth of her narrow black eyes with a glimpse of the window showing them your master i said your son you mean and much there is to choose between you she did not betray any signs of surprise at this haphazard shot of mine but coldly answered my gaze and said you are very insolent let me give you a warning you seem to be a powerful man in the hands of my master you would be a babe although you are so much larger and were i to tell him what you have said there would not be a sound piece of skin on you now let me hear no more of you with the greatest pleasure madam i am sure i cant understand whatever could bring me here but i can she answered more to her own thoughts than to mine as she shut the door quite on my heels and left me to my own devices i felt almost as much amiss as if i were in an evil dream of being chased through caves of rock by some of my very best customers all bearing redhot toasting forks and pelting me with my own good fish it is the very worst dream i have and it never comes after a common supper which proves how clear my conscience is and even now i might have escaped because there were side passages and for a minute i stood in doubt until there came into my mind the tales of the pack of hounds he kept and two or three people torn to pieces and nobody daring to interfere also i wanted to see him again for he beat everybody i had ever seen and i longed to be able to describe him to a civilised audience at the jolly sailors therefore i knocked at the door of his room approaching it very carefully and thanking the lord for his last great mercy in having put my knife into my head you may come in was the answer i got at last and so in i went and a queerer room i never did go into but wonderful as the room was surely and leaving on memory a shade of halfseen wonders afterwards for the time i had no power to look at anything but the man people may laugh and they always do until they gain experience at the idea of one man binding other men prisoners to his will for all their laughing there stands the truth and the men who resist such influence best are those who do not laugh at it i have seen too much of the tricks of the world to believe in anything supernatural but the granting of this power is most strictly within natures scope and somebody must have it one man has the gift of love that everybody loves him another has the gift of hate that nobody comes near him the third and far the rarest gift combines the two others one more one less and adds to them both the gift of fear i felt as i tried to meet his gaze and found my eyes quiver away from it that the further i kept from this mans sight the better it would be for me he sat in a highbacked chair and pointed to a threelegged stool as much as to say you may even sit down this i did and waited for him your name is david llewellyn he said caring no more to look at me you came from the coast of glamorgan three days ago in the rose of devon schooner ketch your reverence if you please the difference is in the mizzenmast well jack ketch if you like sir no more interrupting me now you will answer a few questions and if you tell me one word of falsehood he did not finish his sentence but he frightened me far more than if he had i promised to do my best to tell the truth so far as lies in me do you know what child that was that came ashore drowned upon your coast when the coroner made such a fool of himself and the jury as well your reverence about the child i know nothing at all describe that child to the best of your power for you are not altogether a fool i told him what the poor babe was like so far as i could remember it but something holy and harmless kept me from saying one word about bardie and to the last day of my life i shall rejoice that i so behaved he saw that i was speaking truth but he showed no signs of joy or sorrow until i ventured to put in may i ask why your reverence wishes to know and what you think of this matter and how certainly you may ask llewellyn it is a womans and a welshmans privilege but certainly you shall have no reply what inquiry has been made along your coast about this affair i longed to answer him in my humour even as he had answered me with any one else i could have done it but i durst not so with him therefore i told him all the truth to the utmost of my knowledgemaking no secret of hezekiah and his low curiosity also the man of the press with the hat and then i could not quite leave out the visit of anthony stew and sir philip this more than anything else aroused parson chownes attention for the papers he cared not a damn he said for two of them lived by abusing him but as he swore not except that once it appeared to me that he did care however he pressed me most close and hard about anthony stew and sir philip when he had got from me all that i knewexcept that he never once hit upon bardie the heart and the jewel of everything he asked me without any warning do you know who that sir philip is no your reverence i have not even heard so much as his surname although no doubt i shall find out you fool is that all the wit you have three days in and out of barnstaple it is sir philip bampfylde of narnton court close by you there is no narnton court that i know of your reverence anywhere round our neighbourhood there is candleston court and court isa and court tush i mean near where your ship is lying and that is chiefly what i want with you i know men well and i know that you are a man that will do anything for money my breath was taken away at this so far was it from my true character i like money well enough in its way but as for a single disgraceful action your reverence never made such a mistake for coming up here i have even paid more than you were pleased to give me if that is your point i will go straight back do anything indeed for money pooh this is excellent indignation what man is there but will do so i mean of course anything you consider to be right and virtuous anything which is undeniably right and upright and virtuous ah now your reverence understands me such has always been my character in your own opinion well selfrespect is a real blessing i will not ask you to forego it your business will be of a nature congenial as well as interesting to you your ship lies just in the right position for the service i require and as she is known to have come from wales no revenuemen will trouble you you will have to keep watch both day and night upon sir philip and narnton court nothing in the nature of spying your reverence or sneaking after servants or underhand work nothing at all of that sort you have nothing to do but to use your eyes upon the riverfront of the building especially the landingplace you will come and tell me as soon as ever you see any kind of boat or vessel either come to or leave the landingplace also if any man with a trumpet hails either boat or vessel in short any kind of communication betwixt narnton court and the river you need not take any trouble except when the tide is up the river am i to do this against sir philip who has been so kind and good to me if so i will hear no more of it not so it is for sir philips good he is in danger and very obstinate he stupidly meddles with politics my object is to save him i see what your reverence means i answered being greatly relieved by this for then and even to this day i believe many of the ancient families were not content with his gracious majesty but hankered after ungracious stuarts mainly because they could not get them i will do my best to oblige you sir i finished and made a bow to him to obey me you mean of course you will but remember one thingyou are not to dare to ask a single word about this family or even mention sir philips name to anybody except myself i have good reason for this order if you break it i shall know it and turn you to stone immediately you are aware that i possess that power please your reverence i have heard so and i would gladly see it donenot to myself as yet but rather to that old woman in the kitchen it could not make much difference to her keep your position sir he answered in a tone which frightened me it was not violent but so deep and now for your scale of wages of course being opposite that old house you would watch it without any orders the only trouble i give you is thiswhen the tide runs up after dark and smooth water lets vessels over the bar you will have to loosen your boat or dingy punt or whatever you call her and pull across the river and lie in a shaded corner which you will find below narnton court and commanding a view of it have you firearms then take this the stock is hollow and contains six charges you can shoot i am sure of that i know a poacher by his eyelids he gave me a heavy twobarrelled pistol long enough for a gun almost and meant to be fired from the shoulder then pressing a spring in the stock he laid bare a chamber containing some ammunition as well as a couple of spare flints he was going to teach me how to load it till i told him that i had been captain of cannon and perhaps the best shot in the royal navy then dont shoot yourself he said as most of the old sailors have reason to do but now you will earn your living well what with your wages on board the schooner and the crown aweek i shall give you a crown aweek your reverence my countenance must have fallen sadly for i looked to a guinea aweek at least and to have to stay out of my bed like that it is a large sum i know llewellyn but you must do your best to earn it by diligence and alacrity i could have sent one of my fine naked fellows and of course not have paid him anything but the fools near the towns are so fidgety now that they stare at these honest adamites and talk of themwhich would defeat my purpose be off with you i must go and see them nothing else refreshes me after talking so long to a fellow like you here are two guineas for youone in advance for your first months wage the other you will keep until i have done with you and then return it to me a month your honour i cried in dismay i never could stop in this country a month why a week of it would be enough to drive me out of my mind almost you will stay as long as i please llewellyn that second guinea which you pouched so promptly is to enable you to come to me by day or by night on the very moment you see anything worth reporting you are afraid of the dogs yes all rogues are here take this whistle they are trained to obey itthey will crouch and fawn to you when you blow it he gave me a few more minute instructions and then showed me out by a little sidedoor and all the way back such a weight was upon me and continual presence of strange black eyes and dread of some hovering danger that i answered the driver to never a word nor cared for any of his wondrous stories about the naked people whose huts we beheld in a valley below us nay not eventhough truly needing it and to my own great amazementcould i manage a drop of my pittance of rum so the driver got it after all or at least whatever remained of it while i wished myself back at old newton nottage and seemed to be wrapped in an evil dream both horse and driver however found themselves not only thankful but lighthearted at getting away from nympton moor jack even sang a song when five miles off and in his clumsy way rallied me but finding this useless he said that it was no more than he had expected because it was known that it always befell every man who forgot his baptism and got into dealings with parson chowne chapter xxx on duty there are many people who cannot enter into my meaning altogether this i have felt so often that now i may have given utterance to it once or possibly twice before if so you will find me consistent wholly and quite prepared to abide by it in all substantial things i am clearer than the noonday sun itself and to the very utmost farthing righteous and unimpeachable money i look at now and then when it comes across me and i like it well enough for the sake of the things it goes for but as for committing an action below the honour of my family and ancestors who never tuned their harps for less than a mark anight also and best of all my own consciencea power that thumps all night like a ghost if i have not strictly humoured itfor me to talk of such things seems almost to degrade the whole of them therefore if any one dreams in his folly that i would play the spy upon that great house over the river i have no more to say except that he is not worthy to read my tale i regard him with contempt and loathe him for his vile insinuations such a man is only fit to take the place of a spy himself and earn perhaps something worth talking of if his interest let him talk of it for taking friendly observation of narnton court for its inmates sake i was to have just five shillings aweek it became my duty now to attend to the getting out of the limestone and i fetched it up with a swing that shook every leaf of the rose of devon fuzzy attempted to govern me but i let him know that i would not have it and never knocked under to any man and if parson chowne had come alongside i would have said the same to him nevertheless as an honest man i took good care to earn my money though less than the value of one good sewin or at any rate of a fine turbot each week no craft of any sort went up or down that blessed river without my laying perspective on her if there chanced to be light enough or if she slipped along after darkwhich is not worth while to do on account of the shoals and windingsthere was i in our little dingy not so far off as they might imagine and i could answer for it even with disdainful chowne looking down through me that nothing larger than a rowboat could have made for narnton court but i have not said much of the river as yet and who can understand me this river bends in graceful courtesies to the sweet land it is leaving and the hills that hold its birth also with a vein of terror at the unknown sea before it back it comes when you grieve to think that it must have said goodbye for ever such a lovely winding river with so many wilful ways silvery shallows and deep rich shadows where the trees come down to drink also beautiful brightgreen meadows sloping to have a taste of it and the pleaches of bright sand offered to satisfy the tide and the dark points jutting out on purpose to protect it many rivers have i seen nobler grander more determined yet among them all not one that took and led my heart so had i been born on its banks or among the hills that gaze down over it what a song i would have made to italthough the bardic inspiration seems to have dropped out of my generation yet will it return with fourfold vigour probably in bunnys children if she ever has any that is to say of the proper gender for the thumb of a woman is weak on the harp and bunnys only aspiration is for ribbons and lollipops which must be beaten out of her however my principal business now was not to admire this river but watch it and sometimes i found it uncommonly cold and would gladly have had quite an ugly river if less attractive to white frosts and what with the clearing of our cargo and the grumbling afterwards and the waiting for sailingorders and never getting any and the settingin of a sudden gale which but for me must have capsized us when her hold was empty as well as some more delays which now i cannot stop to think ofthe middle of october found us still made fast by stem and stern in barnstaple river at deadmans pill parson chowne who never happened to neglect a single thing that did concern his interests any more than he ever happened to forget an injury twice or thrice aweek he came mounted on his coalblack mare to know what was going on with us i sawfor i am pretty sharp though not pretending to vie with him as no man might who had not dealt in a wholesale mode with the devili saw though the clumsy understrappers meant me not to notice it that bethel jose our captain was no more than a slave of the parsons this made clear to me quite a lump of what had seemed hopeless mysteries touching my poor self to begin with chowne knew all about me of course by means of this dirty fuzzy also fuzzys silence now and the difficulty of working him with any number of sheets in the wind which had puzzled both newton and nottage and the two publichouses at porthcawl and might have enabled him to marry even a farmers widow with a rabbitwarren and l to dispose of and a reputation for sheepsmilk cheese and herself not badlooking in spite of a beard i could see and could carry home the truth having thoroughly got to the bottom of it and might have a chance myself to settle if i dealt my secret well with some of the women who had sworn to be single until that fuzzy provoked them so this consideration added more than can be now described to my desire to get home before any one got in front of me but fuzzy from day to day pretended that the ketch was not victualled to sail any more than she was even ballasted she must load with hay or with bricks or pottery or with something to fill her hold and pay freight or what was to fill our bellies all the way back and so on and so on until i was sure that he had some dark reason for lingering there of course i had not been such a pure foolin spite of short seasons for going from homeas to forget my desire and need to come home after proper interval the whole of the parish would yearn for me and so would ewenny and llaleston long ere the christmas cod comes in and i made a point in my promises to be back before gunpowder treason and plot as a thoroughly ancient hand at the cannon i always led the fireworks and the pope having done something violent lately they were to be very grand this year what is a man when outside his own countrya prophet a magistrate even a sailor who has kept well in with his relations all his old friends are there longing to praise him when they hear of good affairs and as to his enemiesa man of my breadth of nature has none this made it dreadfully grievous for me not to be getting home again and my heart was like a sprouted onion when i thought of bardie bunny would fight on i knew and get converted to the church in the house of our churchwarden and perhaps be baptised after all which my wife never would have done to her however i did not care for that because no great harm could come of it and if the primitives gave her ribbons the church would be bound to grant honiton lace thinking of all my engagements and compacts and serious trusteeships and the many yearnings after me i told bethel jose in so many words that i was not a black man but a white man unable to be trampled on and prepared unless they could show me better to place my matter in the hands of his worship no less than the mayor of barnstaple fuzzy grinned and so did ike and finding the mayor sitting handsomely upon the very next marketday i laid my case before him his worship as keeping a grocers shop at which i had bought three pounds of onions and a quarter of a pound of speckled cheese and half an ounce of tobacco was much inclined to do me justice and indeed began to do so in a loud and powerful voice and eager for people to hearken him but somebody whispered something to him containing no doubt the great parsons name and he shrank back into his hole and discharged my summons like a worm with lime laid on his tail such things are painful yet no man must insist upon them hardly because our ancestors got on among far greater hardships and it would prove us a bad low age if we turned sour about them we are the finest fellows to fight that were ever according to providence we ought to be thankful for this great privilege as i mean to show byandby and i would not shake hands with any man who for trumpery stuff would dare to make such a terrible force internal this grand soundness of my nature led me to go under orders though acquit of legal contract only seeking to do the right while receiving the money beforehand now this created a position of trust for it involved a strong confidence in ones honour any man paying me beforehand places me at a disadvantage which is hardly fair of him i do not like to refuse him because it would seem so ungraceful and yet i can never be sure but that i ought to take consideration not to dwell too much upon scruples which scarcely any one else might feel and no other man can enter into be it enough that my honour now was bound to do what was expected but what a hardship it was to be sure to find myself debarred entirely from forming acquaintance or asking questions or going into the matter in my own style especially now that my anxiety was quickened beyond bearing to get to the bottom of all these wonders about sir philip bampfylde what had led him to visit me what was he seeking on braunton burrowsfor now i knew that it must be he why did parson chowne desire to keep such watch on the visitors to narnton court by water while all the world might pass into or out of the house by land or did the parson keep other people watching the other side of the house and prevent me from going near them lest we should league together to cheat him this last thing seemed to be very likely and it proved to be more than that revolving all this much at leisure in the quiet churn of mind i pushed off with my little dingy from the side of the rose of devon when the evening dusk was falling somewhere at octobers end this little boat now seemed to be placed at my disposal always although there used to be such a fuss and turn for turn in taking her now the glance of light on water and the flowing shadows keeping humour with the quiet play of evening breezes here a hill and there a tree or rock to be regarded while the strong influx of sea with white wisps traced the middle channel and the little nooks withdrawn under gentle promontories took no heed of anything when the moon came over these dissipating clouds and moving sullen mists aside her track i found it uncommonly difficult to be sure what i was up to the full moon lately risen gazed directly down the river but memory of daylight still was coming from the westward feeble and inclined to yield what business was all this of mine god makes all things to have turn and i doubt if he ever meant mankind to be always spying into it ever so much better go these things without our bother and our parson said being a noble preacher and fit any day for the navy that the people who conquered the world according to the prophet joelth after trinitynever noticed nature never did consult the lord of hosts and yet must have contented him difficult questions of this colour must be left to parsons who beat all lawyers out and out in the matter of pure cleverness because the latter never can anyhow but the former somehow with the greatest ease reconcile all difficulties the only business i have to deal with is what i bodily see feel and hear and have mind to go through with and work out to perfect satisfaction and this night i found more than ever broke upon my wits before except when muzzle gapes at muzzle and to blow or be blown up depends upon a single spark because now in my quiet manner growing to be customary under parson chownes regard dipping oars i crossed the river making slant for running tide that man knowing everybody who might suit his purpose had employed me rather than old ikey or even fuzzy partly because i could row so well and make no sound in doing it while either of them with muffled rowlocks would splash and grunt to be heard across river and halfway to barnstaple bridge almost as silently as an owl i skimmed across the silent river not with the smallest desire to spy but because the poetry of my nature came out strongly and having this upon me still i rowed my boat into a drooping tree overhanging a quiet nook here i commanded the riverfront of all that great house narnton court which stands on the north side of the water over against our deadmans pill after several voyages under sundry states of light and weather this was now approved to me as the very best point of observation for all the long and straggling house quite big enough for any three of the magistrates houses on our side could have been taken and raked as it were like a great ship with her stern to me from the spot where i lay hidden such a length it stretched along with little except the west end to me and a show of frontwindows dark and void and all along the riverterrace and the narrow spread of it overlooking the bright water pagan gods or wicked things just as bad all standing however that was not my business if the gentry will forego the whole of their christianity they must answer for themselves when the proper time appears only we would let them know that we hold aloof from any breach of their commandments a flight of ten wild ducks had been seen coming up the river every now and then as well as fourteen redcaps and three or four good wisps of teal having to see to my victualling now as well as for the sport of it i loaded the parsons twofoot pistol which was as good as a gun almost with three tobacco pipes full of powder poured into each barrel and then a piece of an ancient hat which ikey had worn so long that no man could distinguish it from wadding and upon the top of the hat three ounces of leaden pellets and all kept tight with a good dollop of oakum it must kill a wild duck at forty yards or a redcap up to fifty if i hit the rogues in the head at all the tide must have been pretty nigh the flood and the moon was rising hazily and all the river was pale and lonely for the brownsailed lighters which they call the tawton fleet had long passed by when i heard that silvery sound of swiftness cleaving solitudethe flight of a wedge of wild ducks i knelt in the very smallest form that nature would allow of and with one hand held a branch to keep the boat from surging plash they came down after two short turns as sudden as forked lightning heads down for a moment then heads up and wings flapping sousing and subsiding quacks began from the old drake first and then from the rest of the company and a racing after one another and a rapid gambolling under and between them all the river lost its smoothness beaten into ups and downs that sloped away in ridge and furrow these fine fellows as fat as butter after the barleystubble time carried on such joy and glory within twenty yards of me that i could not bring my gun to bear for quiet shot so as to settle four like an ancient gunner i bided my time being up to the tricks of most of them when their wild delight of water should begin to sate itself what would they do why gather in round the father of the family and bob their heads together this is the time to be sure of them especially with two barrels fired at once as i could easily manage i never felt surer of birds in my life i smelt them in the drippingpan and beheld myself quite basting them but all of a sudden up they flew when i had got three in a line and waited for two more to come into it just as the muzzle was true upon themup and away and left me nothing except to rub my eyes and swear i might have shot as they rose but something told me not to do so therefore i crept back in my little punt and waited in another moment i heard the swing of stout oars pulled with time and power such as i had not heard for years nor since myself was stroke of it of course i knew that this must be a boat of the british navy probably the captains gig and choice young fellows rowing her and the tears sprang into my eyes at thought of all the times and things between and all the heavy falls of life since thus i clove the waters all my heart went out towards her and i held my breath with longing as i looked between the branches of the dark and fluttering tree just to let them know that here was one who understood them chapter xxxi two lovers the boat came round the corner swiftly of the wooded stretch of rock within whose creek i lay concealed and the officer in the sternsheets cried in the short sharp tone of custom easy stroke hold all i heard him jerk the rudderlines as they passed within biscuittoss of me and with a heavy sheer he sent her as if he knew every inch of water to the steps of narnton court not the handsome balustrade only a landing of narrow stoneway nearer to me than the western end and where the riverside terrace stopped two men sprang ashore and made the boat fast at the landing and then some others lifted out what seemed to be a heavy chest and placed it on the topmost step until the officer having landed signed to them to bear it further to a corner of the parapet i could see the whole of these doings and distinguish him by his uniform because the boat and the group of sailors were not more than fifty yards from me and almost in the track of the moon from the place where i was hiding in a minute or two all returned to the boat with the exception of the officer and i heard him give orders from the shore round the point men keep close and wait for me under the yellow hook i showed you the coxswain jumped into the sternsheets in a second or two they had put about and the light gig pulling six good oars shot by me on the first of the ebb as swiftly almost as the wild ducks flew meanwhile the officer stood and gazed until they had rounded the western point from which they had spoiled my shot so and knowing the vigilant keenness of a british captains eyes i feared that he might espy my punt which would have disgraced me dreadfully and even without this i felt how much i would rather be far away there could have been no man more against my taste to keep a watch upon than a captain in the royal navy whose father might have been over me and vigorously as i called to mind that all i was doing must be for his good as well as for that of his relatives i could not find that satisfaction which ought to flow from such benevolence however it now was too late to back out even if my desire to know the end of this matter allowed of it the officer stood for a minute or two as if in brown thoughts and deep melancholy and turned to the house once or twice and seemed to hesitate as to approaching it the long great house with the broad riverfront looked all dark and desolate not a servant a horse or even a dog was moving and the only sign of life i could see was a dull light in a little window over a narrow doorway while i was wondering at all this and the captain standing gloomily a little dark figure crossed the moonlight from the shadowy doorway and the officer made a step or two and held out his arms and received it they seemed to stay pretty well satisfied thus the figure being wholly female until with a sudden change of thought there seemed to be some sobbing this led the captain to try again some soft modes of persuasion such as i could not see into even if i would have deigned to do a thing against my grain so because i have been in that way myself and did not want to be looked at however not to be too long over what every man almost goes through some honestly and some anyhow but all tending to experience my only desire was finding them at it to get out of the way very quickly for poor as i am there were several women of newton and llaleston and ewenny and even of bridgend our markettown setting their caps like springles at me whereas i laboured at nothing else but to pay respect to my poor wifes memory and never have a poor woman after her and now all these romantic doings made me feel uneasy and ready to be infected so as to settle with nothing more than had been offered me thrice and three times refuseda footandinch mangle and if she proved a tiger have to work it myself perhaps be that either way these two unhappy lovers came along while i was wondering at them yet able to make allowance so until they must have seen me if they had a corner of an eye for anything less than one another they stood on a plank that crossed the narrow creek or slot wherein i lay under a willow full of brown leaves and scarcely ten yards from me here there was a rail across about as big as a kidneybean stick whereupon they leaned and looked into the water under them then they sighed and made such sorrow streaked somehow with happiness that i got myself ready to leap overboard if either or both of them should jump in however they had more sense than that though they went on very tenderly and with a soft strain quite unfit to belong to a british officer being from ancient though humble birth gifted with a deal of delicacy i pulled out two plugs of tobacco which happened to be in my mouth just now and i spared them both to stop my ears though striking inwards painfully i tried to hear nothing for ever so long but i found myself forced to ease out the plugs they did smart so confoundedly and this pair wanted some one now to take a judicious view of them for which few men perhaps could be found better qualified than i was for they carried on in so high a manner that it seemed as if they could be cured by nothing short of married life of which i had so much experience and the principal principle of that state is that neither party must begin to make too much of the other side but being now over that sort of thing i found myself snug in a corner and able to view them with interest and considerable candour is there no hope of it then after all after all you have done and suffered and the prayers of everybody this was the maiden of course having right to the first word and the last of it there is hope enough my darling but nothing ever comes of it and how can i search out this strange matter while i am on service always throw it up drake my dear heart for my sake throw it up and throw over all ambition until you are cleared of this foul shame my ambition is slender now he answered and would be content with one slender lady here he gave her a squeeze that threatened not only to make her slenderer but also to make the rail need more stoutness and me to keep ready for plunging nevertheless you know he went on when the plank and the rail put up with it i cannot think of myself for a moment while i am thus on duty we expect orders for america so you said and it frightens me if that should be so what ever ever can become of us my own dear you are a child almost a child for a man like me knocked about the world so much and ever so unfortunate the rest of his speech was broken into much to my dissatisfaction by a soft caressing comfort such as womens pity yields without any consideration only they made all sorts of foolish promises and eternal pledges touched up with confidence and hope and mutual praise and faith and doubt and the other ins and outs of love i wont cry any more she said with several sobs between it i ought not to be so with you who are so strong and good and kind your honour is cruelly wronged at home you never shall say that your own own love wished you to peril it also abroad he took her quietly into his arms and they seemed to strengthen one another and to my eyes came old tears or at any rate such as had come long ago these two people stood a great time silent full of one another keeping close with reverent longing gazing yet not looking at the moonlight and the water then the delicate young maiden for such her voice and outline showed her though i could not judge her face shivered in the curling fog which the climbing moon had brought hereupon the captain felt that her lungs must be attended to as well as her lips and her waist and heart and he said in a soft way like a shawl come away my lovely darling from the cold and fog and mist your little cloak is damp all through and time it is for me to go discipline i will have always and i must have the same with you until you take command of me many many a weary year ere i have the chance of it captain drake the young thing sighed as she spoke though perhaps without any sense of prophecy isabel let us not talk like that even if we think it the luck must turn some day my darling even i cannot be always on the evil side of it how often has my father said so and what stronger proof can i have than you as long as you are true to me they were turning away when this bright idea which seems to occur to lovers always under some great law of nature to prolong their interviewsthis compelled them to repeat pretty much the same forms and ceremonies assurances pledges and suchlike which had passed between them scarcely more than three or four minutes ago at the utmost and again i looked away because i would have had others do so to me and there was nothing new to learn by it only one thing more my own said the lady taking his arm again one more thing you must promise me if you care for me at all keep out of the way of that dreadful man why how can i meet him at sea my bell even if he dislikes me as you tell me perpetually though i never gave him cause that i know of he does not dislike you drake bampfylde he hates you with all the venomous cold black hatred such as i fear to think ofoh my dear oh my dear now isabel try not to be so foolish i never could believe such a thing and i never will without clearest proof i never could feel like that myself even if any one wronged me deeply and in spite of all my bad luck bell i have never wronged any one at least more than you know of then dont wrong me my own dear love by taking no heed of yourself here there and everywhere seems to be his nature you may be proud of your ship and people and of course they are proud of you you may be ordered to gibraltar where they have done so gloriously or to america or to india but wherever you are you never can be out of the reach of that terrible man his ways are so crooked and so dark and so dreadfully coldblooded isabel isabel now be quiet what an imagination you have a man in holy orders a man of a good old family who have been ancient friends of ours a bad old family you meanbad for generations it does not matter of course what i say because i am so young and stupid but you are so frank and good and simple and so very brave and careless and i know that you will own some dayoh it frightens mo so to think of itthat you were wrong in this matter and your isabel was right what his answer was i cannot tell because they passed beyond my hearing upon their way towards the house the young lady with her long hair shining like woven gold in the moonlight tried so far as i could see to persuade him to come in with her this however he would not do though grieving to refuse her and she seemed to know the reason of it and to cease to urge him in and out of many things which they seemed to have to talk of he showed her the great chest in the dark corner and perhaps she paid good heed to it as to that how can i tell when they both were so far off and riverfogs arising yet one thing i well could tell or at any rate could have told it in the times when my blood ran fast and my habit of life was romantic even though the light was foggy and there was no time to waste these two people seemed so to stay with a great dislike of severing however they managed it at last and growing so cold in my shoulders now as well as my knees uncomfortable right glad was i to hear what the maiden listened to with intense despair that is to say the captains footfall a yard further off every time of the sound ho went along the braunton road to find his boat where the river bends and much as i longed to know him better and understand why he did such things and what he meant by hankering so after this young lady outside his own fathers house and refusing to go inside when invited and speaking of his own bad luck so much and having a chest put away from the moonlight likewise his men in the distance so far and compelled to keep round the corner not to mention his manner of walking and swinging his shoulders almost as if the world was nothing to him although i had never been perhaps so thoroughly pushed with desire of knowledge and all my best feelings uppermost there was nothing for me left except to ponder and to chow my quid rowing softly through the lanes and lines of misty moonlight to my little cuddyhome across the tidal river chapter xxxii among the savages at this moment it became a very nice point to perceive what was really honest and right and then to carry it out with all that fearless alacrity which in such cases i find to be as it were constitutional to me my high sense of honour would fain persuade me to keep in strictest secrecy that which so far as i could judge was not or might not have been intended for my eyes or ears or tongue on the other hand my still higher sense of duty to my employer which is a most needful and practical feeling and that power of loyalty which descends to me and perhaps will die with me as well as a strong and no less ancestral eagerness to be up to the tricks of all mysterious beingsi do not exaggerate when i say that the cutwater of my poor mind knew not which of these two hands pulled the stronger oar in short being tired and sleepy and weary and worn out with want of perceiving my way although i smoked three pipes all alone not from the smallest desire for them but because i have routed the devil thus many and many a night i knowas the priests do with their incense the reason of which i take to be that having so much smoke at home he shuns it when coming for change of airgrowing dreamy thus i said with nobody to answer me i will tumble into my berth as this dirty craft has no room for hammocks and between parson and captain i will leave my dreams to guide me i played with myself in saying this no man ever should play with himself it shows that he thinks too troublesomely and soon may come if he carries it on almost to forget that other people are nothing while himself is everything and if any man comes to that state of mind there is nothing more to hope of him i was not so far gone as that nevertheless it served me right for thinking such dreadful looseness to have no broad fine road of sleep in the depth whereof to be borne along and lie wherever wanted but instead of that to toss and kick with much selfdamage and worst of all to dream such murder that i now remember it what it was belongs to me who paid for it with a loss of hair very serious at my time of life however not to dwell upon that or upon myself in any waysuch being my perpetual wish yet thwarted by great activitylet it be enough to say that parson chowne in my visions came and horribly stood over me therefore arising betimes i hired a very fine horse and manning him bravely laid his head east and by south as near as might be according to our binnacle but though the wind was abaft the beam and tide and all in his favour and a brave commander upon his poop what did he do but bouse his stem and run out his spankerdriver and up with his taffrail as if i was wearing him in a thundering heavy sea i resolved to get the upper hand of this uncalledfor mutiny and the more so because all our crew were gazing and at the fair i had laid down the law very strictly concerning horses i slipped my feet out of the chains for fear of any sudden capsize and then i rapped him over the catheads where his anchor ought to hang he however instead of doing at all what i expected up with his boltsprit and down with his quarter as if struck by a whale under his forefoot this was so far from true seamanship and proved him to be so unbuilt for sailing that i was content to disembark over his stern and with slight concussions never say die has always been my motto and always will be nailing my colours to the mast i embarked upon another horse of less than half the tonnage of that one who would not answer helm and this craft being brokenbacked with a strange sound at her portholes could not under press of sail bowl along more than four knots an hour and we adjusted matters between us so that when she was tired i also was sore and therefore disembarked and towed her until we were both lit for sea again therefore it must have been good meridian when i met parson chowne near his house this man was seldom inside his own house except at his mealtimes or when asleep but roving about uncomfortably seeing to the veriest trifles everywhere abusing or kicking everybody and but for the certainty of his witchcraft ninefold powerful as they told me when conferred upon a parson and the black strength of his eyes and the doom that had befallen all who dared to go against him the men about the yards and stables told mewhen he was miles awaythat they never could have put up with him for his wages were also below their deserts he came to me from the kennel of hounds which he kept not for his own pleasure so much as for the delight of forbidding gentlemen whenever the whim might take him so especially if they were nobly accoutred from earning at his expense the glory of jumping hedges and ditches now as he came towards me or rather beckoned for me to come to him i saw that the other truly eminent parson the reverend john rambone was with him and giving advice about the string at the back of a young dogs tongue although this man was his greatest friend master chowne treated him no better than anybody else would fare but signed to the mate of the hounds or whatever those foxhunters call their chief officer to heed every word of what rambone said because these two divines had won faith throughout all parishes and hundreds chowne for the doctrine of horses and for discipline of dogs john rambone his reverence fixed a stern gaze upon me because i had not hurried myselfa thing which i never do except in a glorious naval actionand then he bade me follow him this i did and i declare even now i cannot tell whither he took me for i seemed to have no power in his presence of heeding anything but himself only i know that we passed through trees and sate down somewhere afterwards wherever it was or may have been so far as my memory serves i think that i held him at bay some little for instance i took the greatest care not to speak of the fair young lady inasmuch as she might not have done all she did if she had chanced to possess the knowledge of my being under the willowtree but parson chowne without my telling knew the whole of what was done and what he thought of it none might guess in the shadowy shining of his eyes you have done pretty well on the whole he said after asking many short questions but you must do better next time my man you must not allow all these delicate feelings chivalry resolute honesty and little things of that sort to interfere thus with business these things do some credit to you llewellyn and please you and add to your happiness which consists largely with you as it does with all men in conceit but you must not allow yourself thus to coquet with these beauties of human nature it needs a rich man to do that even add my five shillings to your own four and you cannot thus go to corinth i had been at corinth twice and found it not at all desirable so i could not make out what his reverence meant except that it must be something bad which at my time of life should not be put into the mind even by a clergyman but what i could least put up with was the want of encouragement i found for all my better feelings these seemed to meet with nothing more than discouragement and disparagement whereas i knew them to be sound substantial and solid and i always felt upon going to bed what happiness they afforded me and if the days of my youth had only passed through learned languages latin and greek and hebrew i doubt whether even parson chowne could have laid his own will upon me so supposing then that your reverence should make it ten i answered with my own four that would be fourteen i can truly believe that it would my man and you may come to that if you go on well now go into the house and enjoy yourself you welshmen are always hungry and you may talk as freely as you like which is your next desire every word you say will come back to me and some of it may amuse me if you have no sense you have some cunning you will know what things to speak of and be sure that you wait until i come back this was so wholly below and outside of the thing which i love to reconcile with my own constitution having so long been respected for them as well as rewarded by conscience that i scarcely knew where or who i was or what might next come over me and to complete my uncomfortable sense of being nobody i heard the sound of a galloping horse downhill as wild as could be and found myself left as if all the ideas which i was prepared to suggest were nothing however that was not my loss but his so i entered the house with considerable hope of enjoying myself as commanded for this purpose i have always found it in the house of a gentleman the height of luck to get among three young women and one old one the elderly woman attends to the cooking which is not understood by the young ones or at any rate cannot be much expected while on the other hand the young ones flirt in and out in a pleasant way laying the table and showing their arms which are of a lovely red as good as any gravy and then if you know how to manage them well with a wholesome deference to the old cook and yet an understandingwhile she is basting and as one might almost say behind her backa confidential feeling established that you know how she treats those young ones and how harshly she dares to speak if a coal comes into the drippingpan and in casting it out she burns her face and abuses the whole of them for her own fault also a little shy suggestion that they must put up with all this because the old cook is past sweethearting time and the parlourmaid scarcely come to it accompanied by a wink or two and a hint in the direction of the stablessome of the very noblest dinners that ever i made have been thus introduced but what forgiveness could i expect or who would listen to me if i dared to speak in the same dinnerhour of the goodly kitchen at candleston court or even at court ysha and the place that served as a sort of kitchen so far as they seemed to want one at this nympton rectory a chill came over every man directly he went into it and he knew that his meat would be hocks and bones and his gravy if any would stand cold dead however i made the best of it as my manner is with everything and though the old stony woman sate and seemed to make stone of every one i kept my spirits up and became in spite of all her stoppage what a man of my knowledge of mankind must be among womankind in a word though i do not wish to set down exactly how i managed it in half an hour i could see while carefully concealing it that there was not a single young woman there without beginning to say to herself should i like to be mrs llewellyn after that i can have them always but i know them too well to be hasty no prospects would suit me at my time of life unless they came after some cash in hand the louts from the stables and kennels poured in some of them very degustin as my bardie used to say nevertheless the girls seemed to like them and who was i even when consulted to pretend to say otherwise in virtue of what i had seen among barbarous tribes and everywhere and all my knowledge of ceremonies and the way they marry one another it took me scarcely half an hour especially among poor victuals to have all the women watching for every word i was prepared to drop although this never fails to happen yet it always pleases me and to find it in parson chownes kitchen go thus and the stony woman herself compelled to be bitten by mustard for fear of smiling and two or three maids quite unfit to get on without warm pats on their shoulderblades and the dogs quite aware that men were laughing and that this meant luck for them if they put up their noses it was not for me to think much of myself and yet how could i help doing it in the midst of this truly social joy and natural commune over victuals and easing of thought to suit one another in the courtesies of digestion and just as the slowest amongst us began to enter into some knowledge of me in walked that great parson rambone with his hands behind his back and between them a stout huntingcrop the maidens seemed to be taken aback but the men were not much afraid of him what a rare royster you are making out by the kennel i heard you however can i write my sermons does your reverence write them in the kennel thus the chief huntsman made inquiry having a certain privilege clear out clear out said rambone fetching his whip toward all of us i am left in authority here and i must have proper discipline mrs steelyard i am surprised at you girls you must never go on like this what will his reverence say to me come along with me thou villain welshman and give me a light for my pipe if you please it was a sad thing to behold a man of this noble nature having gifts of everything whether of body or heart or soul only wanting gift of mind and for want of that alone making wreck of all the rest i let him lead me while i felt how i longed to have the lead of him but that was in stronger hands than mine come and ill show thee a strange sight taffy he said to me very pleasantly as soon as his pipe was kindled only i must have my horse to inspire them with respect for me as well as to keep my distance where is thy charger thou valiant taffy i answered his reverence that i would rather travel afoot if it were not too far neither could he persuade me after the experience of that morning to hoist my flag on an unknown horse the command of which he offered me so forth we set the parson on horseback and in very high spirits trolling songs leaping hedges frolicking enough to frighten one and i on foot rather stiff and weary and needing a glass of grog without any visible chance of getting it here you despondent taffy take this and brighten up a bit it is true you are going to the gallows but theres no room for you there just now i saw what he meant as he handed me his silver huntingflask for they have a fashion about there of hanging bad people at cross ways and leaving them there for the good of others and to encourage honesty and truly the place was chosen well for in the hollow not far below it might be found those savage folk of whom i said something a good while ago and i did not say then what i might have said because i felt scandalised and unwilling to press any question of doubtful doings upon thoroughly accomplished people but now i am bound like a hospital surgeon to display the whole of it take hold of the tail of my horse old taffy said his reverence to me and i will see you clear of them have no fear for they all know me by this time we were surrounded with fifteen or twenty strangelooking creatures enough to frighten anybody many fine savages have i seenon the shores of the land of fire for instance or on the coast of guinea or of the gulf of panama and in fifty other placesyet none did i ever come across so outrageous as these were they danced and capered and caught up stones and made pretence to throw at us and then with horrible grimaces showed their teeth and jeered at us scarcely any of the men had more than a piece of old sack upon him and as for the women the less i say the more you will believe it my respect for respectable women is such that i scarcely dare to irritate them by not saying what these other women were as concerns appearance and yet i will confine myself as if of the female gender to a gentle hint that these women might have looked much nicer if only they had clothes on but the poor little piccaninies as the niggers call them these poor little devils were far worse off than any hatch of negroes or maroons or coppercolours anywhere in the breedinggrounds not so much from any want of tendance or clean management which none of the others ever got but from difference of climate and the moisture of their native soil these little creatures all stark naked seemed to be well enough off for food of some sort or another but to be very badly off for want of washing and covering up and their little legs seemed to be growing crooked the meaning of which was beyond me then until i was told that it took its rise from the way they were forced to crook them in to lay hold of one anothers legs for the sake of natural warmth and comfort as the wintertime came on when they slept in the straw all together i believe this was so but i never saw it the reverend john rambone took no other notice of these people than to be amused with them he knew some two or three of the men and spoke of them by their nicknames such as browny or horsehair or sandy boy and the little children came crawling on their bellies to him this seemed to be their natural manner of going at an early age and only one of all the very little children walked upright this one came to the parsons horse and being still of a tottery order laid hold of a foreleg to fetch up his own and having such moorage looked up at the horse the horse for his part looked down upon him bending his neck as if highly pleased yet with his nostrils desiring to snort and the whole of his springy leg quivering but trying to keep quiet lest the baby might be injured this made me look at the child again whose little foolish life was hanging upon the behaviour of a horse the rider perceived that he could do nothing in spite of all his great strength and skill to prevent the horse from dashing out the babys brains with his forehoof if only he should rear or fret and so he only soothed him but i being up to all these things and full for ever of presence of mind slipped in under the hold of the horse as quietly as possible and in a manner which others might call at the same time daring and dexterous i fetched the poor little fellow out of his dangerous position well done taffy said parson jack i should never have thought you had sense enough for it you had a narrow shave my man for the horse being frightened by so much nakedness made a most sudden spring over my body before i could rise with the child in my arms and one of his afterhoofs knocked my hat off so that i felt truly thankful not to have had a worse business of it but i would not let any one laugh at my fright a miss is as good as a mile your reverence many a cannonball has passed me nearer than your horses hoof tush a mere trifle will your reverence give this poor little man a ride and with that i offered him the child upon his saddlebow naked and unwashed and kicking keep off or you shall taste my horsewhip keep away with your dirty bratand yetoh poor little devil if i only had a cloth with me for this parson was of tender nature although so wild and reckless and in his light way he was moved at the wretched plight of this small creature and the signs of heavy stripes upon him not all over him as the parson said being prone to exaggerate but only extending over his back and his hams and other convenient places and perhaps my jacket made them smart for he roared every time i lifted him and every time i set him down he stared with a wistful kind of wonder at our clothes and at the noble horse as if he were trying to remember something where can they have picked up this poor little beggar said parson jack more to himself than to me he looks of a different breed altogether i wonder if this is one of stoyles damned tricks and all the way back he spoke never a word but seemed to be worrying with himself but i having set the child down on his feet and dusted my clothes and cleaned myself followed the poor little creatures toddle and examined him carefully the rest of the children seemed to hate him and he to shrink out of their way almost and yet he was the only fine and handsome child among them for in spite of all the dirt upon it his face was honest and fair and open with large soft eyes of a dainty blue and short thick curls of yellow hair that wanted combing sadly and though he had rolled in muddy places as little wild children always do for the sake of keeping the cold out his skin was white where the mud had peeled and his form lacked nothing but washing chapter xxxiii in a state of nature now all these things contributed coming as they did so rapidly to arouse inside me a burning and almost desperate curiosity it was in vain that i said to myself these are no concerns of mine let them manage their own affairs the less i meddle the better for me i seem to be in a barbarous land and i must expect things barbarous and after all what does it come to compared with the great things i have seen ay and played my part in to reason thus and regard it thus and seek only to be quit of it was a proof of the highest wisdom any man could manifest if he could only stick to it and this i perceived and thus i felt and praised myself for enforcing it so until it became not only safe but a bounden duty to reward my conscience by a little talk or so hence i lounged into the stableyardfor that terrible chowne was not yet come back neither were maids to be got at for talking only that stony steelyardand there i found three or four shirtsleeved fellows hissing at horses and rubbing away to put their sleeping polish on them before the master should return also three or four more were labouring in the stalls very briskly one at a sort of holystoning making patterns with brick and sand and the others setting up the hammocks for the nags to lie in with a lashing of twisted straw aft of their afterheels and taffrails as the wake of a ship might be and all of it done most shipshape this amused me mightily for i never had seen such a thing before even among wild horses who have power to manage their own concerns but to see them all go in so snugly and with such a sweet clean savour each to his own oats or mashings with the golden straw at foot made me think and forced me to it of those wretched white barbarians white at least just here and there whom good parson jackas one might almost try to call himhad led me to visit that same afternoon perceiving how the wind sate i even held back and smoked a pipe exactly as if i were overseer and understood the whole of it yet did not mean to make rash reproach this had a fine effect upon them especially as i chewed a straw by no means so as to stop my pipe but to exhibit mastery and when i put my leg over a rail as if i found it difficult to keep myself from horseback the headman came to me straightforward and asked me when i had hunted last i told him that i was always hunting weekdays and sundays and all the year round because it was our fashion and that we hunted creatures such as he never had the luck to set eyes on and when i had told him a few more things such as flow from experience when mixed with imagination a duller man than myself might see that he longed for me to sup with him and he spoke of things that made me ready such as tripe and onions however this would never do i felt myself strongly under orders and but for this paramount sense of duty never could i have done the things modestly mentioned as of yore and those of hereafter tenfold as fine such as no modesty dare suppress so when i had explained to him exactly how i stood about it he did not refuse to fill his pipe with a bit of my choice tobacco and to come away from all idle folk to a place in the shelter of a rick where he was sure to hear the hoofs of his masters horse returning i sate with him thus and we got on well and as he was going to marry soon the daughter of a publican who had as good as fifty pounds and nothing that could be set on fire and lived fifty miles away almost he did not mind telling me all the truth because he saw that i could keep it and at his age he could not enter into the spirit of being kicked so i told him i should like to see a man kick me but he said that i might come to it this was a very superior man and i durst not contradict him and having arranged so to settle in life how could he hope to tell any more lies for i have always found all men grow pugnaciously truthful so to put it for a month almost before wedlock while the women are doing the opposite however not to go far into that what he told me was much as follows parson chowne in early life before his mind was put into shape for anything but to please itself had been dreadfully vexed and thwarted every matter had gone amiss directly he was concerned in it his guardians had cheated him so had his stepmother so had his favourite uncle and of course so had his lawyers done in the thick of that bitterness what did his sweetheart do but throw him over she took a great scare of his strange black eyes when she found that his money was doubtful this was instinct no doubt on her part and may have been a great saving for her but to him it was terrible loss his faith was already astray a little but a dear wife might have brought it back or at any rate made him think so and he was not of the nature which gropes after the bottom of everything like a twisting augur having a prospect of good estates he was sent to london to learn the law after finishing at oxford not that he might practise it but to introduce a new element to the county magistrates when he should mount the bench among them here he got rogued as was only natural and a great part of his land fell from him and therefore he took to the clerical line and being of a stern and decided nature he married three wives one after the other and thus got a good deal of property it was said of course as it always is of any man thrice a widower that he or his manner had killed his wives a charge which should never be made without strong evidence in support of it at any rate there had been no children and different opinions were entertained whether this were the cause or effect of the parsons dislike and contempt of little ones moreover as women usually are of a tougher staple than men can be chownes successive liberation from three wives had added greatly to his fame for witchcraft such as first accrued from his commanding style nocturnal habits method of quenching other people and collection of pots and kettles the headgroom told me with a knowing wink that in his opinion the parson was now looking after wife no for he never had known him come out so smart with silver heels and crested headpiece and even the mark of the saddle must not show upon his breeches this was a sure sign he thought that there was a young lady in the wind possessing both money and good looks such as chowne was entitled to and always had insisted on upon that point i could have thrown some light if prudence had permitted it or at least i had some shrewd suspicions after what happened beside the river however i said nothing but i asked him what in his opinion first had soured the young man chowne against the whole of the world so sadly as he seemed to retain it now and he answered me that he could not tell inasmuch as the cause which he had heard given seemed to him to be most unlikely according to all that he saw of the man nevertheless i bade him tell it being an older man than he was and therefore more able to enter into what young folk call inconsistencies and so he told me that it was this chowne while still a young boy had loved with all the force of his heart a boy a few years younger than himself a cousin of his own but not with prospects such as he had and this boy had been killed at school and the matter hushed up comfortably among all high authorities but stoyle chowne had made a vow to discover and hunt it out to the uttermost and sooner or later to have revenge but when his own wrongs fell upon him doubtless he had forgotten it i said that i did not believe he had done so or ever would to the uttermost then i asked about parson jack and heard pretty much what i expected that he was a wellmeaning man enough although without much sense of right or wrong until his evil star led him into parson chownes society but still he had instincts now and then such as a horse has of the right road and an old woman of his church declared that he did feel his own sermons and if let alone and listened to might come to act up to them i asked whether parson chowne might do the like but was told that he never preached any we were talking thus and i had quite agreed to his desire of my company for suppertime when the sound of a horse upon stony ground tearing along at a dangerous speed quite broke up our conference the groom at the sound of it damped out his pipe and signified to me to do the same i have fired amany of his enemies ricks he whispered in his haste and fright but if he were to smell me asmoking near to a rick of his own good lord and he pointed to a hayrope as if he saw his halter and though he had boasted of speedy marriage and caring no fig for parson chowne he set off for the stables at a pace likely to prove injurious to his credit for consistency on the other hand i in a leisurely manner picked myself up from the attitude natural to me when listening kindly and calmly asserting my right to smoke approached the track by which i knew that the rider must come into the yard for all the dogs had no fear of me now by virtue of the whistle which i bore and before i had been there half a minute the parson dashed up with his horse all smoking and himself in a heavy blackness of temper such as i somehow expected of him no jack here not a jack to be seen have the kindness to look for my stablewhip ho llewellyn is it yes your reverence david llewellyn once of his majestys royal navy and now of no more of that you have played me false i expected it from a rogue like you restore me that trustguinea this so largely differed from what even anthony stew would dare to say in conversation with me much less at times of evidence that i lifted up my heart to heaven as two or three preachers had ordered me and even our parson had backed it up with lineage at least as good and perhaps much better than parson chownes by right of welsh blood under it the whole of this overcame me so that i could only say what guinea sir what guinea indeed you would rob me would you dont you know better than that my man come to me in two hours time stop give me that dogs whistle taking that heed of me and no more he cast the reins to my friend the headgroom who came up looking for all the world as if never had he seen me and wondered strangely who i could be and this air of fright and denial always pervaded the whole household all of which was quite against what i had been long accustomed to wherever i deigned to go in with my news to the servants place or the housekeepers room or anywhere pointed out to me as the best for entertainment here however although the servants seemed to be plentiful enough and the horses and the hounds to have as much as they could eat there was not a trace of what i may call good domestic comfort when this prevails as it ought to do in every gentlemans household the marks may be discovered in the eyes and the mouth of everybody nobody thinks of giving way to injudicious hurry when bells ring or when shouts are heard or horses feet at the front door and if on the part of the carpeted rooms any disquietude is shown or desire to play or feed or ride at times outside the convenience of the excellent company downstairs there is nothing more to be said except that it cannot be done and should never in common reason have been thought of for all servants must enjoy their meals and must have time to digest them with proper ease for conversation and expansion afterwards at candleston court it was always so and so it should be everywhere however to return to my groom whose cordiality revived at the moment his master turned the corner perceiving that chowne had some matter on hand which would not allow him to visit the stables just for the present at any rate he turned the black mare over to the care of an understrapper and with a wink and a smack of his lips gave me to know that his supper was toward neither were we disappointed but found it all going on very sweetly in a little private room used for cleaning harness and he told me that this young cook maid of unusual abilities had attached herself to him very strongly with an eye to promotion and having no scent of his higher engagement neither would he have been unwilling to carry out her wishes if she could only have shown a sixpence against the innkeepers daughters shilling i told him that he was too romantic and he said with a sigh that he could not help it but all would come right in the end no doubt this honest affection impressed me not a little in his favour and in less than half an hour i found him a thoroughly worthy fellow while he perceived through a squarestalked rummer that my character was congenial i told him therefore some foreign stories many of which were exceedingly true and he by this time was ready to answer almost anything that i chose to ask even though he knew nothing about it as for the people that wore no clothes but lived all together in the old mudhouse there need be and could be no mystery every one knew that his reverence had picked them up in his early days and been pleased with their simple appearance and dislike of cultivation perceiving even then how glad he might be in afterlife to annoy his neighbours what did he do but bring these people then six in number and all of them wives and husbands to one another and persuade them to dig themselves out a house and by deed of gift establish them on forty acres of their own land so that as englishmen love to say their house was now their castle not that these were perhaps english folk but rather of a gipsy cross capable however of becoming white if a muscular man should scrub them the groom said that nobody durst go near them except parson chowne and parson jack and that they seemed to get worse and worse as they began to be persecuted by clotheswearing people i asked him what their manners were and he said he believed they were good enough so long as not interfered with and who could blame them for maintaining that whether they wore clothes or not was entirely their own concern also that if outer strangers intruded from motives of low curiosity upon their unclad premises it was only fair to point out to them the disadvantages of costume by making it very hard to wash there was some sense in this because the main anxiety of mankind is to convert one another and the pelting of mud is usually the beginning of such overtures and these fine fellows having recurred as parson chowne said to a natural state their very first desire would be to redeem all fellowcreatures from the evils of civilisation whereof the foremost perhaps is clothes and the time we take in dressinga twelfth part of their waking life with even the wisest women and with the unwise virgins often not less than threequarters and with many men not much betterbut to come back to my savages i asked this good groom how it came to pass that none of the sheriffs or deputies or even magistrates of the shire put down this ungoodly company he said that they had tried but failed according to the laws of england on the best authority because these men of the ancient adam went back to the time before the beasts had come to adam to get their names they brought up their children without a name and now all names were dying out and they agreed much better in consequence and how could any writ warrant or summons run against people without a name it had once been tried with a nesho kiss the meaning of which was beyond me but parson chowne upset that at once and the bailiff was fit to make bricks of at this i shook my head and smiled because we put up with many evils on our side of the water but never with people so unbecoming in their manner of life and clothes and i thought how even mild colonel lougher would have behaved upon such a point and how sharp anthony stew would have stamped when they began to pelt him and how i wished him there to try it nevertheless i desired to know what victuals these good barbarians had because although like the indian jogis mentioned by some great traveller they might prove their right to go without clothes which never were born upon them they could not to my mind prove their power to do so well without victuals he answered that this was a clever thing on my part to inquire about but that i was so far wrong that these people would eat anything his reverence sent them every week the refuse of his garden as well as of stableyard and kennel and they had a gift of finding food in everything around them their favourite dishso to say when they had never a dish among themwas what they discovered in the pastureland and this they divided carefully accounting it the depth of shame and the surest mark of civilisation to cheat one another but they could not expect to get this every day in a neighbourhood of moorland therefore instead of grumbling they did their best to get on without it and providence always sends thousands of victuals for all whose stomachs have not been ruined by thinking too much about them or very likely through the women beginning to make them delicate so when a man is seasick he thinks of and hates almost everything on the other hand these noble fellows hated nothing that could be chewed twentyone sorts of toadstool with the insects which inhabit them three varieties of eft and of frogs no less than seven also slugs six inches long too large to have a house built moles that live in lines of decks like a manofwarsman also rats and brindled hedgehogs and the grubs of hornets which far surpass all oystersthese and other little things like goatmoths leopards and moneygrubs kept them so alive as never to come down on the parish neither was there any henroost rickyard appleroom or dairy on the farms around them but in it they found nourishment into all this i could enter while the groom only showed the door of it but while we were talking thus i heard the stableclock strike eight which brought hezekiah to my mind and my own churchclock at newton it struck in such a manner that i saw the door of my own cottage also bunny in bed with her nostrils ready to twitch for snoring and mother jones with a candle stooping to ease her by means of a drop of hot grease and inside by the wall lay bardie sleeping as she always slept with a smile of highborn quietude and what would all three say to me if ever i got back again thanking this excellent groom for all his hospitality to me and promising at his desire to keep it from his master i took my way as pointed out to the room where his reverence might be found i feared that his temper would be black unless he had dined as i had supped and taken a good glass afterwards and i could not believe what the groom had told me concerning one particular there is a most utterly pestilent race arising and growing up around us whose object is to destroy old england by forbidding a man to drink st paul speaks against them and all the great prophets and the very first thing that was done by our lord after answering them in the temple was to put them to shame with a great many firkins also one of the foremost parables is concerning bottles as especially honest things while bushels are to the contrary and the tendency of all scripture is suchwhichever testament you takethat no man in his wits can doubt it and though i never read the koran and only have heard some verses of it i know enough to say positively that mahomet began this movement to establish antichrist however my groom said that parson chowne though not such a fool as to stop other people scarcely ever took a drop himself and his main delight was to make low beasts of the clergy who had no selfcommand and two or three years ago he had played a trick on his brother parsons such as no man would ever have tried who took his own glass in moderation and enjoyed it heartily as scripture even commands us to do to promote goodfellowship and discretion having a power of visitation from some faculty he enjoyed he sent all round to demand their presence at a certain time for dinner all the parsons were glad enough especially as their wives could not in good manners be invited because there was now no mrs chowne and they saw a rare chance to tell good stories and get on without the little snaps which are apt to occur among ladies therefore they all appeared in strength having represented it as a high duty whatever their better halves might think when a parson says this his wife must knock under or never go to church again being there they were treated well and had the good dinner they all deserved and found their host very different from what they had been led to expect of him he gave them as much wine as they needed and a very good wine too he let them tell their stories though his own taste was quite different and he even humoured them so as to laugh the while he was despising them and though he could not bear tobacco that and pipes were brought in for them all went smoothly until one of them edged on by the others called for spirits and hot water this master chowne had prepared for of course and meant to present the things in good time but now being gored thus in his own house the devil entered into him his dark face grew of a leaden colour while he begged their pardon then out he went to mother steelyard and told her exactly what to do two great jacks of brown brandy came in and were placed upon the table and two silver kettles upon the hobs he begged all his guests to help themselves showing the lemons and sugarcaddy the bottles and kettles and everything and then he left them to their own devices while he talked with parson jack who had dropped in suddenly now what shall i tell you came to passas a very great traveller always sayswhy only that these parsons grew more drunk than despair or even hope because in the silver kettles was not water but whisky at boilingpoint and the more they desired to weaken their brandy the more they fortified it until they tumbled out altogether in every state of disorder for this he had prepared by placing at the foot of his long steps halfadozen butts of liquid from the cleaning of his drains meant to be spread on the fields next day and into the whole of this they fell and he bolted the doors upon them this made a stir in the clerical circles when it came to be talked about but upon reference to the bishop he thought they had better say nothing about it only be more considerate and on the whole it redounded greatly to the credit of parson chowne chapter xxxiv waiting and learning what this great man now said to me had better not be set down perhaps because it proved him incapable of forming due estimate of my character enough that he caused me some alarm and considerable annoyance by his supercilious vein and assumption of evil motives whereas you could not find anywhere purer or loftier reasons and i might say more poetical ones than those which had led me to abstain from speaking of the fair young lady however as this chowne had learned all about her from some skulking landsman whom he maintained as a spy at the back of the premises it was certain that i could in no way harm her by earning a trifle of money in front in a thoroughly open and disciplined way and it might even lie in my power thereby to defeat the devices of enemies and rescue this beautiful young female from any one who would dare to think of presuming to injure her i found my breast and heart aglow with all the fine feeling of younger days the moment the above occurred to me and it would not have cost me two blows to knock down any man who misunderstood me however his reverence did not afford me any chance for this exercise but seemed to allow me the benefit which such ideas afford a man and promised to give me three halfcrowns instead of five shillings a week as before he allowed me a hayloft to sleep in that night after taking good care that i had not even a flint to strike a light with for cordially as he did enjoy the firing of an enemys barns or stacks his reverence never could bear the idea of so much as a spark coming near his own and the following morning i saddled my horse with a good chain undergirding and taking turn and turn about got home to the rose of devon and here i found very unjust work fuzzy gone and ike not to be found and the ketch laid up for the winter only bang the boy was left and the purpose of his remaining was to bear me a wicked message namely that i had been so much away both in the boat and on horseback that the captain would not be bound to me except to get home again how i might and if this could not be brought about and i chose to take care of the ketch for the winter two shillings aweek was what i might draw also the wood on the wharf so long as it would last for firing and any fish i could catch with lines and any birds i could shoot on the river with a stone of rockpowder that was in the hold bang was ashamed to deliver this message and i cannot describe to you my wrath as slowly i wrung it out of him his head went into his neck almost for fear of my taking it by the handles which nature had provided in his two ears and letting him learn as done once before that the mast had harder knots in it but i always scorn injustice and bang was not to be blamed for this so i treated him kindly as i might wish a boy of my own to be treated by a man of large experience and i let him go home to his mothers house which was said to be somewhere within a league and then i went to see what manners had been shown in the picklingtub here i found precious little indeed and only the bottom stuff of coxcombs tails and nails and overharpings thready bits and tapeworm stuff such as we pray deliverance from unless it comes to famine nevertheless in my now condition i grieved that there was not more of it because how could i get across to my native land again all the small coastingcraft were laid up as if they were china for shelfing immediately after that gale of wind which but for me must have capsized us these fellows up the rivers never get a breath of seamanship sudden squalls are all they think of sea room and the power of it they would be afraid of at one time i thought of walking home because none of these traders would venture it and if i had only a guinea to start with on the road to bristol nothing could have stopped me for say what i might to myself about it and reason however carefully i could not reconcile with my conscience these things that detained me the more i considered only three halfcrowns and the mere chance of wildducks on the river the less i perceived how my duty lay and the more it appeared to be movable and why was i bound to stop here like this when their place was to take me home again according to stipulation to apply to the mayor as i knew was useless especially now that i owed him a bill as for the bench of magistrates one had already a bias against me because i went into a wood one night to watch an eclipse of the moon and took my telescope which they all swore was a gun being disappointed with the moons proceedings i slammed up my telescope hastily and at the same time puffed my pipe and there was a fellow on watch so vile as to swear to the sound and the smoke of a gun and this fellow proved to be a welshman of the name of llewellyn and a cousin of mine within seven generations i acquit him of knowing this fact at the time and when in crossexamination i let him know it and nobody else he came back to his duty and swore white all the black he had sworn before nevertheless i did not like it though acquitted amidst universal applause on account of the notoriety and finding him one night upon the barge walk and his manners irritating i was enabled to impress him with a sense of consanguinity and after that i might bear my telescope and take observations throughout the coverts whenever the pheasants did not disturb me this privilege and a flight of wildducks followed by a team of geese and rumours even of two wild swans moderated my desire to be back at home again there no man can get a shot except in very bitter weather or when the golden plovers come in unless he likes to take on himself a strong defiance of public opinion because colonel lougher is so kind and so forbears to prosecute that to shoot his game is no game at all and shames almost any man afterwards and the glory of all that nightwork is the sense of wronging somebody moreover a little thing occurred which in my doubt of conclusion led me to stay a bit longer some people may think nothing of it but a kind touch takes a hold on me i have spoken of a boy by the name of bang possessing many good qualities yet calling for education of this i had given him some little administered not to his head alone but to more influential quarters and the result was a crop of gratitude watered by humility when he went home for the winter months i expected to hear no more of him having been served in that manner often by boys whom i have corrected therefore all who have ever observed the want of thankfulness in the young will enter into my feelings when an ancient woman bangs grandmother hailed me in a shaky voice over the side of my ketch with bang in the distance watching her between her feet was a good large basket which with my usual fine feeling i leaped out to ease her of but on no account would she let me touch it until she knew more about me be you the man she said madam i answered i be the man the man as goes on so wicked to bang for the sake of his soul hereafter yes madam i am he who clothed in the wholesome garb of severity a deep and parental affection for now i smelled something uncommonly good be you the chap as wolloped him that i can proudly say i am look e see here this be for e then with no common selfapproval i observed what she turned out although i longed much to unpack them myself for fear of her spoiling anything but she put me back in a wholesale manner and spread it all out like a marketstand and really it was almost enough to make a market of for she was a very wiry old woman and bang had helped carry as far as the wharf when he saw me and fled especially did i admire a goose fat with golden fat upon him trussed and laid on stuffingherbs also a little pig for roasting too young to object to it yet with his character formed enough to make his brains delicious and as for sausagesbut no more the goodness of these things preserved me from going off on the tramp just yet that is the last thing a sailor should do though gifted with an irontipped wooden leg the government drove me into it once when my wound allowed me to be discharged but it took more out of my selfrespect than ever i have recovered and if i do anything under the mark which to my knowledge i never do it dates from the time the king drove me to alms however i never do dwell upon that unless there is something wrong down in my hold and when that is right i am thankful again and none of that ever befalls me when i get my rations regular but who cares to hear any more about me with all these great things coming on you may look on me now as nobody because i fell so much beneath my own idea of myself and all that others said of me through my nasty want of strength when parson chowne came over me it is easy enough to understand that a man in goodnature may knock under to another man of goodnature also all in friendship and in fun and for the benefit of the world but for a man of intellect not so very far under the averageas will now be admitted of me in spite of all inborn diffidenceas well as a man of a character formed and framed by experience now to be boarded and violently driven under hatches without any power to strike a blow by a man who was never on board of a shipat any rate to my knowledge to think of this and yet not help it made me chafe like a fellow in irons there was one thing however that helped to make me put up with my present position a little and that was my hope to be truly of service to my genuine benefactor poor sir philip bampfylde this old gentleman clearly was not going on very comfortably and parson chowne had given me to understand without any words that the great chest landed at the end of his house was full of arms and all other treason these were to be smuggled in after the captains departure and the captain would not enter the house through fear of the servants suspecting something i could not reconcile this account with what i had seen the young lady do and the captains mode of receiving it but as i would not tell the parson a word about that young lady i could not make that objection to him nor did i say though i might have done so that i would not and could not believe for a moment that any british naval captain would employ his ship and crew for a purpose of high treason to his lawful master that parson chowne should dare to think that i would swallow such stuff as that made me angry with myself for not having contradicted him but all this time i was very wise and had no call to reproach myself seldom need any man repent for not having said more than he did and never so needeth a welshman and now though i still took observation of narnton court as in honour bound to deserve my salary and though the parson still rode down and went the round of the deck at times when nobody could expect him yet it was not in my nature to be kept from asking something as to all these people you may frighten a man and scare his wits and keep him under and trample on him and even beat his feelers down and shut him up like a jellyfish but after all this if he is a man he will want to know the reason for this makes half of the difference between man and the lower animalsthe latter when punished accept it as a thing that must befall them and so do the negroes and all proper women but a man always wants to know why it must be though it greatly increases his trouble to ask and still more to tell it again if you please sir philip bampfylde as every one said was a very nice gentleman indeed the head of an ancient family and the owner of a large estate kind moreover and affable though perhaps a little stately from having long held high command and important rank in the army some years ago he had attained even to the rank of general which is the same thing among landforces as an admiral is with us and he was so proud of this position that he always wished to be so addressed rather than by the title which had been so long in the family for his argument was that he had to thank good fortune for being a baronet whereas good conduct and perseverance alone could have made him a general now if these had made him an admiral i would always entitle him so as it is i shall call him sir philip or general just as may happen to come to my mind now this gentleman had two sons and no other children the elder was philip bampfylde esquire and the younger captain drake bampfylde of whom i have spoken already philip the heir had been appointed to manage the family property which spread for miles and miles away and this gave him quite enough to do because his father for years and years was away on foreign service and during this time squire philip married a lady of great beauty sent home by his father from foreign parts after rescue from captivity she was of very good extraction so far as foreigners can be and a princess they said in her own right though without much chance of getting it and she spoke the prettiest broken english being very sensitive well everything thus far went purely enough and the lady had brought him a pair of twins and was giving good promise of going on and everybody was pleased with her and most of all her husband and sir philip was come home from governorship but only on leave of absence and they were trying hard to persuade him now to retire and live in peace when who should come with his evil luck to spoil everything but drake bampfylde how it came to pass was not clearly known at least to the folk on our side of the river or those whom i met in barnstaple and i durst not ask on the further side that is to say around narnton court because the parsons spies were there only the old women felt pretty sure that they had heard say though it might be wrong that captain drake bampfylde had drowned the children some said by accident some said on purpose and buried them somewhere on braunton burrows and the effect of this on the foreign lady being as she was poor thing might have been foreseen almost for she fell into untimely pains and neither herself nor her babe survived exactly as happened to my sons wife this was a very sad story i thought but they said that the worst of it still lay behind for poor squire philip had been so upset by the hurry of all these misfortunes that nobody knew what to do with him he always had been a most warmhearted man foolishly fond of his wife and children and of a soft and retiring nature moreover he looked on his younger brother who had seen so much more of the world than himself and was of a bolder character not with an elder sons usual carelessness but with a thorough admiration and when he found him behave in this manner according at least to what every one said and all for the sake of the property without a sharp word between them it went to his heart in the thick of his losses so that he was beside himself he let his beard grow and his hair turn white although he was not yet forty and he put up the shutters of his room and kept candles around him and little dolls he refused to see his brother drake and his father sir philip and everybody except his own attendant and the nurse of his poor children and finding this the captain left the house as if cursed out of it the only one who took things bravely was the ancient general much as he grieved at the loss of his race and extinction perhaps of the family he swore that he never would be cast down or doubt the honour of his favourite son until that son confessed it this drake bampfylde had never done although the case was hard against him and scarcely any one except his father now stood up for him but of the few who still held him guiltless was one especial comforter isabel carey to wit a young lady of very good devonshire family left as a ward to sir philip bampfylde and waiting for three or four years more of age to come into large estates in south devon the general people did not know this but i happened to get ahead of them and having a knack in my quiet way of putting two and two together also having seen the captain and shaped my opinions i would have staked my boat against a cuttlefish that he was quite innocent if the children were found buriedalthough i could never quite get at this but only a story of a man who had seen him doing it as i shall tell hereafterbut even supposing them deep in the sand which i was a little inclined to do from trusting my spyglass so thoroughly yet there might have been other people quite as likely to put them there as that unlucky captain drake it has been my lot to sail under a great many various captains not only whom i have hinted at in the days when i was too young for work but whom i mean to describe hereafter in my far greater experiences really finding although i have tried to convince people to the contrary that what they have told me was perfectly true and that i come out far stronger and better whenever my reins are tried and proved and my loins as sound as a bell although hereditary from king david let that pass i find one fault and it is the only one to be found with me it is that the style of our bards will come out and spread me abroad in their lofty allusions to come back to these captains i never found one who would do such a thing as kill and slay two children much less dig their graves in the sand and come home to dinner afterwards and of all the captains i had seen drake bampfylde seemed as unfit as any to do a thing of that dirtiness however as i have not too much trust in human nature after the way it has used me and worst of all when in the government i said to myself that it was important to know at what time this captain bampfylde won the love of that fine miss carey because after that he had no temptation to put the little ones out of the way and i quite settled it in my own mind that if they had set up their horses together before the young children went out of the world captain drake bampfylde was not likely to have made them go so for that fair maidens estates i was told would feed four hundred people no one had seen this exactly as i did nor could i beat it into them and i found from one or two symptoms that it was high time for me to leave off talking parson chowne came down one night as black as a tarred thunderbolt and though he said nothing to let me know i felt afraid of his meaning also parson jack rode down in his headlong careless way and filled his pipe from my tobaccobag and gave me a wink and said keep your mouth shut it was always a pleasure to me to behold him whatever his principles may have been and if i could have said a word to stop him from his downward road or to make it go less sudden goodness knows i would have done it at the risk of three halfcrowns aweek chapter xxxv the polite ferryman now for a man of my age and knowledge keeping an eye on his own concerns and under the eyes of a good many women eager to have him because confessed superior to the neighbourhood yet naturally doubtful how much money would be wanted for such a man to attend to things which could not concern him in any way without neglecting what now he had found a serious matter at his time of lifethis to my mind proves a breadth of sympathy rarely found outside of wales entering into these things largely and desiring to do my best having moreover nought else to do except among dabs and flounders i was led by a naturally active mind to try to turn a penny not for my own good so much as for the use of bunny therefore having the punt at command and a good pair of oars and a good pair of arms what did i do but set up a ferry such as had never been heard of before and never might have been dreamed of except for my intelligence because we had two miles to barnstaple bridge and no bridge at all to be found below us and a good many houses here and there on either side of the river and i saw that they must know one another and were longing to dine or to gossip together except for the water between them or the distance to walk all the way by the bridge so being left in this desolate state and shamefully treated by captain fuzzy and bangs grandmother now neglecting me at a period of sadness while smoking a pipe providence gave me this brilliant idea i never had dreamed for a moment of settling without something permanent and not even l ayear would tempt me to do any despite to my late dear wifes remembrance a year and a day at the very least was i resolved to mourn for her still as the time was drawing on i desired to have some prospect not to settle rashly as young people do in such affairs which really should be important but to begin to feel about and put the price against the weight and then take time to think about it only i had made up my mind not to look twice at the very richest and most beautiful methodist enough had i had for my life of them and the fellows that come after them church of england or church of rome for me this time at any rate with preference to the latter because having no chapel in our neighbourhood and i worked this ferry if you will believe me not for the sake of the twopence both ways half so much as because of my thoughts of the confidence that i must create i knew for i wont say forty years but at any rate good thirty what women are the very moment they must needs come into a boat the very shyest and wisest of them are at the mercy of a man right out and i never could help believing that they come for that very reason i know all their queerness of placing their toes and how they fetch their figures up and manage to hitch their petticoats and try to suppose they are quite on a balance and then go down plump on the nearest thwart and pretend that they did it on purpose nevertheless they are very good and we are bound to make the best of them when i told parson chowne of my ferryboat rather than let him find it out which of course must have happened immediately a quick gleam of wrath at my daring to do such a thing without consulting him moved in the depth of his great black eyes at least i believed so but was not sure for i never could bear to look straight at his eyes as i do to all other people especially anthony stew esquire i thought that my ferry would be forbidden but with his usual quickness he saw that it might serve his purpose in several ways because it would help to keep me there as well as account for my being there and afford me the best chance in the world of watching the river traffic so he changed his frown to an icy smile such as i never could smile at and said behold now what goodluck comes of my service only remember no fares to be taken when the tide serves for you know what and especially no gossiping this being settled to my content i took a great peace of loose tarpaulin out of the hold of the rose of devon and with a bucket of thick limewhiting explained to the public in printing letters each as large as a marlinspike who i was and of what vocation and how thoroughly trustworthy and let any one read it and then give opinion in common fairness whether any man capable of being considered a spy would ever have done such a thing as this david llewellyn mariner of the royal navy ferryman to king george the iiid each way or both ways only twopence ladies put carefully over the mud live fish on hand at an hours notice and of the choicest quality this last statement was not quite so accurate as i could have desired to oblige the public i kept the fish too long on hand occasionally because i never had proper notice when it might be wanted and therefore no reasonable person ever took offence at me one fine day towards the frosty time who should appear at my landingstage on the further side of the river just by the limekiln not far from the eastern end of narnton courtwho but a beautiful young lady with her maid attending her the tide was out and i was crossing with a good sixpennyworth that being all that my boat would hold unless it were of children and seeing her there i put on more speed so as not to keep her waiting when i had carried my young women over the mud and received their twopences i took off my hat to the fair young lady who had kept in the background and asked to what part i might have the honour of conveying her ladyship i am not a ladyship she answered with a beautiful bright smile i am only a common lady and i think you must be an irishman this i never am pleased to hear because those irish are so untruthful however i made her another fine bow and let her have her own way about it then mr irishman she continued you are so polite we will cross the water no no thank you as i offered to carry her you may carry nanette if she thinks proper nanette has the greatest objection to mud but i am not quite so particular and she tripped with her little feet over the bank too lightly to break the green cake of the ooze you sall elave me my good man said nanette who was rather a pretty french girl mamselle can afford to defigure her dress but i can no such thing do at all meanwhile the young lady was in the boat sitting in the sternsheets like a lieutenant and laughing merrily at nanette who was making the prettiest fuss in the world not indeed with regard to her legs which an english girl would have considered first but as to her frills and fripperies and smelling my quid she had no more sense than to call me a coachman or something like it however i took little heed of her although her figure was very good for i knew that she could not have sixpence and scarcely a hundred ayear would induce me to degrade myself down to a real french wife for how could i expect my son ever to be a sailor now as i pulled and this fine young lady who clearly knew something about a boat nodded her head to keep time with me and showed her white teeth as she smiled at herself my own head was almost turned i declare and i must have blushed if it could have been that twenty years of the fishtrade had left that power in me because this young lady was so exactly what my highest dreams of a female are and never yet realised in my own scope and her knowledge of a boat and courage and pleasant contempt of that french chit who had dared to call me a coachman when added to her way of looking over the water with fine feeling such as i very often have and must have shown it long ago also the whole of this combined with a hat of a very fine texture indeed such as i knew for italian and a feather that curled over golden pennon of hair in the wind like a spanish ensign and not only these things but a face and manner and genuine beauty of speech not to be found in a million of womenafter dwelling on all these things both steadily and soberly over my last drop of grog before i went into my berth that night and prayed for the sins of the day to go upward what do you think i said on the halfdeck and with all the stars observing meim damned if ill serve parson chowne any more i said it and i swore it and when i came to think of it in a practical manner next morning and to balance the ins and outs and what i might come to if thus led astray by a man in holy orders yet whose orders were all unholy at any rate such as he gave to me and when i reflected on three halfcrowns for finding me in everything and then remembered how i had turned two guineas in a day when poor bardie came to me and with a conscience as clear as a spent cuttlefish and never a sign of my heels behind me when squeamish customers sat down to dinner also good mother jones with sweet gossip while my bit of flesh was grilling and my little nip of rum and the sound of bunny snoring while i smoked a pipe and praised myself also the pleasure of doubting whether they could do without me at the jolly through the wall and the certain knowledge how the whole of the room would meet me if i could deny myself enough to go among themthese things made me lose myself as in this sentence i have done in longing to find old times and places and old faces once again and some one to call me old dyo now who would believe that the whole of all this was wrought in my not very foolish mind by the sight of a beautiful highbred face and the sound of a very sweet softening voice also the elegant manner in which she never asked what the passage would come to but gave me a bright and true halfcrown for herself and that frippery french girl i must be a fool no doubt i am when the spirit of ancestors springs within me spoiling all trade as an inborn hiccough ruins the best pipe that ever was filled for though i owed three tidy bills i had no comfort until i drilled a little hole in that bright halfcrown and hung it with my charms and knobs and caul inside my jersey and thus the result became permanent and my happiness was in my heart again and all my selfrespect leaped up as ready to fight as it ever had been when i had shaped a firm resolve to shake off chowne like the devil himself i cannot imagine a lower thing than for any man to sayand some were even to that degree basethat i thus resolved upon calculation and ability now to get on without him and balance of his three halfcrowns against the income of my ferry with which i admit that his work interfered neither would any but a very vile man dare to cast reflections upon me for having created by skill and eloquence a small snug trade in the way of fish and of those birds which are sent by the lord in a casual way and without any ownership for the good of us unestated folk while i deny as unequivocally as if upon oath before magistrates that more than fifty hares and pheasantsbut there i may go on for ever rebutting those endless charges and calumnies which the mere force of my innocent candour seems to strike out of maliciousness once for all i never poach i never stab salmon i never smuggle i never steal boats i never sell fish with any stink outside of itand how can i tell what it does inside or what it may do afterwards i never tell lies to anybody who does not downright call for it and you may go miles and miles i am sure to find a more thoroughly honourable goodhearted brave and agreeable man now i did not mean to say any of this when i began about it neither am i in the habit of deigning even to clear myself but once beginning with an explanation i found it the best to start clear again because parson chowne and my manner towards him which for the life of me i could not help also my service under him and visit at his house and so on and even my liking for parson jack after his sale to satan though managed without his privity as well as my being had up for shooting pheasants with a telescopethese and many other things too small now to dwell upon may have spread a cloud betwixt my poor self and my readers and a cloud whose belly is a gale of wind it is not that i ever could do any unworthy action it is simply that i can conceive the possibility of it seeming so to those who have never met me and who from my overcandid account purposely shaped dead against myself may be at a loss to enter into the delicacies of my conduct but you shall see byandby and seeing is believing now it was a lucky thing that on the very morning after i had made my mind up so and before it was altered much down came chowne in a tearing mood with his beautiful black mare all in a lather i was on board of the rose of devon smoking my first afterbreakfast pipe and counting my cash from the ferry business of the day beforeexcept of course the halfcrown which lay among my charms and strengthened me the ketch was aground in a cradle of sand which she had long ago scooped for herself and which she seldom got out of now except just to float at the top of the springs she stood almost on an even keel unless it were blowing heavily our punt or rather i should call her mine by this time for of course she most justly belonged to me after all their breach of contract and desertion of their coloursat any rate there she was afloat and ready for any passenger while my notice to the public flapped below the mainboom of the ketch you precious rascal cried chowne from the wharf with his horse staring at the tarpaulin and half inclined to shy from it who was it crossed the river twice in your rotten ferryboat yesterday please your reverence i answered calmly puffing at my pipe which i knew would still more infuriate him will your reverence give me time to think let me seewhy let me seethere was mother pugsley from up the hill and mother bidgood from round the corner and farmer skinner and young joe thorne and eliza tucker from the mill and jenny stribling and honor jose first cousin to our captain andwell i think thats nearly all that i know the name of your reverence i thought you knew me better now than to lie to me llewellyn you know what i mean as well as i do to be sure to be sure your reverence i beg your pardon altogether i ought to have remembered poor old nanny gotobed the wharf was high and our gunwale below it he put his mare at it clapped in the spurs and before i could think or even wonder he had me by the nape of the neck with his knuckles grinding into me and his face now ashy white with rage fixed on me so that i could not move will you tell me he cried i wont said i crack came his huntingwhip round my sidescrack and wish and crack again then i caught up a broken spar and struck him senseless over the tail of his horse the mare ramped all round the halfdeck mad then leaped ashore with her legs all bloody and scoured away with her saddle off chowne lay so long insensible that a cold sweat broke through the heat of my wrath to think that i had killed him and but for his hat i had done no less for i struck with the strength of a maddened man and the spar was of heavy dantzic i untied his neckcloth and ran for water and propped him up and bathed his forehead although my hands were trembling so that i could scarcely hold the swab and now as i watched his pale stern face without a weak line in it even from fainting i was amazed at having ever dared to lift hand against him but what royal navyman could ever put up with horsewhip at last he fetched a strong breath and opened the usual wickedness of his eyes and knew me at once but did not know exactly what had befallen him i have had a good deal to do with knocking down a good many men and know that such is their usual practice and that if you take them promptly then they will sometimes believe things very freely therefore i said your reverence has contrived to hit yourself very hard but i hope you will soon be better again hit myself why somebody hit me and then he went off again into a doze from the buzzing of his head perhaps perceiving that he would soon come to himself and desiring to be acquitted of any violent charge of battery i jumped down into the hold and fetched an old boom that was lying there and hoisted it up in the tacklefall so as to hang at about the right height moreover i put the spar well away and then with a sluice of water i fetched his reverence back to himself again i found him very correct this time and beginning to look about pretty briskly therefore i turned him away and said your reverence must not look at itit will make your head go round again either shut your eyes or look away your worship he seemed not to notice me so i went on your reverence has had a narrow escape what a mercy your head is not broken your reverence went to chastise me and lo your horse reared and threw your reverence against that great boom which that lubberly jose has left there ever since we broke cargo you are a liar he said you struck me to the last day of your life you shall rue it the voice of his throat ran cold all through me being so low and so cold itself and the strength of his eyes was coming back and the bitter disdain of his countenance the devil who wanted him for a rare morsel in the way of cannibalism stood at my elbow but luckily thought it sweeter not to hurry it the foulest man on all gods earth who made a scoff of mercys self lay at my mercy for a minute defied it took it and hated it for the sake of myself i let him go for the sake of mankind i should have slain him chapter xxxvi under fairer auspices knowing now what i had to expect from parson chowne and from all his train whether clothed or naked and even perhaps from parson jack who lay beneath his thumb so much and who could thrash me properly i seized the chance of a good high tide and gave a man sixpence to help me and warped the rose of devon to a berth where she could float and swing and nobody come anigh her without a boat or a swimmingbout because i knew from so many folk what a fiend i had to deal with and that his first resort for vengeance haply through his origin generally was to fire they told me that when he condescended to do duty in either churchfor two he had as i may have saidall the farmers took it for a call to have their ricks burned they durst not stay away from church to save the very lives of them nor could they leave their wives behind on account of the unclothed people all they could hope was that no offence had come from their premises since last service the service he held just as suited his mood sometimes three months and the churchdoor locked sometimes three sundays one after the other man woman and child demanded whenever this happened the congregation knew that the parish had displeased him and that he wanted them all in church while his boy was at the stackyards he never deigned to preach but made the prayers themselves a comedy singing them up to the clerks amen and the neigh of his mare from the vestry i cannot believe even half that i hear from the very best authority therefore i set nothing down which may be overcoloured but the following story i know to be true because seven people have told it to me and not any two very different two or three bishops and archdeacons or deacons of arches i know not which at any rate high freemasons desired to know some little more about a man in their jurisdiction eminent to that extent and equally notorious they meant no harm at all but just to take a little feel of him because he had come to visitation once or twice when summoned with his huntsman and his hounds and himself in leathern breeches there must have been something amiss in this or at any rate they thought so and his lordship a bishop just appointed made up his mind to tackle him he came in a coachandfour and wearing all his high canonicals and they managed somehow to get up the hill and appear at nympton rectory then a footman struck the door with a gold stick well embossed and he struck again and he struck again more in dudgeon every time because no man had yet been seen nor woman on the premises only dogs very wild and mad but kept away from biting strike again said his lordship nodding under his wig with some courtesy we must never be impatient jemmy strike again my lad jemmy struck a thundering stroke and out came mrs steelyard she looked at them all and then she said with her eyes full on the bishops are you robbers or are you savages my master in that state and you do this and they all saw that she could not weep by reason of too much sorrow it is the lord bishop said the footman keeping a little away from her excellent female began his lordship spreading his hands in a habit learned according to his duties tell your master that hisc jehoshaphat wishes to see him mr jehoshaphat she replied you are just in time and no more sir how we have longed for a minister you are just in time and no more sir will you have the kindness to come this way and to step as quietly as you can his lordship liked not the look of this being however a resolute man he followed the stony woman up the staircase and into a bedroom with the windowcurtains three quarters drawn and here he found a pastille burning and a lot of medicine bottles and a bible on the table open and on it a pair of spectacles in the bed lay some one with a face of fire heavily blotched with bungs of black and all his body tossing with spasms and weak groaning what means this asked his lordship drawing considerably nearer to the door only thed plague said the stony woman he was took with it yesterday doctor says he may last two hours more almost particular if he can get anybody to take the symptoms off him i expect to be down with it some time tonight because i feel the tingling but your highness will stop and help us i am damned if i will cried the bishop sinking both manners and dignity in the violence of alarm and he ran down the stairs at such a pace that his apron strings burst and he left it behind and he jumped into the coach with his two feet foremost and slammed up the windows and ordered full speed then parson chowne rose and threw off his mask and drew back the windowcurtain and sat in his huntingclothes and watched with his usual bitter smile the rapid departure of his foe and he had the bishops apron framed and hung it in the parsonage hall from a reddeers antlers with the name and date below and so of that bishop he heard no more now a man who had beaten three bishops and all the archdeacons in the country was of course tenfold of a match for me and when he rode down smoothly to me as he did in a few days time and never touched on our little skirmish except with a sort of playful hit so far as his haughty mind could play and riding another horse without a word about the mischief which his favourite mare had taken and demanded as a matter of justice that having quitted his service now i should pay back sevenandsixpence drawn in advance for wages i was obliged to touch my hat as if i had never made stroke at his or put my knee upon him he had flogged me to such purpose that i ever must admire him for the flick of the boatswains lash was a tickle compared to what chowne took out of me and if i must tell the whole truth i was prouder of having knocked down such a wonderful man than of all of my victories put together but one of my weak and unreasonable views of life is this that having thrashed a man i feel a great power of goodwill to him and a desire to give him quarter and the more so the less he cries for it but on the whole i was not so young after all that was said by everybody as to imagine for a moment that i had felt the last of him the very highest in the land had been compelled to yield to him as when he turned out my lord gs horses from the stabling ordered at lord gs inn would such a man accept defeat from a crazy old mariner like me feeling my danger and meaning never to knock under any more i refused as a matter of principle to restore so much as a halfpenny and if i understand law at all he was bound to give me another weeks wages in default of notice however i could not get it and therefore am glad to quit such trifles from all experience it was known that this man never hurried vengeance he knew that he was sure to get it and he liked to dwell upon it thus prolonging his enjoyment by the means of hope he loved as in the case of that unfortunate captain vellacott to persuade his enemies that he had forgiven or at least forgotten them and then to surprise them and laugh to himself at their ignorance of his nature so i felt pretty sure that i had some time till my life would be in danger for of course he knew that my ferry business growing in profit daily would keep me within his reach for the present over and above the difficulty of getting across the channel now however he began upon me sooner than i expected on account perhaps of my low degree but in the meanwhile feeling sure that i could not stand worse with him than i diddesiring moreover to ease my conscience and perhaps improve my income by an act of justicei crossed the river to narnton court and getting among the servants nicely sent word in to miss isabel carey that the old ferryman begged leave to see her upon business most particular for of course although in the hurry of things i may have forgotten to mention it the lovely young lady i ferried across and whose name i was thrashed so for not betraying was captain drakes sweetheart the ward of sir philip one of the most hateful things in chowne was that he never did anything in the good oldfashioned manner unless it were use of the horsewhip and it now rejoiced my heart almost to be shown into a fine dark room by the side of good long passages with a footman going before me and showing legs of a quite superior order and then under my instructions boldly throwing an oaken door wide and announcing mr david llewellyn maam for though i had left felix farley behind from a sort of romantic bashfulness i had seen in the hall a coloured gentleman who seemed justly popular therefore i had just dropped a hint not meant to go any further concerning my risk of life and fortitude for the sake of black men and this made the women admire me for it turned out that this worthy negro stood high in the house and had saved some cash the room which i entered was large and high with an amazing number of books in it and smelling exceeding learned and there in a deep window sat the young lady with the light from the river glancing on the bright elegance of her hair and when she rose and came towards me i felt uncommonly proud of having been even thrashed for her sake nor did i wonder at captain drakes warm manner of proceeding or at chownes resolve to keep so jealous a watch over her over and above her beauty which was no business of mine of course she had such pretty eyebrows and so sweet a way of looking that a thrill went to my experienced heart in spite of all experience and women seemed a different thing from what i was accustomed to therefore i left her to begin while i made bows and felt afraid of giving offence by gazing she however put me at my ease almost directly having such a highbred way so clarified and gentle that i neither could be distant nor familiar with her only to be quite at ease like respect and love her and this lady was only about seventeen it is wonderful how they learn so much i need not follow all i said or even what she said to me without for a moment sacrificing my true sense of dignity i gave her to understand very mildly that i had seen something and had taken a vague sense of its import when i chanced to be after wildducks also that strong attempts had been made to set me spying after her and that i might have yielded to them but for my own lofty sense of being a victorious veteran and the way in which i was conquered by her extraordinary beauty she seemed for a moment to doubt how far i should have touched that subject and if i had only looked up she would have rung the bell decidedly but i bowed and kept down my eyelashes which were grey now and helped me much in paying innocent compliments to every kind of woman even in the bar of very firstrate publichouses have i been pressed to take and not pay for glasses even of ancient stingo because of the way i have paid respects and looked through my shadows afterwards therefore this young lady said i hardly know what to do or say mr llewellyn it is a strange tale why should any one watch me that is more than i can say my lady i only know that the thing is done and by a very wicked man indeed and you have found it out as ferryman how clever of you to be sure and how honest to come and tell me you have been a royal sailor in the royal navy maam our captains are the most noble men so brave and glorious and handsome if you could only see one of them perhaps i have she said under her breath being carried away by my description as i hoped to do to her and then she came back through a shading of colours to herself and looked at me as if to say have you detected me now i touched my lock and by no means seemed to have dreamed a suspicion of anything you are a most worthy man she said and wonderfully straightforward none but a royal navy sailor could have behaved so nobly in spite of all the bribes offered you no no no i cried nothing to speak of nothing to speak of what is a guinea and a half aweek when it touches a mans integrity three guineas aweek you shall have at once because you have behaved so nobly and because you have fought for your country so and been left with nothing i think you said with half of your lungs quite shot away except twopence aday to live upon one and eightpence farthing aweek my lady and to be signed by a clergyman and twentyeight miles to walk for it it vexes mo so to hear such things dont tell me any more of it what is the use of having money except for the people who want it mr llewellyn you must try not to be offended i saw that there was something coming but looked very grave about it a man of my rank and mark must never be at all ready and much less eager to lay himself under any form of trifling obligation and thoroughly as she had won me over i tried very hard not to be offended while she was going to a small black desk if she had come thence with a guinea or two my mind was made up to do nothing more than gracefully wave it back again and show myself hurt at such ignorance of me but now when she came with a l note such as sir philip seemed to keep in stock my duty to bardie and bunny rose as upright as could be before my eyes and overpowered all selfish niceties i would not make a fuss about it lest i might hurt her feelings but placed it in my pocket with a bow of silent gratitude perhaps my face conveyed to her that it was not the money i cared for only to do what was just and right as any british sailor must when delicately handled also her confidence in me was so thoroughly sweet and delicate that i felt the whole of my heart wrapped up in saving her from her enemies we made no arrangements about it but i went into her service bodily being left to my own discretion as seemed due to my skill and experience i was to keep the ferry going because of the opportunities as well as to lull suspicion and always at dark i was bound to be according to my own proposal near the river front of the house to watch against all wicked treachery and especially if a spy of chownes should come sneaking and skulking there whether in a boat or out of it i gladly volunteered to thrash him within an inch of his foul base life the bad mans name never passed between us and indeed i may say that the lady forbore from committing herself against anybody so that i was surprised to find such wit in one so youthful we settled between us that my duties were to begin that very day and my salary of course to run also how the lady was to let me know when wanted and i to tell her when i discovered anything suspicious and as i had been compelled to restore the parsons gun to his gunmaker miss carey led me to a place you might almost call an armoury and bade me choose any piece i liked and her own maid should place it where i could find it that same evening as though it were to shoot wildfowl for them but she advised me on no account to have any talk with nanette or any servants of the household whether male or female not only because of the wicked reports and cruel slanders prevailing but also that it might not be known how i was to act in her interest and then having ordered me a good hot dinner in the butlers pantry as often was done for poor people she let me go once and then called me back and said oh nothing and then called me again and said looking steadily out of the window by the by i have quite forgotten to say that there is a boat belonging to a ship commanded by a son of sir philip bampfylde a white boat with three oars on each side and sometimes an officer behind them if they should happen to come up the river or to go ashore upon business here you need noti mean you will quite understand that no harm whatever is intended to me and therefore that you mayyou see what i mean to be sure to be sure my lady of course i may quit my duty so long as there is a manofwars boat in the river even the boldest and worst of men would venture nothing against you then quite so she replied looking bravely round with as much of pride in her bright blue eyes as of colour on her soft fresh cheeks so i made my best bow and departed chapter xxxvii two poor children by this time i owe it to all the kind people who have felt some pity for our bardie and her fortunes to put off no longer a few little things which i ought to tell them in the first place they must not think of me but look upon me as nobody treat me in fact as i treat myself and never ask what i knew just now and what i came to know afterwards only to trust me as now they must to act in all things honourably and with no regard to self and not only that but with lofty feeling and a sense of devotion towards the members of the weaker sex captain drake bampfylde was the most unlucky of born mortals to begin with he was the younger son of that very fine sir philip and feeling that he had far more wit and enterprise than his elder brother while thankful to nature for these endowments he needs must feel amiss with her for having mismanaged his time of birth now please to observe my form of words i never said that he did so feel i only say that he must have done so unless she had made him beyond herself which from her love for us she hardly ever tries to do however he might have put up with that mistake of the goddess that sits crossleggedi have heard of her i can tell you and a ship named after her though to spell her name would be a travail to me fatal perhaps at my time of lifei mean to say at any rate that young drake bampfylde might have managed to get over the things against him and to be a happy fellow if he only had common luck but providence having gifted him with unusual advantages of body and mind and so forth seemed to think its duty done and to leave him to the devil afterwards this is a bad way of beginning life especially at too young an age to be up to its philosophy and the only thing that can save such a man is a tremendous illness or the downright love of a firstrate woman thence they recover confidence or are brought into humility and get a bit of faith again as well as being looked after purely and finding a value again to fight for after abandoning their own not that drake bampfylde ever did slip into evil courses so far as i could hear of him or even give way to the sense of luck and abandon that of duty i am only saying how things turn out with nineteen men out of twenty in spite of chances he may have happened just to be the twentieth i know for sure that he turned up well though vexed with tribulation evil times began upon him when he was nothing but a boy he fell into a pit of trouble through his education and ever since from time to time new grief had overtaken him a merrier little chap or one more glad to make the best of things could not be found as was said to me by the cook and also the parlourmaid he would do things when he came out among the servants beautifully and the maids used to kiss him so that his breath was taken away with pleasing them and then he went to school and all the maids and boys and men almost came out to see the yellow coach and throw an old shoe after him this however did not help him as was seriously hoped and why because it went heelforemost from the stupidity of the caster news came in a little time that there was mischief upward and that master drake must be fetched home to give any kind of content again for he was at an ancient grammarschool in a town seven miles from exeter where everything was done truly well to keep the boys from fighting only the habit and tradition was that if they must fight fight they should until one fell down and could not come to the scratch again and drake had a boy of equal spirit with his own to contend against not however of bone and muscle to support him thoroughly but who could grieve or feel it half so much as young drake bampfylde did when the other boy in three days time died from a buzzing upon his brain he might have got into mischief now even though he was of far higher family than the boy who had foundered instead of striking but chiefly for the goodwill of the school and by reason of the boys father having plenty of children still to feed and consenting to accept aid therein that little matter came to be settled among them very pleasantly only the course of young drakes life was changed thereby as follows the plan of his family had been to let him get plenty of learning at school and then go to oxford colleges and lay in more if agreeable and so grow into holy orders of the church of england well worth the while of any man who has a good connection but now it was seen without thinking twice that all the disturbers and blasphemers of the nonconformist tribe now arising everywhere as in dirty hezekiah and that greasy hepzibah who dared to dream such wickedness concerning even me every one of these rogues was sure to cast it up against a parson in his most heavenly stroke of preaching that he must hold his hand for fear of killing the clerk beneath him and so poor drake was sent to sea the place for all the scapegoats here ill fortune dogged him still as its manner always is after getting taste of us he heeded his business so closely that he tumbled into the sea itself and one of those brindlebellied sharks took a mouthful out of him nevertheless he got over that and fell into worse trouble to wit in a very noble fight between his britannic majestys sloop of war hellgoblins carrying twelve guns and two carronades which came after my young time and the french corvette heloise of sixand twenty heavy guns he put himself so forward that they trained every gun upon him of course those fellows can never shoot anything under the height of the moon because they never stop to think nevertheless he contrived to take considerable disadvantage by a random shot they carried off the whole of one side of his whiskers and the hearing of the other ear fell off though not involved in it the doctors could not make it out however i could thoroughly from long acquaintance with cannonballs also he had marks of powder under his skin that would never come out being of a coarsegrained sort and something like the bits of tea that float in rich folks teacups happening as he did by nature to be a fine florid and handsome man this powder vexed him dreadfully nevertheless the ladies said loving powder of their own that it made him look so much nicer that however was quite a trifle when compared to his next misfortune being gazetted to a ship and the whole crew proud to sail under him he left the downs with the wind abaft and all hands in high spirits there was nothing those lads could not have done and in less than twelve hours they could do nothing a terrible gale from southwest arose in spite of utmost seamanship they were caught in the callipers of the varne and not a score left to tell of it these were things to try a man and prove the stuff inside him however he came out gallantly for being set afloat again after swimming all night and half a day he brought into the portland roads a crappo ship of twice his tonnage and three times his gunnage and now his sailors were delighted having hope of prizemoney that they never got of course which no doubt was all the better for their constitutions but their knowledge of battle led them to embark again with him having sense as we always have of luck and a crooked love of a man whose bad luck seems to have taken the turn and yet their judgment was quite amiss and any turn taken was all for the worse captain bampfylde did a thing which even i in my hotter days would rather have avoided he ran a thirtytwo gun frigate under the chains of a sixtyfour he thought that they must shoot over him while he laid his muzzles to her waterline and then carried her by boarding nothing could have been finer than this idea of doing it and with eight french ships out of nine almost he must have succeeded but once more his luck came over like a cloud and darkened him the frenchmen had not only courage which they have too much of but also what is not their gift with lucky people against them selfcommand and steadiness they closed their lower ports and waited for the englishmen to come up they knew that the side of their ship fell in like the thatch of a rick from the lower ports ten feet above the enemy they had their nettings ready and a lively sea was running it grieves as well as misbecomes me to describe the rest of it the englishmen swore with all their hearts at their ladders the sea and everything and their captain was cast down between the two ships and compelled to dive tremendously in a word it came to this that our people either were totally shot and drowned or spent the next sunday in prison at brest now here was a thing for a british captain such as the possibility of it never could be dreamed of to have lost one ship upon a french shoal and the other to a frenchman drake bampfylde but for inborn courage must have hanged himself outright and as it was he could not keep from unaccustomed melancholy and when he came home upon exchange it was no less than his duty to abandon pleasure now and cheerfulness and comfort only to consider how he might redeem his honour in the thick of this great trouble came another three times worse i know not how i could have borne it if it had been my case stoutly as i fight against the publics rash opinions for this captain was believed and with a deal of evidence to have committed slaughter upon his brothers children and even to have buried them he found it out of his power to prove that really he had not done it nor had even entertained a wish that it might happen so everybody thought how much their dying must avail him and though all had a good idea of his being upright most of them felt that this was nothing in such strong temptation i have spoken of this before and may be obliged again to speak of it only i have rebutted always and ever shall rebut low ideas yet if truly he did kill them was he to be blamed or praised for giving them good burial the testimony upon this point was no more than that of an unclad man which must of course have been worthless until they put him into a sack and in that form received it this fellow said that he was coming home towards his family very late one friday night and he knew that it was friday night because of the songs along the road of the folk from barnstaple market he kept himself out of their way because they had such a heap of clothes on and being established upon the sands for the purpose of washing his wife and children who never had seen water before and had therefore become visited he made a short cut across the sands to the hole they had all helped to scoop out in a stiff place where some roots grew this was his home and not a bad one for a seaside visit at any rate he seemed to have been as happy there as any man with a family can experience especially when all the members need continual friction this fine fellow was considering how he could get on at all with that necessary practice if the magistrates should order all his frame to be covered up and fearing much to lose all chance of any natural actionbecause there was a crusade threatenedhe lay down in the moonlight and had a thoroughly fine roll in the sand before he had worn out this delight and while he stopped to enjoy it more he heard a sound not far away of somebody digging rapidly or at any rate if it was not digging it was something like it the weather was wonderfully hot so that the rushes scarcely felt even cool to his breast and legs in that utterly lonely place for now the road was a mile behind him and the sands without a track and the stars almost at midnight there came upon him sudden fright impossible to reason with he had nothing to be robbed off neither had he enemy as for soul he never yet had heard of any such ownership but an unknown latitude of terror overpowered him nothing leads a man like fear and this poor savage though so naked was a man of some sort therefore although he would far liefer have skulked off in the crannying shadows leaving the moon to see to it he could by no means find the power to withdraw himself like that the sound came through the rushes and between the moonlit hillocks so that he was bound to follow it crouching through the darker seams and setting down his toeballs first as naked feet alone can do step by step he drew more near though longing to be further off and still he heard the heelstruck spade and then a cast and then the sullen sound of sand asliding then he came to a hollow place and feared to turn the corner being by this time frightened more than any words can set before us back he stroked his shaggy hair and in a hat of rushes laid his poor wild face for gazing and in the depth of the hollow where the moonlight scarcely marked itself and there seemed a softer herbage than of dry junkrushes but the banks combed over so as to bury the whole three fathoms deep at their very first subsidinga man was digging a small deep grave on the slope of the bank and so as to do no mischief any longer two little bodies lay put back not flung anyhow but laid as if respect was shown to them each had a clean white nightgown on and lay in decorous attitude only side by side and ready to go into the grave together the man who was digging looked up at them and sighed at so much necessity and then fell to again and seemed desirous to have done with it so was the naked man who watched him fright by this time overcreeping even his very eyeballs he blessed himself for his harmlessness and illwill to discipline all the way home to his own sandhill and a hundredfold when he came to know after the dregs of fright had cleared that he had seen laid by for coolness by this awful gravedigger the cockedhat of a british captain in the royal navy this hat he had seen once before and wondered much at the use of it and obtained an explanation which he could not help remembering and fitting this to his own ideas he was as sure as sure could be that captain bampfylde was the man who was burying the children now when this story reached the ears of poor old sir philip whether before or after his visit to our country matters not it may be supposed what his feelings were of sorrow and indignation he sent for this savage who seemed beyond the rest of his tribe in intelligence as indeed was plainly shown by his coming to bathe his family and in spite of all the difference of rank and manner between them questions manifold he put but never shook his story and then he sent to exeter for a lawyer thoroughly famous for turning any man inside out and putting what he pleased inside him but even he was altogether puzzled by this man in the sack wherein he now lived for decorums sake however raw it made him and the honest fellow said that clothing tempted him so to forsake the truth when he could not tell his own legs in it that it sapped all principle that question is not for me to deal with nor even a very much wiser man except that my glimpses of foreign tribes have all been in favour of nudity and the opposite practice is evidently against all the bent of our civilised women who are perpetually rebelling and more and more eager to open their hearts to their natural manifestation for the heart of a woman is not like a mans desperately wicked and how can they prove this unless they show its usual style of working only the other day i sawbut back i must go to the heart of my tale in a word this fine male savage convinced every one he came into contact with which after his bathing was permitted if the other man bathed afterwards that truly surely and with no mistake he must have seen something what it was became naturally quite another question and upon this head no two people could be found of one opinion but though it proved an important point i will not dwell too long on it captain drakes boat to my firm belief never came once up the river now and i thought that my beautiful young lady seemed a little grieved at this every now and then she crossed on her way to see old women and even that old mother bang and the french maid became a plague to me she had laid herself out to obtain me because of the softness with which i carried her and her opposition to my quid naturally set her heart all the more upon me i will not be false enough to say that i did not think of her sometimes because she really did go on in a tantalising manner and we seemed to have between us something when her ladys back was turned however she ought to have known that i never mean anything by this and if she chose to lie back like that and put her red lips toppermost the least thing she should have done was first to be up to our manners and customs chapter xxxviii a fine old gentleman when i came to look round upon this state of things and consider it i made up my mind to tempt providence or rather perhaps the most opposite power by holding on where i was in spite of the parson and all his devices this was a stupid resolve and one on which he had fully calculated i was getting a little perhaps fond of nanette though not quite so much as she fancied feeling unable to pin my faith to a thing she had whispered into my ear to wit that she would thrice soon inherit one three grand money hunder tousand more than one great strong man could leeft i asked her to let me come and try and she said it was possible to be having a thorough acquaintance with crappos and the small wretched particles of their money i did not attach much importance to this for i like our kings face and they have not got it and they seem to stamp their stuff anyhow but in spite of all prejudice it would be well to look a little into it particularly as this girl whether right or wrong in thousands had a figure not to be denied when you came home to her nevertheless i am not the man to part with myself at random and there was a good farmers daughter now solid and twoandthirtywhich is my favourite ship to sail in handy strong and with guns well upthis young woman crossed the ferry at eightpence aday for my sake and i thought of retaining a lawyer to find what might be her prospects she was by no means bad to look at when you got accustomed and her nature very kind and likely to see to bunnys clothes also she never contradicted which is cottonwool to one who ever has rheumatics but i did not wish to pay sixandeightpence and then be compelled to lose eightpence aday in order to steer clear of her so i ferried both her and nanette alike and let them encounter one another and charged no difference in their weight nothing better fits a man for dealing with the womankind than to be well up in fish now i found the benefit of that knowledge where i never looked for it and i knew the stale from the freshthough these come alike in the pickle of matrimonyalso which is far more to the point the soft roes from the hard roes these you cannot change but must persuade yourself to like whichever you happen to get of them and that you find out afterwards while i was dwelling upon these trifles and getting on well with my serious trade working my ferry and catching salmon so as to amaze the neighbourhood also receiving my wellearned salary from the fair mistress isabel and surprising the publichouses every night with my narrativesin a word becoming the polarstar of both sides of the rivera thing befell me which was quite beyond all sense of reason through wholesome fear of parson chowne and knowledge of his firetricks i kept the rose of devon in a berth of deep fresh water where a bulk of sand backed up and left a large calm pool of river here the dimpling water scarcely had the life to flow alongwhen the tide was well away and scarcely brought a single bubble big enough to break upon us according to the weather so the colour of the water was only when you understood it seemed to please you always one night i was not asleep but getting very near it setting in my mind afloat as i felt the young tide flowing thoughts or dreams or lighter visions than the lightest dream that flits of about concerning touching anyhow regarding or in any lightest sidelight gleaming who can tell or glancing from the chequers of the daywork suddenly a great explosion blew me out of my berth and filled the whole of the cuddy with blaze and smoke i lay on the floor halfstunned and with only sense enough for wondering then providence enabled me on the strength of the battles i had been through to get on my elbow and look around everything seemed quite odd and stupid for a little while to me i neither knew where i was nor what had happened or would happen me it may have been half an hour or it may have been only half a minute before i was all alive again and able to see to the mischief then i found that a very rude thing had been done and a most unclerical action not to be lightly excused and wholly undeserved on my part a goodsized kettle of gunpowder had been cast into my cuddy possibly as a warning to me but to say the least a dangerous one my wrath overcame all fear so much that in spite of the risk of meeting others i rushed through the smoke and up the ladder and seized my gun from its sling on the deck and gazed or rather i should say stared in every direction around me but whether from the darkness of the night or the stinging and stunning turmoil in my eyes and upon my brain i could not descry any moving shape or any living creature and this even added to my alarm so that i got very little more sleep that night i do assure you however i kept my own counsel about it even from my lady patroness resolving to maintain a sharp lookout and act as behoved a gallant cymro thrown amongst a host of savages to this intent i took our tiller which was just about six feet long and entirely useless now and i put a bit of a bottom to it so as to stand quite decently and fixed a crosstressel for shoulders and then dressed it up so with my old fishingsuit and a castaway hat to encourage my brains that really though the thing was so grave i could not help laughing at myself in the dusk it was so like me when the labours of the day were over and the gleam of the water deadened i set up this other fine davy llewellyn on board the ketch now here now there sometimes leaning over the bulwarks in contemplation of the river which was my favourite attitude from my natural turn for reflection sometimes idly at work with a rope or anything or nothing only so as to be seen from shore and expose to the public his whereabouts meanwhile i crouched in a ditch hard by and with both barrels loaded you will say this was an unchristian thing especially as i suspected strongly that my besiegers wore naked backs and would therefore receive my discharge in full i will not argue that point but tell you in common fairness to myself and to prevent any slur of the warm affection long subsisting between all who have cared to listen to me and my free self that whenever i hoped for a chance at those fellows i drew the duckshot from the first barrel and put a light charge of snipeshot in which no man could object to the second barrel was ready in case that the worst should come to the worst as we say now it is a proof of my bad luck and perhaps of my having done a thing below the high welsh nature that providence never vouchsafed me a single shot at any one of them the more trouble i took the less they came until i could scarcely crook my fingers through the rheumatics they brought on me night after night i said to myself if it only pleases the lord to save me from the wiles of this anointed one i vow to go back to my duty and teach those other young chits of boys their work for i had observed though i would not tell it except in a rheumatic twinge that even captain bampfyldes men had lost the style of drawing oars through the water properly and as i used to give the tune fiveandtwenty years agone it is needless to say that after all the close actions i have conquered in a canister of gunpowder was nothing to disturb me but as they might do worse next time whether in joke or earnest i made me a hutch of stout strong oak also cut the bulkhead out and freed myself into the hold at once upon any unjust disturbance nigh me was my double gun heavily shotted at bedtime and the spar which had knocked down parson chowne and might have to do it again perhaps and now i began to persuade myself into happy sleep again for my nature is not vindictive one night i lay broad awake perhaps from having shot a curlew and eaten him without an onion sewn inside while roasting but he had been so hard to shoot that i was full of zeal to dine upon him and had no onion handy whether it were so or not i lay awake and thought about the strange things now come over me to be earning money at a very noble rate indeed to be winning the attentions of it may be ten young women each of whom believed that never had i been in love before and to be establishing a business which could scarcely fail of growing to a publichouse with benches and glass windows looking down upon the river and yet with all this prospect brewing scarcely to have a moments peace what a lucky thing for parson chowne that i have no cold black blood in me in this medley of vague thoughts such as all men of large brain have and even myself when the moon ordains it a strong and good idea struck me and one to be dwelled upon tomorrow and if then approved to be carried out immediately this was no less than to beg an audience of sir philip bampfylde himself and tell him all that i ever had seen of chowne and his devices and place sir philip on his guard and learn maybe a little of the many things that puzzled me of course i had thought of this before but for several reasons had forborne to carry it any further in the first place it seemed such a coarse rude way of meeting plans that should be met with equal stealth and subtlety unless a man were prepared to own himself vanquished in intelligence again it would have been very difficult to obtain a private interview without some stir concerning it moreover i felt a delicacy with respect to my stewardship on behalf of those two children for a stranger might not at a glance perceive that prudence and selfdenial on my part which the worrisome frivolousness of the fish had for the time frustrated however i now perceived that a gentleman of sir philips lofty bearing could not with any grace or dignity allude to his own beneficence and as for the second difficulty i might hope for miss careys good offices while i could no longer think to encounter chowne with his own weapons since he had blown me out of bed accordingly i persuaded my beautiful young lady who had plenty of sense but not much craft and was pleased with my straightforwardness to lead me into sir philips presence in a lonely part of the grounds near the river to the westward and out of sight of the house in a word not far from the braunton burrows here the river made a bend and came to the breast of an ancient orchard rich with grass and thick with trees leafless now but thickly bearded upon every twig with moss this was of every form and fashion and of almost every hue i had never seen such a freaksome piece of work outside the tropics although in devonshire common enough where the soil is moist and the climate damp some of these trees lay down on the ground as if they wore tired of standing and some were in sitting postures and some half leaning over but all alive in spite of that and fruitful when it suited them and everything being neglected now from want of the squires attention heaps of rosy and golden apples lay where they had been piled to sweat but never led to the ciderpress perceiving no sign of sir philip about and remembering how it was now beginning to draw on for christmastime i felt myself welcome to one or two of these neglected apples for it was much if nobody of the farmers wives who crossed the ferry could afford me a goose for christmas in my solitary hole and even if all should fail disgracefully of their duty towards me i had my eye on a nice young bird of more than the average plumpness who neglected his parents advice every day and came for some favourite grass of his which only grew just on the rivers verge within thirty yards of my fusil it would have shown low curiosity to ask if he owned an owner from his independent manner i felt that he must be public property and i meant to reduce him into possession right early in the morning of the saint that was so incredulous it is every mans duty to treat himself well at the time of the holy nativity and having a knowledge of devonshire geese after two months on the stubbles i could not do better than store in my boat one or two of these derelict apples never do i see or taste an apple without thinking of poor bardie appledies she always called them and she was so fond of them and her little white teeth made marks like a smalltooth comb in the flesh of them i was thinking of her and had scarcely embarked more than a bushel or so for sauce in a little snug locker of my own when i had the pleasure of seeing the gentleman whom i had come all that way to see at my own desire and through miss careys faith in me it had not been laid before sir philip that i was likely to meet him here only she had told me when and where to come across him so as not to be broken in upon now he came down the narrow winding walk at the lower side of the orchard a path overhanging a little brook which murmured under last summers growth and i gazed at him silently for a while through the bushes that overhung my boat he was dressed as when i had seen him last through my telescope at the time we came up the river that is to say in black velvet and with his long sword hanging beside him a brave and stately and noble man walking through a steady gloom of grief and yet content to walk alone and never speak of it i leaped through the bush at the rivers brink and suddenly stood before him he set his calm cold gaze upon me without a shadow of surprise as if to say you have no business in my private grounds however it is not worth speaking of i made him a low bow with my hat off and he moved his own and was passing on will your worship look at me i said and see whether you remember me he seemed just a little surprised and then with his inborn courtesy complied i have seen you before but i know not where sir i often need pardon now for the weakness of my memory in a few short words i brought to his mind that evening visit to my cottage with anthony stew and the yellow carriage to be sure to be sure i remember now he said with his grave and placid smile david llewellyn both good old names and the latter i daresay in your belief both the older and the better one i remember your hospitality your patience and your love of children is there anything i can do for you no your worship nothing i am here for your sake only although if i wanted i would ask you having found you so good and kind whence did you get that expression my friend the common usage is kind and good i once knew a very little childbut i suppose it is the welsh idiom your worship i can speak english thoroughly better even than my own language and all around us the scholarly people have more english than of welsh but to let your worship know my cause to come so much upon you is of things more to the purpose i have found a bad man meaning mischief to your worship it cannot be so he replied withdrawing as if i were taking a liberty no doubt but you mean me well llewellyn and yourself believe it but neither i nor any one else of all my family now so small can have given reason for any illwill towards us it was not for me to dare to speak while the general was reflecting thus as if in his own mind going through every small accident of his life even the servants he might have discharged or the landforces ordered for punishment whereof to my mind they lack more than they get and grow their backs up in a manner beyond all perception of discipline for my part i could not help thinking as i watched him carefully how low and black must be the nature of the heart that could rejoice in such a mans unhappiness a man who at threescore years and five was compelled to rack his memory even after being long in uncontrolled authority to find a time when he might have given cause for private enmity if i had only enjoyed such chances i must have had at least a score of strong enemies by this time being a little surprised i looked again and again at his white eyebrows while his eyes were on the ground also at his lips and nostrils which were highly dignified and i saw in my dry low way one reason why he had never given offence he was perhaps a little scant of humour and of quickness which two things give more offence to the outer world that has them not than the longest course of rigid business carried on without them i have seen a man who could not crack nuts fly into a fury with one who could and these reflections made me even yet more anxious to serve him so grave and calm and simpleminded and so patient was his face nevertheless i did not desire and would at the point of his sword have refused a halfpenny for the things of import which i now disclosed to him he led me to an ancient bench beneath a wellworn appletree and sat thereon and even signed for me to sit beside him my knowledge of his rank would not permit me to do this until i was compelled to argue a gentleman more shaped and set inside his own opinions it had never been my luck to have to deal with now and then there are men you cannot laugh at though you get the best of them unless your conscience works with such integrity as theirs does and the sense of this in some way unknown may have now been over me how i began it or even showed my sense of manners and of all the different rank between us is beyond my knowledge now and must have flowed from instinct then enough that i did lead sir philip to have thoughts and to hearken me with a power not expected by myself at first beginning while in doubt of throat and words i contrived to set before him much that had befallen me though i never said a word that lay outside my knowledge neither let a spark of heat find entrance to my mind at all and would rather speak too little than be thought outrageous there could be no doubt that my simple way of putting all i had to say moved this lofty man as if he were one of the children at the well belonging to john the baptist i thought of all those pretty dears as i beheld him listening and the way they sat around me and their style of moving toes at any great catastrophe whiles they kept their hands and noses under very stiff control also the universal sigh when my story killed any one by any means unfit to die and their pure contempt of the things they suck the whole while they are swallowing sir philip to whom my thoughts meant no failure of respect but feeling of simplicity this old gentleman let me speak as one well accustomed to lengthiness but i did my best to keep a small helm and yards on the creak for bracing if i take you aright he said as i drew near the end of my story you have not a high opinion of that reverend gentleman stoyle chowne i look upon him your worship as the blackesthearted son of belial ever sent into this world sir philip frowned as behoved a man accustomed to authority and only to have little words half spoken out before him but at my time of life no officer under an admiral on full pay could have any right to damp my power of expression however my respect was such for the presence of this noble man that i rose and made a leg to him i am sorry to say he answered bowing to my bow as all gentlemen must do that this is not the first time i have heard unpleasant things about poor stoyle he is my godson and has been almost as one of my own children i never can believe that he would ever do me injury if i thought it i should have to think amiss of almost every one he turned away as if already he had said more than he meaned and feeling how he treated me as if of his own rank almost i did not wonder at the tales of men who gave their lives to save him in the bloody battletime knowing the world as i do i only sighed and waited for him you are very good he said without a tone of patronage to have thought to help me by delivering your opinions a heavy trouble has fallen upon us and the goodwill of the neighbourhood has many times astonished me however you must indulge no more in any such wild ideas they all proceed from the evil one and are his choicest device to lower the value of holy orders the reverend stoyle chowne descends from a very good old family at any rate on his fathers side and he has his dignity to maintain and his holy office to support him on this head i will hear no more the general shut his mouth and closed it so that i could never dare to open mine again to him concerning this one subject and his manner stopped me so that i only made my duty this he acknowledged in a manner which became both him and me and then he passed through a little gate to his usual walk upon braunton burrows chapter xxxix notice to quit we were now come to the time of year which all good christians celebrate by goodwill and festivities even i in my humble way had made some preparation for this holy period by shooting farmer badcocks goose which had long been in my mind upon plucking he turned out even whiter and better than expectation and the tender down clung to him in a way that showed his texture i hung him up in a fine throughdraught and rejoiced in the thought of him every time my head came in between his legs neither did he fall away when he came to roasting but when i had put him down upon the christmas morning with intent to stick thereby and baste him up to one oclock dipping bits of bread beneath him as he might begin to drip and winning thus foretaste of himall my plans were overset by a merry party coming and demanding ferry with my lovely goose beginning just to spread his skin a little and hiss sweetly at the fire up i ran with resolution not to ferry anybody but to cook my goose aright nevertheless it might not be so here were three young fellows ramping of the high nobility swearing to come aboard and stick me if i would not ferry them it was not that i feared of this but that i beheld a guinea spinning in the morning sun which compelled me to forego and leave my poor young goose to roll around and try to roast himself therefore i backed him from the fire and laid half a pound of slow lard on his breast and trusted his honour to keep alive these young joyous fellows now were awake to everything they had begun the morning bravely with a cup of rum and lemon then a tender grill of beef and a quart of creamy ale every one accordingly and they meant to keep the day up to no less a pattern being all of fine old birth and bound to act accordingly however it had been said by some one that they ought to go to church and they happened to feel the strength of this and vowed that the devil should catch the hindmost unless they struck out for it hence i came to win the pleasure of their company that day their nearest church was the little simple quiet old church at ashford from my ferry i could see it and it often made me sigh because it looked so tranquil sweet green land sloped up towards it with a trace of crooked footpaths and the nicks of elbowed hedges where the cows came down and stood also from it looking downward through the valley of the tawe may be seen a spread of beauty and of soft variety and of largeness opening larger with the many winding waters to the ocean unbeheld that the sternest man must sigh and look again and look again a genuine parson now was master of this queer old quiet church a man who gave his life entire for the good of other men in a little hut he lived which the clerks house overrode just at the turning of the lane upon the steep ascent and where the thundershowers flooded it all the poor folk soon began to dwell upon his noble nature and to feel that here was some one fit to talk of saviours miles around they came to hear him so that he was forced to stand on a stool in the porch and speak to them for speaking it was and not preaching which made all the difference these three gay young sparks leaped lightly into the bow of my ferryboat and bade me pull for my very life unless i desired to be flung into the water then and there a strong springtide was running up and i was forced to pull the starboard oar with all my might to keep the course my passengers were carrying on with every sort of quip and crank and jokes that made the boat to tilt when suddenly a rush of water flooded their silk stockings i thought at first that the bung was out and told them not to be frightened but in another breath i saw that it was a great deal worse than that the water was rushing in through a mighty hole in the planks of the larboard bow and in three minutes we must be swamped all aft all aft in a moment i cried it is our only chance of reaching shore the gallants were sobered at once by fright and i bundled them into the sternsheets sat on the aftmost thwart myself and for the lives of us all pulled back towards the bank we had lately quitted by casting all the weight thus astern i raised the leak up to the waterline except when we plunged to the lift of the oars and the water poured in less rapidly now with the set of the tide on our starboard beam however with all this and all my speed and my passengers showing great presence of mind we barely managed to touch the bank and jump out when down she foundered at first i was at a loss altogether even to guess how this thing had happened for the boat seemed perfectly sound and dry at the time of our leaving the shore but as soon as the tide was out and i could get at her i perceived that a trick of entirely fiendish cunning and atrocity had been played upon me a piece of planking a foot in length and from eight to ten inches wide had been cut out with a keyhole saw at the time she was lying high and dry and doubtless before daybreak this had been then replaced most carefully with a little caulking so that it was watertight without strong pressure from outside but the villain had contrived it knowing in what state of tide i was likely next to work the ferry so that the rush of water could not fail to beat the piece in it made my blood run cold to think of the stealthiness of this attempt as well as the skill it was compassed with for the chances were ten to one almost in favour of its drowning me and leaving a bad name behind me too for having drowned my passengers and to this it must have come if so much as a single woman had been in the boat that day for these when in danger always do the very worst thing possible and the manager of this clever scheme knew of course that my freight was likely on the christmas morning to be chiefly female luckily i had refused two boatloads of young and attractive womankind not from religious feeling only but because i had to chop a trencherful of stuffing this affair impressed me so with a sense of awe and reverence and a certainty that parson chowne must be in direct receipt of counsel from the evil one that my mind was good to be off at once and thank the lord for escaping him for let us see what must have happened but for the goodness and fatherly care of a merciful providence over me the boat would have sunk in the very midst of the rapid and icy river david llewellyn with his accustomed fortitude would have endeavoured to swim ashore and yet could not have resisted the claims of three or even four young women who doubtless would have laid hold of him all screaming splashing and dragging him down the mind refuses to contemplate such a picture any longer this matter could not be kept quiet as the first attempt had been but spread from house to house and gained in size from each successive tongue until the man at the foot of the bridge who naturally detested me whispered into every ear that it was high time to have a care of that interloping welshman who had drowned six fine young noblemen for the sake of their buckles and watches and my courage was at so low an ebb that when he retreated into his house i could not even bring my mind to the power of kicking his door in hence that calumny not being quenched went the round of the neighbourhood and i might as well haul down my sign and the hopes of any publichouse became a fading vision and of all the fine young women who had set their hearts upon keeping it as i described my intention to them and who had picked up bits of welsh for an access to my heart in all its patriotism there was not one worth looking at or fit to be a landlady who took the trouble to come near me in the frosty weather when a man is forsaken by the world he must have recourse to reason and if only borne up thereby and with a little cash in hand he can wait till the world comes round again this was my position now i never had behaved so well in all my life before i think though always conscientious but of late i had felt as it were in one perpetual round of bitter wrestling with the evil one men of a loose kind may not see that this was tenfold hard upon me from my props being knocked away i mean my entire trust and leaning upon the ancient church of england which perhaps by repulsion from those fellows that came after our old ham as well as our proper parsons knowledge of soles and the way to fry them had increased upon me so that my heart leaped up whenever i heard the swing of a bell on sunday some of this perhaps was owing to my thoughts of newton clock and twelve shillings now due to me from my captainship thereof but how could this loyal and ecclesiastical fervour thrive while a man in holy orders did such unholy things to me the only one with faith enough and sense enough to stand by me now through this bitter trial was that beautiful young lady whom i did admire so and if till now i admired only now i did adore her nanette did for herself with me and all her hopes of ever being mrs david llewellyn by poking up her little toesand i saw that they were all square almostand with guttural noises crying that on board my boat she would not dare miss carey laughed at her and stepped with her beautiful boots on board of me and from that moment she might do exactly as she pleased with me however my ferry was knocked on the head and all the hopes of a wife and family and even a publichouse and skittles which i had long been building up as well as to train our bunny for barmaid which must always be done quite young to get the proper style of it and thorough acquaintance with measures how to make them look quite brim up when they are only threeparts full all golden dreams will vanish thus no life of smiling boniface but of gunmuzzles was before me no castingup of shot by pence but ramming down on pounds of powder let that pass my only wish is to conceal in the strictest manner little trifles about myself isabel carey was so shocked at hearing of our danger as by me distinctly told without a word of flourish that she made me promise strongly to give up my ferrying this i was becoming ready more and more every day to do especially as nobody ever now came down for porterage but i told the lady how hard it was to have formed such a valuable trade or you might say an institution and then to lose it all because of certain private enmities what she said or did hereon is strictly a family question and can in no way concern the public since i hauled my flag down and now i gained more insight into my great enemys schemes and doings than i could have acquired while engaged so much at ferry for time allowed me to maintain that strict watch upon narnton court which was now become my duty as well as an especial pleasure for the following reason i began to see most clearly that the foul outrage upon my boat must have been perpetrated by one or both of those savage fellows who were employed as spies upon this great house from the landward side they must have forded the river which is not more than three feet deep in places when the tide is out and no floods coming down these two cunning barbarians came of course from the nympton rookery but were lodging for the present in a hole they had scooped for themselves in the loneliest part of braunton burrows of course they durst not go about in a peopled and civilised neighbourhood with such an absence of apparel as they could indulge at home still they were unsightly objects and decent people gave them a wide berth when possible but my firm intention was to grapple with these savage scoundrels and to prove at their expense what a civilised welshman is and how capable of asserting his commercial privileges only as they carried knives i durst not meet them both at once and even should i catch them singly some care was advisable so as take them off their guard because i would not lower myself to the use of anything more barbarous than an honest cudgel however although i watched and waited and caught sight of them more than once especially at nighttime when they roved most freely it was long before i found it prudent to bear down on the enemy not from any fear of them but for fear of slaying them as i might be forced to do if they rushed with steel at me one night after the turn of the days and with mild weather now prevailing and a sense of spring already fluttering in the valleys i sat in a dark embrasure at the end of narnton court there had been more light than usual in the windows of the great diningroom which now was very seldom used for hospitable purposes and now two gentlemen came forth as if for a little air to take a turn on the riverterrace it did not cost me long to learn that one was good sir philip bampfylde and the other that very wicked chowne the latter had manifestly been telling some of his choicest stories and held the upper hand as usual general take my arm the flags are rough and the night is of the darkest you must gravel this terrace for the sake of your guests after your portwine dick said the general with a sigh for he was a most hospitable man and accustomed to the army dick thou hast hardly touched my port and i like not to have it slighted sir what excuse the parson made i did not hear but knew already that one of his countless villanies was his rude contempt of the gift of god as vouchsafed to noah and confirmed by the very first rainbow which continues the colours thereof up to this time of writing sir philip leaned on the parapet some twenty yards to windward of me and he sniffed the fine fresh smell of seaweed and seawater coming up the river with a movement of four knots an hour and in his heart he thanked the lord very likely without knowing it then he seemed to sigh a little and to turn to chowne and say dick this is not as it should be look at all this place and up and down all this length of river every light you can see burning is in a house that longs to me and who is now to have it all it used to make me proud but now it makes me very humble you are a parson tell me dick what have i done to deserve it all the rev richard stoyle chowne had notwhatever his other vices wereone grain of pious hypocrisy in all his foul composition if he had he might have flourished and with his native power must have been one of the foremost men of this or any other age but his pride allowed him never to let in pretence religious into the texture of his ways a worse man need not be desired and yet he did abhor all cant to such a degree that he made a mock of his own churchservices general i have nought to say you have asked this question more than once you know what my opinion is i know that you have the confidence sir every honourable man must have in my poor sons innocence you support it against every one against all the world against even you when you allow yourself to doubt it tush i would not twice think of it however many candles burnthis was a touch of his nasty sarcasm which he never could deny himselfup and down the valley general no son of yours however wild and troubled in expenditure could ever shape or even dream of anything dishonourable i hope noti hope to god not sir philip said with a little gasp as if he were fearing otherwise dick you are my godson and you have been the greatest comfort to me because you never would believe not another word general you must not dwell on this matter so the children were fine little dears of course very clever and very precious oh if you only knew the words dick my little granddaughter could come out with scarcely anything you could think of would have been too big for her little mouth and if she could not do it once she never left it till she did where it came from i could not tell for we are not great at languages but it must have been of her mothers race and the boy though not with gifts of that sortoh you ought to have seen his legs dickat least till he took the whoopingcough the stately old gentleman leaned and dropped a tear perhaps into the river tawe general i understand it all said chowne though he never had a child by reason of the almightys mercy to the next generation of course these pretty children were a great delight to every one but affairs of this sort happen in all ancient families the mere extent of land appears to open for clandestine graves that wicked devilish story dick did you tell me or did you not to take it as the fiends own lie a lie of course as concerns the captain from their want of knowledge but concerning some one else true enough i fear i fear both men had by this time very nearly said their say throughout the general seemed to be overcome and the parson to be growing weary of a subject often treated in discourse between them before you go in the morning dick said the old man now recovering i wish to consult you about a matter nearly concerning young isabel she is a distant cousin of yours you thoroughly understand the law of which i have very little knowledge perhaps you will meet me in the bookroom for half an hours quiet talk before we go to breakfast i cannot do it sir philip i have my own affairs to see to i must be off when the moon is up i cannot sleep in your house this night chapter xl forcible ejectment those things which have been settled for us by long generations of ancestors all of whom must have considered the subjects one after the other painfully and brought good minds of ancient strength less led away than ours are to bear upon what lay before them also living in a time when money went much further and got a deal more change in honesty which was then more plentifulto rush i say against the bulwarks of our noble elders who showed the warmth of their faith by roasting all who disagreed with them would be ay and ever will be a proof of a rebellious scurvy and perpetually scabby nature the above fine reflection came home to me just as my pipe grew sweet and rich after an excellent dinner provided by that most thoughtful and bright young lady the honourable isabel carey upon a noble new years day in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eightythree her ladyship now had begun to feel that interest in my intelligence and unusual power of narrative as well as that confidence in my honour and extreme veracity which without the smallest effort or pretence on my part seem to spring by some law of nature in every candid mind i meet combining this ladys testimonials as presented weekly with some honourable trifles picked up here and there along shore in spite of all discouragement perhaps i congratulated myself on having turned the corner of another year not badly i counted my money to the tune of fiveandtwenty level pounds an amount of cash beyond all experience yet instead of being dazzled i began to see no reason for not having fifty not that i ever thought of money but for the sake of the children the tears came into my eyes to think of these poor little creatures bardie with all her fount of life sanded up as one might say in that old sker warren and bunny with her strength of feeding weakened over rice and fowlfood such as old charles morgan kept who had been known to threaten to feed his family upon sawdust a most respectable man as well as churchwarden and undertaker but being bred a pure carpenter he thought when his money came in fast and great success surprised him that providence would be offended at his waste of sawdust now this was the man who had bunny to keep entirely from his own wish of course or the sense of the village concerning her and many times i had been ready to laugh and as many times to cry almost whenever i thought of the many things that were likely to happen between them to laugh when i thought of churchwardens face regarding our bunny at breakfasttime and the way she would say i want some more through his narrowshouldered children to cry when i thought of my dear sons child and as dear to me as my own almost getting less of victuals daily as her welcome should grow staler and giving way to her old trick of standing on the floor with eyes shut and with shut mouth to declare i wont eat now you have starved me so and no one in that house with wit to understand and humour her and then i could see her go to bed in a violent temper anyhow and when the wind boxed round to north i could hear her calling granny this very tender state of mind and sense of domestic memories seems to have drawn me so far as i can in a difficult case remember it towards a very ancient inn having two bowwindows when i entered no man could be in a stricter state of sobriety and as if it were yesterday i remember asking the price of everything the people were even inclined to refuse to draw anything in the smallliquor line for a man with so little respect for trade as to walk so straight upon new years day after a little while i made them see that this was not so much my fault as my misfortune and when i declared my name of course and my character came forward even rumshrub out of a cask with golden hoops around it scarcely seemed to be considered good enough for me gratis but throughout the whole of this i felt an anxious and burning sense of eager responsibility coupled with a strong desire to be everywhere at once right early to the very utmost of my recollection i tumbled into my lonely berth after seeing my fusil primed and praying to the lord for guidance through another and a better year i had clean sheets which are my most luxurious gift of feeling and having no room to stretch my legs or roll i managed space to yawn and then went off deliciously now i was beginning to dream about the hole i had placed my money ina clever contrivance of my own and not in the cuddy at all because the enemy might attack me therewhen a terrible fit of coughing came and saved my life by waking me the little cuddy was full of smokeparching blinding choking smokeso thick that i could scarcely see the red glare of fire behind it through the brattice of the bulkhead good lord i cried have mercy on me sure enough i am done for now and nobody ever will know or care what the end was of old dyo i did not stop still to say all this that you may be quite sure of and it argues no small power of speech that i was able to say anything for with a last desire for life and despairing resolve to try again i broke my knuckles against the hatch which i had made so heavy for the purpose of protecting me to go out through my door would have been to rush into the fire itself and what with the choking and the thickness and the terror of the flames violently reddening and roaring a few feet away i felt my wits beginning to fail me which of course was certain death so i sate down on a threelegged stool which was all my furniture and for a moment the rushing smoke drew by some draught otherwhere and whether i would or no a deal of my past life came up to me i wondered whether i might have been too hard sometimes on any one or whether i might have forgotten to think of the lord upon any sunday and then my thoughts were elevated to the two dear children now what do you think happened to me when i thought of those two darlings and the tears from smoke made way for the deepborn tears of a noble heart why simply that a flash of flame glanced upon the iron crowbar wherewith i had opened hatch i could not have been in pure bright possession of my makers gifts to me when i chanced before going to bed to lay that crowbar for my pillowcase nevertheless i had done it well and in the stern perception of this desperate extremity i could not help smiling at the way i had tucked up my head on the crowbar but though no time is lost in smiling i had not a moment to lose even now although with my utmost wits all awake and coughing i prised the hatch up in half a moment where it was stuck in the combings and if ever a man enjoyed a draught i did so of air that moment many men might have been frightened still and not have known what to do with themselves but i assure you in all honour that the whole of my mind came back quite calmly when i was out of smothering people may say what they like but i know after seeing every form of death and you need not laugh at me very much if i even said feeling iti know no anguish to be compared to the sense of being pressed under slowly and the soul with no room to get away but i was under the good stars now and able to think and to look about and though the ketch could not last long being of tons only i found time enough to kneel and thank my god for his mercy to me there was no ice in the river now and to swim ashore would have been but little except for rheumatics afterwards but it seemed just as well to escape even these and having been burned out at sea before i was better enabled to manage it the whole of the waist of the ketch was in flames curling and beginning now to indulge their desire of roaring but the kindness of the lord prevented wind from blowing had there been only a fourknot breeze you would never have heard of me again surely which would grieve you in this very sad state of mind combined with a longing for thankfulness and while i was thinking about the fireto say the truth very stupidly and wondering instead of workingquite an oldfashioned affair restored me to my wits and my love of the world again this was the strong sour sound of the air when a bullet comes through it hastily and casting reproach upon what we breathe for its want of a stronger activity a man had made a shot at me and must have been a lubber by his want of range and commonsense before i could think i was all alive and fit to enjoy myself almost as if it were a fight with frenchmen the first thing i thought of was the gun lent to me by miss carey to rescue this i went down even into the cuddy which had so lately proved my very grave almost and after this i saw no reason why i should not save my money if the lord so willed it from a sense of all the mischief even now around me i had made a clever hole in the bowknees of the ketch where the wood lay thickest and so had plugged my money up with the power to count it daily and now in spite of flame and roar and heat of all the midships and the spluttering of the rockpowder bags too wet to be unanimous i made my mind up just to try to save my bit of money because although a man may be as coarse and wicked and vilehearted as even my very worst enemies are he cannot fail of getting on and being praised and made the best of if he only does his best to stick tight to his money therefore having no boat within reach and the midship all aflame i made a raft of the cuddyhatch and warped along by the side of the ketch and purchased my cash from its little nest and then with a thankful heart and nothing but a pair of breeches on made the best of my way ashore punting myself with a broken oar this desire to sacrifice me without the trouble even taken to count what my value was gave me such a sense of shock and of spreading abroad everywhere without any knowledge left of what might have become of me and the subject liable to be dropped if ever entered into by a jolly crowner and a jury glad to please him that for the moment i sate down upon a shelf of clay until the wet came through my want of clothes suddenly this roused me up to make another trial for the sake of my wellaccustomed and familiar suit of clothes so well beloved also even my sunday style more striking but less comfortable in lack of which the world could never have gone on in our neighbourhood therefore i ran to my little punt and pushed off and was just in time to save my kit with a little singeing the ketch burned down to the waters edge and then a rough tide came up and sank her leaving me in a bitter plight and for some time quite uncertain how to face the future from knowledge of the parsons style of treating similar cases i felt it to be a most likely thing that i should be charged with firing her robbing her and concealing booty and this injustice added to the bitterness of my close escape it is no use i said aloud it is useless to contend with him he has sold himself to satan and thank god i have no chance with him therefore by the time the fire had created some disturbance in the cottage bedrooms i had got my clothing on in a decent though hasty manner and slipped into a little wood with my spyglass happily saved and resolved to watch what happened in among the bumpkins these came down and stared and gawked and picked up bits of singed spars and so on and laid down the law to one another and fought for the relics and thought it hard that no mans body was to be found with clothes on i saw them hunting for me up and down the river channel with a desperate ignorance of tide although living so close to it and i did not like to have my body hunted for like that but i repressed all finer feelings as a superior man must do and chewed the tip of a bullocks tongue which luckily was in my waistcoatpocket ready for great emergency and which if a man keeps going on with he may go like the great elijah forty days and feel no hunger at least i have heard so and can believe it having seen men who told me so but i would rather have it proved by another mans experience while i was looking on at these things down came parson chowne himself in a happy mood and riding the black mare now brought out of dock again the country folk all fell away from their hope of stealing something and laid fingers to their hats being afraid to talk of him he however did no more than sign to the servingman behind him to acknowledge compliments which was outside his own custom and then he put spurs to his horse and galloped right and left through the lot of them in my anxiety to learn what this dreadful man was up to i slipped down through the stubs of the wood where the faggotcutters had been at work gliding even upon my jersey because of the parsons piercing eyes and there in the ditch i found some shelter and spied through a bushy breastwork no more than i expected he cried from what i have seen of the fellow he has fired the ship and run away with all he could lay hands on as a justice of the peace i offer ten pounds reward for david llewellyn brought before me alive or dead is there one of you rantipoles can row oh you can take this shilling and be off with that big thiefs ferryboat and leave it at sam tuckers shipyard in the name of the reverend stoyle chowne it went to my heart that none of the people to whom i had been so good and kindto use pretty bardies phrasenow had the courage to stand up and say that my character was most noble and claim back my boat for me instead of that they all behaved as if i had never ferried them and the ingratitude of the young women made me long to be in wales again because you may say what you like but the first point in our people is gratitude of course cried chowne and his voice though gently used came down the wind like a bell of course good people you have not found the corpse of that wretched villain us would giv un up glad enough if us only gat the loock for tan zhilling your raverance lave aloun tan poond when that miserable miser said a thing so low as that my very flesh crept on my bones and my inmost heart was sick with being made so very little of to myself i always had a proper sense of estimation and to be put at this low figure made me doubt of everything however i came to feel after a bit that this is one of the trials which all good men must put up with neither would a common man find his corpse worth ten pounds sterling betwixt my sense of public value a definite sum at any rate and imagination of what my truly natural abilities might lead me to if properly neglected i found it a blessed hard thing to lie quiet until dark and then slip out and the more so because my stock of food was all consumed by middle day and before the sun went down hunger of a great shape and size arose and raged within me this is always difficult to discipline or to reason with and to men of the common order it suggests great violence to me it did nothing of that kind but led me into a little shop where i paid my money and got my loaf my flint and steel and tinderbox lay in my pocket handy these i felt and felt again and went into the woods and thought and found that even want of food had failed to give me a thoroughgoing and consistent appetite because for the first time in my life i had shaped a strong resolve and sworn to the lord concerning itto commit a downright crime and one which i might be hanged for although every one who has entered into my sufferings and my dignity must perceive how right i was and would never inform against me i will only say that on saturday evening parson chowne had fourteen ricks and on sunday morning he had none and might begin to understand the feelings of the many farmers who had been treated thus by him right gladly would i have beheld his face so rigid and contemptuous at other peoples trouble when he should come to contemplate his own works thus brought home to him but i could not find a hedge thick enough to screen me from his terrible piercing eyes this little bit of righteous action made a stir you may be sure because it was so contrary to the custom of the neighbourhood although i went to see this fire i took the finest care to leave no evidence behind me and even turned my bits of toggery inside out at starting but there was a general sense in among these people that only a foreigner could have dared to fly in the parsons face so i waited long enough to catch the turn of the public feeling and finding it set hard against me my foremost thought was the love of home keeping this in view and being pressed almost beyond bearing now with no certainty moreover as to warrants coming out and the people looking strangely every time they met me i could have no peace until i saw the beautiful young lady and to her told everything you should have seen her eyes and cheeks as well as the way her heart went and the pride with which she gathered all her meaning up to speak even after i had told her how the ricks would burn themselves you dear old davy she said i never thought you had so much courage you are the very bravest manbut stop did you burn the whole of them every one burned itself your ladyship i saw the ashes dying down and his summerhouse as well took fire through the mischief of the wind and all his winter stock of wood and his toolhouse and his any more any more old david yes your ladyship his cowhouse after the cows were all set free and his new cartshed fifty feet long also his carpenters shop and his ciderpress you are the very best man she answered with her beautiful eyes full upon me that i have seen since i was a child i must think what to do for you did you burn anything more old davy the fire did your ladyship three large barns and a thing they call a linhay also the granary and the mealhouse and the appleroom and the churnroom and only missed the dairy by a little nasty slant of wind what a good thing you have done there is scarcely any man i know that would have shown such courage mr llewellyn is there anything in my power to do for you nothing could have pleased me more than to find this fair young lady rejoicing in this generous manner at the parsons misadventure and her delight in the contemplation made me almost feel repentance at the delicate forbearance of the flames from the rectory itself but i could not help reflecting how intense and bitter must be this young harmless creatures wrong received and dwelling in her mind ere she could find pleasure from wild havoc and destruction there is one thing you can do i answered very humbly and it is my only chance to escape from misconstruction i never thought at my time of life to begin life so again but i am now a homeless man burned out of my latest refuge and with none to care for me perhaps i may be taken up tomorrow or the next day and with such a man against me it must end in hanging i never heard such a thing she said he tries to burn you in your bed after blowing you up and doing his very best to drown you and then you are to be hanged because there is a bonfire on his premises it is impossible mr llewellyn to think twice of such a thing your ladyship may be right i answered and in the case of some one else reasoning would convince me but if i even stop to think twice it will lead to handcuffs and handcuffs lead to halter at this she began to be frightened much and her fright grew worse as i described the unpleasantness of hanging how i had helped myself to run up nine good men at the yardarm and a fine thing for their souls no doubt to stop them from more mischief and let them go up while the lord might think that other men had injured them your ladyship i began again when i saw all her delicate colour ebbing it is not for a poor hunted man to dare to beg a favour oh yes it is it is she cried that is the very time to do it anything in my power david after all you have done for me then all that i want of your ladyship is to get me rated aboard of captain drake bampfyldes ship she coloured up so clearly that i was compelled to look away and then she said how do you knowi mean who can have told you thatbut are you not tooperhaps a little too old your ladyship not a day i am worth halfadozen of those young chips who have got no bones to their legs yet and as for shooting if his honour wants a man to train a cannon i can hit a marlinspike with a roundshot at a mile and a half as soon as i learn the windage for i knew by this time that captain bampfyldes ship the alcestis was in reserve as a feeder for the royal navy to catch young hands and train them to some knowledge of sealife and smartness and the styles of gunnery and who could teach them these things better than a veteran like me miss carey smiled at my conceit as perhaps she considered it well davy if you can fire a gun as well as you can a hayrick no more your ladyship i beseech you even walls like these have ears and every time i see my shadow i take it for a constable i am sure there are two men after me have you then two shadows she asked in her peculiar pleasant way at any rate no one will dare to meddle with you or any of us i should hope in the generals own house come in here i expect or at least i think there is some prospect of a boat from the alcestis coming up the river this very evening perhaps you have some baggage no your ladyship not a bit they burned me out of all of it but i saved some money kindly by special grace of god at the loss of all my leghair i ought not to have said that i knew directly after uttering it to a young lady who could not yet be up to things of that kind chapter xli the right man in the right place the very next day i was afloat as a seaman of the royal navy of the united kingdom none but a sailor can imagine what i felt and what i thought here for years i had been adrift from the very work god shaped me for wrecked before my time by undue violence of a frenchman also i had bred my son up to supply my place a little and a very noble fellow though he could not handle cutlash or lay gun as i had done but he might have come to it if he ever had come to my own time of life this however had been cut short by the will of providence and now i felt bound to make good for it only one thing grieved me viz to find the war declining this went to my heart the more because our navy had not done according to its ancient fame anywhere but at gibraltar and with admiral rodney in the year before i rejoined it off the coast of america things i could not bear to hear also the loss of the royal george the capture of the leeward islands and of minorca by the french and even a british sloop of war taken by a french corvette such things moved me to the marrow after all i had seen and done and all our ships company understood that i returned to the service in the hope to put a stop to it this reclaiming of me to the thing that i was meant for took less time than i might use to bring a gun to its bearings that beautiful miss carey managed everything with captain drake and in less than fifty kisses they had settled my affairs i could have no more selfrespect if i said another word but the king and the nation won the entire benefit of this it came to pass that i was made a secondinstructor in gunnery with an entire new kit found me and sixandtwopence aweek appointed together with second right to stick a fork into the boiler of course i could not have won all this by favour but showed merit it had however been allowed me under an agreement just enough yet brought about by special love of justice that i should receive a month ashore at newtonnottage in the course of the spring whenever it might suit our cruising my private affairs demanded this as well as love of neighbours and strong desire to let them know how much they ought to make of me how i disdained my rod and pole and the longshore life and the lubberly ways when i felt once more the bounding of the open water the spring of the buoyant timbers answering every movement gallantly the generous vehemence of the canvas and the noble freedom of the ocean winds around us the rush up a liquid mountain and the sway on the balance of the world then the plunge into the valley almost out of the sight of god though we feel him hovering over us while the heart leaps with the hope of yet more glorious things to comethe wild delight the rage suspense and majesty of battle nothing vexed me now so much as to hear from private people and even from the public sailors that the nation wanted peace no nation ever should want peace until it has thoroughly thrashed the other or is bound by wicked luck to knock under hopelessly and neither of those things had befallen england at this period but i have not skill enough to navigate in politics and before we had been long at sea we spoke a fullrigged ship from hamburg which had touched at falmouth and two german boys in training for the british navy let us know that peace was signed between great britain france and spain as nearly as might be on valentines day of the year a sad and hard thing we found to believe it and impossible to be pleased after such practice of gunnery nevertheless it was true enough and confirmed by another ship and now a new ministry was in office under a man of the name of fox doubtless of that nature also ready always to run to earth nothing more could be hoped except to put up with all degradation a handful of barbarous fellows wild in the woods and swamps of america most of them sent from this homecountry through their contempt of discipline fellows of this sort had been able mainly by skulking and shirking fight to elude and get the better of his britannic majestys forces and pretend to set up on their own account as if they could ever get on so no one who sees these things as clearly as i saw them then and there can doubt as to the call i felt to rejoin the royal navy of course i could not dream that now there was rising in a merchantship captured from the frenchmen and fitted with two dozen guns a british captain such as never had been seen before nor will ever be again and whose skill and daring left the frenchmen one hope onlyto run ashore and stay there however not to dwell too long on the noblest and purest motives it did not take me quite three weeks to supersede the first instructor and to get him sent ashore and find myself hoisted into his berth with a rise of twoandtwo per week this gave me eightandfourpence with another stripe on my right arm and what was far more to the purpose added greatly to the efficiency of the british navy because the man was very well or at any rate well enough in his way and in his manners and quite worth his wages but to see him train a gun and to call him first instructor captain bampfylde saw in twenty minutes that i could shoot this fine fellows head off unwilling as i was to give offence and delicate about priming and all the men felt at once the power of a practised hand set over them i saw that the navy had fallen back very much in the matter of gunnery in the time of the twenty years or so since i had been guncaptain and it came into my head to show them many things forgotten the force of nature carried me into this my proper position and the more rapidly because it happened to occur to me that here was the very man pointed out as it were by the hand of providence for parson chowne to blow up next our captain had the very utmost confidence that could be in him and he stood on his legs with a breadth that spoke to the strength of his constitution a man of enduring gravity also his weight was such that the parson never could manage to blow him up with any powder as yet admitted into the royal dockyards i liked this man and i let him know it but i thought it better for him to serve his country on shore a little after being so long afloat if as i put it to his conscience he could keep from poaching and from firing stackyards or working dangerous ferries he told me that he had no temptation towards what i had mentioned but on the other hand felt inclined after so many years at sea to have a family of his own and a wife if found consistent this i assured him i could manage and in a few words did so asking for nothing more on his part than entire confidence my nature commanded this from him and we settled to exchange our duties in a pleasant manner i gave him introduction to the liveliest of the farmers daughters telling him what their names were and being overfull of money he paid me halfacrown apiece for thirteen girls to whom i gave him letters of commendation this was far too cheap with all of them handsomer than he had any right to and three of them only daughters and two with no more than grandmothers but i love to help a fellowsailor and thus i got rid of him for our captain had the utmost faith in this poor mans discretion and had thought before i said it of laying him up at narnton court to keep a general lookout because his eyes were failing i did not dare to offer more opinion than was asked for but it struck me that if parson chowne had been too clever for david llewellyn and made the place too hot for him he was not likely to be outwitted by naval instructor heaviside however i could not see much occasion for chowne to continue his plots any longer or even to keep watch on the house unless it were from jealousy of our captains visits as far as any one might fathom that unfathomable parson he had two principal ends in view the first was to get possession of miss carey and all her property by making her mrs chowne no the second which would help him towards the first was to keep up against poor captain drake the horrible charge of having killed those two children whose burial had been seen as before related and here i may mention what i had forgotten through entire want of vindictive feelingto wit that i had as a matter of duty contrived to thrash very heavily both of those fellows on braunton burrows who had been spying on narnton court and committed such outrages against me without doing this i could not have left the county conscientiously and now on board the alcestis a rattling fine frigate of guns it gave me no small pleasure to find that although the gunnerypractice was not so good as i was accustomed to in seamanship and discipline and general smartness there was little to be reasonably complained of especially when it was borne in mind what our special duty was and why we were kept in commission when so many other ships were paid off at the conclusion of the war up to that time the alcestis had orders to cruise off the western coasts not only on account of some french privateers which had made mischief with our shipping but also as a draftship for receiving and training batches of young hands who were transferred as occasion offered to halifax or the west indies station and now as the need for new forces ceased captain drake was beginning to expect orders for spithead to discharge instead of that however the admiralty had determined to employ this ship which had done so much in the way of education for the more thorough settlement of a question upon which they differed from the general opinion of the navy and especially of the ordnance board this was concerning the value of a new kind of artillery invented by a clever scotchman and called a carronade because it was cast at certain ironworks on the banks of the river carron this gun is now so thoroughly well known and approved and has done so much to help us to our recent triumphs that i need not stop to describe it although at first it greatly puzzled me it was so short and light and handy and of such large caliber moreover with a great chamber for the powder such as a mortar has that at first it quite upset me knowing that i must appear familiar yet not being so however i kept in the background and nodded and shook my head so that every one misunderstood me differently that night i arose and studied it and resolved to back it up because only captain drake was in its favour and the firstlieutenant heaviside was against it strongly although he said that six months ago the rainbow an old being refitted with nothing else but carronades of large caliber had created such terror in a french ship of almost equal force that she fired a broadside of honour and then surrendered to the rainbow but to come back to our alcestis at the time i was promoted to first place in gunnery over and above her proper armament of long guns eighteen and twelve pounders she carried on the quarterdeck six pounder carronades and two of in the forecastle so that in truth she had fiftytwo guns and was a match in weight of metal for a french ship of sixty guns as at that time fitted afterwards it was otherwise and their artillery outweighed ours as much as a true briton outweighs them now naval instructor mr llewellyn had such a busy time of it and was found so indispensable on board the alcestis that i do assure you they could not spare him for even a glimpse of old newtonnottage until the beginning of the month of may but as i always find that people become loose in their sense of duty unless girt up well with money even as the ancients used to carry their cash in their girdles i had taken advantage of a run ashore at pembroke to send our excellent parson lougher a letter containing a l note as well as a few words about my present position authority and estimation i trusted to him as a gentleman not to speak of those last matters to any untrustworthy person whatever because there would be six months pension falling due to me at swansea at the very time of writing and which of course i meant to have for my zeal in overlooking my wound could not replace me unwounded i trow but knowing our government to be thoroughly versed in every form of stinginess and peculation which was sure to be doubled now a fox was in i thought that they might even have the dishonesty to deny me my paltry pittance on account of ancient merit and great valour upon the shabby plea that now i was on full pay again they would have done so i do believe if their own clumsy and careless ways had allowed them to get scent of it but they do things so stupidly that a clever man need never allow them to commit roguery upon him and by means of discreet action i was enabled for fourteen years to draw the pension i had won so nobly as well as the pay i was earning so grandly however these are trifles the l note was for mother jones to help our bunny with springclothes and to lay out at her discretion for my grandchilds benefit supposing as i must needs suppose that churchwarden morgan in face of his promise would refuse indignantly to accept a farthing for the childs nourishment he disappointed me however by accepting four pound ten and mrs jones was quite upset for even bunny never could have eaten that much in the time charles was a worthy man enough as undertakers always are but it was said that he could not do according to his lights when fancy brought his wife across them poor mother jones was so put out that she quite forgot what she was doing until she had spent the ten shillings of change in drawers for her middle children and so poor bunny got nothing at all nor even did poorer bardie for this little dear i had begged to be bought for the sake of her vast imagination nothing less than a twoshilling doll jointed both at knee and elbow as the dutchmen turn them out it was to be naked like parson chownes folk but with the girls at the well stirred up to make it more becoming and then mother jones was to go to sker and in my name present it all things fail unless a man himself goes and looks after them and so my l note did and when i was able to follow it complaint was too late as usual but you should have seen the village on the day when our captain drakeas we delighted to call himfound himself for the first time able to carry out his old promise to me made beneath the very eyes of his truelove isabel the thought of this had long been chafing in between his sense of honour and of duty set before him by the present naval board and but for his own deeper troubles though i did my best for ease he must have felt discomfort if i chose i could give many tokens of what he thought of me not expressed nor even hinted yet to my mind palpable but as long as our navy lasts no man will dare to intrude on his captain be it enough and it was enough that his majestys gun ship alcestis brought up as near as her draught allowed to porthcawl point on the th of may this was by no means my desire because it went against my nature to exhibit any grandeur and i felt in my heart the most warm desire that master alexander macraw might happen to be from home that day nothing could have grieved me more than for a man of that small nature to behold me stepping up in my handsome uniform with all the oars saluting me and the secondlieutenant in the sternsheets crying farewell mr david also officership marked upon every piece of my clothes in sight and the dignity of my bearing not behind any one of them but as my evil luck would have it there was poor sandy mac himself and more halfstarved than ever such is the largeness of my nature that i sank all memory of wrongs and upon his touching his hat to me i gave him an order for a turbot inasmuch as my clothes were now too good and my time too valuable to permit of my going fishing this however was nothing at all compared with what awaited me among the people at the well all newton was assembled there to welcome and congratulate me and most of them called me captain llewellyn and every one said i looked ten years younger in my handsome uniform i gave myself no airs whateverthat i leave for smaller menbut entered so heartily into the shaking of hands that if i had been a pump the well beneath us must have gone quite dry but all this time i was looking for bunny who was not among them and presently i saw short legs of a size and strength unparalleled except by one another coming at a mighty pace down the yellow slope of sand and scattering the geese on the small green patches mrs morgan had kept her to smarten upand really she was a credit to them so clean and bright and rosyfaced at first she was shy of my grand appearance but we very soon made that right now i will not enlarge upon or even hint at the honour done me for having done such honour to my native place because as yet i had done but little except putting that coat on to deserve it enough that i drew my salary for attending to the old church clock also my pension at swansea and was feasted and entertained and became for as long as could be expected the hero of the neighbourhood and i found that mother jones had kept my cottage in such order that after a day or two i was able to go to sker for the purpose of begging the favour of a visit from bardie but first as in duty bound of course i paid my respects to colonel lougher as luck would have it both the worthy colonel and lady bluett were gone from home but my old friend crumpy their honest butler kindly invited me in and gave me an excellent dinner in his own pantry because he did not consider it proper that an officer of the royal navy should dine with the maids in the kitchen however unpretending might be his behaviour and here while we were exchanging experience over a fine old cordial in bursts the honourable rodney without so much as knocking at the door upon seeing me his delight was such that i could forgive him anything and his admiration of my dress when i stood up and made the salute to him proved that he was born a sailor a fine young fellow he was as need be in his twelfth year now and come on a mitching expedition from the great grammarschool at cowbridge to drink his health both crumpy and myself had courage for another glass and when i began to tell seastories with all the emphasis and expression flowing out of my uniform he was so overpowered that he insisted on a hornpipe this although it might be now considered under dignity i could not refuse as a mark of respect for him and for the service and when i had executed as perhaps no other man can this loyal and inimitable dance his feelings were carried away so strongly that he offered all the money left him by a course of schoolwork and amounting to fourpencehalfpenny if i would only agree to smuggle him on board our alcestis when she should come to fetch me this of course i could not think of even for a hundred pounds and much as i longed for the boy to have the play of his inclination and in the presence of crumpy too who with all his goodwill to me would be sure to give evidence badly if his young master were carried away and under such love and obligation to the noble colonel i behaved as a man should do when having to deal with a boyish boy that is to say i told his guardians on the next opportunity but to break away at once from all these trifling matters only one day came to pass before i went for bardie all along the seacoast i was going very sadly half in hopes but more in fear because i had bad news of her what little they could tell at newton was that delushy was almost dead by means of a dreadful whoopingcough all throughout the winter and the small caliber of her throat and charles morgan had no more knowledge of my warm feeling thitherway than to show me that he had been keeping some boards of sawn and seasoned elm two feet six in length and in breadth ten inches from what he had heard about her health and the likelihood of her measurement when i heard this you might knock me down in spite of all my uniform with a tube of macaroni people have a foolish habit when a man comes home again of keeping all the bad news from him and pushing forward all the good if this had not been done to me i never could have slept a wink ere going to sker manor to me that old house always seemed even more desolate and forlorn with the summer sunshine on it than in the fogs and storms of winter perhaps from the bareness of the sandhills and the rocks and drystone walls showing more in the brightness and when woods and banks are fairest i looked in vain for a moving creature there seemed to be none for miles around except a sullen cormorant sleeping far away at sea only little dutch was howling in some lonely corner slowly as when her five young masters died as i approached the door in fear of being too late to say goodbye to my pretty little one yet trying to think how well it might be for her poor young life to flutter to some guardian angel my old enemy black evan stood and barred the way for me i doubt if he knew me at first sight and beyond any doubt at all i never should have known him if i had chanced to meet him elsewhere for i had not set eyes on his face from the day when he frightened us so at the inquest and in those ten months what a change from rugged strength to decrepitude you cannot see any one in this house he said very quietly and of course in welsh every one is very busy and in great trouble every one evan black i feel sorrow for you and have felt it through all your troubles take the hand of a man who has come with goodwill and to help you he put out his hand and its horn was gone i found it flabby cold and trembling a year ago he had been famous for crushing everything in his palm you cannot help us neither can any man born of a woman he answered with his black eyes big with tears it is the will of the lord to slay all whom he findeth dear to me is delushy dead i asked with a great sob rising in my throat like wadding rammed by an untaught man the little sweetheart is not yet dead but she cannot live beyond the day she lies panting with lips open what food has she taken for five days any one whose nature leads him to be moved by little things would have been distressed at seeing such a most unlucky creature finishing her tender days in that quiet childish manner among strangers tenderness in her weak defeated state with all her clever notions gone she lay with a piece of striped flannel round her the lips that used to prattle so now gasping for another breath and the little toes that danced so limp and frail and feebly twitching the tiny frame was too worn to cough and could only shudder faintly when the fit came through it yet i could see that the dear little eyes looked at me and tried to say to the wandering wits that it was old davy and the helpless tongue made effort to express that love of beauty which had ever seemed to be the ruling baby passion the crown and stripes upon my right arm were done in goldat my own expense for government only allowed yellow thread upon these her dim eyes fastened with a pleasure of surprise and though she could not manage it she tried to say how boofely chapter xlii the little maid and the midshipman in this sad predicament i looked from one to other of them hoping for some counsel there was moxy crying quite as if it were her own child almost and there was peggy the milkingmaid allowed to offer her opinion having had a child although not authorised to produce one also myself in uniform and black evan coming up softly with a newlydiscovered walk and yet not one had a word to say except poor little dear sometimes and sometimes we must trust in god i tell you i cried that never does and i never knew good come of it a mans first place is to trust to himself and to pray to the lord to help him have you nothing more to say here be all her little things black evan whispered to his wife put them ready to go with her his two great hands were full of little odds and ends which she had gathered in her lonely play along the beach and on the sandhills is that all that you can do watkin could do more than that and now where is young watkin they assured me there was no more to do they were tired of trying everything as for watkin he it was who had brought the malady into the house and now they had sent him for change of air to an uncle he had at llynvi concerning delushy there was nothing for her to do but to die and to go to heaven she shant die i tell you i cried out strongly you are a set of hopeless ones twice have i saved her life before when i was only a fisherman i am a man in authority now and please god i am just in time to save her life once more my friends do you give her up you stupids they plainly thought that i was gone mad by reason of my rise in life and tenfold sure of it they were when i called for a gown of red pembrokeshire flannel belonging to moxy for ten years now however poor moxy herself went for it and i took the child out of her stuffy bed and the hot close room containing it and bore her gently in my arms with the red flannel round her and was shocked to find how light she was down the great staircase i took her and then feeling her breath still going and even a stir of her toes as if the life was coming back to her what did i do but go out of doors into the bright may sunshine i held her uncommon and clearlyshaped face on my bosom to front the sunlight and her long eyelashes lifted and her small breast gave three sighs goodbye all of you i cried she comes away with me this minute peggy may come if she likes with half a sheep on her back tomorrow and so she did and i could not give her less than halfacrown for it because of the difference and the grace of god to darling bardie in my arms the whole way home she lay like a newborn lamb almost with her breath overcome at first and heavily drawn while her eyes were waking then as the air of the open heaven found its way to her wornout lungs down her quiet eyelids dropped with a sleepy sense of happiness and her weak lips dreamed of smiling and her infant breast began to rise and fall quite steadily and so she fell into a great deep sleep and so i took her to my home and the air of newton saved her our bunny was very good there could hardly have been any better child when her victuals were not invaded she entered into bardies condition and took quite a motherly attitude towards her and while the tiny one lay so weak bunny felt that the lead of mind was hers for the present and might be established by a vigorous policy however in this point she was wrong or at any rate failed to work it out in a fortnight bardie was mistress again and poor bunny had to trot after her now although it was very pleasant to see the thankfulness of black evan when he came over every day and brought his pockets full of things and tried to look pleased when truthful bardie refused downright to kiss him pleasant also for me to be begged not only to fish but even to shootperhaps because now the wrong time of yearin and over and through a place where the mere sight of my hat had been sure to lead to a black eye under it in despite of all these pleasures i perceived that business must be thoroughly attended to and taking this view i was strengthened in my own opinions by the concurrence of every neighbour possessing a particle of sense not only mother joneswho might be hard from so much familybut also the landlord of the jolly quite agreed with the landlady and even crumpy a man of the utmost tenderness ever known almost and who must admire children because he never yet had owned anyall these authorities agreed that i must take care what i was about for my part finding their opinions go beyond my own almost or at any rate take a form of words different from my own and having no assurance how it might end i felt inclined to go back and give fairplay to both sides of the argument but as often happens when a man desires to see the right and act strictly up to it the whole affair was interrupted and my attention called away by another important matter and the duties springing out of it and this came to pass in the following manner it happened upon oakapple morning that i was down on a little sandhill smoking a pipe and with both children building houses upon my pumps these pumps had lovely buckles of the very latest regulation and it was a pleasure to regard them when at leisure and reflect upon their quality as well as signification the children however took this matter from another point of view and there was scarcely anything to their little minds more delightful than to obscure my pumps with sand and put up a tower over them and then if i moved down came the whole and instead of themselves they laughed at me i had worked very hard in the alcestis and for almost a week after landing found it a most delicious thing because so incomprehensible to have nothing whatever to do but long before now i was tired of it and yearned to put on my old slops again and have a long day of fishing as if bunnys life and mine hung on it and when i gave a feast of turbot caught by that excellent sandy macraw and paid for at just what he chose to charge you would not have guessed it but such were my feelings that i only could make believe to eat and sandy himself by special desire took the foot of the table and went largely into everything but behaved uncommonly well for him now this is just the way i keep on going out of the proper track if i could not train a gun much straighter than i can tell a story france would have conquered england i believe in spite of nelson it is the excess of windage coming down to me from great bards which prevents my shot from flying pointblank as it ought to do nevertheless the village children loved my style especially since his majesty had embellished me and this was why i shunned the well and sate among the sandhills for really it was too hard to be expected to have in throat a new story never heard before every time a little pitcher came on the head of a little maid to be filled and then to go off again bardie and bunny knew better than that and never came for stories till the proper timethe twilight now as i was longing much to sacrifice all dignity and throw off goldlace and bluecloth and verily go at the congers which i did the next day and defied the parish to think what it chose of me i beheld a pair of horses with a carriage after them coming in a lively manner towards my nest of refuge it is useless now i cried aloud i can hope for no more peace everybody knows me or believes it right to know me nevertheless on the whole i felt pleased when i saw that the harness was very bright and the runninggear knopped with silver and my amazement was what you may enter into when really the driver proved to be no bigger than that little master rodney bluett he had the proper coachman by his side for fear of accidents but to me who had seen so much of horses now in devonshire it appeared a most rash thing to allow such a boy to navigate however having caught me thus he jumped out without accident while the coachman touched his hat to me or to his majesty as now represented by me then that noble boyas he ought no doubt to be entitled being the son of a nobleman although in common parlance styled an honourable boy which to my mind is no more than a simple contradictionup he ran with his usual haste expecting to find only bunny and me but his astonishment was worth seeing on account of his being such a fair young chap when suddenly he beheld poor bardie standing weakly on her legs not quite reestablished yet and in her shy manner of inner doctrine taking observation of him a more freeandeasy schoolboy there could scarcely be than rodney and as for our bunny he used to toss her until her weight overpowered him but with this little lady looking so pale and drawn and delicate he knew as if by instinct that he must begin very gingerly captain llewellyn he said i am come to tell you that my mind is quite made up i mean to go to sea as soon as i can have my clothes made but young sir i answered with a wish to humour this fine boy yet a desire to escape the noble colonels anger it is useless now to go to sea there is no war we must wait and trust the lord to send one and how shall i be fit to manage a ship and fight our enemies unless i begin at once and practise captain llewellyn in this there was so much truth as well as sense of discipline moreover such fine power of hope for another good bout at the french that i looked at my pocketlappets for an answer and found none i can stand a great deal he cried on account of my age and so on but i cant stand latin and greek and i cannot stand being put off always i know what they want me to do they want me to grow too old for the navy and i do believe they will manage it i am getting twelve every day almost and i can pull a pair of oars and fire a cannon nine inches long and sail a boat if it doesnt blow for all that i can answer sir my words were being proud of him and you know who taught you this and that and you know that he always did impress upon your early mind the necessity of stern discipline and obedience to superiors your first duty is to your king and country in the glorious time of war but with a wretched peace prevailing your duty is to the powers placed by providence to look after you i have heard that till i am sick of it he answered rather rudely for i seemed to myself to have put it well is that all you can do for me i had better not have come at all look i have five guineas here given me yesterday and all good ones i will put them just in thereand my word of honour my boy if it were fifty five hundred or five thousand would an officer of the royal navy think of listening to them you have hurt my sense of honour i beg your pardon captain llewellyn he said hanging down his head but you used not to be quite so proud you used to like five shillings even that is neither here nor there i answered very loftily and increasing his confusion five shillings honourably earned no man need be ashamed of but what you have offered me is a bribe for the low purpose of cheating your good uncle and dear mother you ought to sink into the sand sir he seemed pretty nearly fit to do so for i put a stern face on though all the time i could hardly keep from laughing most goodnaturedly when a little hand went into his and a little face defied me poor sick bardie had watched every word and though unable to understand she took hot sides with the weaker one e sant sink into e sand i tell a e yicked bad old davy hots a done to be colded so is very angy with a indeed to go on so to a gentleyum by what instinct could she tell that this was a young gentleman by the same i suppose by which he knew that she was a young lady and each of them ready to stand up for the other immediately it made me laugh and yet it is a sad thing to go into now my boy i began for fear of losing the upper hand of them you are old enough to understand good sense when put before you it is true enough that if you mean to walk the planks like a sailor you can hardly begin too soon at the time of life you are come to i was afloat at half your age so far as i can remember but i am bound to lay before you two very serious questions you will have to meet and never escape from every kind of dirt and hardship narrowness and halfstarvingnot an atom of comfort left such as you are accustomed to danger i will not speak of because it would only lead you on to it but the other thing is this by going to sea you will for ever grieve and drive out of your prospects not only your good uncle but perhaps almost your mother i thought i had made a most excellent speech and bardie looked up with admiration to know when i meant to finish but to my surprise young rodney took very little heed of it that shows how much you know old davy why i was come on purpose to tell you that they are tired out at last and that i may go to sea if only you will appoint me a place on board of your ship alcestis now do captain llewellyn do and i will never forget it to you if ever i become a great man my dear boy i would do it this minute if i had the power but though they call me captain here i am only captain of a gun and instructor of artillery and even our captain himself could not do it he could only take you as a volunteer and now there is no call for them you must get your appointment as midshipman in the regular way from london and the chances are fifty to one against your joining the alcestis that is to say of course unless you have some special interest his countenance fell to the lowest ebb and great tears stood in his bold blue eyes but presently the hopeful spirit of youth and brave lineage returned i will write to my brother in london he said he has never done me a good turn yet perhaps he will begin this time not to be too long about it either by that or some other influence he obtained his hearts desire and was appointed midshipman with orders to join the alcestis upon her next appearance off our coast you should have seen the fuss he made and his mother too about his outfit and even colonel lougher could not help being much excited as for me i was forced to go to and fro betwixt newton and candleston court every day and twice aday for the purpose of delivering judgment upon every box that came but when master rodney made me toss his spellingbooks and grammar at his breast to practise parrying with his little dirk i begged him to let me take them home as soon as he was tired i have them now with his little stabs in them and they make me almost independent of the schoolmaster in writing not only was i treated so that i need not have bought any food at allexcept for bardie and bunnybut also employed at a pleasant price to deliver lessons every morning as to the names of sails and ropes and the proper style of handling them we used to walk down to the hard seashore with a couple of sharp sticks whenever the tide allowed fair drawingroom and the two little children enjoyed it almost as much as the rising hero did the difficulty was to keep the village children who paid nothing from taking the benefit of my lecture as much as midshipman bluett did and they might have done so if they cared to do it for i like a good large audience but they always went into playing hopscotch in among my ropes and yards when all done beautifully in fine sand and ready to begin almostfor the proper way is to have a ship spread naked first and then hoist sail if you want to show its meaning i could not bear to be hard upon these young onesand some of them good mother joness ownall in a mess of activity and i tried to think that it was all right because money was earning anyhow but i could not reconcile it with my sense of duty to make a game of wellpaid work therefore i kept the children out in a manner i need not now describe only you may rely upon it for real ingenuity for children are worse to manage than folk who have been through having them chapter xliii a fine price for bardie now our own two little darlings had behaved so beautifully gazing at the bad works of the others from a distance only though sadly pushed to share in them and keeping their little garters up when the others were hopscotching also feeling and pointing out and almost exaggerating the ruin wrought by the other small ones which they durst not come down to help that i determined to give them both a magnificent sunday dinner i would gladly have had the young midshipman downfor on sunday he was such an ornament as good as the best churchwindowbut now our time was almost up and though his mother would have let him come to grace my humble cottage the colonel insisted that he must go to take farewell of some excellent aunts from whom he had large expectations and who had ordered him up for the sunday to the neighbourhood of cardiff however we could get on very well with our own aristocracy only which i was sure poor bardie was though without any aunts to dine her and it only made me the more determined to have a family party fed on good fare we envied nobody as we sate down and the little ones put up both hands according to some ancient teaching for the first course we had conger baked a most nourishing excellent dish full of jelly and things for children and this one was stuffed like a loaded cannon with meatballs pork fat and carraways bunny went at him as if she had never secured such a chance in her life before but bardie seemed inclined to wait for what was coming afterwards and spent the time in watching bunny with admiration and contempt mixed as they are on a childs face only then i brought in the dish of the day with bunny skipping and going about and scorching her fingers to help me but bardie having gone into her grandeur sitting at table steadfastly and with a resolute mind to know what it was before approval she had the most delicate nostrils but what i brought made her open them because i had the very best half of the very best ham ever cured in our parish through a whole series of goodluck luck and skill and the will of the lord must all combine for a firstrate ham and here they were met and no mistake both by one another and by excellent cooking afterwards it would not become me to say any more when it comes to my mind that the delicate gold of infant cabbage by side of it was also of my own planting in a bit of black mould in a choice niche ere bethel jose had tempted me in spite of all this wonderful cheer and the little ones going on famously the sight of that young cabbage struck a vein of sorrow in me somewhere to go away and leave my house and garden for whole years perhaps and feel that it was all behind me in neglect and loneliness with no one to undo the windows or to sow a row of peas or even dib a cabbage in and perhaps myself to find no chance of coming back to it and none to feel the difference like a knife all this went through me so that i must look upward quite for fear of the little ones watching me those two little creatures ate with a power and a heartiness enough to make anybody rejoice in the harmless glory of feeding them after the very first taste they never stopped to wipe their lips or to consider anything but dealt with what they had won and felt and thoroughly entered into it only every now and then they could not help admiring what i take to be the surest proof of a fine ham and good cookery that is to say bright stripes of scarlet in between fat of a clear french white not unlike our streaky jaspers interlaid with agate to see that little thing who scarce could lift a finger three weeks ago now playing so brisk a knife and fork filled me with gratitude and joy so that i made up my mind to finish my dinner from the conger and keep the rest of the ham for her i gave the little souls their wineas they called itof gooseberrywater a good eggcup full apiece and away they went like two little women into the garden to play with it and see who would keep it the longest then i put the rest of the ham in the cupboard and returning to the conger began to enjoy the carvers privilege of ten minutes for his own fork but just as i had done handsomely well and was now preparing to think about a pipe of fine navy tobacco and a small nip of old rum and water suddenly my door was darkened and there stood the very last man save one whom for my comfort and calm sabbath feeling i could ever have wished to see peace be to this house he began with his hands spread out and his eyes turned up but his nostrils taking sniff of things peace be to this humble home and the perishing flesh contained in it brother davy is it well with thee brother hezekiah said i perceiving what he was up to no flesh does this house contain for that it is too humble but in the name of the lord right welcome art thou to cold conger brother i pray thee arise and eat and go forty days hence on the strength of it it hath been done replied hezekiah by divine grace and unceasing prayer but come old chap i am sure you have got something better in that cupboard stinking fish hast thou often sold me and lo i have striven to like it therefore give me good meat now and let us rejoice at thy great doings this speech was so full of truth that it got the upper hand of me both by the sense of compunction and the strength of hospitality and i could no longer deny to perkins all that remained of poor bardies ham i have expounded the word of the lord i have been as lot in your little zoar he cried going on for the third help of ham my spirit was mighty within me david and hepzibah took up the wondrous tale backsliding brother where hast thou been there is a movement and revival set afoot from my burning words and hepzibahs prophecies such as shall make your rotten old church have a drop of beer i said for i did not like to see him shake his fist at our churchtower well i dont mind if i do he answered now i come to think of it everything in its season brother and a drop of your old rum afterwards i pretended not to hear this last for though i might stand him in twopenny ale i saw no reason for spoiling the tops of a bottle or two that i scorned to open even when my rheumatics had leapt from my double halfribs to my eardrops so after observing that things were locked up i ran into the jolly and fetched a pint of small ale very rapidly not expecting me back so soon he had made a good round with his knife in his hand to see what might be hoped for now back he came with a groan and said that he knew not what he was fit for when the power of the word came upon him he had such spasms afterwards i never love to be in company with a man of this sort when my time is come for thanking god for a fine dinner i would rather be alongside of a simple man and a stupid one who can sit and think with me and say no more about it he knew my feelings i do believe and enjoyed them like pickles with his meat and after finishing every morsel even down to the mark of the saw upon the very knuck of it up he put his tallowy thumbs with the black nails outwards and drew a long breath and delivered in the name of the lord amen and now brother david rejoice a little as behoves a christian man upon the blessed sabbathday hezekiah i have rejoiced to behold your joy in feeding and to minister thereto now having fruition of fleshly things take the word of the lord oh my brother and expound doctrinally though it be but a score of chapters i will smoke and hearken thee strong meat is not for babes my son and a babe art thou old dyo chaps like you must wait and watch for the times of edification there is a time for sowing and there is a time for reaping small ale is not meat for such as bear the burden of the day kiah the smith i asked very shortly what is it you would have of me brother davy i have offered a blessing on thy fleshpots and good they were though not manifold it is comely that i should offer another blessing on thy vessels davy what could i do with such a man in my own house brother hezekiah became at my expense most hospitable i found no escape from my own bottle without being rude to my visitors glass and yet i enjoyed not a single drop for want of real companionship for all my wits were up in arms as if against parson chowne almost because i knew that master perkins wanted to make a fool of me so i feigned to be halfseasover that he might think he had done it ancient friend he began at last when he thought that i was ripe for it thou hast lifted me above the height of edification peradventure i say words that savour not of wisdom beloved brother the fault is thine here i am and there you are how can any man having a smithy of his own go on so an thou wert not tipsy kiah thou couldst see the contrary i am here and thou art there just so you have put it wonderfully he answered after thinking we may both say right is right which is the end of everything keziah said to me go seek where he is and how he is because i have seen noble visions of his exaltation and yet you see exalted brother scarce the tenth part came to her she knows what she is about said i she dreamed of a redhot cradle and the hoof of satan rocking me now i see the whole of it it was parson chowne and the ferryboat and the ketch i was all but burned in perkins tell me more my friend i have groaned much for neglecting the warning of the prophetess how many men have groaned in vain for that same cause old dyo vainglorious males they doubt her gift because she is a female out of the mouths of babes and womenbrother i forget the passage but it comes to that i think and now she hath been again in trouble concerning what old hezekiah as concerning what i pray thee even touching the child delushy in the godless house of sker in a holy trance it hath been vouchsafed her to behold that poor kid of the flock bearing in her mouth a paper whereupon in letters of blood was written come over and help us and we have found a way to help her with thy faithful testimony in his crafty sheepseyed manner made of crawling piety mixed with sharp and spiteful worldliness he began to feel my soundings towards a scheme so low and infamous that my blood within me boiled for being forced to bear with him he had prepared the whole plot well and what it came to was just this inland there lived a wealthy smelter of the methodist tribe and hezekiah was deep in his books for long supply of material rees ap rees was his name and he longed as every year he grew older to make up for an ancient wrong which was coming home to him in the early days when he was poor and clever and ambitious he had ousted his elder brother from his fathers hearth and banished him this poor fellow fled to the colonies and for many years no token and no news came home of him meanwhile rees ap rees was growing elderly and worn out with money which is a frightful thing to feel but about a year ago a halfcast sailor had come to his house bringing a wretched deathscrawl from this supplanted but never yet forgotten and only brother there were not a dozen lines but they told a tale that made the rich man weep and eat dry bread for days and days his brother having been born without the art of getting on at all was dying for want of food and comfort having spent his last penny to keep the mouths of his two little babes at work these poor children had lost their mother and were losing their father now who with his last breath almost forgetting wrongs as we do in death very humbly committed them to the charge of his rich brother and he said that his only remaining friend captain of the nova scotia had promised to deliver them safe in bristol to be sent for the dying father had no strength to speak of their names or age or any other particulars now it so happened that rees ap rees was dearly fond of children as all rich childless people are on account of being denied them and since his wife died he had often thought of adopting some one but being rich he was fidgety now and none of the children in his neighbourhood ever blew their noses so here he found as it were from heaven two little dears coming down upon him his next of kin and right heirs and also enabling him to go to his parish churchyard with a sense of duty done although preferring to rest elsewhere if by law allowable you may suppose how he waited and watched but those two little dears never came upon that he longed for them so much more that he offered a reward of l for any tidings of them and of l for both or either brought to his house in safety hence it will be clear enough what hezekiahs scheme was and half the reward was to be my own all thou hast to say good dyo is what thou saidest at the very time that the ship was not called andalusia but to the best of thy belief was more like nova scotia also that she was bound for bristol and that the other babys clothes bore no coronet as they fancied but the letter r done fancifully as might be by a freemason such as the poor father was said to be that garment must be destroyed of course i have one prepared for the child delushy with martha ap rees in faint writing upon it this the old man must find out for himself after our overlooking it he will then believe it tenfold and after the sight of thy uniform dyoha how sayest thou old friend a snug little sum to invest for old age thou knowest the old saying scurvy in the navy but the navys self more scurvy when thou art discharged with three halfpence aday one hundred pound with accumulations say l then will help to buy sulphur for thy rheumatics myself will give thee ten per cent for it upon sound security it sounds very well said i to lead him one hundred and fifty pounds have a fine sound not only that my noble boy but the hold thou wilt have on a rich young maiden such as martha ap rees will be the old fellow cant last very long none of those smelters ever do and he hath heartdisease as well little martha will come into l or more and every penny of it hanging upon thee and me my lad is it well devised is it grand my boy is it worthy of old kiah that it is i cried most worthy he flourished his glass in the pride of his heart and even began to sing a song with a chorus of spankadilloes forgetting whose holy day it was unfortunately i did the same for my nature can never resist a song moreover i wanted to think a little not from any desire to dwell for a moment on my own interest but from the great temptation to make the fortunes of our poor castaway but while i was nursing my left knee with the foot giving time for another chorus which was just beginning i heard a tiny pipe and turned round and there was the little thing herself dancing on one foot and jerking the other in mockery of my attitude nodding her head to keep time as well and for her very life singing out pankydillo dillo dillo while bunny peeping round the doorpost with a power of sabbath feeling looked as if the world were ending it was clear that bardie had not seen perkins whom she never could endure else would she not have run in from the garden to bear a share in our melody and that good brother was so full of his noble scheme and his song and my rum that he never noticed her baby voice and her quick light figure was out of his sight from the corner of his boozing therefore i managed to get her away and send her for a good walk with bunny to look for watercress at bruwys well for i thought it wiser to keep that perkins ignorant of her whereabouts and bunny could be trusted now to see to any one anywhere off went the heavy one very gravely and the light one full of antics even in front of the cottages singing pankydillo which hit her fancy so that i feared some disrepute at such a thing going forth from our house upon a sabbath evening i tried to frown but she made me laugh by turning round and clapping her knee exactly as she had seen me do and it seemed the best thing to go back out of sight ere neighbours got the key to it little she guessed that the fate of her life was dancing in the balance and that her own lightsome play had turned it whether for good or evil how could i let such a spring of life such a mischievous innocence and thoroughly earnest devotion to play sink and be quenched by a formal old methodist in the iron district sker house was dull enough for dry bones but there at least she had the sands and sea and shells and rabbits and wildfowl nor any one to terrify her with religious terrorswhich to the young are worst of allunless it were a ghost or two of wicked abbots repenting whereas i knew what an old compunctious methodist is who has made some money and devotes his last years to the service of jehovah even l could not make it up to her therefore i shook master perkins up for he really had been a little too free and was going to sleep with his spectacles stuck for a corkscrew into another bottle and i made him understand that his plan was a great deal too crooked for me and that the sooner he went to seek hepzibah who was prophesying on a stool for pickling pork down at betsy matthews and to prepare for his midnight service with a strong revival rising the better chance he would have of escaping my now rapidlygrowing desire to afford him total immersion which is the only salvation of one highly respectable lot of them in the well of john the baptist hezekiah dreaded water so much that this hint was enough for him and off he set in a tipsy shamble to lie down on the sandhills ere he came face to face with the prophetess when i had put things a little aright and brushed up the hearth to a bit of fire to warm the milk for the little ones and by opening doors and windows sweetened all the place with summer flowing in and nestling round the relics of the sunset and when the neighbours chairs whereon the very old men had been sitting for their sunday evening creaked as if carried in and dusted for another sunday and there was not one child left except a bad child by the well whose loose mind was astray with stars and took no heed of suppertime then the two best children in the village neighbourhood or county handinhand came to my door they were wonderfully silent and they stole each in her own manner just a little glimpse at me to feel how my temper lay then they looked at one another to exchange opinions on that allimportant matter they knew they had been out too late and had frightened granny a little perhaps and therefore now had angered him and in their simple way they thought it wiser not to broach the question i meant to scold them but could not find it when i beheld their pretty ways within my power to do so and lucky for them that i did not know until next day when too late to scold what a dreadful mess their clothes were in in that light i could only see their pretty faces glowing and their bright eyes full of doubt and their little bodies shrinking back also bundles of watercress put forward to mitigate righteous wrath i felt that i had been having my spree and these small creatures had only had theirs so i kissed them both and gave them good supper and blessed them into their little bed chapter xliv provides for education having before me several years of absence from home if it should please the lord so long to spare me i now took measures for the welfare of those who would chiefly miss me the little cottage was my own from many generations and in a new will made by a clever man no less than our new schoolmaster i left it to bunny and all my effects except my boat and the sum of ten guineas which two items as honour demanded were for miss delushy but what is wealth without education no more than a plummet without the line knowing this i provided as follows a thoroughly fine new schoolmaster had arisen as aforesaid for the purpose of educating all our newton children our good parson had brought him in not because the old one being challenged by the village tailor to spell the word horse without the picture proved his command of the alphabet by accomplishing it in nine different ways all wrong for that was entered to his credit when the tailor failed to do the like but because he horsed a boy and left him there for the afternoon having fallen asleep without thrashing him and it shows what the public confusion of mind is that there were not three people in all the parish who could help jumbling these stories together because each of them had a horse in it however the poor old man had to go and colonel lougher having nothing to do with the spelling of the children thought it so hard on his brothers part that he made the old man his head gardener so as to double his wages and enable him to sleep not half but the whole of the afternoon his successor in the school had been sought out very diligently and he could spell almost as well as bardie could pronounce a word but when we found that he came from a distance more than a quick man could walk in a day and that he could not through all his forefathers although they were quite at his fingerends claim so much even as intermarriage with any of our thirdrate families much less with any llewellyns or hopkins or bevans or even thomases we saw that even parson lougher had gone a little too far for us and not a woman in the place would let a bedroom to that man however we could not bolt him out of his own schoolroom and there he slept contented with a pile of slates for bedstead and of copybooks for bolster and for pillow for a week at least he had no school but he went to church and sang beautifully which brought half the women over and the children began to be such a plague at home before monday morning that eight or nine were sent back to school as if with halters round their necks with these he took so much kind trouble that in three hours they learned more than the parish had learned for a generation so much that they could not keep it down when they went home for dinner in the afternoon there were twenty pupils and by the end of the week three dozen but how could they prove him to their parents qualified for a bedroom upon the strength of my present position and unrivalled experience i found it my duty to come to the fore and take the command of the householders and knowing of course what a waste of time it is to reason with anybody i seized the bull by the horns and offered master roger berkrolles the occupancy of my cottage upon most liberal conditions that is to say for rent per quarter one seasnail and per annum one cockleshell to preserve the title provided nevertheless and upon this express condition that my lawful granddaughter bunny should be fed alimented sufficiently nourished clothed clad apparelled and in garments found also taught instructed indoctrined educated and perfected in every branch of useful knowledge by the said roger berkrolles item that if a certain child of tender years known as delushy should at any time appear on the premises and demand instruction instruction of the highest order and three slices of breadandbutter should be imparted to her without charge de die in diem i objected to these dies as being of a nasty churchyard sound but master roger convinced me soon and must have convinced a far tougher fellow that to put our latter end out of sight and out of mind so is a bad example and discouragement for the young ones whose place it is to dwell on it a man of far coarser tone of mind than mine would be required to describe master rogers sense of gratitude towards me when i do a handsome thing i cannot bear to tell of it nor even to receive the praise accruing from what neighbours know do it and be done with it in all such cases is my rule and if roger chose to give me an inventory of goods and chattels he can bear me out in saying that i scorned to call a witness in to put his name to it business is not my strong point and it never is with a man of largeness the next thing for me to see to was to get some wicked warrants quashed which a deep ignorance of my character and the lies of very low villains had induced some weak or vicious magistrates to issue so that in the sporting season when i might have done my best i was forced to decamp with my telescope this has been mentioned perhaps before but not my strong resolution to face it out as soon as ever the sense of a strong position enabled me no doubt they had meant to do their duty and i forgave them altogether there were three of them two names i quite forget how can one think of such trifles at sea but the third was one master anthony stew who had tyrannised over me dreadfully in the times of my tribulation up to this mans gate i went and rang the great bell with my three stripes on and a cap of fronted tapestry squire anthony was about somewhere on the premises would my honour mind waiting while the boy went round to look for him this maid never guessed how often she had told me my fish was bad and what a shame it was to make them eat it up in the kitchen or starve and where did i hope to go to neither did she recollect how she had as good as made me kiss her behind the meatscreen when my glory began to grow for saving those drowned niggers and yet i could not be sure that she did not know it all and hide it all for the joy of boasting afterwards i understand everything except women when i was shown into the drawingroom and mrs stew with a curtsy went out as if afraid to trust herself in a presence so imposing i had a great mind to take a nip at some of the rubbish upon the table the whole of these nicknacks could never have paid me half what this fellow had cost me in fines expenses costs and so on without a bit of evidence from any man of character however i only looked at them when that low anthony stew came in he knew me before i could speak almost he gave a quick glance at the table and then without another word showed me out in spite of all my uniform to his dirty little justiceroom with such a man i should think it wrong to go into his ribaldry only he said this at last davy thou thief we will withdraw them because we cannot execute them now thou art in royal service five there are if i remember does your conscience plead to more my conscience pleads to none your worship perjured scoundrels all of them five was the number i do believe alas what may we come to the gallows dyo the gallows thou rogue thou hast had some shavings but when thy turn comes good dyo i will do thee a good turn if i can will your worship tell me why i never looked for anything but the flintedge from your worship because thou art the only rogue i never was a match for there go thy way now go thy way or i shall be asking thee to dinner nay your worship god forbid what food have i had since breakfasttime and so i won the last word of him after this provision for my good repute and defiance of magisterial scandal on behalf of bunny my next act was one of pure generosity towards an ancient enemy poor sandy macraw had a very hard fight to maintain himself and his numerous and still increasing family sometimes they did not taste so much as a rind of bacon for months together but lived on barleybread and dogfish or such stuff as he could not sell with oatmeal cakes for a noble treat every other sunday what did i do but impart to him under document drawn by berkrolles that licence to fish off and on sker point which my courage had well established with authority to him and covenant by him to attack and scare all poachers the whole to be void upon my return if so i should think proper and not only this but i put him in funds to replace all his tackle by enabling him to sell his boat for i went so far as to lease him my own at a moderate yearly rental upon condition that he should keep her in thorough repair and as good as new and for the further validity as the lease said of this agreement two years rent became due at once and was paid from the price of the other boat my boat went twice as fast as sandys and was far more handy so that this bargain was fair and generous and did honour to all concerned the next and last thing before starting was to provide for poor bardie herself for i feared that hezekiah or some other unprincipled fellow might trump up a case and get hold of her and sell or by other means turn into money my little pet to the loss of my rights and perhaps her own undoing resolved as i was to stop all chances of villany of that kind i went direct to colonel lougher and to lady bluett here i made the cleanest breast that ever was scooped out almost i may declare that i kept in nothing except about painting the boat and one or two infinite trifles of that sort which it would have been a downright impertinence to dwell upon nevertheless colonel lougher said that some blame might attach to me in spite of all pure intentions but lady bluett said no no she would not hear of it for a moment the only thing that surprised her was llewellyns thorough unselfishness and chivalrous devotion to a child who was nothing to him she was a bewitching little dear no one who saw her could doubt that still it showed a very soft side to a wonderfully gallant character when through all modesty it appeared what womanly tenderness there had been and this proved how entirely right her opinion had been from the very first and what a mistake the good colonel had made in declining to let her even argue my dear eleanor my dear eleanor cried the colonel with his eyes wide open and his white hand spread to her i am surprised to hear you say so but we cannot go into that question now llewellyn begged for my opinion yours my dear as you have proved is of course more valuable still i thought that it was mine to be sure it was dear henry yours is what was asked for my rule is never to interrupt you but to listen silently to be sure eleanor to be sure and we always agree in the end my dear but so far as i can judge at present llewellyn although with the very best meaning and a display of the greatest valour come colonel even by his own account yes my dear great valour no doubt coupled with very sound discretion yet when i come to consider the whole i really do think that your hero might have entered more fully into these particulars about the boat of course he had no motive and it was simply an error of judgment henry there was no error at all what could he do when they would not even listen to him about the name of the ship if they would not listen about a ship is it likely they would listen about a boat and a very small atom of a boat the thing is too ridiculous perceiving a pause i made my bow for the very last thing i could desire would be to sow a controversy between the gentleman and lady whom of all the county i esteemed the most and loved the best and i knew that if i caused dissension in a pair so well united each would think the less of me when they came to make it up together moreover my object was attained their attention was drawn to the child again the colonel as the nearest magistrate was put in legal charge of her i was now quit of all concealment and lady bluett had promised to see to the poor things education if ever she should need any this i hoped with all my heart that she would do and quickly too and indeed she was growing at such a pace after that long illness also getting so wonderfully clever about almost everything and full of remarks that might never strike a grown man till he thought of them that the only way or chance i saw of taking the genius out of her was to begin her education forgetting just now a good deal of my own and being so full of artillery i got master berkrolles to make the first start and show her the way to the alphabet our bunny now could spell cat and dog and could make a good shot at some other words and enjoyed a laugh at children head and shoulders over her whenever they went amiss and she from the masters face was sure of it but bardie had never been to school for i thought it below her rank so much and now i contrived for our great schoolmaster to come to my cottage and there begin it must have made the very gravest man ever cut from a block of wood laugh to behold master roger and her he with his natural dignity and wellfounded sense of learning and continual craving for a perfect form of discipline yet unable to conceal his great wonder at her ways she on her side taking measure of him in a shy glance or two and letting her long eyelashes fall and crossing her feet with one shoulder towards him for him to begin with her he vowed that he never had such a pupil instead of learning she wanted to know the reason why of everything why had a two legs and a girdle while b had two stomachs and no leg at all c was the moon from the shape of it it was no good to tell her that c was the cat a cat had four legs and c had none and as for d being a dog she would fetch dear dutch if he would not believe her and show him what a dog was like and then perceiving how patient he was and understanding his goodness the poor little fatherless soul jumped up on his knee and demanded a play with him he did not know how to play very well because he was an ancient bachelor but entering into her sad luck from knowledge of her history he did the very best thing as i thought that ever had been done to her he put her on a stool between his knees and through the gloss of her hair he poured such very beautiful and true stories that one could almost see her mind like the bud of a primrose opening she pushed up her little hands and tossed her thick hair out of the hearing way and then being absorbed in some adventures like her own almost round she turned and laid her eyes upon his furrowed yet beaming face and her delicate elbows on his knees and drank in every word with sighs and short breath and a tear or two although from one point of view i did not like to be superseded so especially in my own department as might be said of storytelling yet i put small feelings away and all the jaundice of jealousy if i were bound to go wherever government might order me for the safety of our native land and with moderate pay accruing also with a high position and good hopes of raising it the least i could do was to thank the lord for sending those two poor children a man so wise and accomplished and kindhearted bound over to look after them and yet i would almost as lief have committed them into the hands of mother jones who could scarcely vie with me but they promised never to forget me and the night before i went away i carried bardie back to sker and saw that black evan was dying chapter xlv introduces a real hero my orders were to rejoin at pembroke on the th of june where the alcestis lay refitting and taking in stores for an oceancruise of course i was punctual to the day and carried with me a fine recruit master rodney bluett i received not only minute directions from his ladymother but also a tidy little salary to enable me to look after him this was a lady of noble spirit and ready to devote her son for the benefit of his country because there was no fighting now nor any war in prospect also colonel lougher came as far as the gate where the griffins are and patted his nephews curly head and said that although it was not quite as he himself could have wished it he could trust the boy to be an honour to a loyal family and to write home every now and then for the sake of his poor mother for his own sake also i think the colonel might have very truly said because while he was talking so and trying to insist on duty as the one thing needful i could not for a moment trust my own eyes to examine him so we all tried to say goodbye as if there was nothing in it it was a very long goodbye even longer than we could by any stretch have dreamed of two or three years was the utmost that we then looked forward to but i tell you simple truth in saying that not one of us had the chance of seeing england much less any part of wales for a shorter period than seven years and two months added you may doubt me and say pooh pooh that was your fault and so on but you would be wholly wrong and from the admiralty records our captain could prove it thoroughly and what is much clearer than all do you think that captain drake bampfylde would have been seven years or even seven days away without sight of his beautiful lady isabel carey if it could have been managed otherwise it was a mixture of bad luck i can explain a good deal of it but not all the ins and outs we were ordered here and ordered there and then sometimes receiving three contradictions of everything until we should scarcely have been surprised at receiving signal hms alcestis to the moon to wait for orders and if we had received that signal i believe we should have tried it being by this time the besttrained and finest ships company in the world we had ceased to be a receivingship as soon as the war was over and now were what they begin to callthough it sounds against the grain to mean experimental ship and the lord knows that we made experiments enough to drown or blow up or blow arms off every man borne on our blessed books they placed me at the head of it all until the others were up to it and a more uneasy or ticklish time i never have known before or since over and over again i expected to go up to the sky almost and you may pretty well conceive how frequent was my uneasiness nevertheless i still held on and government had to pay for it in four years time the old frigate began to be knocked almost to pieces and we made up our minds to be ordered home and set our memories at work upon all who were likely to meet us if still in the land of the living while at halifax thinking thus and looking forward to christmastime among our own families a spick and span new frigate came of the loveliest lines we had ever seen and standinggear the most elegant she took our eyes so much at once and she sat the water so that there was not a man of us able to think of anything else till all hands piped down this was the thetis if you please taken from the crappos in the very last action of the war a gun frigate but larger than an english gun ship the french shipbuilders are better than ours but their riggers not to be compared which is the reason perhaps why they always shoot at our rigging instead of our hulls at any rate having been well overhauled and thoroughly refitted at chatham and rigged anew from step to truck she presented an appearance of most tempting character it was a trick of the naval board to keep us together and it succeeded those gentlemen knew what we were by this time the very best ships company to be found in all the service and as there were signs already of some mischief brewing their desire was still to keep together such a piece of discipline my humble name had been brought forward many times with approval but without any effect so far upon wages or position now however my lords had found it expedient to remember me and david llewellyn was appointed masters mate to the thetis if he should think fit to join her for the whole after our long service was a matter of volunteering there was not a man of us dared to leave captain drake bampfylde shabbily we turned over to the thetis in a body with him and the crew that had manned her from england took the old alcestis home again and junior lieutenant bluett now a fine young fellow walked the quarterdeck of the thetis so that you should have seen him but first and foremost was to see our great captain drake as ready as if he were always looking out for an enemys ship from the foretop he walked a little lame on account of the piece the shark took out of him nevertheless we had not a man to equal him for activity i remember once when a violent gale caught us on the banks of newfoundland and the sky came down upon us black as any thundercloud the wind grew on us so towards nightfall that after taking in reef after reef the orders were to make all snug send down the topgallantmasts and lieto under closereefed maintopsail and foretopmast staysail captain drake was himself on deck as he always was in time of danger and through the roar of the gale his orders came as clear as a bell almost from the mouth of his speakingtrumpet maintop men to station close reef the maintopsail mr bluett clew up clew up there is not a moment to lose my men spit to your hands and stick like pitch what are you afraid then all of you for the sail was lashing about like thunder having broken from the quartergasket and when the men came to the topsailyard they durst not go upon it then a black squall struck them with blinding rain and they scarce could see one anothers faces till a cheery voice came from the end of the yard hold on my ladshold on there you seem so skeery of this job i will do it for you tis the devil himself cried old ben bower captain of the maintop let him fly let him fly my lads it is our captain said i who was coming slowly up to see to it myself prepared to do the job and shame all those young fellows skulk below you jellypots and leave it to me and the captain a cheer for the captain a cheer for the captain they cried before i could follow them and a score of men stood against the sky in the black pitch of the hurricane as if it were a review almost for they guessed what the captain must have done and it made a hero of each of them while they came slowly up the ratlins he clomb the rigging like a cat and before they got to the lubbers hole he was at the topmasthead whence he slid down by the toppinglift to the very end of the mainyard such a thing done in a furious gale and the sea going mountains high almost beat even my experience of what british captains are up to after that if he had cried make sail toheligoland with no landing to itthere was not a man of us but would have touched his hat and said ay ay sir and now we first met captain nelson in command of the boreas a poor little frigate we could have sunk her as easily as we outsailed her but as senior to captain drake he at once assumed command of us although it was not in our instructions to be at his disposal the americans then were carrying on with the privileges of british subjects in trading with the leeward islands although they had cast off our authority in a most uncourteous and i might say headstrong manner captain nelson could never put up with the presumptuous manners of this race and he felt bitterly how feeble had been our behaviour to them these are people who will always lead the whole world if they can counting it honour to depart from and get over old ideas and now they were doing a snug bit of roguery with the leeward islands pretending to have british bottoms while at bottom yankees nelson set his face against it and whenever he set his face his hand came quickly afterwards we soon cut up that bit of smuggling although the governor of the islands was himself against us captain nelsons orders were to enforce the navigation act and we did it thoroughly ever so many times i met him as he now came to and fro and he took the bargetiller out of my hand at least a dozen times i think for he never could bear that another man should seem to do his work for him any more than he could bear to see a thing done badly not that he found fault with my steering which was better than his own no doubt but that he wanted to steer himself and he never could sit a boat quietly from his perpetual ups and downs and longing to do something he knew my name he knew every ones name he called me old dyo continually because the men had caught it up and in my position i could not perceive what right he had to do so i had him on my lap i wont say fifty times but at least fifteen for he never had sealegs at all when a heavy sea was running and i never thought it any honour but cherished some hopes of a shilling or so as for appearance at first sight he struck me as rather grotesquelooking than imposing in spite of his fulllaced uniform and the broad flaps of his waistcoat his hair moreover was drawn away from his forehead and tied in a lanky tail leaving exposed in all its force rather a sad face pale and thin and with the nose somewhat lopsided also the shoulders badly shaped and the body set up anyhow and the whole arrangement of his frame nervous more than muscular in spite of all this any man who knows the faces of men and their true meaning could not fail to perceive at once that here was no common mortal the vigour and spirit of his eyes were such that they not only seemed to be looking through whatever lay before them but to have distinct perception of a larger distance and eagerness to deal with it and the whole expression of his face told of powerful impatience and a longing for great deeds dashed with melancholy the entire crew of his ship i was told were altogether wrapped up in him and would give their lives for him without thought and there was not one of them but was mad with our government for being at peace and barring captain nelson from the exploits he was pining for one of them struck at me with an oar when i said how puny nelson was compared with our drake bampfylde and only the strong sense of my position enabled me to put up with it and what i said was all the time the very truest of the true and that was why it hurt them so we being now the finest and smartest frigate in the service looked down upon that tub of a boreas and her waddlefooted crew and her pale pigtailed commander with a power of ignominy which they were not pleased with and all the time we were at their orders and they took care to let us know it we would have fought them with pleasure if the rules of the service allowed it enough of that uncomfortable discontent and soreness the hardest point is for a very great man to begin to set forth his greatness we could not at the moment see why horatio nelson should thus sweep off with the lead so but after he had once established what he was and what he meant there was no more jealousy to this i shall come in its proper place i am only now picking up crumbs as it were and chewing small jobs honourably but against one thing i must guard our captain drake was never for a moment jealous of captain nelson it was one of the things that annoyed us most when we looked down on the boreas and would gladly have had a good turn with those fellows who assumed such airs to us to find that our beloved captain was as full of nelson as the worst of the boreasses and one of our men who went on strongly took six dozen and no mistake and acknowledged how well he deserved it that is the way to do things and makes all of us one family it is time for me now to crowd all sail for spithead as we did at last seven round years and two months were gone since i had seen old cymru and i could fill seven thousand pages with our whole adventures but none of them bore much on my tale and nobody cares for my adventures since i ceased to be young and handsome and sometimes i almost thought in spite of all experience that i had better have gone into matrimony with a young woman of moderate substance but as is the case with those things when i had the chance i scorned it not being touched in the heart by any one and so proud of freedom moreover the competition for a man amongst young women may become so lively as to make him bear away large down wind exactly what had happened to me in the land of devonshire three quarters of my pay had been assigned to roger berkrolles under my hand and signature for the maintenance of our bunny so far as the rent might not provide it and for the general management of things and then to accumulate so that after all i had not any amazing sum to draw remembering too that from time to time we had our little tastes of it nevertheless when added up i really was surprised to find that the good clerks thought it worth so much quillchop over it and now i had been for several years on the pay of a petty officer masters mate and looking forward to be master if he were good enough to drop off he was truly tough and would never drop off and i felt it the more because he was ten years my junior and unseasoned he drew half again as much as i did though he knew that i had done all the work he gave me two fingers to say goodbye which is a loathsome trick to me so i put out my thumb which was difficult to him and the next time i saw him he lay dead in the cockpit of the goliath in a word i got so little after all my long endeavours to secure the british nation from its many enemies that verily i must have fallen to the old resource again and been compelled to ask for alms to help me home in as had happened to me in the year of grace we sailors always seem to be going either up or down so much without seeming to know why perhaps it is a custom from our being on the waves so much however i was saved from doing such disgrace to the uniform and to my veteran aspect and the hair by this time as white as snow simply through the liberality of our captain bampfylde for he made me an offer both kind and handsome though not more perhaps than might be expected after our sailing together so long this was to take me home with him to narnton court or the neighbourhood according to how the land might lie and thence to secure me a passage which is easy enough in the summertime by one of the stoneboats to newton nottage i felt that i might have come home in grander style than this was like to be and yet it was better than begging my way and scarcely any man should hope to be landed twice in all his life at his native village from a manofwar of course if master rodney bluett had still been with us he would have seen to my return and been proud of it but he had been forced to leave us having received his appointment as d lieutenant to the boadicea therefore i travelled with captain drake and made myself useful upon the road finding his coxswain who came with us in a miserably menial manner utterly useless whenever a knowledge of life and the world was demanded and over and over again my assistance paid my fare i am sure of it whether it were by coach or post because the great mass of seaman appear whenever they come on shore to enjoy a good cheating more than anything the reason is clear enoughto wit that having seen no rogues so long they are happy to pay for that pleasure now it was said that even the admiralty had been playing the rogue with us stopping our letters and our news to keep us altogether free from any disturbances of home at any rate very few of us had heard a word of england except from such old papers as we picked up in the colonies and now after seven years how could we tell what to expect or how much to fear chapter xlvi after seven years from exeter to barnstaple we crowded sail with horses tails and a heavy sea of mud leaping and breaking under the forefoot of our coach also two boys on the horses dressed like any admirals one with horn on his starboard thigh and the other with jackboots only it was my privilege to sit up in the foretop as might be with coxswain toms in the mizentop and the captain down in the waist by himself we made about six knots an hour perhaps whenever we got jerks enough to keep up the swearing but the impatience of our captain showed how very young he was now at forty years of age according to chronology though nobody would believe it surely he might have waited well after so long waiting and if he could not chew a quidwhich breeds a whole brood of patienceat any rate he had fine pipes and with commonsense might have kindled them i handed him down my flint and steel and my hat to make a job of it but he shut up the glass and cried more sail in a voice that almost frightened me it was as dark as maintoptree holes by the time we got to barnstaple but we found no less than four fine lamps of spermoil burning and tallowcandles here and there in shops of spirit and enterprise the horses were stalled and the baggage housed in a very fine inn looking up the street and then the captain told toms and me to house up our jibs while he went out this we were only too glad to do after so much heavy rolling upon terra firma as those landsmen love to call it in spite of all earthquakes such as killed thirty thousand italian people when first i took to the sea again but before long toms and i began to feel that we had no right to abandon our commander so here we were in a town that hardly ever saw a royal sailor and could not be supposed to know for a moment what his duties were or even to take a proper pride in seeing him borne harmless and here was our captain gone out in the dark with his cockedhat on and his gold lace shining wherever a tallowcandle hung also with a pleasant walk as if he were full of prizemoney though the evil one had so patched up a peace that we never clinked a halfpenny when old jerry toms and my humble self had scarcely gone through three glasses he said to me and i said to him that we were carrying on too coolly in a hostile town like this and just at this moment the navy was down in popular estimation for such is the public urgency whenever we are paid for without being killed or wounded therefore jerry and i were bound to steer with a small helm and double the watch we beat up the enemys quarters calmly finding none to challenge us and then we got tidings of our captain out upon the braunton road jerry was a man of valour and i could not hang back to be far behind him and we had been concerned in storming many savage villages so we stormed this little town carrying our hangers and nobody denied us but before we were half a mile entirely out of hearing the mayor arose from his supper and turned out the watch and beat the drums and bred such alarm that in one street there were three more people alive ere morning meanwhile jerry toms and i shaped our course for the braunton road and hit it and held on to it and because no man in strange places knows what the air may contain for him jerry sang a song and i struck chorus with such an effect that the cows were frightened all along the hedgerows this put us quite on our legs again and a more deeply sober couple could not or at any rate need not be seen than that which myself and jerry were after two miles of walking in this manner steering free yet full of responsibility we doubled the last point of the road where it fetches round to narnton court and here we lay to and held council out of the tide of the road and in what seemed to be a limekiln the coxswain wanted to board the house and demand our captain out of it we had carried all public opinion thus and the right thing was to go on with it but i told him very strongly so that he put down his collar from his ears to listen that no doubt he was right enough upon a hundred thousand subjects yet was gone astray in this and if we boarded a house at night after carrying all the town by storm what ship had we to bear us away from the mayor and his constables tomorrow in this dilemma who should appear but the captain himself with his head bowed down and his walk which was usually so brisk in spite of a trifling lameness his very walk expressing that his heart was full of sadness how much longer how much longer he was saying to himself being so troubled that he did not see us in the shadow there my own brother to have sworn it will the lord never hold his hand from scourging and from crushing me would that i were shot and shrouded it is more than i can bear in this gloomy vein he passed us and we looked at one another daring not to say a word how could a pair of petty officers think of intruding upon the troubles and private affairs of a postcaptain even though since our ship was paid off we could hardly be said to serve under him blow me out of the mouth of a gun cried coxswain toms in a shaking voice if ever i was so amazed before i would have sworn that our skipper was not only the handsomest but the happiest man in all the service then jerry i could have set you to rights how many times have i hinted that our skipper had something on his mind and none of you would hearken me true for you my lad i remember now you come to speak of it but we paid no heed because you looked so devilish knowing and would go no further old dyo i beg your pardon now there is good stuff in you friend dyothoroughly good stuff in you i should rather think there was i replied perhaps a little drily for he ought to have known it long ago jerry i could tell you things that would burst the tar of your pigtail nevertheless i will abstain being undervalued so ho shipmate haul your wind and hail i am blessed if it isnt old heaviside even in the dark i knew by the walk that it was a seaman and now my eyes were so accustomed to look out in all sorts of weather that day or night made little difference to my sense of vision which as you may see hereafter saved a british fleet unless i do forget to tell of it heaviside is my name sir and i should like to know what yours may be david llewellyn and so we met and i squeezed his hand till he longed to dance and i was ready to cut a caper from my depth of feeling i introduced him to jerry toms according to strict formality and both being versed in the rules of the service neither would take precedence but each of them hung back for the other fellow to pretend to it if he dared i saw exactly how they stood and being now as masters mate superior officer to both i put them at their ease by showing that we must not be too grand thus being all in a happy mood and desirous to make the best of things we could not help letting our captain go to dwell upon his own fortunes not that we failed of desire to help him but that our own business pressed gunner heaviside led us down to a little cabin set up by himself on the very brink of tawe highwater mark as a place of retirement when hard pressed and unable to hold his own in the bosom of his family you may well be surprisedfor i was more i was downright astonishedto find that this was my old ferryboat set up like a dog begging on shores with the poop channelled into the sand and the sides eked out with tarpaulin a snugger berth i never saw for a quiet man to live in and though heaviside scorned to tell us and we disdained to ask him thatas i guessed from the firstwas the true meaning of it this poor fellow had been seducedand i felt for his temptationswhen he came fresh from salt water and our rolling ideas of women into rapid matrimony with that sharp nanette he ought to have known much better and i ought to have given him warning but when he had made up his mind to settle i thought it was something solid i gave him the names as i may have said of good substantial farmers daughters owning at least a good cow apiece from the date of their majority also having sheets and blankets and as they told me many a time picked goosefeathers enough for two and yet he must go and throw himself away upon that nanette so but when i came to hear his case and he for a moment would not admit that it was worse than usual or that he wanted pity more than any other men do and scarcely knew how far he ought or dared even to accept it and then at the gurgling of his pipe fancied that he heard somebody jerry and i squeezed hands for a moment and were very careful not to tantalise this poor man with our strongset resolution give a wide berth to all womankind was what we would have said if we could when now it was too late for him failing that stand off and on and let the inhabitants come down and push off their boats and victual you poor heaviside fetched a sigh enough to upset all arrangements for jerry and i good widowers both were not likely to be damped at the proper time for jollifying by the troubles of a man who was meant to afford us rather a subject for rejoicing therefore we roused him up and said or at least conveyed to him that he must not be so sadly down upon his luck like this and hearing that he had six children now and was in fear of a seventh one i was enabled to recollect more than twenty instances of excellent women who had managed six and gone off at the seventh visitation this good news put such sudden spirit into my old shipmate that he ceased for a long time to be afeared of all that his wife could do to him he never said a word to show what his mind suggested to him whether good or evil only he made me tell those cases of unmerited mercy as he put it such a number of times that i saw what comfort he was deriving and then we challenged him to tell us what was going on with him he seemed rather shy of discussing himself but said that he was in sir philips service as boatman longshoreman and riverbailiff also porksalter as a son of the brine and watercresspicker to the family in a word he had no work whatever to do as you may pretty safely conclude when a man is compelled to go into a catalogue of his activities this sense of ease overweighed him no doubt and made the time hang heavily after so much active service so that naval instructor heaviside moved about and began to gossip and having no business of his own spent his mind upon other folks now as we began to see through him and the monotony of a fellow who is under his wifes thumb without the frankness to acknowledge and enlist our sympathies for this universal burden both jerry and i desired to hear something a little more new than this all things are good in their way and devised by a finely careful providence so that no man whose wife is a plague to him can fail of one blessed reflectionto wit that things are ordered so for the benefit of his fellowcreatures thus our noble heaviside not being satisfied with the state of things at homeespecially after he had appealed to nanettes strong sense of reason which bore sway in the very first week of half the honeymoon gloriously and after he had yielded slowly all his outworks of tobacco coming down from plugs to pipes and from pipes to paper things without stink enough to pay for rolling and so on in the downward course till he would have been glad of dry sugarcanes or the stems of oldmans beardthis poor but very worthy fellow gallantly surrendered and resolved to rejoice for the rest of his time in his neighbours business mainly herein he found great and constant change from his own sharp troubles everybody was glad to see him and the wives who were the very hardest upon their own husbands thought that he showed himself much too soft in the matter of madame heaviside it was not his place when that subject arose to say either yes or no but to put aside the question as one that cannot be debated out of the house with dignity only every one liked him the more the moment they remembered how contagious his complaint was regard this question as you will according to lack of experience it was much for our benefit that the naval instructor was henpecked he had accumulated things such as no man can put together whose wife allows him to have his talk if he may lay down the law or even suggest for consideration he lets out half his knowledge and forgets the other half of it whereas if all his utterance is cut short at beginning he has a good chance to get something well condensed inside him thus if you find any very closetexture and terseness in my writings the credit is due to my dear good wife who never let me finish a sentence i daresay she had trouble with me and i must be fair to her it takes a very different man to understand a different woman and these things will often touch us too late and too sadly i gave her a beautiful funeral to my utmost farthing and took her headstone upon credit almost before the sexton would warrant that the earth was settled that night my old friend heaviside who has led me from like experience into a wholly different thing showed some little of himself again before our whaleoil light began to splutter and bubble too violently our society quite renewed his hope of getting away again especially when i explained to him that according to my long acquaintance with law no one could hold him accountable for any quantity of children which a frenchwoman might happen to have an alien to wit and a foreigner worst of all a frenchwoman could not expect all her froggy confinements to hold good in england he had committed a foolish and unloyal act in buckling to with an alien enemy and he deserved to pay out for it but i thought and coxswain toms was of the same opinion that poor heaviside now had suffered ever so much more than even a frenchwoman could expect of him and we begged him to go afloat again he shook his head and said that he had not invited our opinions but to a certain extent endeavoured to be thankful for them yet he suggested delicately that after being so long at sea we might have waited for our landlegs before we became so positive and if we would not mind allowing him to see to his own concerns he would gladly tell all he knew about those of other people this appeared to me to be a perfectly fair offer but jerry toms took a little offence on account of not knowing the neighbourhood as superior officer of the three i insisted upon silence especially as from old times i knew what villany might be around us and as soon as heaviside could descry quite clearly what tack i stood upon he distinctly gave his pledge to be open as the day therefore we all filled our pipes again and took fresh lights for them and looked at one another while this old chap told his story and please to mind that he had picked up a prawnnetful of little trifles such as i never could stoop to scoop because he won such chances through the way the women pitied him only i must in shipshape put his rambling mode of huddling things if you please we are now going back seven years and more than that to the very date of my escape from devonshire so as to tell you what none of us knew until we met with heaviside chapter xlvii mischief in a household it seems that no sooner did parson chowne discover how cleverly i had escaped him after leaving my mark behind in a way rather hard to put up with than he began to cast about to win the last stroke somehow and this not over me alone but over a very much greater man who had carried me off so shamefullythat is to say captain bampfylde heaviside was not there as yet but with us in the alcestis so that he could not describe exactly the manner of chownes appearance only he heard from the people there that never had such terror seized the house within human memory not that chowne attempted any violence with any one but that all observed his silence and were afraid to ask him what was done that night between sir philip and the parson or even between the parson and sir philips heir the squire whose melancholy room that chowne had dared to force himself into nobody seemed to be sure although every one craved to have better knowledge but it was certain that isabel carey went to her room very early that night and would have no nanette for her hair and in the morning was not fit for any one to look at unless it were one who loved her great disturbances of this sort happen by some law of nature often in large households give me the quiet cottage where a little row just now and then comes to pass and is fought out and lapses when its heat is over into very nice explanations and womens heads laid on mens shoulders and tears that lose their way in smiles and reproach that melts into selfreproach however this was not the sort of thing that any sane person could hope for in thirty miles distance from master stoyle chowne after once displeasing him and what do you think parson chowne did now or at least i mean soon afterwards that night he had pressed his attentions on the beautiful young lady so that in simple selfdefence she was forced to show her spirit this aroused the power of darkness always lurking in him so that his eyes shone and his jaws met and his forehead was very smooth for he had a noble forehead and the worse his state of mind might be the calmer was his upper brow after frightening poor miss carey not with words but want of them which is a far more alarming thing when a man encounters women he took out his rights in the house by having an interview with sir philip and no one could make any guess about what passed between them only it could not be kept from knowledge of the household that parson chowne obtained or took admission to squire philip also of this unhappy gentleman very little has been said because i then knew so little i am always the last man in the world to force myself into private things and finding out once that i must not ask never to ask is my rule of action unless i know the people however it does not look as if master heaviside had been gifted with any of this rare delicacy and thus he discovered as follows squire philips brain was not so strong as captain bampfyldes he had been very good at figures while things went on quietly also able to ride round and see the tenants and deal with them as the heir to a large estate should do the people thought him very good and that was about the whole of it he never hunted he never shot he did not even care for fishing a man may do without these things if he gets repute in other ways especially in witchcraft but if he cannot show good cause for sticking thus inside four walls an english neighbourhood is apt to set him down for a milksop and tenfold thus if he has the means to ride the best horse and to own the best dogs and to wear the best breeches that are to be bought squire philip must not be regarded however with prejudice he had good legs and a very good seat and his tailor said the same of him also he took no objection to the scattering of a fox with nothing left for his brush to sweep up and his smell made into incense nor was the squire from any point of view or of feeling squeamish nevertheless he did not give satisfaction as he should have done he meant well but he did not outspeak it only because to his quiet nature that appeared so needless and the rough rude world undervalued him because he did not overvalue himself this was the man who had withdrawn after deep affliction into a life or a death of his own abandoning hope too rapidly he had been blessed or cursed by nature with a large soft heart and not the flint in his brains there should be for a wholesome balance i know the men they are not very common and i should like to see more of them this squire philips hair was whiter than his fathers now they said and his way of sitting and of walking growing older no wonder when he never took a walk or even showed himself rather like a woman yielding who has lost her only child it is not my place to defend him all our ways are not alike to my experience he seemed bound to grieve most about his children for a man may always renew his wife more easily than his children but squire philips view of the matter took a different startingpoint it was the loss of his wife that thus unwisely overcame him accordingly he had given orders for women alone to come near him because they reminded him of his wife and went all around in a flatfooted way and gave him to see that they never would ask yet gladly would know his sentiments and living thus he must have grown a little weak of mind as all men do with too much of a female circle round them what parson chowne said to this poor gentleman on the night we are speaking of was known to none except themselves and two or three maids who listened at the door because their duty compelled them thus to protect their master and all of these told different stories agreeing only upon one point but the best of them told it as follows chowne expressed his surprise and concern at the change in his ancient friends appearance and said that it was enough to make him do what he often had threatened to do squire philip then asked what he meant by this and he answered in a deep low voice bring to justice the villain who for the sake of his own advantage has left my poor philip childless and with all the fair isabels property too greedy greedy scoundrel they could not see the poor squires face when these words came home to him but they knew that he fell into a chair and his voice so trembled that he could not shape his answer properly then you too think as i have feared as i have prayed as i would die rather than be forced to think my only brother and i have been so kind to him for years and years that he was strong and rough i knowbut such a thing such a thing as this he began to indulge his propensities for slaughter rather earlyi think i have heard people say yes yes that boy at school but this is a wholly different thingwhat had my poor wife done to him did you ever hear that drake bampfylde offered himself to the princess while you were away from home and a little before you did i never heard anything of the kind and i think that she would have told me i rather think not it would be a very delicate point for a lady however it may not be true chowne it is true from the way you say it you know it to be true and you never told me because it prevents any further doubt now i see everything everything now chowne you are one of the best of men i know that i am said the parson calmly although it does not appear to be the public opinion however that will come right in the end now my poor fellow your wisest plan will be to leave yourself altogether to a thoroughly trustworthy man do you know where to find him only in you in you my friend my father will never come to see me becauseyou know what i meanbecausei dared to think what is now proved true now philip my old friend you know what i am a man who detests every kind of pretence even a little inclined perhaps to go too far the other way yes yes i have always known it you differ from other men and the great fault of your nature is bluntness philip you have hit the mark i could not have put it so well myself my fine fellow never smother yourself while you have such abilities alas i have no abilities chowne the whole of them went when my goodluck went and if any remained to me how could i care to use them after what you have told me too my life is over my life is dead all the maids agreed at this point and would scorn to contradict that poor squire philip fell down in a lump and they must have run in with their bottles and so on only that the door was locked moreover they felt and had the courage to whisper to one another that they were a little timid of the parsons witchcraft there had been a girl in sherwell parish who went into the parsons service and because she dared to have a sweetheart on the premises she had orders for half an hour before and after the moon rose to fly up and down the river yeo from sherwell mill to pilton bridge and her own mother had seen her therefore these maids only listened all this shows a noble vein of softness in you my good friendthis was the next thing they could hearit is truly good and grand what a happy thing to have a darling wife and two sweet children for the purpose of having them slain and then in the grandeur of soul forgiving it this is noble this is true love how it sets one thinking this was the last that the maids could hear for after that all was whispering only it was spread in every street and road and lane around in about twelve hours afterwards that a warrant from justices chowne and rambone and with consent of philip bampfylde was placed in the hands of the officers of the peace for the apprehension of captain drake upon a charge of murder when sir philip heard of this outrage on himselfand tenfold worseupon their blameless lineage he ordered his finest horse to be saddled and put some of his armyclothes on not his best for fear of vaunting but enough to know him by then he rode slowly up and down the narrow streets of barnstaple and sent for the mayor and the towncouncil who tumbled out of their shops to meet him to these he read a copy of the warrant obtained from the headconstable and asked upon what information laid such a thing had issued betwixt their respect for sir philip bampfylde and their awe of parson chowne these poor men knew not what to say but to try to be civil to every one sir philip rode home to narnton court and changed his dress and his horse as well and thus set off for chownes house what happened there was known to none except the two parsons and the general but every one was amazed when chowne in company with parson jack rode into barnstaple at full gallop and redemanded his warrant from the headconstable who held it and also caused all entries and copies thereof to be destroyed and erased as might be and for this he condescended to assign no reason in that last point he was consistent with his usual character but that he should undo his own act was so unlike himself that no one could at first believe it of course people said that it was pity for sir philips age and character and position that made him relent so but others who knew the man better perceived that he had only acted as from the first was his intention he knew that the captain could not be taken of course for many a month to come and he did not mean to have him taken or put upon his trial for he knew right well that there was no chance of getting him convicted but by issue of that warrant he had stirred up and given shape to all the suspicions now languishing and had enabled good honest people to lay their heads together and shake them and the boldest of them to whisper that if a common man had done this deed or been called in question of it the warrant would have held its ground until he faced an impartial jury of his fellowcountrymen and what was far more to chownes purpose he had thus contrived to spread between sir philip and his eldest son a deadly breach unlikely ever to be bridged across at all and quite sure to stand wide for healing up to the dying hour because it was given to all to know that this vile warrant issued upon oath of squire philip and by his demanding and the fathers pride would never let him ask if this were so now people tried to pass this over as they do with unpleasant matters and to say let bygones go yet mankind will never have things smothered thus and put away when a game is begun it should be played out when a battle is fought let it be fought outthese are principles quite as strong in the bosoms of spectators as in our own breasts the feelinglet us live our lives out but isabel careys wrath would not have any reason laid near it her spirit was as fine and clear almost as her lovely face was and she would not even dream that evil may get the upper hand of us she said to sir philip i will not have it i will not stay in a house where such things can be said of any one i am very nearly eighteen years old and i will not be made a child of you have been wonderfully kind and good and as dear to me as a father but i must go away now i must go away so you shall said poor sir philip it is the best thing that can be done you have another guardian more fortunate than i am and my dear you shall go to him then she clung to his neck and begged and prayed him not to think of it more only to let her stop where she was in the home of all her happiness but the general was worse to move than the rock of gibraltar whenever his honour was touched upon my dear isabel he answered you are young and i am old you were quicker than i have been to see what harm might come to you that is the very thing which i am bound to save you from my darling i love you as if you were my own daughter and this sad house will be god knows tenfold more sad without you but it must be so my child you ought to be too proud to cry when i turn you out so not to dwell upon things too muchespecially when grievousnarnton court was compelled to get on without that bright young isabel and the female tailors who were always coming after her as well as the noble gallants who hankered every now and then for a glimpse of her beauty and property isabel carey went away to her other guardian lord pomeroy at a place where a castle of powder was and all the old people at narnton court determined not to think of it while all the young folk sobbed and cried and take it on the average a guinea ayear was lost to them all this had happened for seven years now but it was that last piece of news no doubt almost as much as the warrant itself that made our captain carry on so when we were in the limekiln because lord pomeroy had forbidden isabel to write to her lover while in this predicament he on the other hand getting no letters without knowing why or wherefore was too proud to send any to her we saw the force of this at once especially after our own correspondence under both mark and signature had for years been like the wind going where it listeth so we resolved to stop where we were upon receipt of rations and heaviside told us not to be uneasy about anything for although he durst not invite us to his own little cottage or rather his wife nanettes he stood so well in the cooks good graces that he could provide for us so he took us into the kitchen of narnton court where they made us very welcome as captain drakes retainers and told us all that had happened since the departure of miss isabel between narnton court and nympton in the first place parson chowne had been so satisfied with his mischief that he spared himself time for another wedlock taking as mrs chowne no a young lady of some wealth and beauty but reputed such a shrew that nobody durst go near her before she had been mrs chowne a fortnight her manners were so much improved that a child might contradict her and within a month she had lost the power of frowning but had learned to sigh however she was still alive having a stronger constitution than any of the parsons former wives parson jack had also married and his wife was a good one but chowne being out of other mischief sowed such jealousies between them for his own enjoyment that poor master rambone had taken to drink and his wife was so driven that she almost did the thing she was accused of very seldom now did either of these two great parsons come to visit sir philip bampfylde not that the latter entertained any illwill towards chowne for the matter of the warrant for that he blamed his own son the squire having received chownes version of it and finding poor philip too proud and moody to offer any explanation we had not been at narnton court more than a night before i saw the brave general for hearing that i was in the house and happening now to remember my name he summoned me into his private room to ask about the captain who had started off as i felt no doubt for the castle of lord pomeroy i found sir philip looking of course much older from the seven years past but as upright and dignified and trustful in the lord as ever nevertheless he must have grown weaker though he did his best to hide it for at certain things i told him of his favourite son great tears came into his eyes and his thin lips trembled and he was forced to turn away without finishing his sentences then he came back as if ashamed of his own desire to hide no shame and he put his flowing white hair back and looked at me very steadily llewellyn he said i trust in god years of trouble have taught me that i speak to you as a friend almost from your long acquaintance with my son and knowledge of our story my age will be three score years and ten if i live please god till my next birthday but i tell you david llewellyn and i beg you to mark my words i shall not die until i have seen the whole of this mystery cleared off the honour of my name restored and my innocent son replaced in the good opinion of mankind this calm brave faith of a longharassed man in the goodness of his maker made me look at him with admiration and with glistening eyes for i said to myself that with such a deep knave as chowne at the bottom of his troubles his confidence even in the lord was very likely to be misplaced and yet the very next day we made an extraordinary discovery which went no little way to prove the soundness of the old mans faith chapter xlviii a breathless disinterment by this time we were up to all the ins and outs of everything a sailor has such a knowledge of knots and the clever art of splicing that you cannot play loose tricks in trying on a yarn with him jerry toms and i were ready long before that day was out to tie up our minds in a bowline knot and never more undo them jerry went even beyond my views as was sure to be because he knew so much less of the matter he would have it that parson chowne had choked the two children without any aid and then in hatred and mockery of the noble british uniform had buried them deep in braunton burrows wearing a cockade for a shovel hat purely by way of outrage on the other hand while i agreed with jerry up to a certain distance i knew more of parson chowne whom he never had set eyes upon than to listen to such rubbish and while we agreed in the main so truly and thoroughly praised each others wisdom all the people in the house made so highly much of us that jerry forgot the true line of reasoning even before nine oclock at night and dissented from my conclusions so widely and with so much arrogance that it did not grieve me after he got up to have knocked him down like a ninepin however in the morning he was all right and being informed upon every side that the cook did it with the rollingpin he acknowledged the justice of it having paid more attention to her than a married lady should admit though parted from her husband however she forgave him nobly and he did the same to her and i with all my knowledge of women made avowal in the presence of the ladyhousekeeper that my only uneasiness was to be certain whether i ought to admire the more jerrys behaviour or mrs cooks and the cook had no certainty in the morning exactly what she might have done this little matter made a stir far beyond its value and having some knowledge of british nature i proposed to the comitatus with deference both to the cook and housekeeper also a glance at the first housemaid that we should right all misunderstanding by dining together comfortably an hour before the usual time because as i clearly expressed it yet most inoffensively our breakfast had been ruined by a piece i might say of misconstruction overnight between two admirable persons and heaviside came in just then and put the cap on all of it by saying that true sailors were the greatest of all sportsmen therefore in honour of our arrival he had asked and got leave from the gamekeepers to give a great rabbiting that afternoon down on braunton burrows and he hoped that mrs cockhanterbury being the ladyhousekeeper would grace the scene with her presence and let every maid come to the utmost heavisides speech though nothing in itself neither displaying any manner at all was received with the hottest applause and for some time jerry and i had to look at one another without any woman to notice us we made allowance for this of course although we did not like it for after all who was heaviside but we felt so sorely the ill effects of the absence of perfect harmony upon the preceding evening when all our male members of the human race took more or less the marks of knuckles that a sense of stiffness helped us to make no objection to anything and tenfold thus when we saw how the maids had made up their minds for frolicking these young things must have their way as well as the nobler lot of us for they really have not so very much less of mind than higher women have and they feel what a woman is too well to push themselves so forward they know their place and they like their place and they tempt us down into it be that either wayand now unwomanly women waste their good brains upon a trifle of this kindrabbiting was to be our sport and no sooner was the dinner done and ten minutes given to the maids to dress than every dog on the premises worth his salt was whistled for it would have amused you to see the maids or i might say all the womankind coming out with their best things on and their hair done up and all pretending never even to have seen a lookingglass madame heaviside as she commanded all people to entitle her was of the whole the very grandest as regards appearance also in manner and carrying on but of this i have no time to speak enough that the former naval instructor thought it wiser to keep his own place and let her flirt with the game keepers we had dogs and ferrets and nets and spades and guns for those who were clever enough to keep from letting them off at all and to frighten the women without any harm there must have been fiveandtwenty of us in number altogether besides at least a score of children who ran down from braunton village when they saw what we were at there was no restraint laid upon us by any presence of the gentry for sir philip was not in the humour for sport and the squire of course kept himself to his room and as for the captain we had no token of his return from south devon yet therefore we had the most wonderful fun enjoying the wildness of the place and the freshness of the river air and wilfulness of the sandhills also the hideandseek of the rushes and the many ups and downs and pleasure of helping the young women in and out also how these latter got if they had any feet to be proud of into rabbitholes on purpose to be lifted out of them and fill the rosettes of their shoes and have them dusted by a naval mans very best pockethandkerchieftogether with a difficulty of standing on one foot while doing it or having it done to them and a fear of breathing too much outafter smothered rabbit at dinnertimewhich made their figures look beautiful enough that i took my choice among them for consideration and jotted down the names of three who must have some cash from their petticoats let nobody for a moment dream that i started with this intention the rest of my life was to be devoted to the royal navy if only a hot war should come again of which we already felt simmerings but i could not regard all these things after so many years at sea without some desire for further acquaintance with the meaning of everything at sea we forget a great deal of their ways when we come ashorethere they are again this is a very childish thing for a man like me to think of nevertheless i do fall back from perfect propriety sometimes never as regards money but when my feelings are touched by the way in which superior young women try to catch me or when my opinion is asked conscientiously as to cordials and this same afternoon the noble clearness of the sun and air and the sound of merry voices glancing where all the world unless it were soft sand would have echoed them and the sense of going sportingwhich is half the game of itthese and other things as well as the fatness of the rabbits backs and great skill not to bruise them led the whole of us more or less into contemplation of natures beauties we must have killed more than a hundred and fifty coneys in one way and another when heaviside came up almost at a run to a hill where jerry toms and i were sitting down to look about a bit and to let the young women admire us whats the matter said i not liking to be interrupted thus matter enough he panted out where is madame the lord keep her away madame is gone down to the waterside said jerry though i frowned at him together with that smart young fellowi forget his nameunderkeeper they call him hurrah my hearties cried heaviside that is luck and no mistake now lend a hand every lubber of you her pet dog snap is in the sand with the devil to pay and no pitch hot if we take long to get him out again we knew what he meant for several dogs of an overzealous character had got into premature burial in the rabbitgalleries through the stupidity of people who crowded upon the cone over them some had been dug out alive and some dead according to what their luck was and now we were bound to dig out poor snap and woe to us all if we found him dead i took the biggest spade as well as the entire command of all of us and we started at quick step for the place which heaviside pointed out to us he told us so far as his breath allowed that his small brown terrier snap had found a rabbit of tender age hiding in a tuft of rushes snap put all speed on at once but young bunny had the heels of him and flipped up her tail at the mouth of a hole with an air of defiance which provoked snap beyond all discretion he scarcely stopped to think before he plunged with a yelp into the hole while another and a wiser dog came up and shook his ears at it for a little while they heard poor snap working away in great ecstasy scratching at narrow turns and yelping when he almost got hold of fur heaviside stood in his heavy way whistling into the entrancehole which went down from a steep ascent with a tuft of rushes over it but snap was a great deal too gamesome a dog to come backeven if he heard him meanwhile a lot of bulky fellows who could do no more than clap their hands got on the brow of the burrow and stamped and shouted to snap to dig deeper then of a sudden the whole hill slided as a hollow fire does and cast a great part of itself into a deep gully on the north of it and those great louts who had sent it down so found it very hard and never deserved to get their clumsy legs out no wonder that heaviside had made such a run to come and fetch us for snap must be now many feet underground and the naval instructor knew what it would be to go home to nanette without him he stood above the slip and listened and there was no bark of snap while to my mind came back strangely thoughts of the five poor sons of sker and of the little child dwelling in sand forlorn and abandoned bardie dig away my lads dig away i cried from force of memory and setting example to every one i have seen a thing like this before it only wants quick digging we dug and dug and drove our pit through several decks of rabbitberths and still i cried dig on my lads although they said it was hopeless then suddenly some one struck something hard and cried halloa and frightened us we crowded round and i took the lead and made the rest keep back from me in right of superior discipline and thence i heaved out a beautiful cockedhat of a british captain of the royal navy with snap inside of it and not quite dead such a cheer and sound arose the moment that snap gave a little sniff from universal excitement and joy with heaviside at the head of it that i feared to be hoisted quite out of the hole and mounted on human shoulders this i like well enough now and then having many a time deserved without altogether ensuing it but i could not stop to think of any private triumph now the whole of my heart was hot inside me through what i was thinking of that poor honest fellow who so eschewed the adornment of the outward man and carried out pure christianity so as to take no heed of what he wore or whether he wore anything whatever yet who really felt for people of a weaker cultivation to such an extreme that he hardly ever went about by day muchthis noble man had given evidence such as no man who had lost respect by keeping a tailor could doubt of in itself it was perspicuous and so was the witness before he put up with a sack in order to tender it the whole force of this broke upon me now while the others were showing the hat round or blowing into the little dogs nostrils and with a rabbits tail tickling him because in a single glance i had seen that the hat was our captain bampfyldes and then i thought of old sir philip striding sadly along these burrows for ever seeking something dig away dig away my lads never mind the little dog let the maidens see to him under our feet there is something now worth a hundred thousand dogs all the people stood and stared and thought that i was off my wits and but for my uniform not one would ever have stopped to harken me it was useless to speak to heaviside the whole of his mind was exhausted by anxiety as to his wifes little dog no sleep could he see before him for at least three lunar months unless little snap came round again so i had to rely on myself alone and jerry toms and two gamekeepers all these were for giving up because i can tell you it is no joke to throw out spadeful after spadeful of this heavy deceitful sand with half of it coming back into the hole and the place where you stand not steadfast and the rushes were combing darkly over us showing their gingercoloured roots and with tufts of jagged eyebrows threatening overwhelment for our lives we worked awaywith me as seems to be my fate compelled to be the masterand all the people looking down and ready to revile us if we could not find a stirring thing but we did find a stirring thing exactly as i will tell you for suddenly my spade struck something soft something which returned no sound and yet was firm enough to stop or at any rate to clog the tool although it was scarcely twilight yet and many people stood around us a feeling not of fear so much as horror seized upon me because this was not like the case of digging out poor bodies smothered by accident or the will of god but was something far more dreadful proof to wit of atrocious murder done by villany of mankind upon two little helpless babes so that i scarce could hold the spade when a piece of white linen appeared through the sand and then some tresses of long fair hair and then two little hands crossed on the breast and a set of small toes sticking upward and close at hand lay another young body of about the same size or a trifle larger at this terrible sight the deepest breath of awe drew through all of us and several of the women upon the hill shrieked and dropped and the children fled and the men feared to come any nearer even my three or four fellowdiggers leaped from the hole with alacrity leaving me all by myself to go on with this piteous disinterment for a moment i trembled too much to do so and leaned on my spade in the dusky grave watching the poor little things and loath to break with sacrilegious hands such innocent and eternal rest ye pure and stainless souls i cried hovering even now above us in your guardian angels arms and appealing for judgment on your icyhearted murderer pardon me for thus invading in the sacred cause of justice the calm sleep of your tenements in this sad and solemn moment with all the best spectators moved to tears by my deep eloquence as well as their own rich sympathies it struck me that the legs of one of the corpses stuck up rather strangely i had not been taken aback at all by the bright preservation of hands and toes because i knew well what the power of sand is when the air is kept far away but it was dead against all my experience that even a baby eight years buried should have that muscular power of leg without any further hesitation up i caught the nearest of them being desperate now to know what would be the end of it three or four women whose age had passed from lying in to laying out now ran down the hill in great zealousness but though their profession is perhaps the most needful of all yet invented by human nature there was no exercise for it now for behold in the evening light and on the brink of the grave were laid two very handsome and large dutch dolls clad in their nightgowns and looking as fresh as when they left the dollmakers shop the sand remained in their hair of course and in their linen but fell away by reason of its dryness from their faces and hands and feet the whole of which were of fine hard wax but the joints of their arms and legs had stiffened from having no children to work them also their noses had been spoiled at some stage of their obsequies and upon the whole it seemed hard to say whether their appearance was more ludicrous or deplorable however that matter was settled for them by the universal guffaw of the fellows who had been scared of their scanty wits not more than two minutes since but all of whom now were as brave as lions to make laughter at my expense this is a thing which i never allow but very soon put a stop to it and so i did now without any hard words but turning their thoughts discreetly come my lads i said we have done a better turn to the gentleman who feeds us than if we had found two thousand babies such as you ran away from rally round me if you have a spark of courage in your loutish bodies you little know how much hangs on this while in your clumsy witless way you are making a stupid joke of it mr heaviside i pray you seek for me mistress cockhanterbury while i knock down any rogue who shows the impudence to come near me every man pulled his proud stomach in when i spoke of the ladyhousekeeper who was a tartar high up on a shelf allowing no margin for argument she appeared in the distance as managingwomen always do when called upon and she saw the good sense of what little i said and she laid them all under my orders chapter xlix one who has interred himself such an effect was now produced all over all around us that every man pressed for his neighbours opinion rather than offer his own almost this is a state of the public mind that cannot be long put up with for half the pleasure goes out of life when a man is stinted of argument but inasmuch as i was always ready for all comers and would not for a moment harken any other opinion the great bulk of conclusion ran into the grooves i laid for it this was neither more nor less than that satans own chaplain chowne was at the helm of the whole of it some people said that i formed this opinion through an unchristian recollection of his former rudeness to me i mean when he blew me out of bed and tried to drown and to burn me alive however the great majority saw that my nature was not of this sort but rather inclined to reflect with pleasure upon any spirited conduct and to tell the whole truth upon looking back at the parson i admired him more than any other man i had seen except captain nelson for it is so rare to meet with a man who knows his own mind thoroughly that if you find him add thereto a knowledge of his neighbours minds certain you may be that here is one entitled to lead the nation he may be almost too great to care about putting this power in exercise unless any grand occasion betides him just as parson chowne refused to go into the bishopric and just as nelson was vexed at being the supervisor of smugglers nevertheless these men are ready when god sees fit to appoint them however to come back to these dolls and the opening now before them the public although at first disappointed not to have found two real babies strangled in an experienced manner perceived the expediency of rejoicing in the absence of any such horror only there were many people of the lower order so disgusted at this cheat and strain upon their glands of weeping with no blood to show for it that they declared their firm resolve to have nothing more to do with it for my part being some little aware of the way in which laurels are stolen i kept my spade well up and the two dolls in my arms with their heads down and even their feet grudged to the view of the gossipers in the midst of an excited mob a calm sight of the right thing to do may lead them almost anywhere and i saw that the only proper thing was to leave everything to me they with that sense of fairness which exists in slow minds more than in quick ones fell behind me because all knew that the entire discovery was my own of course without snap i could never have done it nor yet without further accidents still there it was and no man even of our diffident welsh nation can in any fairness be expected to obscure himself my tendency throughout this story always has been to do this but i really did begin to feel the need of abjuring this national fault since men of a mixture of any sort without even celtic blood in them over and over again had tried to make a mere nobody of me hence it was and not from any desire to advance myself that among the inferior race i stood upon my rights and stuck to them if ever there had been any drop of desire for money left in me after perpetual purification from seven years of getting only coppers and finding most of them forgeries this scene was alone sufficient to make me glad of an empty purse for any man who has any money must long to put more to it as the children pile their farthings hoping how high they may go i like to see both old and young full of schemes so noble only they must let an ancient fellow like me keep out of them these superior senses glowed within me and would not be set aside by any other rogue preceding me when i knocked at sir philips door and claimed first right of audience the other fellows were all put away by the servingmen as behoved them then i carried in everything just as it was and presented the whole with the utmost deference sir philip had inkling of something important and was beginning to shake now and then nevertheless he acknowledged my entrance with his wonted dignity signed to the footman to refresh the spermoil lamps in the long dark room and then to me to come and spread my burden on a table nothing could more clearly show the selfcommand which a good man wins by wrestling long with adversity for rumour had reached him that i had dug up his sons cockedhat and his two grandchildren all as fresh as the day itself it is not for me who have never been so deeply stirred in the grain of the heart by heavens visitations to go through and make a show of this most noble and ancient gentlemans doings or feelings or language even a man of low station like myself would be loath to have this done to him at many and many a time of his life so if i could even do it in the case of a man so far above me and so far more deeply harrowed instead of being proud of describing i must only despise myself enough to say that this snowyhaired most simple yet stately gentleman mixed the usual mixture of the things that weep and the things that laugh which are the jointstock of our nature from the old adam and the young one what i meanif i keep to factsis that he knelt on a strip of canvas laid at the end of the table and after some trouble to place his elbows because of the grit of the sandiness bowed his white forehead and silvery hair and the calm majesty of his face over those two dollies and over his sons very best cockedhat and in silence wept thanksgiving to the great father of everything david llewellyn he said as he rose and approached me as if i were quite his equal allow me to take your hand my friend there are few men to whom i would sooner owe this great debt of gratitude than yourself because you have sailed with my son so long to you and your patience and sagacity under the mercy of god i owe the proof or at any rate these tokens of my poor sons innocence ii thank the lord and you here the general for the moment could not say another word it is true your worship i answered that none of your own people showed the sense or the courage to go on but it is a welshmans honest pride to surpass all other races in valour and ability i am no more than the very humblest of my ancestors may have been then all of them must have been very fine fellows sir philip replied with a twinkling glance but now i will beg of you one more favour carry all these things just as they are to the room of my son mr philip bampfylde at first i was so taken aback that i could only gaze at him and then i began to think and to see the reason of his asking it i have asked you to do a strange thing good david if it is an unpleasant one say so in your blunt sailors fashion your honour i answered with all the delicacy of my nature upwards say not another word i will do it for truly to speak it if anything had been often a grief and a care to me it was the bitterness of thinking of that squire philip deeply and not knowing anything the general bowed to me with a kindness none could take advantage of and signalled me to collect my burden then he appointed me how to go together with a very old and longaccustomed servitor himself would not come near his son for fear of triumph over him after a long bit of tapping and whispering and the mystery servants always love to make of the simplest orders i was shown with my arms well aching for those wooden dolls were no joke and the captains hat weighed a stone at least with all the sand in the lining into a dark room softly strewn and hung with ancient damask the light of the evening was shut out and the failure of the candles made it seem a cloudy starlight only in the furthest corner there was light enough to see by and there sate at a very old desk a whitehaired man with his hat on if i can say one thing truly while i am striving at every line to tell the downright honesty this truth is that my bones and fibres now grew cold inside of me there was about this man so placed and with the dimness round him such an air of difference from whatever we can reason with and of far withdrawal from the ways of human nature as must send a dismal shudder through a genial soul like mine there he sate and there he spent three parts of his time with his hat on gazing at some old grey tokens of a happy period but so far as could be judged hoping fearing doing thinking even dreamingnothing he would not allow any clock or watch or other record of time in the chamber he would not read or be read to neither write or receive a letter there he sate with one hand on his forehead pushing back the old dusty hat with his white hair straggling under it and even below the gaunt shoulderblades his face set a little on one side without any kind of meaning in it unless it were long weariness and patient waiting gods time of death i was told that once aday whenever the sun was going down over the bar in winter or summer in wet or dry this unfortunate man arose as if he knew the time by instinct without view of heaven and drew the velvet curtain back and flung the shutter open and for a moment stood and gazed with sorrowworn yet tearless eyes upon the solemn hills and woods and down the gliding of the river following the pensive footfall of another receding day then with a deep sigh he retired from all chance of starlight darkening body mind and soul until another sunset upon the better side of my heart i could feel true pity for a man overwhelmed like this by fortune while my strength of mind was vexed to see him carry on so therefore straight i marched up to him when i began to recover myself having found no better way of getting through perplexity as my footsteps sounded heavily in the gloomy chamber squire philip turned and gazed at first with cold displeasure and then with strong amazement at me i waited for him to begin but he could not whether from surprise or loss of readiness through such long immurement may it please your honour i said the general has sent me hither to clear my captain from the charge of burying your honours children whatwhat do you mean was all that he could stammer forth while his glassy eyes were roving from my face to the dolls i bore and round the room and then back again exactly as i say your honour these are what the wild man took for your two children in braunton burrows and here is the captains cockedhat which some one stole to counterfeit him the whole thing was a vile artifice a delusion cheat and mockery i need not repeat how i set this before him but only his mode of receiving it at first he seemed wholly confused and stunned pressing his head with both hands and looking as if he knew not where he was then he began to enter slowly into what i was telling him but without the power to see its bearing or judge how to take it he examined the dolls and patted them and added them to a whole school which he kept with two candles burning before them and then he said they have long been missing i am pleased to recover them then for a long time he sate in silence and in his former attitude quite as if his mind relapsed into its old condition and verily i began to think that the only result of my discovery so far as concerned poor squire philip would be a small addition to his gallery of dolls however after a while he turned round and cried with a piercing gaze at me mariner whoever you are i do not believe one word of your tale the hat is as new and the dolls are as fresh as if they were buried yesterday and i take that to be the truth of it how many years have i been here i know not bring me a lookingglass he pointed to a small mirror which stood among his precious relics being mounted with silver and tortoiseshell this had been as they told me afterwards the favourite toy of his handsome wife when i handed him this he took off his hat and shook his white hair back and gazed earnestly but without any sorrow at his mournful image twenty years at least he pronounced it in a clear decided voice twenty years it must have taken to have made me what i am would twenty years in a dripping sandhill leave a smart gentlemans laced hat and a poor little babys dolls as fresh and bright as the day they were buried old mariner i am sorry that you should lend yourself to such devices but perhaps you thought it right this although so much perverted made me think of his fathers goodness and kind faith in every one and i saw that here was no place now for any sort of argument your honour is altogether wrong i answered very gently the matter could have been at the utmost scarcely more than eight years ago according to what they tell me and if you can suppose that a man of my rank and age and service would lend himself to mean devices there are at least thirty of your retainers and of honest neighbours who have seen the whole thing and can swear to its straightforwardness and your honour of course knows everything a thousand times better than i do but of sand and how it keeps things everlasting so long as dry your honour seems if i may say it to have no experience he did not take the trouble to answer but fell back into his old way of sitting as if there was nothing worth argument people say that every man is like his father in many ways but the first resemblance that i perceived between sir philip and his elder son was that the squire arose and bowed with courtesy as i departed upon the whole this undertaking proved a disappointment to me and it mattered a hundredfold as much that our noble general was not only vexed but angered more than one could hope of him having been treated a little amiss i trusted that sir philip would contribute to my selfrespect by also feeling angry still i did not desire more than just enough to support me or at the utmost to overlap me and give me the sense of acting aright by virtue of appeasing him but on the present occasion he showed so large and cloudy a shape of anger wholly withdrawn from my sight as happens with the peak of teneriffealso he so clearly longed to be left alone and meditate that i had no chance to offer him more than three opinions all these were of genuine value at the time of offering and must have continued so to be if the facts had not belied them allowing for this adverse view i will not even state them nevertheless i had the warmest invitation to abide and be welcome to the best that turned upon any of all the four great spits or simmered and lifted the potlids suddenly for a puff of fine smell to come out in advance to a man of less patriotic feeling this might thus have commended itself but to my mind there was nothing visible in these hills and valleys and their sloping towards the sea which could make a true welshman doubt the priority of welshland for with us the sun is better and the air moves less in creases and the sea has more of rapid gaiety in breaking the others may have higher cliffs or deeper valleys down them also if they like to think so darker woods for robbers nestsbut our own land has a sweetness and a gentle liking for us and a motherly pleasure in its bosom when we do come home to it such as no other land may claimaccording to my experience these were my sentiments as i climbed upon the ensuing sunday a lofty hill near the ilfracombe road commanding a view of the bristol channel and the welsh coast beyond it the day was so clear that i could follow the stretches and curves of my native shore from the low lands of gower away in the west through the sandy ridges of aberavon and the grey rocks of sker and porthcawl as far as the eastern cliffs of dunraven and the fading bend of st donats the sea between us looked so calm and softly touched with shaded lights and gentle variations also in unruffled beauty so fostering and benevolent that the white sailed coasters seemed to be babies fast asleep on their mothers lap how long is this mere river to keep me from my people at home i cried it looks as if one could jump it almost a child in a cockleshell could cross it at these words of my own a sudden thought which had never occurred before struck me so that my brain seemed to buzz but presently reason came to my aid and i said no no it is out of the question without even a thread of sail i must not let these clods laugh at me for such a wild idea and the name in the stern of the boat as well downright santa lucia chowne must have drowned those two poor children and then rehearsed this farce of a burial with the captains hat on to enable his man to swear truly to it tush i am not in my dotage yet i can see the force of everything chapter l a brave man runs away it may be the power of honesty or it may be strength of character coupled with a more than usual brightness of sagacitybut whatever the cause may be the result seems always to be the same in spite of inborn humilityto wit that poor old davy llewellyn wherever his ups and downs may throw him always has to take the lead this necessity as usual seemed to be arising now at narnton courtthe very last place in the world where one could have desired it since the present grand war began with the finest promise of lasting because nobody knows any cause for it so that it must be a law of nature i have not found much occasion to dwell upon common inland incidents these are in nature so far below all maritime proceedings that a sailor is tempted to forget such trifles as people are doing ashore even upon holy scripture since the stirring times began for me henceforth to chronicle it has not been my goodluck to be able to sit and think of anything nevertheless i am almost sure that it must have been an active man of the name of nehemiah who drew for his rations every day one fat ox and six choice sheep and fowls of order various all of these might i have claimed if my capacity had been equal to this great occasion hence it may be well supposed that the kitchen was my favourite place whenever i deigned to enter into converse with the servants at first the headcook was a little shy but i put her soon at her ease by describing from my vast breadth of experience the proper manner to truss and roast a manand still better a woman the knowledge i displayed upon a thing so far above her level coupled with my tales of what we sailors did in consequence led this excellent creature so to appreciate my character and thirst for more of my narratives that i never could come amiss even at dishingup time but here i fell into a snare as every seaman is sure to do when he relaxes his mind too much in the charms of female society not concerning the cook herselffor i gave her to understand at the outset that i was not a marrying man and she possessing a husband somewhere resolved not to hanker after mebut by means of a fair young maid newly apprenticed to our headcook although of a loftier origin more than once while telling my stories i had obtained a little glimpse of long bright ringlets flashing and of shy young eyes just peeping through the hatch of the scullerydoor where the huckaback towel hung down from the roller and then on detection there used to ensue a very quick fumbling of small red hands as if being dried with a desperate haste in the old jacktowel and then a short sigh and light feet retiring when this had happened for three or four times i gave my headcook a sudden wink and sprang through the scullerydoor and caught the little red hands in the fold of the towel and brought forth the owner in spite of deep blushes and even a little scream or two then i placed her in a chair behind the jackchains and continued my harrowing description of the way i was larded for roasting once by a score of unclothed gabooners also how the skewers of barwood thrust in to make me of a good rich colour when i should come to table had not that tenacity which our english wood is gifted with so that i was enabled to shake after praying to god for assistance my right arm out and then my left and after clapping both together to restore circulation it came providentially into my head to lay hold of the spit and charge them and then ensued such a scene as i could not even think of laying before young and delicate females this young girl whoso name was polly always at this pitch of terror not only shivered but shuddered so and needed support for her figure beyond the power of stays to communicate also let such tears begin to betray themselves and then retreat and then come out and defy the world with a brave sob at their back almostthat i do not exaggerate in saying how many times i had the pleasure of roasting myself for the sake of them however it always does turn out that pleasures of this sort are transient and i could not have been going on with polly more than ten days at the utmost when i found myself in a rare scrape to be sure and this was the worse because sir philip so strongly desired my presence now perhaps in the vain hope of my convincing that obstinate squire of his brothers innocence when that brother should return now i need not have spoken as yet of miss polly if she had been but a common servant because in that case her peace of mind would have been of no consequence to the household but as it happened she was a person of no small importance by reason of the very lofty nature of her connections for she was no less than genuine niece to the ladyhousekeeper mrs cockhanterbury herself and hence she became the innocent cause of my departure from narnton court before i had time to begin my inquiries about the two poor little children this i had made up my mind to do as soon as that strange idea had crossed it while i was gazing upon the sea and my meaning was to go through all the traces that might still be found of them and the mode of their disappearance it is true that this resolve was weakened by a tempest which arose that very same evening after the channel had looked so insignificant and which might have been expected after that appearance nevertheless i must have proceeded according to my intention if my heart had not been too much for me in the matter of polly cockhanterbury being just now in my sixtieth year i could not prove such a coxcomb of course as to imagine that a pretty girl of twoandtwenty could care for me so that no course remained open to me as an honourable man and gallant british officer who studies his own peace of mind except to withdraw from this too tempting neighbourhood and in this resolution i was confirmed by mrs cockhanterburys reluctance to declare in a binding manner her intentions towards her niece also by finding that somehow or other the whole of the groundfloor at narnton court had taken it into their heads to regard me as a man of desirable substance it is possible that in larger moments when other people were boasting i may have insisted a little too much upon my position as landowner in the parish of newton nottage also i may have described too warmly my patronage of the schoolmaster and investment of cash with a view to encourage the literature of the parish but i never could have saidwhat all of them deposed tosuch a very strong untruth as to convey the conclusion even to a devonshire state of mind that colonel lougher and i divided the whole of the parish between us be that as it may there was not any maid over thirty who failed to set her cap at me and my silver hair was quite restored to a youthful tinge of gold hence i was horrified at the thought that polly might even consent to have me for the sake of my property and upon discovering its poetical existence lead me a perfectly wretched life as bad as that of poor heaviside so that in spite of all attractions and really serious business and the important duty of awaiting the captains return from pomeroy castle and even in spite of jerry toms offer to take polly off my handsas if she would say a word to himand all the adjurations of poor heaviside who had defied his wife all the time i was there to back him up and now must have to pay out for itwhat did i do but agree to doff my uniform and work my passage on board the majestic a foreandaftrigged limestone boat of fortyeight tons and a half of course she was bound on the usual business of stealing the good colonel loughers rocks but i distinctly stipulated to have nothing to do with that my popularity now was such with all ranks of society also i found myself pledged for so many stories that same evening that i imparted to none except sir philip and polly and jerry toms and heaviside and one or two more the scheme of my sudden departure my mind was on the point of changing when i beheld sweet pollys tears until i felt that i must behave at my time of life as her father would because she had no father when i brought the majestic into shallow water off the tuskar every inch of which i knew it was no small comfort to me that i could not see the shore for years i had longed to see that shore and dreamed of it perpetually while tossing ten thousand miles away and now i was glad to have it covered with the twilight fogginess it suited me better to land at night only because my landing would not be such as i was entitled to and every one knows how the navy and army drop in public estimation when the wars seem to be done with therefore i expected little and i give you my word that i got still less it may have been over eleven oclock but at any rate nothing to call very late just at the crest of the summertime when i gave three good strong raps at the door of my own cottage knowing exactly where the knots were i had not met a single soul to know me or to speak my name although the moon was a quarter old and i found a broken spar and bore it as i used to bear my fishingpole no man who has not been long aroving can understand all the fluttering ways of a mans heart when he comes home again how he looks at every one of all the old houses he knows so well at first as if he feared it for having another piece built on or grander people inside of it and then upon finding this fear vain he is almost ready to beg its pardon for not having looked at it such a long time it is not in him to say a word to or even about the children coming out thus to stare at him all the children he used to know are gone to days work long ago and the new ones would scarcely trust him so as to suck a foreign lollipop he knows them by their mothers but he cannot use their names to them there is nothing solid dwelling for a poor man long away except the big trees that lay hold upon the ground in earnest and the tombstones keeping up his right to the parish churchyard along the wall of this i glanced with joy to keep outside of it while i struck for the third time strongly at not being let into mine own house at last a weak and faltering step sounded in my little room and then a voice came through the latchhole man of noise how dare you thus you will wake up our young lady master roger let me in know you not your own landlord the learned schoolmaster was so astonished that he could scarcely draw back the bolt is it so is it so indeed i thank the lord for sending thee was all he could say while he stood there shaking both my hands to the very utmost that his slender palms could compass friend llewellyn he whispered at last i beg thy pardon heartily for having been so rude to thee but it is such a business to hush the young lady and if she once wakes she talks all the night long i fear that her mind is almost too active for a maid of her tender years what young lady do you mean i asked is bunny become a young lady now bunny he cried with no small contempt then perceiving how rude this was to me began casting about for apologies never mind that i said only tell me who this wonderful young lady is miss andalusia the maid of sker as every one now begins to call her there is no other young lady in the neighbourhood to my knowledge nor in the whole world for you i should say by the look of your eyes master roger berkrolles nevertheless put your coat on my friend and give your old landlord a bit to eat i trow that the whole of my house does not belong even to miss delushy have i not even a granddaughter to be sure and a very fine damsel she is ay and a good and comely one though she hath no turn for erudition what we should do without bunny i know not she is a most rare young housewife the tears sprang into my eyes at this as i thought of her poor grandmother and i gave master berkrolles hand a squeeze which brought some into his as well let me see her was all i said it is not easy to break her rest unless she is greatly altered she is not in bed she is singing her young friend to sleep i will call her presently this was rather more however than even my patience could endure so i went quietly up the stairs and pushing the door of the best room gently there i heard a pretty voice and saw a very pretty sight in a little bed which seemed almost to shine with cleanliness there lay a young girl fast asleep but lying in such a way that none who had ever seen could doubt of her that is to say with one knee up and the foot of the other leg thrown back and showing through the bedclothes as if she were running a race in sleep and yet with the back laid flat and sinking into the pillow deeply while a pair of little restless arms came out and strayed on the coverlet her full and lively red lips were parted as if she wanted to have a snore also her little nose well up and the rounding of the tender cheeks untrimmed to the maiden oval down upon these dark lashes hung fluttering with the pulse of sleep while heavy clusters of curly hair dishevelled upon the pillow framed the gentle curve of the forehead and smiling daintiness of the whole near this delicate creature sate in a bending attitude of protection a strong and wellmade girl with black hair jetblack eyes and a rosy colour spread upon a round plump face she was smiling as she watched the effect of an old welsh air which she had been singingar hyd y nos to look at her size and figure you would say that her age was fourteen at least but i knew that she was but twelve years old as she happened to be our bunny you may suppose that this child was amazed to see her old granny again once more and hardly able to recognise him except by his voice and eyes and manner and a sort of way about him such as only relations have for really if i must tell the truth the great roundness of the world had taken such a strong effect upon me that i had not been able to manage one straight line towards newton nottage for something over six years now perhaps i have said that the admiralty did not encourage our correspondence and most of us were very well content to allow our dear friends to think of us so that by my pay alone could my native parish argue whether i were alive or dead it would not become me to enter into the public rejoicing upon the morrow after my wellaccustomed face was proved to be genuine at the jolly there are moments that pass our very clearest perception and judgment and even our strength to go through them again and it was too early yetexcept for a man from low latitudesto call for rumandwater the whole of this i let them know while capable of receiving it chapter li triple education master roger berkrolles had proved himself a schoolmaster of the very driest honesty this expression upon afterthought i beg to use expressly my own honesty is of a truly unusual and choice character and i have not found say a dozen men fit anyhow to approach it but there is always a sense of humour and a view of honour wagging in among my principles to such an extent that they never get dry as the multiplicationtable does master berkrolles was a man of too much mind for joking therefore upon the very first morning after my return and even before our breakfasttime he poured me out such a lot of coin as i never did hope to see himself regarding them as no more than so many shells of the sea to count all these he had saved from my pay in a manner wholly beyond my imagination because though i love to make money of people i soon let them make it of me again and this was my instinct now but roger laid his thin hand on the heap most gravely and through his spectacles watched me softly so that i could not be wroth with him friend llewellyn i crave your pardon all this money is lawfully yours neither have i or anybody the right to meddle with it but i beg you to consider what occasions may arise for some of these coins hereafter also if it should please the lord to call me away while you are at sea what might become of the dear child bunny without this mammon to procure her friends would you have her like poor andalusia dependent upon charity hush i whispered too late however for there stood bardie herself a slim lightfooted and graceful child about ten years old just then i think her dress of slatecoloured stuff was the very plainest of the plain and made by hands more familiar with the needle than the scissors no ornament or even change of colour was she decked with not so much as a white crimped frill for the fringes of hair to dance upon no child that came to the well so long as she possessed a mother ever happened to be dressed in this denying manner but two girls blessed with good stepmothers having children of their own were indued as was known already with dresses cut from the selfsame remnant now as she looked at roger berkrolles with a steadfast wonder not appearing for the moment to remember me at all a deep spring of indefinite sadness filled her dark grey eyes with tears charity she said at last if you please sir what is charity charity my dear is kindness the natural kindness of good people is it what begins at home sir as they say in the copy books yes my dear but it never stops there it is a most beautiful thing it does good to everybody you heard me say my dear child that you are dependent on charity it is through no fault of your own remember but by the will of god you need not be ashamed to depend on the kindness of good people her eyes shone for a moment with bright gratitude towards him for reconciling her with her pride and then being shy at my presence perhaps she turned away just as she used to do and said to herself very softlyi would rather have a home thoughi would rather have a home and a father and mother of my own instead of beautiful charity master berkrolles told me when she was gone that many children of the place had no better manners than to be always shouting after her when coming back from the sandhills wheres your father wheres your mother wheres your home delushy this of course was grievous to her and should never have been done and i let roger know that his business was to stop any scandal of this kind but he declared that really the whole of his mind was taken up and much of his body also in maintaining rule and reason through the proper hours after schooltime it was not the place of the schoolmaster but of the parson of the parish or by deputy churchwardens or failing them the clerk and if he were out of the way the sexton to impress a certain tone of duty on the young ones especially the sexton need not even call his wife to help if he would but have the wit to cultivate more young thoughtfulness by digging a grave every other day and trusting the lord for orders it was not long before delushy learned some memory of me partly with the aid of bunny partly through the ship i madesuch as no other man could turn outpartly through my uniform and the rest of it by means of goodness only can tell what a man who is knocked about all over rounds and flats and sides of mountains also kicked into and out of every hole and corner and the strong and weak places of the earth and upset after all the most by his fellowcreatures doings although he may have started with more principle than was good for him comes home in the end to look at results far more than causes this was exactly mine own case i can hardly state it more clearly i wanted no praise from anybody because i felt it due to me a fellow who doubts about himself may value approbation and such was the case with me perhaps while misunderstood by the magistrates but now all the money which i had saved under stewardship of berkrolles enabled all my household to stand up and challenge calumny there is a depth of tender feeling in the hearts of welshmen such as cannot anywhere else be discovered by a welshman heartily we love to find man or woman of our own kin even at the utmost nip of the calipers of pedigree doing anything which reflects a spark of glory on us of this man or woman even we make all the very utmost to the extremest point where truth assuages patriotism the whole of our neighbourhood took this matter from a proper point of view and sent me such an invitation to a public dinner that i was obliged to show them all the corners of the road when the stupid fellows thought it safer to conduct me home again upon that festive occasion also sandy macraw took a great deal too much so entirely in honour of me that i felt the deepest goodwill towards him before the evening was over even going so far it appears as to discharge him from all backrent for the use of my little frigate i certainly could not remember such an excess of generosity upon the following morning until he pulled off his hat and showed me the following document inscribed with a pencil on the lining dearest and best of friendsafter the glorious tribute paid by the generous scotchman to the humble but warmhearted cambrian the latter would be below contempt if he took a penny from him signed david llewellyn witness rees hopkins chairman his mark after this and the public manner of my execution there was nothing to be said except that sandy macraw was below contempt for turning to inferior use the flow of our finest feelings therefore i went with some indignation to resume possession of my poor boat which might as well have been sandys own during the last five years and more however i could not deny that the scotchman had kept his part of the contract well for my boat was beautifully clean and in excellent repair in a word as good as new almost so i put miss delushy on board of her with bunny for the ladysmaid and finding a strong ebb under us i paddled away towards sker and landed bravely at pool tavan for poor black evan lay now in our churchyard by the side of his live bold sons having beheld the white horse as plainly as any of the coroners jury the reason was clear enough to all who know anything of medicine to wit his unwise and pernicious step in prostituting his constitution to the use of water if any unfortunate man is harassed with such want of selfrespect and utter distrust of providence as well as unpleasancy of behaviour towards all worthy neighbours and black ingratitude to his life as to make a vow for ever never to drink any good stuff again that man must be pitied largely but let no one speak harshly of him because he must so soon be dead and this in half the needful time if formerly he went on too much poor moxy now with young watkin only carried on this desert farm it was said that no farmer ever since the abbots were turned out could contrive to get on at sker one after the other failed to get a return for the money sunk into the desolate sandy soil black evans father took the place with a quarter of a bushel heaped with golden guineas of queen anne and very bravely he began but nothing ever came of it except that he hanged himself at last and left his son to go on with it what chance was there now for moxy with no money and one son only and a far better heart than head nevertheless she would not hear for one moment of such a thing as giving up delushy this little maid had a way of her own of winding herself into peoples hearts given to her by the lord himself to make up for hard dealings moxy loved her almost as much as her own son watkin and was brought with the greatest trouble to consent to lose her often for the sake of learning because there never could be at sker the smallest chance of growing strongly into education and everybody felt that bardie was of a birth and nature such as demanded this thing highly however even this public sentiment might have ended in talk alone if lady bluett had not borne in mind her solemn pledge to me roger berkrolles would have done his best of course to see to it but his authority in the parish hung for a while upon female tongues which forced him to be most cautious so that i though seven years absent am beyond doubt entitled to the credit of this childs scholarship i had seen the very beginning of it as i must have said long ago but what was that compared with all that happened in my absence berkrolles was a mighty scholar knowing every book almost that ever in reason ought to have been indited or indicted and his calm opinion was that he never had led into letters such a mind as bardies she learned more in a week almost than all the rising generation sucked in for the quarter not a bit of milching knowledge could he gently offer her ere she dragged the whole of it out of his crop like a young pigeon feeding and sometimes she would put such questions that he could do nothing more than cover both his eyes up all such things are well enough for people who forget how much the body does outweigh the mind being meant of course to do so getting more food as it does and able to enjoy it more by reason of less daintiness but for my part i have always found it human prudence to prevent the mind or soul or other parts invisible from conspiracy to outgo what i can see and feel and manage and be punished for not heedingthat is to say my body now the plan arranged for bardie was the most perfect that could be imagined springing from the will of providence and therefore far superior to any human invention master berkrolles told me that a human being may be supposed to consist principally of three partsthe body which is chiefly water this i could not bear to hear of unless it were salt water which he said might be the case with me the mind which may be formed of air if it is formed of anything and the soul which is strong spirit and for that reason keeps the longest accordingly this homeless maidens time was so divided that her three parts were provided for one after other most beautifully she made her rounds with her little bag from sker to candleston court and thence to master berkrolles at my cottage and back again to sker when moxy could not do without her she would spend perhaps a fortnight at candleston then a fortnight in newton village and after that a month at sker more or less as might be according to the weather and the chances of conveyance at candleston of course she got the best of bodily food as well but lady bluett made a point of attending especially to her soul not in a sanctimonious way but concerning grace and manners and the love of music and the handling of a knife and fork and all the thousand little things depending on that part of us and here she was made a most perfect pet and wore very beautiful clothes and so on but left them all behind and went as plain as a nun to newton as soon as the time arrived for giving her mind its proper training now when her mind was ready to burst with the piles of learning stored in it and she could not sleep at night without being hushed by means of singing moxy would come from sker to fetch her and scold both the master and bunny well for the paleness of delushys face and end by begging their pardon and bearing the child away triumphantly with watkin to carry the bag for her and then for a month there was play and seaair and rocks to climb over and sandhills and rabbits and wildfowl to watch by the hour and bathing throughout the summertime and nothing but very plain food at regular intervals of fine appetite so the overactive mind sank back to its due repose and the tender cheeks recovered with kind natures nursing all the bloom the flowers have because they think of nothing also the lightsome feet returned and the native grace of movement and the enjoyment of good runs and laughter unrepressed but made harmonious by discipline and then the hair came into gloss and the eyes to depths of brightness and all the mysteries of wisdom soon were tickled out of her this was the life she had been leading now for some six years or more and being of a happy nature she was quite contented in the boat i did my utmost that day to examine her as to all her recollections of her early history but she seemed to dwell upon nothing now except the most trifling incidents such as a crab lifting up the cover one day when old davy was boiling him or dutch being found with a lot of small dutches and nobody knew where they came from she had no recollection of any boat or even a coroners inquest and as to papa and mama and brothershe put her hand up to her beautiful forehead to think and then wondered about them having cleverly brought you thus to a proper acquaintance with the present situation i really think that you must excuse me from going into all moxys transports called forth by the sight of me in spite of all that i always say in depreciation of myself ay and often mean it too nobody can have failed to gather that my countrymen at large and which matters more my countrywomen take a most kind view of me and it would have been hard indeed if moxy could not find a tear or two and watkin now was a fine young fellow turned of twenty some time ago straight as an arrow and swift as a bird but shy as a trout in a mountainstream from a humble distance he admired miss delushy profoundly and was ever at her beck and call so that of course she liked him much but entertained a feminine contempt for such a fellow chapter lii great march of intellect now i come to larger actions and the rise of great events and the movements of mankind enough to make their mother earth tremble and take them for suicides and even grudge her bosom for their naked burial often had i longed for war not from love of slaughter but because it is so good for us it calls out the strength of a man from his heart into the swing of his legs and arms and fills him with his duty to the land that is his mother and scatters far away small things and shows beyond dispute gods wisdom when he made us male and female the fair sex after long peace always want to take the lead of us having rash faith in their quicker vigour of words and temper but they prove their goodness always coming down to their work at once when the blood flows and the bones are split into small splinters and a man dies bravely in their arms through doing his duty to them but though war is good no doubt till men shall be too good for it there was not one man as yet in great britain who would have gone of his own accord into the grand and endless war at this time impending master roger berkrolles told me that throughout all history every in and out of which he knew while pretending otherwise never had been known such war and destruction of gods men as might now be looked for he said that it was no question now of nation against nation such as may be fought out and done with after rapid victory neither a piece of mere covetousness for a small advance of dominion nor even a contest of dynasties which might prove the tougher one but that it was universal clash half of mankind imbittered to a deadly pitch with the other half and that now no peace could be till one side was crushed under these things were beyond my grasp of widest comprehension neither could i desire a war begun about nothing anyhow if the frenchmen insulted our flag or wanted back some of their islands or kept us from examining their customs when imported no true briton could hesitate to keep his priming ready but at present they were only plucking up courage to affront us being engrossed with their own looseness and broad spread of idiocy for they even went the length of declaring all men to be equal the whole world common property and the very names of the months all wrong after this it was natural and one might say the only sensible thing they ever did to deny the existence of their maker for it could hardly be argued that the almighty ever did lay hand to such a lot of scoundrels now if these rats of the bilgehole had chosen to cock their tails in their dirt and devour one another pleasure alone need have been the feeling of the human race looking down at them but the worst of it was that real men and women far above them took up their filthy tricks and antics and their little buckjumps and allowed their judgment so to be taken with grimaceseven as a man who mocks a fit may fall into itthat in every country there were sympathisers with the great and glorious march of intellect in devonshire i had heard none of all this for none of the servants ever set eyes or desired to do so on public journals they had heard of these but believed them to be very dangerous and wicked things also devoid of interest for what was the good of knowing things which anybody else might knowe and even if they had taken trouble ever to hear of the great outbreak they would have replied until it led to recruiting in their own parish thiccy be no consarn to we but in our enlightened neighbourhood things were very different there had long been down among us ever so many largeminded fellows anxious to advance mankind by great jumps towards perfection and in this they showed their wisdom being all young bachelors to strive to catch the golden age before they got rheumatics however to men whose life has been touched with the proper grey and brown of earth all these bright ideas seemed a baseless dance of rainbows mans perfection was a thing we had not found in this world and being by divine wisdom weaned from human pride concerning it we could be well content to wait our inevitable opportunity for seeking it in the other world we had found this world wag slowly sometimes better and sometimes worse pretty much according to the way in which it treated us neither had we yet perceived in the generation newly breeched any grand advance but rather a very poor backsliding from what we were at their time of life we all like a strong fellow when we see him and we all like a very bright child who leaps through our misty sense of childhood to either of these an average chap knocks under when quite sure of it and yet in our parish there was but one of the one sort and one of the other bardie of course of the new generation and old davy of the elder it vexes me to tell the truth so but how can i help it unless i spoil my story ever so many people got a meeting in the chapel up to sign a paper and to say that nobody could guess the mischief done by all except themselves they scouted the french revolution as the direct work of the devil and in the very next sentence vowed it the work of the seventh angel to shatter the church of england they came with this rubbish for me to sign and i signed it and some of them also with my wellattested toe and heel after such a demonstration any man of candid mind falls back on himself to judge if he may have been too forcible but i could not see my way to any crossroad of repentance and when i found what good i had done i wished that i had kicked harder by doing so i might have quenched a pestilential doctrine as every orthodox person told me when they heard how the fellows ran butas my bad luck always conquersi had but a pair of wornout pumps on and the only toe which a man can trust through his own defects of discipline happened to be in hospital now and short of spring and flavour nevertheless some good was done for parson lougher not only praised me but in his generous manner provided a new pair of shoes for me to kick harder if again so visited and the news of these prevented them but even the way these fellows had to rub themselves was not enough to stop the spreading of low opinions for the strength of my manifestation was impressive rather than permanent also all the lower lot of nonconformists and schismatics ran with their tongues out like mad dogs all over the country raving snapping at every good gentlemans heels and yelping that the seventh vial was open and the seventh seal broken to argue with a gale of wind would show more sense than to try discussion with such a set of ninnies and when i asked them to reconcile their admiration of atheism with their religious fervour one of them answered bravely that he would rather worship the goddess of reason than the god of the church of england however the followers of john wesley and all the respectable methodists scouted these ribalds as much as we did and even hezekiah had the sense to find himself going too far with them and to repair the seventh seal and clap it on hepzibahs mouth for how could he sell a clock if time was declared by the trumpet to be no more amid this universal turmoil uproar and upheaving i received a letter from captain bampfylde very short and without a word of thanks for what i had done for him but saying that he was just appointed to the bellona carrying carronades on the poop that she was fitting now at chatham and in two months time would be at spithead where he was to man her he believed that the greater part of the fine ships company of the thetis would be only too glad to sail under him and he was enabled to offer me the masters berth if i saw fit he said that he knew my efficiency but would not have ventured to take this step but for what i had told him about my thorough acquirement of navigation under the care of a learned man after saying that if i reported myself at narnton court by the end of october he would have me cared for and sent on he concluded with these stirring words there is a great war near at hand our country will want every man young or old who can fight a gun these last words fixed my resolve i had not been very well treated perhaps at any rate my abilities had not been recognised too highly lest they should have to be paid for with a little handsomeness but a man of large mind allows for this feeling that the world of course would gladly have him at halfprice but when it came to talking of the proper style to fight a gun how could i give way to any small considerations fuzzy and ike were stealing rock at this particular period in a new ketch called the devil wholly in honour of parson chowne and through these worthy fellows and bang now the most trustworthy of all i sent a letter to narnton court accepting the mastership of his majestys ship of the line bellona now everybody in earnest began to call me captain llewellynnot at my own instigation but in spite of all done to the contrary the master of a ship must be the captain they argued obstinately and my wellknown modesty had the blame of all that i urged against it but i need not say any more about it because the war has gone on so long and so many seamen have now been killed that the nation has been stirred up to learn almost a little about us while i was dwelling on all these subjects who should appear but miss delushy newly delivered from candleston court on her round of high education and to my amazement who but lieutenant bluett delivered her i had not even heard that he was come home so much does a man when he rises in life fail in proper wakefulness but now he leaped down from the forecastle and with a grave and most excellent courtesy and his bright uniform very rich and noble and his face outdoing it forth he led this little lady who was clad in simple grey she descended quite as if it was the proper thing to do and then she turned and kissed the tips of her fingers to him gracefully and she was not yet eleven years old how can we be amazed at any revolutions after this bardie i cried with some indignation as if she were growing beyond my control and she stood on the spring of her toes exactly as she had done when two years old and offered her bright lips for a kiss to prove that she was not arrogant none but a surly bear could refuse her still my feelings were deeply hurt that other people should take advantage of my being from home so much to wean the affections of this darling from her own old davy and perhaps to set up a claim for her berkrolles knew what my rights were and finding him such a quiet man i gave it to him thoroughly well before i went to bed that night i let him know that his staying there depended wholly upon myself not only as his landlord but as holding such a position now in newton and nottage and miles around that the lifting of my finger would leave him without a scholar or a crust also i wished him to know that he must not as a wretched landsman take any liberties with me because i had allowed him gratis to impart to me the vagueness of what he called mathematics in the question of navigation of that queer science i made out some but the rest went from me through the clearness of my brain which let things pass through it otherwise i would have paid him gladly if he had earned it but he said or i may myself have said to suggest some sense to him that my brain was now too full of experience for experiments and of all the knowledge put into me by this good man carefully and i may say laboriously i could not call to mind a letter figure stroke or even sign when i led the british fleet into action at the battle of the nile nevertheless it may all have been there steadily underlying all coming through great moments like a quiet perspiration but if i could not take much learning here was some one else who could and there could be no finer sight for lovers of education than to watch old mr berkrolles and his pupil entering into the very pith of everything i could not perceive any cause for excitement in a dull matter of this sort nevertheless they seemed to manage to get stirred up about it for when they came to any depth of mystery for fathoming it was beautiful to behold the long white hair and the short brown curls dancing together over it that good old roger was so clever in every style of teaching that he often feigned not to know a thing of the simplest order to him so that his pupil might work it out and have a bit of triumph over him he knew that nothing puts such speed into little folk and their stepsbe they of mind or bodyas to run a race with grownup people whether nurse or tutor but in spite of all these brilliant beams of knowledge now shed over her our poor bardie was held fast in an awkward cleft of conscience i may not have fully contrived to show that this little creature was as quick of conscience as myself almost although of course in a smaller way and without proper sense of proportions but there was enough of it left to make her sigh very heavily lest she might have gone too far in one way or the other her meaning had been from her earliest years to marry or be married she had promised me through my grey whiskers often with two years to teach her her own mind never as long as she lived to accept any one but old davy we had settled it ever so many times while she sate upon my shoulder and she smacked me every now and then to prove that she meant matrimony now when i called to her mind all this she said that i was an old stupid and she meant to do just what she liked though admitting that everybody wanted her and after a little thought she told me crossing her legs in the true old style and laying down her lashes that her uncertainty lay between master roger and mr bluett she had promised them both she did believe without proper time to think of it and could she marry them both because the one was so young and the other so old i laid before her that the proper middle age of matrimony could not be attained in this way though in the present upsidedown of the world it might come to be thought of and then she ran away and danced exactly as she used to do and came back with her merry laugh to argue the point again with me before i set off for narnton court on my way to join the bellona lieutenant bluett engaged my boat and my services both with oar and net for a days whole pleasure off shore and on i asked how many he meant to take for the craft was a very light one but he answered as many as ever he chose for he hoped that two officers of the royal navy knew better than to swamp a boat in a dead calm such as this was my selfrespect derived such comfort from his outspoken and gallant way of calling me a brother officer as well as from the most delicate air of ignorance which he displayed when i took up a twoguinea piece which happened to have come through my roof at this moment perhaps or at any rate somehow to be lying in an old tobaccobox on my table that i declared my boat and self at his command entirely we had a very pleasant party and not so many as to endanger us if the ladies showed good sense colonel lougher and lady bluett also the lieutenant of course and a young lady staying at candleston court and doing her utmost to entrap the youthful sailorher name has quite escaped mealso delushy and myself these were all or would have been all if master rodney had not chanced as we marched away from my cottage with two men carrying hampers to espy in the corner of the old well a face so sad and eyes so black that they pierced his happy and genial heart ill give it to you you sly minx i cried for an impudent brazen trick like this what orders did i give you miss a master of a ship of the line and not master of his own grandchild the young lieutenant laughed so that the rushes on the sandhills shook for he saw in a moment all the meaning of this most outrageous trick bunny forgetting her grade in life had been crying ever since she awoke at receiving no invitation to this great festivity she had even shown illwill and jealousy towards bardie and a want of proper submission to her inevitable rank in the world i perceived that these vile emotions grew entirely from the demagogic spirit of the period which must be taken in hand at once wherefore i boxed her ears with vigour and locked her into an empty cupboard there to wait for our return with a junk of bread and a cheeserind however she made her way out as her father had done with the prison of dunkirk and here she was in spite of all manners good faith and discipline let her come she deserves to come she shall come master rodney cried and as all the others said the same i was forced to give in to it and upon the whole i was proud perhaps of our bunnys resolution neither did it turn out ill but rather a good luck for us because the young lady who wooed the lieutenant proved her entire unfitness for a maritime alliance by wanting before we had long been afloat although the sea was as smooth as a duckpond some one to attend upon her every one knows what the tuskar rock is and the caves under southern down neither am i at all of a nature to dwell upon eating and drinking and though all these were of lofty order and i made a fire of wreckwood just to broil some collops of a sewin who came from the water into it through a revival of my old skill and to do a few oysters in their shells with their gravy sputtering to let us know when they were done and to call for a bit of butter no small considerations or most grateful memories of flavour could have whispered to me twice thus to try my mouth with waterings over such a cookery but i have two reasons for enlarging on this happy day and these two would be four at once if any one contradicted them my chief reason is that poor dear bardie first obtained a pure knowledge of her desolate state upon that occasionat least so far as we can guess what works inside the little chips of skulls that we call babyish everybody had spoiled her so being taken with her lovingness and real newness of going on and power to look into things together with such a turn for play as never can be satiated in a world like ours not to mention heaps of things which you must see to understand let me not overdo it now in saying that this little dear had taken such good education through my liberal management as to long to know a little more about herself if possible this is a very legitimate wish and deserving of more encouragement than most of us care to give to it because so many of us are not the waifs and strays and salvage only but the dead shipwrecks of ourselves content with the bottom of the great deep only if no shallow fellows shall come diving down for us having the joy of sun and sea and the gratitude for a most lovely dinner such as none could take from me i happened to lie on my oars and think while all my passengers roved on the rock they were astray upon bladderweed popweed dellusk oarweed ribbons frills kelp wrack or fivetailsanything you like to call them without falling over them my orders were to stand off and on till the gentry had amused themselves only i must look alive for the tuskar rock would be two fathoms under water in about four hours at a mile and a half from the nearest land the sunset wanted not so much as a glance of sea to answer it but lay hovering quietly and fading beneath the dark brows of the cliffs which do sometimes glorify and sometimes so discourage it the meaning of the weather and the arrangement of the sky and sea was not to make a show for once but to let the sunset gently glide into the twilight and the twilight take its time for melting into starlight this i never thus have watched except in our old island there was not a wave to be seen or felt only the glassy heave of the tide lifted my boat every now and then or lapped among the wrinkles of the rocks and spread their fringes not a sound was in the air and on the water nothing except the little tinkling softness of the drops that feathered off from my suspended oarblades floating round a corner thus i came upon a sight as gently sad as sky and sea were a little maid was leaning on a shelf of stone with her hair dishevelled as the kelp it mingled with her plain brown hat was cast aside and her clasped hands hid her face while her slender feet hung down and scarcely cared to paddle in the water that embraced them now and then a quiet sob in harmony with the evening tide showed that the storm of grief was over but the calm of deep sorrow abiding what is the matter my pretty dear i asked after landing and coaxing her tell old davy captain david will see the whole of it put to rights it cannot be put to yights she answered being even now unable to pronounce the r aright although it was rather a lisp than any clear sound that supplied its place it never can be put to yights when the other children had fathers and mothers god left me outside of them and the young lady says that i must not aspiya ever to marry a gentleman i am ony fit for watkin or tommytoms or nobody old dyo why did i never have a father or a mother my dear you had plenty of both i replied but they were shipwrecked and so were you only before the storm came on you were put into this boat somehow nobody living can tell how and the boat came safe though the ship was wrecked this boat she cried spreading out her hands to touch it upon either sidefor by this time i had shipped herwas it this boat saved me yes you beauty of the world now tell me what that wicked girl had the impudence to say to you this i need not here set down enough that it flowed from jealousy jealousy of the lowest order caused by the way in which lieutenant rodney played with bardie this of course interfered with the ladys chances of spreading nets for him so that soon she lost her temper fell upon delushy and upbraided her for being no more than an utterly unknown castaway chapter liii beating up for the navy my other reason for setting down some short account of that evening was to give you a little peace and sense of gratitude to the lord for our many quiet sunsets and the tranquillity of our shores it really seems as if no other land was blest as ours is with quiet orderly folk inside it and good rulers over it and around it not too much of sun or moon or anything unless it may be now and then a little bit of cloudiness and this love of our country seems ever to be strongest whether at departing for the wars with turbulent nations or upon returning home as soon as we have conquered them but now for a long time i shall have very little peace to dwell upon at narnton court i found no solace for my warmth of feeling polly had been sent out of the way on purpose because i was coming which was a most unhandsome thing on the part of mrs cockhanterbury for the very expectation which had buoyed me up at a flattish period and induced me to do without three quids of crosscut negrohead was my simple and humble looking forward to my polly i knew that i was a fool of course but still i could not help it and i had got on so well among young women always that i found it very hard to miss the only chance i cared for i feared that my age was beginning to tell for often since i had been ashore my rheumatics had come back again neither was that my only grief and source of trouble at this time but many other matters quite as grave combined against me heaviside was not there to talk and make me hug my singleness nor even jerry toms nor the cook who used to let me teach her it was not that all these had left the place for any mischief in an ancient household such a loss is not allowable all meant to come back again when it suited their opportunities and each perceived that the house was sure to go to the dogs in the absence of themselves and one another heaviside had found nanette in spite of my best prognostics overget her seventh occasion of producing small crappos and his natural disappointment with her led to such words that he shouldered his bundle and made off for spithead in company with jerry who was compelled to forsake his creditors and as for the cook i did hear though unable to believe it that she was in trouble about a young fellow scarcely worthy to turn her jack in other respects i found that nothing of much importance had occurred since i was there in the summertime sir philip continued to trust in the lord and the squire to watch the sunsets neither had the latter been persuaded to absolve his brother the captain had been at home one or two days inquiring into my discovery of the buried dolls he did not attach so much importance to this matter as his father had done but said that it made a mysterious question even more mysterious and failing as a blunt sailor would to make either head or tail of it and being disgusted with his brother for refusing to see him he vowed to remain in the house no longer but set off for pomeroy castle again where he had formed a close friendship with the eldest son of the owner his ladylove the fair isabel was not living there now but might very easily be met with for on coming of age three years ago she had taken possession of her domain carey park a magnificent place adjoining the pomeroy property it was said that the earl had done his best to catch the young heiress for his son and therefore had made a pretext of the old charge against the captain for the purpose of putting a stop to communication with him but his son lord mohun upon finding how the young ladys heart was settled withdrew his suit like a man of honour and all the more promptly perhaps because he had made up his mind to another lady before miss carey came to them it was said that the captain might now have persuaded the beautiful heiress to marry him and finish their long affection if he could have thoroughly made up his mind that honour would bear him out in it for her confidence was so perfect in him that she left it to his own judgment herself perhaps longing to put an end to their wearisome uncertainty sir philip heard of it and came down to implore them thus to settle themselves and captain bampfylde was so hard set by the nature of the case that he might have been enticed away from what his conscience told him this was that the solemn oath which he had taken in the church with isabel beside him to purge himself of all foul charges ere he made another guilty if himself were guilty could not thus be laid aside without a loss of honour sir philip would be the last man in the world to counsel dishonest actions but being an old man and reluctant that his race should all expire he looked upon that sacrament as no more than a piece of sacrilege or a hasty pledge of which the lord would never take advantage nobody knows what might have happened with captain bampfylde so beset and longing to think that he ought to act as everybody told him but he begged for a night to think over it and in the morning he received his appointment to the bellona even sir philip could not deny that the hand and the will of the almighty must herein be recognised and there was a chance of a brush with spain about the nootka sound just then and if anything makes a sailors fortune it is a fight with these fine old dons a frenchman is sure to be captured but not half so sure as a spaniard and the hidalgoes do turn out good gold with good manners behind it many ships have i boarded but with brightest alacrity always a good fat old spaniard therefore the captain brushed away any little weakness and set out for spithead bravely in a bachelor condition and after trying to collect what news there was at narnton and finding that i must not think of meeting my dear polly i quietly drew my travellingmoney and set forth to join him only every one will reproach me and have right to do so if i fail to tell the latest tidings of that parson chowne people seemed to like this man because they never could make him out and nearly all the world is pleased to hear of the rest being vanquished it seems that a wholly new bishop arose by reason of the other dying and this gentleman swore on the bible to have things in order when he heard of chowne and his high defiance of all former bishops he said fie fie this must not be i will very soon put this to rights to follow up this resolution he appointed tiverton and the old church of st peter for chowne to bring his young people up to a noble confirmation also for a visitation of the clergy all around such as they have now and then to stop the spread of kings evil his holiness the bishop was surprised to receive this answer my dear lordmy meet is at calverly on the day you speak of we always find a fox hard by and if he should make for stoodleigh coverts i may come down the bolham road in time to meet your lordship at any rate i shall dine at the angel somewhere between three and five oclock and hope to find you there and have a pleasant evening with youyours very truly r s chowne psif you bring your two archdeacons we will have a rubber but i never go beyond guinea points the whole of this was written with cumberland lead on the back of a paper showing how to treat hounds in distemper and the bishop was displeased about it and declined his society especially as he had invitation to the good tidcombe rectory and there he was treated so hospitably by a very handsome family that he put up his glass of a noble wine and saw the sun set through it and vowed that his magna charta or habeas corpus or writ of errori never can remember whichbut at any rate that his royal orders should fall out of his apronpocket if he failed to execute them in this state of mind he received a letter from parson chowne himself full of respect and most cleverly turned as well as describing the parsons grief at being unable to bring to his holiness any one fit to lay hands upon the standard set before them had been before laying on of hands to say the lords prayer backwards and there was not one of them up to it this angered the bishop to such a degree that he ordered out his heavy coach with the six longtailed black horses and the coachman with cockedhat and flowing wig and four great footmen shouldering blunderbusses himself sate inside with his crosier and mitre and lawn sleeves and all the rest of it now this was just the very thing the refractory parson expected therefore he rode round overnight and bade every farmer in the neighbourhood send all his hands with pickaxes and shovels by four oclock the next morning also he gathered all his own men there as well as the unclad folk who were entirely at his orders then he sent for parson jack as being the strongest man about there and imparted his intention to him and placed him over the workmen early in the afternoon the bishops statecarriage was descried moving up the tiverton highroad with a noble and imposing aspect before he arrived at the crossroad leading off to nympton rectory his lordship was surprised to see a great collection of people standing on a hill above the road and all saluting him with the deepest respect not so bad after all he exclaimed brother chowne has brought his men into good order which is the noblest use of the church ah they dont see a bishop every day and they know when a thing is worth looking at for their faces are black with astonishment holloa bob whats that up with the glass your lordship the coachman shouted back or it will be all over with you we are in a damned slough and no mistake and so they were his lordship had no time to slam the windows up before the coach lay wallowing in a bog of nighty blackness in it poured and filled the coach and nearly smothered his lordship who was dragged out at last with the greatest trouble as black as if he were dipped in pitch for the parson had done a most shameful thing and too bad for even him to think of he had taken up his private road and dug out the ground some six feet deep and then by means of carts and harrows transferred to it the contents of a quagmire which lay handy and spread the surface again with roaddirt so that it looked as sound as a rock having seen with a telescope from his window the grand success of his engineering he sent down a groom in smart livery to present his compliments to the traveller who had happened to lose his way and fall into a moorhole and was there anything he could do to mitigate that misfortune but the bishop sputtered out through his chattering teeth that he hoped to hear no more of him and that none but a devonshire man was fit to oversee devonshire parsons and this made the fifth bishop conquered by chowne to return to our noble selvesthat is to say to the better people dealt with in our history at the close of this year to wit upon christmasday of that excellent year of grace no less than three of us dined together of course with a good many others also in the captains cabin of the bellona gun ship of the british navy carrying also six carronades these three were captain drake bampfylde of course the honourable rodney bluett now our second lieutenant and the master of the ship whose name was something like david llewellyn this latter was now remarkable for the dignity of his appearance and the gravity of his deportment and although he was only ranked after the youngest of the lieutenants and just before chits of reefers called by some people midshipmen and though upon any but festive occasions you might not have spied him at the captains table you could scarcely have found any officer more satisfied with his position and more capable of maintaining it we were cruising off the south coast of ireland under orders to search all ships that might be likely to carry arms but as a frigate would have done for that service as well as or better than a we knew that our true commission was to shake together and fall into discipline and bring other seamen into the same if we could get any to join us having a light wind and plenty of searoom we resolved to enjoy ourselves that day and a very delightful party it was especially after i was called on to spin a few of the many true yarns which make me such a general favourite after filling our glasses and drinking the health of his majesty and of the navy at large and especially of our captain we began to talk of the state of affairs and the time at which the war might be expected to declare itself that it must come to a great war with france not even a fool could doubt although he might desire to doubt it ever since the destruction of the bastile in july and throughout all the year and a half since that a wild and desperate multitude had done nothing but abolish all the safeguards of their country and every restraint upon the vilest rabble our wisest plan was to begin at once before this cruel monster should learn the use of its fangs and the strength of its spring but as usual great britain was too slow to seize the cudgel which might haply have saved a million lives however we were preparing quietly for the inevitable conflict as even our presence that day in the cabin of the bellona might indicate master we are sadly short of hands said captain bampfylde addressing me i shall have a poor report to make unless we do something do you think that we could get on without you if i sent you on a cruise for a week or so i think you might sir i answered humbly if it does not come on to blow and if you keep well away from land i have trained mr sebright with so much skill that you may always rely upon him except in any difficulty nobly i spoke and the captains reply was not very far behind me if we carried men he exclaimed with generous candour we could not hope to have more than one master david llewellyn so diffident so truthful so entirely free from jealousy gentlemen is it not so all the officers assented with a pleasant smile to me and then to one another so that i hardly knew what to say except that i could not deserve it our tender the sealark is to meet us in the cove of cork on new years day continued captain bampfylde and after shipping all our stores she will be for a fortnight at my disposal now you know as well as i do that our complement for wartime is men and boys and that our present strength is more than short of that war may be declared any day almost and a pretty figure we should cut against a french liner of guns therefore unless the sealark should bring us a very large draft which i do not expect my resolve is to man and victual her for a fortnights cruise under some one who is a good hand at recruiting would you like the berth master llewellyn sir i know not anything which i should like better our captain perceived that the junior lieutenants looked rather glum at being so passed over from master rodney downwards and though he had the perfect right to appoint any officer he pleased he knew the true wisdom of shunning offence by giving some good reason therefore he went on again there is not one of us i daresay who would not enjoy this little change but i think that llewellyn is our man simply for this reason the part to be beaten up first is the welsh coast from st davids head to penarth i have heard of many good seamen there and especially at llanelly i think that none of our officers can speak welsh except master david even you bluett though coming from wales are not up to the lingo this settled it in the bestnatured manner and all congratulated me and wished me good speed in getting hold of old salts if possible or else fresh young ones not to be too long about it somewhere about epiphany day in the year i stretched away for the coast of wales being in command of the sealark a rattling cutter of tons with two pound bowchasers and a score of picked men under me i have no time now to describe emotions even of the loftiest order such as patriotism modesty generosity selfabasement and many others which i indulged in when i cast anchor off porthcawl and they thought that i meant to bombard them i ordered a boat ashore at once to reassure the natives when i had given a waft of my flag and fired a gun to salute it but being now in such a position and the parish to its utmost corners raving on the subject ashore i durst not trust myself because without rupture of ancient ties and a low impression left behind i could not have got aboard sober again and after that could i knock down any of my crew for being tipsy nevertheless i had bardie and bunny and mother jones with her children and master berkrolles and charles morgan and betsy matthews and moxy thomas all brought in a boat to visit me besides a few others who came without leave they all seemed to be very well and happy and i entertained them beautifully that same afternoon we made a hit enough to encourage anybody we impressed not only my foe the tailor but also hezekiah that is to say it was not quite what might be called impressment because with no war raging yet we could not resort to violence but we made them both so entirely drunk that we were compelled for their own sake to weigh anchor while having their bodies on board i had a stern fellow of noble mind to back me up at all hazard and seeing what a sneak hezekiah was he gave him six dozen out of hand with my official sanction the horologist to the royal family took his allotment worse than almost any man i ever saw however for old acquaintance sake i would not have him salted in spite of this the effect was such that it brought him round to the english church and cured him of all french doctrine and as he gradually began to lose fat and to dwell upon gunnery we found his oiliness most useful to prevent corrosion having worked this coast to our utmost power and gathered a good deal of human stuff some useful and some useless pretty near threescore in all and put upon short rations we thought that we might as well finish our job by slanting across to devonshire because for the most part you there may find more body but less mind than ours which is the proper state of things for the substance of our navy therefore we drafted off to cork all our noble welshmen and made sail for devonshire now before telling what we did i really must guard against any nasty misconstruction whatever had been done to me on the part of parson chowne was by this time so wholly gone out of my heart and mind and everything any man can feel with that nothing was further from my intention than to stir at all in that matter again i knew that in spite of all the deference paid me now on every side and too much for my comfort chowne would turn me inside out ten thousand times worse than stew could this i like to see done when anything wrong can be found inside a man but a thoroughly honest fellow should stick on his honesty and refuse it so when providence in a dream laid before me the great mercy and i might say miracle of impressing the naked people and bringing them under our good chaplain to be trained from the error of their ways and live i felt a sort of delicacy as to trespassing thus upon parson chownes old freehold these naked folk belonged to him and though he did not cultivate them as another man might have done it was not difficult to believe that he found fine qualities in them and to take them from under his very nose might seem like a narrow vexation however times there are when duty overrides all delicacy the bellona was still short of her number by a hundred hands or more and with this reflection i cast away all further hesitation we left the sealark off heddons mouth a wild and desolate part of the coast for my object was to pounce unawares on the parsons savage colony for what we were going to do was not altogether lawful just at present although it very soon would be my force consisted of no less than fifteen jolly wellseasoned tars all thoroughly armed all up for a spree and ready to do any mortal thing at a word or a signal from me if we could only surprise the wild men i had no fear as to our retreat because the feeling of the country would be strongly in our favour as the abaters of a nuisance long pronounced unbearable for five or it may have been six leagues we marched across the moors as straight as possible by compass except when a quagmire or a ridge of rugged stone prevented us we forded several beautiful streams of the brightest crystal water so full of trout that i longed to have a turn at my old calling and we came in view of nympton steeple just as the sun was setting i remembered the lie of the land quite well ever since that night when the fire happened so i halted my men in a little wood and left them to eat their suppers while i slung my spyglass and proceeded to reconnoitre the enemy lying flat upon the crest of a hummocky ridge of moorland i brought my glass to bear through the heather first upon the great parsons house which stood on a hill to the left of me and then on the barbarous settlement the rectory looked as snug and quiet as the house of the very best man could be with a deal more of comfort than most of these contrive to gather around them the dens of the tribe that objected to raiment were quite out of sight from his windows nor were they allowed to present themselves to mrs chowne unless she had done anything to vex him shaping my glass upon these wretches i saw that they were in high festival of course i could not tell the reason but it turned out afterwards that the parsons hounds were off their feed through a sudden attack of distemper and therefore a cartload of carrion had been taken down to the settlement it was lucky that i knew it not for i doubt whether we should have dared to invade their burrows at such a period however i thought that nothing could be more suitable for our enterprise of course they would all overgorge themselves and then their habit of drinking water which alone would establish their barbarism was sure to throw them into deep untroubled sleep till sunrise as soon as one could strike a line from the pointers to the polestar which is a crooked one by the by and as soon as it was dark enough for a man to count the pleiads i called my men with a long low whistle and advanced in double file the savages lay as deeply sleeping as if their consciences were perfect whereas they could have had none at all we entered their principal cuddy or shanty or shieling or wigwam or what you will for it was none of these exactly but a mixture of them all and to our surprise not one awoke or was civilised enough to snore higgledypiggledy they lay in troughs scooped out of the side of the hill or made by themselves of clay and straw called cob i believe in devonshire with some rotten thatch above them and the sides of their den made of brushwood some of the elders had sheepskins over them but the greater part trusted to one another for warmth and to their hairiness all this we saw by a bluelight which i ordered to be kindledfor at first it was as dark as pitchand a stranger or a sadder sight has rarely been seen in england poor creatures they were all so cowed by the brilliant light and the armed men standing in their filthy hovel that they offered no resistance but stared at us in a piteous manner as if we were come to kill them escape was impossible save for the children and most of them thought as we found out afterwards that chowne was tired of them and had ordered their destruction choose all the males from ten years to thirty i shouted to my men who were almost as scared as the savages dont touch the females or ill cut you down set another bluelight burning we dont want any cripples not to be too long with it i only found three men worth impressing the others were so badly built or even actually deformed and of appearance so repulsive that we could not bear to think of turning them into messmates now for the boys i cried we want boys even more then men almost but i found that all the children save one had slipped through the sailors legs adroitly while we were dealing with the men we could not have caught them in the dark and more than this the bestsized of them had popped like snakes into burrowholes or like a fox into his earth but the one who stood his ground and faced us was a noblelooking boy in spite of dirt and nakedness with long thick tangles of golden hair and a forehead like a mans almost he looked up at me in a bold steady manner wholly unlike their savage stare and it struck me that here was the little fellow whom i had saved eight or nine years ago from the horse of parson jack but though he appeared to be twelve years old i could not make out what he said except yes yes and me come with oo such was his state of education i hoisted him on a strong mans back for the long march had made me feel my years and perceiving no call to molest the residue or injure their homesuch as it waswe simply handcuffed the three best fellows and borrowed three pigwhips of their own made right down ingeniously so as to drive them to heddons mouth we durst not halt for a rest until there were three leagues between us and nympton moor then hurrying on at the break of day we found the sealark at anchor and she sent us a boat at our signal scarcely were we on board of the boat and pushing off with our capture when the clash of a horses hoofs upon rock rang through the murmuring of the waves we turned and gazed with one accord for the boat lay broadside on to shore through the kicking of the naked men when they felt salt water under them and our quitting good stroke to attend to them at furious speed a horseman dashed out of the craggy glen and leaped the pool where the brook is barred up and vanishes down the shingle and shelves of wrack he drove his horse into the sea until there was no firmness under him he almost laid hold of our boatnot quite for i struck with an oar at the horse and scared him shouting to all of my crew to pull finding himself just a little too late chowne gave a turn to his horses head and the lather and foam of the spirited animal made a white curdle in the calm blue sea the horse sprang gladly up the shingle crestfor the shore is very steep thereand he shook himself and scattered brine and there were three other horses behind him on one of these sate parson jack and two huntsmen on the other twain and the faces of these were as red as fire with hurry and indignation only chownes wicked face was white and settled with calm fury and his style of address to us just as if we were nothing but dogs of his kennel ho you scoundrels he shouted out hold oars and let me parley you at this i made a signal to my crew to slack from rowing and i stood up in the boat and said what can we do for your reverence nothing for me rogues but much for yourselves i will give you five pounds for that child in the stern i want him for knifecleaning would your worship think fifty too much for him we put him at fifty your worship fifty you robbers well then fifty ten times his value to any one but i have a fancy for him would your worship mind saying five hundred down look at his hair he is worth it for we had washed him in the brook and his hair in drying was full of gold who are you he shouted controlling himself as his habit was when outbreak became useless for the dignity of my demeanour and the nobility of my uniform also the snowiness of my hair combined to defeat the unerring quickness of his rapid and yet cold eyes and so i replied with an elegant bow your reverence it so happens that my name is old davy llewellyn chapter liv taming of the savages after a most successful cruise we returned to our bellona and were received as behoves success with ever so many rounds of cheers it was true that we had sent before us and now brought in an awkward lot but it is beautiful to see how in a large ships company and under a good commander mere coaster fellows become true seamen and even landlubbers learn how to walk captain drake bampfylde did me the honour of asking my advice as soon as his own opinion was settled and i said no more than bay of biscay which was his own opinion here the very utmost of a noble sea awaited us and none of our landsmen had any heart for fat or even for lean stuff we let them go on for a day perpetually groaning and after that we provided for each a gallon of salt water and gave it them through the ships trumpet until they entirely ceased from noise these prudent measures brought them into such a wholesome state of mind that really a child might lead them as by one of the prophets mentioned when i read my bible all of our new hands i mean except hezekiah and the three wild men unfortunate master perkins could not enter into the spirit of our exertions for his benefit because his mind was unsettled with knowing the hardship both of his back and front for his back was covered with raw places sitting amiss to the fit of his clothes while the forward part of his body became too hollow to yield him comfort but strange to say his wrath was kindled not against us for these misfortunes but against his wife hepzibah because she had not predicted them and for the greater part of a week the poor fellow lay in a perfect craze upon the orlopdeck while the ship was rolling heavily nothing could persuade him but that he was the prophet jonah in the belly of the whale and he took the stowage of our cables for the whales intestines you could hear him even from the main deck screaming at the top of his voice wallow not o whale o whale lord thy servant repenteth only let not this whale wallow so so that in spite of all his tricks hypocrisy pride and gluttony i could not help taking compassion upon him and having a hammock rigged tenderly for him so that his empty and helpless body fell into a deep sleep as long as the prophet himself could have had it for i never could show myself at bridgend if through my means hezekiah found the sea his churchyard on the other hand the three wild men took their visitation from a wholly different point of view they had never heard either of god or the devil and could not believe themselves even worth the interference of either power for they did not believe that their souls were immortal as i suppose they must have been nor were they even aware of possessing anything more than a body apiece my own idea of treatment was that to bring them into selfrespect we should flog the whole three very soundly and handsomely pickle them afterwards nor could i see any finer method of curing them of their hairiness but captain bampfylde who showed the strangest interest in these savages would on no account have them flogged until they gave occasion he said that their ideas of justice might be thrown into a crooked line if the catandninetails were promiscuously administered whereas i knew that the only way to make a man dwell upon justice is to give him a taste of the opposite he values the right after this because he thinks there is none of it left upon earth so for the present these three jack cannibals as our tars entitled them sate apart and messed apartand a precious mess it was of it they soon got over the marly mary as the crappos call it and we taught them how to chew tobacco which they did and swallowed it only their fear of the waves was such that they could not look over the side of the ship or even out of a porthole after a few days we fell in with pelting showers of hail and sleet with a bitter gale from the northnorthwest i saw the beauty of this occasion to show mankind their need of clothes therefore i roused up these three poor fellows and had them thrown into a saltingtub full of icecold water this made their teeth chatter bravely and then we started them up the rigging with a taste of ropes end after them they ran up the ratlines faster than even our very best hands could follow them because of the power still left in their feet through never having owned a shoemaker but in the maintop they pulled up and the wind went shivering through them meanwhile i was sedately mounting as my rank required now with a very old pilots coat well worn out hanging over my left arm here jack i cried to the biggest one take this and throw it over you to keep your poor bones warm the sheaves of the blocks were white with snow which they always seem to be first to take and so were the cleats and the weather side of topmast and topgallantmast when you see this you may make up your mind to have every rope frosted ere morning therefore jack cannibal looked at the coat and around it as a monkey does put it on i cried poor fellow put it on to cover you he nodded and laughed as if i were making some joke which he ought to understand and then he threw the warm coat round his body now quite blue from cold but without any perception of sleeves or skirts or anything else except as it were like a bit of thatching and after that he helped us to civilise the rest so that in course of time we had them in decency far superior to the average show of scotchmen and in about the same course of time cannibal jack i do assure you became a very good seaman and a wonderfully honest fellow without any lies in him and yet he said things better than the finest lies that could be told all coming out of his oddness and his manner of taking tameness and if a roaring sound of laughter came to the ears of an officer such as never could be allowed in the discipline of wartime the officer always lifted lip to have a smile accordingly and said to himself i should like to know what cannibal jack has said to them the two other naked ones dick and joeas we christened them out of a bucket of tar without meaning any harm to themnever could be entirely cured of their hereditary shortcomings we taught them at last to wear clothes by keeping a sharp leather strap always handy against which their only protection was a good watch coat or a piece of sailcloth so that after a great deal of pleasantry we set the ship tailor to work for them but no possible amount of strap nor even catandninetails administered by our boatswains mate a most noble hand at wielding it could prevail upon them to abandon their desire for the property of their messmates they even had the arrogance as their english grew more fluent to attempt to reason it out with us father david said cannibal dick for they had agreed that now i was their patron even as chowne had been you take the crappo ship the enemy you call it and then you leave them all their goods not touch one of anything and hand back the ship to him dick none but a savage would talk such rubbish we keep the ship and all it holds and put the men in prison there for you now there for you and you beat us because we take not a great ship but some little thing lying about in a ship from our enemies will you never see things aright dick we are not your enemies we are your friends and to steal things from us is robbery you call it friends to steal us from our place and people and warm dry sands and put us on this strange great wetness where no mushrooms grow and all we try to eat goes into it and then you beat us and drive us up trees such as we never saw before and force us to hide in these dreadful things here he pointed to his breeches with a gaze of such hopeless misery that i felt it would be an unkind thing to press him with further argument however the boy was enough to make up for a far worse lot than these were we soaped him most powerfully to begin with even up to the skin of his eyelids and he made no more objection than a christian child might have offered and after we had scraped him dry with the rough side of a spencer he came out bright i do assure you and was such a model figure that we said to one another that he had some right to go naked for his skin was now as fair and soft as the opening out of a waterlily while his golden curls spread out like flowers of the frogbit also his shoulders so nicely turned and the slope of his sides so clever with arms and legs of such elegant mould being thick and thin in the proper places and as straight as a wellgrown parsnip then again his ankles clear and feet of a character never beheld after any shoemaking our common fellows made so much of this superior little chap that i was compelled to interfere and show my resolution and this required to be done with some small sense of how to do it otherwise the boy might take the turn of sour grapes with them and be bullied even more than he had been petted thitherto moreover all the other boys in the ship were longing to fight with him which as he was the smallest of all and not brought up in a christian manner would have afforded him no fair play for his nice short nose or his soft blue eyes the little dear was as brave as a lion and ready to fight any one of them and he used to stand up to my elbow suing for permission and now he began to talk so well that it was very hard upon him not to be allowed to fight a bit according to the natural issue of all honest converse however i would not be persuaded loving his pretty face as i did and i fear that he had unhappy times through the wickedness of the other boys having a stronger sense of mistake than afforded me any happinessin the thick of my rank and comfortsi could not find any ease until everything looked at anyhow and from all bearings contemplated lay before our captain he thought enough to look wise and then he said that really i was fit to see to such little things myself he had heard of a small boy covered over with a great deal of yellow hair this should have been fetched off long ago and what was the barber kept for thus it always does befall me to be thrown back without guidance on my own resources and even lieutenant bluett with whom i next went to hold counsel was more inclined to stretch and gape after a heavy spell on deck than to bring his mind to bear upon this childs adventures send the poor little beggar in he said and let me look at him if i can keep my eyes open llewellyn you always did love savages lieutenant you would not like me to account you in the number davy you might fairly do it when i come off deck like this send him in ere i snooze old fellow this i did and when the boy entered shyly putting one hand to his forelocks as i had instructed him a beam of the newlyrisen sun broke in through a bulls eye and made a golden frame for him in the middle of this he looked so innocent and so comely and at the same time so well bred that master rodneys sleepy eyes fell open with wonder at him this was my doing of course entirely soap and discipline is my signal to the next generation and nothing else can counteract all the heresies around us therefore this little boys cheeks were brighter than any rose from towelling and his beautiful eyes without speck of dirt and the top of his head as sweet and curly as a feathering hyacinth when i perceive that i have had the luck to make an impression my rule is to say nothing at all but appear to be unaware of it this rule is founded on commonsense and it took me so long to find it out that it ought to be worth something otherwise what offence one gives and not only that but consider how seldom the man who succeeds deserves it any modest man like me upon any moderate success is bound to examine himself and feel less confidence than he used to have his success is enough to prove according to the ways of the world that he never can have deserved it this remembrance led me now to abstain from even patting harry as we had named this little fellow on his golden head at all lest i should manifest undue pride in a creature of my creation for such he was beyond all mistake and it would have given me pleasure to back him for a crown against any boy in our fleet or any three in the whole french navy taking age of course and size into consideration what a fine little fellow said rodney bluett why he ought to be a midshipman i had no idea your savages could turn out such young ones i must see what i can do for him davy only i cant think of anything now perceiving that i was likely to do more harm than good by pressing the matter just then i took little harry away with me and found him quite full of the young lieutenants brave appearance and kindly smile in a word they were pleased with one another so heartily and so lastingly that it was the luckiest day perhaps of poor little harrys unlucky career when i first commended him to the notice of the honourable rodney for this latter was now not only a general favourite in the ship but also a great power being our second luff and twice as active as our first was he took the boy under his special care and taught him all sorts of ennobling thingshow to read and write and spell and clean boots and wait at breakfast so that i felt many qualms sometimes quite apart from all narrow methods of regarding anything and springing from the simple fear that the child might be spoiled for his station in life and fail to become a good seaman chapter lv upon foreign service at length when all sailors hearts were sick with vain hopes of some enterprise france did a truly bold thing by declaring war against great britain those people before this had given occasion for the strongest scandal by taking their king and queen in a dastardly manner and cutting their heads off indignation and hot hatred ran throughout england and wales at the news but our government did no more than politely request that the london agent of these cutthroats should withdraw nevertheless i cannot be wrongas my pension comes from governmentin saying that to my mind the british government at this noble crisis behaved in a most forbearing prudent christian generous glorious and magnanimous manner they waited for war to be proclaimed by france before they accepted it and then they proved themselves as wholly unready as they ought to be what finer state of feeling can be shown by any country it must have been either the end of february or the early part of march in the year of grace when we heard of this grand and momentous affair and i remember the date by this that the onions were sprouted and we were compelled to make shift with shallots for calling at falmouth to victual a little we sent three boats ashore and i of course was in command of one and though we spread abroad and ransacked all the cornish gardeners hoards and gave them a taste of boathooks because they had no proper things not an onion could we find except with a crooked thumb to it nor were the young ones yet fit to pull and this fixes the date to a week or so and now we found that the whole of us were to be turned over while the bellona was refitting to the gun ship defence with orders for the west indies at onceas was generally believedto protect our shipping and commerce there for although the war had been so very long looked forward to our government was not ready yet but had to send squadrons right and left to see to our foreign interests while portsmouth chatham and even london had very few ships to defend them our charity never begins at home as poor bardies did in her copybook however it chanced to turn out all right because the other side was quite as much abroad as we were some of our men were inclined to grumble at having barely a spree ashore when they longed for a turn at home again but the admiralty settled that by not paying their backwages which is the surest way of all for keeping a fellow well up to his work his temptation for running is gone because he has no cash to run with neither do his people want him while in that condition this he knows well and it makes him think and nine times out of ten he resolves to double what is due to him and really pocket it when again due and almost be admired by his own wife therefore most part of us tumbled over from the bellona into the defence after some liberty ashorewhich for a godly man like me was nothing more than a trial captain drake bampfylde worked harder than even parson chownes horses were said to do and as for mebut i will not say for it now becomes unbecoming enough that the defence cleared outward of the noman buoy the very day three weeks from the date of the bellona standing inwards we had the wind at ene as it always is in springtime now it may seem out of place and even very rude on my part but i could not altogether help a strong desire to know how our captain this time managed in the matter of the female sex i had my own feelings towards poor young polly and a hankering to let her see me which however must not now be gratified on either side and of course a man feels when this is the case that another man must be like him however the rules of the service forbade me to put any questions on private affairs to an officer thus set over me and as for observing him that was below me even if time had availed for it heaviside also had shown such ill feeling and even downright ingratitude towards me simply because my position and rank had compelled me to teach him his distance which he was somehow too stupid to learn especially since his rash elevation and appointment as our chief boatswain which made it the more incumbent upon me to preserve a firm attitude this fellow i say was so utterly wanting in that deference which the master of a lineofbattle ship not only has a right to expect but is even bound to exact that i could not now approach him with inquiries about our captain and this became tenfold more painful as soon as i saw that he knew something what french sailors could have a chance with a fleet under sir john jervis i cannot tell how many islands we took for we could not stop to count them we caught just the tail of the hurricane of the th and th of august which ever will be remembered as the most terrible ever known none of us had the luck to see the pine bulkhead blown through the palmtree or the whole of a sugarestate set down on the other side of the mountain but a sailor asks credit for his stories because he has given it and otherwise no tales can go on i need not dwell on our victories here except for the sake of harry savage as we had dubbed the poor nympton boy for want of legitimate surname in one little skirmish ashore somewhere i think in san domingo this little fellow by genuine courage and unusual nimbleness saved the life of his friend and protector our lieutenant bluett for while the lieutenant was engaged sword to sword with one vile republican another of yet more rampant nature made at him as it were flankwise and must have given him a bitter stab if harry had not with a sudden jump grappled the rogue by the leg so tightly that down he came on his face with a curse so far as their language enables them and we were so enraged i assure you at the duplicity of this fellow that we borrowed a dirk from a little middy and gave it to harry to stick him with but this our young savage refused to do and turned quite pale at the thought of it so that we placed that equality man at the mercy of the french royalists who were acting with us at that period and these made very short work with him as justice demanded with a ringleader of pestilential principles also in a manner which true modesty forbids to dwell uponbecause neither of us had clothes oni saved the life before very long of our new boatswain heaviside this worthy fellow was swimming along in his usual independent style after kicking his good wifes shackles off when ihaving taken the inside of him as his superior officerdiscovered a shark of unusual size desirous to swallow our boatswain that this should never come to pass was my resolve immediately although i could not quite see how to be in time to stop it for heaviside with his usual conceit and desire to show himself off was floating on his back with arms laid square and beard on breast and legs spread out like rollingpins and the shark at twenty knots an hour split the blue water towards him any man but myself would have given him over or left all the rest to help him especially after his utterly republican want of deference to me however such want of sympathy was almost impossible so that i swam with all speed to heaviside where he lay floating grandly look there i shouted all up with you ben unless you capitulate and with these words i pointed out the fin of the shark advancing royal sharks we always called them being the largest sharks in the world in and around port royal heaviside had his fat legs foremost and the royal shark stopped to look at them will you or will you not i asked while preserving with some difficulty a proper position behind himfor even a royal shark could have wanted nothing more after heaviside oh davy davy i will he answered only only save me the look which he gave was now enough to make me sink small questions especially as the poor fellow managed being a firstrate swimmer to offer me almost foremost to the jaws of the shark just opening therefore as this latter creature rolled on his side to make at us what did i do but a thing which none except a great fisherman could have done to wit i plucked from its strings the boatswains heavy periwig which had often vexed me on account of its pretension and clapping it on a piece of sugarcane which lay floating handy down the wide jaws of the shark i thrust it to improve his appetite faithless people may doubt my word when solemnly i declare to them that this great monster of the waters coughed and sneezed like a christian and we found him rolling dead the next morning with this obstruction in his throat thus by much caution and presence of mind i saved our boatswain not only from the jaws of a shark but from a far more fatal error arrogance and downright contumacy which had made him refuse to touch his hat to his superior officer now i need not have mentioned this little affair except that it bears upon my story inasmuch as it reconciled master and boatswain and enabled them both to work together for the benefit of their captain among poor heavisides many weak qualities one of the most conspicuous was a resolute curiosity this compelled him to open a great part of the breadth of his nature to the legitimate or otherwise affairs of his fellowcreatures and being an orthodox champion of wedlock from the moment he left his wife and children without any power to draw on him he helped all the rest of the world in this way as a host recommends his hot pickles therefore he had been chosen by very bad taste upon somebodys part and an utter forgetfulness of me to be up at our captains snap of a wedding and to say amen to it what could be worse than a huddle of this kind and a broad scattering afterwards if they had only invited me both sense and honesty would have been there as well as a man not to be upset by things however female that was their own concern of course and it misbecame me to think of it and i saw upon further consideration that my sturdy honesty might not quite have suited them for women are able with the help of men to work themselves up to anything you may call them the shot and men the powder or you may take quite another view and regard them as the powder with a superior man at the touchhole anyhow off they go and who shall ask the reason for from what heaviside told me it seems that the captain and his fair isabel before our present cruise began had resolved that no one should ever be able legally to sever them but one special term of the compact was that the outer world should have no acquaintance with things that happened between them in other words that they should leave their excellent friends and relatives all in the dark about this matter as well as save the poor captains oath by quitting each other immediately it is to the utmost extent beyond my own experience to deny that this is the wisest of all arrangements if there can be anything wise after the deed of wedlock for what can equal severance in the saving of disagreement however they had not the wisdom as yet to look at it in this light and the one wept and the other sighed when they parted at the churchyard gate for the defence must sail at pm the lady had been content to come and dwell in a very dirty village of the name of gosport so that the licence might be forthcoming from proper people when paid for because of course in her own county nothing could have been done without ten thousand people to talk of it and thus they were spliced without hoisting flag for ever spliced both in soul and in law which takes the lead of the other one and yet in body severed always till there should come fair repute a common man of my rank in life and having no more than commonsense must often find himself all abroad with wonder about his superiors they seem to look at things as if everything and every person were looking back at them again instead of trusting to the lord to oversee the whole of it if i had been of the proper age and a lovely rich maid in love with me would i have stopped even twice to think what the world might say about us heavisides opinion was that the lady wished to hide nothing whatever but proclaim before all people where and when and whom she wedded and how proud she was of him but the captain in his kind regard and tenderness for her feelings durst not expose her to the pain and sense of wrong which might ensue upon his name coming forward thus with the county thinking as it did and himself not there to vindicate and of course he knew with what vigour and skill vile parson chowne would set to at once to blacken his character and to make his bride a most unhappy one therefore sir philip bampfylde and the ancient earl of pomeroy were the only persons present of their rank and kindred and both of these confessed the wisdom of the captains arguments now on the th of april at about the hour of sundown our anchor was scarcely beginning to bite in cawsand bay when the barge of the old portadmiral was alongside of us we had long been foregathering what we would do as soon as we got ashore again but now we could only shake heads and fear that the whole would be disappointment and thus it proved and even worse for many of our company inasmuch as our orders were to make sail at once for st helens and there to join the channel fleet under admiral lord howe therefore we carried on again with a gale from southwest to favour us and on the first of may we brought up in the midst of a large society chapter lvi exiles of society a finer sight was never seen than we had now around us for all the convoy was come together as well as the british fleet empowered to protect them i stood in our foretop and counted large sail nearly of which were menofwar and all the rest goodly merchantmen a sight like this not only strengthens a britons faith in providence but puts him into a quiet pride concerning his king and country we had scarcely swung to our moorings ere we had signal from the admiral not a man to be allowed ashore water and victual all night and be ready to weigh again at daybreak of course we did so though a hard thing upon us and new hands desired to grumble until captain bampfylde rigged the gratings heaviside now was known to have such a swing of arm with a flick to it never being satisfied with his mates administration that never a man of patriotic sentiments encroached on him we all determined to sail once more and let the french see what our nature was although they might hope to find it spoiled by our being away from home so much especially when we heard that they had sail or more of merchantmen coming home all very rich and fattened up for capture what we wanted therefore was to see our own good traders free from any chance of piracy and at the same time to stop those french from wicked importations if in both points we might succeed and give battle afterwards our gratitude to the lord would almost equal our own glory and we heard that the mob in paris would starve failing of all this american fleet on the d of may the wind fetched back to its proper place at that time of year northnortheast with snowclouds always ready to endorse it and thus we slipped from our moorings and went quietly down channel concerning the rest we have no cause to plead for mans indulgence the lord continued to baffle us and would not give us any help to close quarters with the enemy we fought three days of rolling battle ending on the st of june after two days of fog interrupting and not a breath of sleep four nights every one says that we fought very well having everything so much against us and the french fleet far superior carrying also a representative of the human race large and fat and fluent of the name of john bone andrews who wrote a noble account of this action although before it began his feelings led him to seek security in a hole far below the waterline but one of the strangest things ever seen and thoroughly worth considering was the behaviour of our two savages under heavy fire two i say although we had three because cannibal jack behaved most steadily and like a thorough christian but the two others most strongly proved their want of civilisation and gross ignorance of war inasmuch as no sooner did they see the opening of bloodshed round them than mad they becameas mad i assure you as any march hares the brace of them in the thick of our combat with the towerful up and down the deck these fellows danced in the most conspicuous places as if inviting every shot and cracking their knuckles and jabbering i was for lashing them to the mainmast but captain bampfylde would not allow it he said that their spirited conduct might encourage and cheer the rest of us and indeed it was strange to see how the shot flew around without striking them now these poor fellows showed so much attachment and strong confidence towards me that when we cast anchor in plymouth sound being detached for refitment there together with eight other ships of the line i took it entirely upon myself to see them safe home and to answer for them our ship had been knocked about so much that she needed a thorough good overhauling and many of us had a months leave of absence while carpenters caulkers and riggers were working and these three savages outwent all of us in longing to see their homes again so it struck me that i might both satisfy them and also gratify myself a little by taking them under my escort as far as their native mudholes and then for a week perhaps enjoying good young pollys society captain bampfylde not only agreed to this but said that he should not care twopence if he never saw two of their number again he meant of course dick and joe whose habits of larceny never could be thrashed out whereas cannibal jack was now become as honest a hand as myself almost and a valuable foretopman having pledged my word to bring this one back safe and the others as well if they chose to come i set forth afoot for a cruise across devon than which in the summer with plenty of money what can be more delightful i would gladly have taken young harry savage now a fine lad of fifteen years so far as one might guess it but jack declared that he must not come for some reason not to be told to me now it was the flush of summer very nearly twelve years from the time i first began with sunny hedges spread their overlap of roses over us while the glad leaves danced in time with light and shade to foster them every bank of every lane was held at home with flowers nourished by some flitting rill that made a tinkle for them and through every gate almost whenever there was a man to look the spread of feathered grasses ran like water with the wind on it even a sailor may see such things and his heart rejoice and be glad in them and his perilous life for a while have rest without any thought of anything be that so neither dick nor joe ever made glance at anything except the henroosts near the road or the haunt of a young rabbit in the hedge or the nesting of a partridge i kept the poor fellows from doing harm by precept and example too yet we had a roast fowl every night except when it was a boiled one and finding myself in my sixtyfourth year what could i do but put up with it it must be threescore miles i think even according to the shortest cut from plymouth to nymptononthemoors and we wandered out of the way of course especially after guineafowls which are most deluding creatures but roast even better than their eggs boil also we got into cherry orchards of a very noble breed so that we spent a whole day and two nights without any power to say farewell and though the farmers wife put up both hands to us at the window she sent out the maid to say that we need not be frightened if we were real sailors after giving this girl a kiss to let her know what our profession was i sent in word that here was the master of his majestys ship defence which had defended the british empire in the late great victory that night they made all of us drunk except me upon these sweet little incidents i must venture to dwell no longer while having so much of my yarn in the slack and none but myself to tauten it enough that we came in about ten days to the genuine naked colony without any meaning of surprise but now as great ambassadors and the least that we all expected was a true outburst of wild welcoming cannibal jack had announced his intention to convert his relatives while dick and joe only shook their heads and seemed to doubt the advantage of it but we need not have thought of the matter twice for strange to say not one of the savages would for a moment acknowledge us all the barbarous tribe stood aloof and scowled at their old members with utter abhorrence and contempt as if at some vast degeneracy even jacks wife or the woman who might in humanity have been called so stood moping and mowing at him afar as if his clothes made a sheep of him while he with amazement regarded her as if she were only a chimpanzee whereupon all of them set up a yell and rushed with such pelting of mud at us that we thought ourselves lucky to make our escape without any further mischief after hauling out of action in this most inglorious manner we brought up to refit and revictual at the nearest publichouse a lonely hut where four roads met and the sign hung from an ancient gibbet here we were treated very kindly and for very little money so that i was quite astonished after all our feeding and i happened to say to the landlady that i was surprised to find honesty within a league of parson chowne oh sir do you know that dreadful man she answered with her apron up or would you like to see him sir madam said i with that bow of mine which takes the women captive i should like to see him wonderfully only without his seeing me of course of course all people say that because of the evil eye he hath this house doth belong to him he be coming for the rent again at two oclock and he never faileth every farthing will be ready now through your honours generosity and if so be you steps in here when you hear me give three knuckles at the door you may see him and welcome for nothing only you must not speak for ever so the landlady showed me a little cellar opening from our sittingroom and having a narrow halfboarded hatchway bearing upon her sanded parlour where she designed to receive the parson and then she was half afraid lest i might make a noise and so betray her but almost before i had time to assure her of my perfect secrecy the dash of horses hoofs was heard and the sound of a mans voice shouting well done said i to myself good parson years have not decreased thee his strong step rang on the limeash floor and his silver spurs made a jingle and lo there he stood in the sanded parlour as noble a chowne as ever there was not the sign of a spot of weakness or relenting about him on his shaven face no bloom of greyness nor in his coalblack hair one streak as vigorous springy and strenuous seemed he as when he leaped on board and thrashed me nearly twelve years agone as i do believe woman where is my money he cried with the old pale frown overcoming him twice i have given you time you know what i always do thereafter yes sir i know what your reverence doth your reverence never calleth law but taketh horsewhip to the mans of us your memory is correct he answered my usual course is to that effect i have brought my heaviest whip this time for your husband has shown arrogance can you show cause why he should not have it yes your reverence here it is and god knows how we have scraped for it with the glow of triumph which a mans face hardly ever shows but a womans cannot be denied of she spread before him all his rent upon an ancient tray and every piece of it was copper thirtysix shillings she had to pay and twentyfour times thirtysix was there for his reverence to count the hostess looked at him with a chuckle brewing now under her apron strings and ready to rise to her ample breast and thence to her mouth if expedient but she mistook her customer woman said chowne in his deep low voice which had no anger in it i am tired of signing warrants warrants your worship for what if you please warrants for thieves who are foisting sham irish halfpennies on the public i see no less than seven of them in this sterling stuff of yours three months at the treadmill now for yourself and your husband say no more you have tried a trick tiverton jail for you both tomorrow and there if you wanted either of them you must go to find them only two days afterward according to what i was told of it no welsh gentleman would have dreamed of behaving to his tenants thus for trying a little joke with him but chowne had no sense of any joke unless himself began it our three cannibals had been trembling at the sound of the parsons voice believing that he would drive them back and feeling that they had no power to withstand his orders but luckily we had made such a smokeall our savages having taken to the use of tobacco gloriouslythat when the parson put his head in as he must do everywhere he drew it back in doublequick time for he hated the weed as old nick does and then after calling his groom as a witness to the irish coinage he made him tie the whole of the rentmoney in his pockethandkerchief and off he set at a good round gallop to make out the warrant you may depend upon it that we four were very soon off as well and in the opposite direction after subscribing a guinea among us to comfort the poor woman who was sobbing her heart out at her mistake and at the prospect as seemed to me of being confined in more senses than one within the walls of a prison for some time i found myself much at a loss about harbouring my convoy for though i could trust jack wildmanas i now began to call himanywhere and with anything this was not the case with the other two who could never be kept from picking up small things that took their fancy we were shaping a course for narnton court where i intended to sling my own hammock and jacks as well if agreeable but i durst not offer to introduce dick and joe for the cause aforesaid moreover they had not yet acquired the manners of good society which were no little insisted upon in sir philip bampfyldes kitchen therefore i thought myself very clever when a settlement of this question suddenly occurred to me this was no less than to settle them both under my old ferryboat if still to be found as two years back shored up and turned into a residence their rations might be sent down to them and what happier home could they wish for with the finest air in the world around them as well as beautiful scenery and if it should happen to leak a little as seems only natural what a blessed reflection for a man of due sentiments towards the lord that this water is dropping from heaven upon him instead of rushing up to swallow him into that outrageous sea accordingly so we contrived this affair mr jack wildman was introduced under my skilful naval tactics into the most accomplished circle on the quarterdeck of our headcook and he looked so very gently wild and blushed in his clothes so beautifully that there was not a maiden all over the place but longed to glance unbeknown at him so that it seemed a most lucky thing that polly was down with the smallpox at a place called muddiford wherein she had an uncle meanwhile cannibals dick and joe lived in the boat as happily as if they had been born in it and devoted their time to the slaying and cooking of sir philips hares and rabbits it was in vain that the gamekeepers did their best to catch them dick and joe could catch hares as they boasted to me almost under the watchers noses so noble was the result of uniting civilised cunning with savage ingenuity i can well believe that no other man either of my rank or age would have ventured on the step which now i did resolve upon this was no less than to pay a visit to my poor little polly and risk all probabilities of being disfigured by smallpox for several times it had crossed my mind that although she was among relatives they were not like a father or mother to her and perhaps she might be but poorly tended and even in need of money perhaps for her very own aunt our mrs cockhanterbury would not go nigh her and almost shuddered when her name was mentioned now it seemed to be only fair and honest to let sir philip know my intention so that he might if he should see fit forbid me to return to his mansion bringing the risk of infection but the general only shook his head and smiled at that idea if it be the will of god we shall have it of course he said and people run into it all the more by being overtimorous and i have often thought it sinful to mistrust the lord so however you had better keep smoking a pipe and not stay more than five minutes and perhaps you might just as well change your clothes before you come back and sink the others to air for a week in the river i was grieved to see him so entirely place his faith in providence for that kind of feeling when thus overdone ends in what we call fatalism such as the very turks have so that i was pleased when he called me back and said take a swim yourself llewellyn i hear that you can swim five miles dont attempt that but swim two if you like swim back to us from barnstaple bridge and i will have a boat to meet you with a wholesome wardrobe thus was the whole of it arranged and carried out most cleverly i took poor polly a bunch of grapes from one of the narnton vineries as well as a number of nice little things such as only a sailor can think of and truly i went not a day too soon for i found her in that weak condition after the fury of the plague is past when every bit of strengthening stuff that can be thought of or fancied by the feeble one may turn the scale and one cheering glance or one smiling word is as good as a beam of the morning then after a long walk i made my swim and a change of clothes exactly as the general had commanded me in a fortnight afterwards where was i why under the boat in a burning madness without a soul to come nigh me except jack wildman and sir philip these two with the most noble courage visited me through my sad attack of smallpox as i was told thereafter although at the time i knew no one and at a distance around the boat a ring of brushwood was kept burning day and night to clear the air and warn the unwary from entering everybody gave me up for a living christian any more and my coffin was ordered at a handsome figure as a death upon narnton premises ay and made also like that of the greatest man that i ever did meet with not only this but two nonconformist preachers found out as they always do that in a weak period of my life when dissatisfied with my pension i had been washed away by my poor wife into the scuppers of dissent therefore they prepared two sermons on this judgment of the lord and called me a scapegoat while goodness knows what care they took never to lay hands on me chapter lvii many weak moments nothing less than steadfast faith and an ancient british constitution can have enabled me to survive this highlydappled period it was not in my body only or legs or parts i think nothing of but in my brain that i felt it most when i had the sense to feel it and having a brain which has no right to claim exemption from proper work because of being under average i happened to take a long time to recover from so many spots striking inwards an emptyheaded man might have laughed at the little drills into his brainpan but with me as with a good beehive early in october there could not be the prick of a bradawl but went into honey and so my brain was in a buzz for at least a twelvemonth afterwards therefore i now must tell what happened rather as it is told to me than as myself remember it only you must not expect such truth as i always give while competent after the master of the ship defence had proved so unable to defend himself general sir philip bampfylde with his large and quiet mind forbidding all intrusion opened out a little of his goodness to jack wildman there are men of the highest station and of noble intellect who do this and cannot help it when they meet a fellowman with something in him like them there is no vanity in it nor even desire to conciliate only a little touch of something understood between them and now being brought so together perhaps by their common kindliness and with the door of death wide open as it were before them the wellborn and highlynurtured baronet and the lowly neglected and ignorant savage found perhaps all the more clearly from contrast something harmonious in each other at any rate they had a good deal of talk by the side of the lonely river where even the lighters kept aloof and hugged to the utmost the opposite shore and the general finding much amusement in poor jacks queer simplicity and strange remarks upon men and things would often relax without losing any of his accustomed dignity so while they were speaking of death one day jack looked at sir philip with an air of deep compassion and feeling and told him with tearful eyes how heartily he was grieved at one thing being pressed as to what it was he answered that it was sir philips wealth because said he i am sad when i think that you must go to hell sir i go to hell sir philip exclaimed with a good deal of rather unpleasant surprise why should i do that jack i never thought that you entertained so bad an opinion of me your honour said jack having picked up some of my correct expressions it is not me it is god almighty i was told afore ever i learned to read or ever heard of reading how it was and so it is in the bible now poor men go to heaven rich men go to hell it must be so to be fair for both the general had too much sense to attempt to prove the opposite and would have thought no more about it if jack had dropped the subject but to do this at the proper moment requires great civilisation while on the other hand jack sought comfort needless to men of refinement your honour must go there he said with a nod of his head which was meant to settle it but there is one of your race or familyor whatever word of that sort he employed for he scarce could have come to any knowledge of things hereditarywho will go to heaven many are gone there alreadytoo many answered sir philip devoutly but tell me whom you mean jack do you mean my son the captain him no no i know better than that it is plain where he must go to your captain you disloyal fellow why you ought to be lashed to the triangles but who is it you are thinking of i know i know said jack nodding his head and no more could sir philip get out of him and whenever he tried to begin again jack wildman was more than a match for him by feigning not to understand or by some other of the many tricks which nature supplies for selfdefence to the savage against the civilised if i had been well i must have shelled this poor jacks meaning out of him whereas on the other hand but for my illness he might never have spoken so it came to pass that he was sent entirely at sir philips cost and with a handsome gratuity to rejoin our captain in plymouth sound and to carry back cannibals dick and joe who had scoured away at great speed upon hearing of my sudden misfortune now i will tell you a very strange thing and quite out of my experience even after smallpox which enlarged and filled me with charity as well as what i had scarcely room forincrease of humility this is that though captain bampfylde had some little spare time at plymouth he had such command of himself that he never went near his beloved isabel nothing could have so checked a man of heartiness and bravery except the strongest power of honour and a long time of chastisement there was a lovely young woman and here a fine though middleaged man her husband they loved one another with heart and soul and they never met but through a telescope it may have been right or it may have been wrongi should have thought it wrong perhaps if the case had been my ownbut they pledged their honour and kept it drake bampfylde like his father had a strength of trust in providence but this trust has no landed security now that the lord has found the world so clever that he need not interfere with it the gun ship defence was known to be the fastest sailer in the british navy not from her build alone or balance but from my careful trim of her sails and knowledge of how to handle her hours and hours i spent aloft among lifts and braces and cluegarnets marking the draw of every sail and righting all useless bellying so that i could now have warranted her the first of our navy to break the line if rigged according to my directions and with me for her master however while i lay docked like this careened i might say and unlikely ever to carry a keel again the defence without my knowledge even being newmasted sailed to join the channel fleet with heaviside acting as her master and as might have been expected fell to leeward one knot in three and even worse than this befell her for in the second of those two miserable actions under hotham in the year when even nelson could do nothing the defence having now another captain as well as a stupid master actually backed her mizzentopsail in the rear of the enemy when the signal was to fill and stand on however as even that famous ship the agamemnon did nothing that day through getting no opportunity we must forgive poor heaviside especially as he was not captain but the one who ground his teeth the hardest and could forgive nobody was the honourable rodney bluett now first lieutenant of the defence by this time every one must desire to know why captain bampfylde was not there as he might have been and might have made himself famous but for his usual illfortune this had carried him to the east indies before the defence had finished refitting and there with none of his old hands near him he commanded a lineofbattle ship under commodore rainier and after some hard work and very fine fighting drove the brave dutchmen out of the castle of trincomalee in august which we came to hear of afterwards thus it was that everybody seemed to be scattered everywhere none of us happened to hold together except those three poor savages and they by a sort of instinct managed to get over accidents for they stuck with that fidelity which is lost by education to rodney bluett as soon as ever poor father davy failed them but this is a melancholy subject and must soon be done with let me then not dwell upon this visitation of the lord for a moment longer than the claims of nation and of kin combine to make it needful nor did it seem to matter much for a long time what became of me the very first thing i remember after months of wandering has something to do with the hush of waves and the soft breath of heaven spread over me also kind young voices seemed to be murmuring around me with a dear regard and love and sense of pretty watchfulness and the sound of my native tongue as soft as the wool of a nest to my bosom because i was lying in a hammock slung by colonel loughers orders betwixt the very same mooringposts at about halftide in newton bay which truly enabled the sons of devon to make such a safe job of stealing his rocks not only the colonel but lady bluett who generally led his judgment felt by this time the pleasure of owing true gratitude to somebody my fatherly care of the young lieutenant had turned him out so nobly it misbecomes me to speak of this and it misbecame me to speak at all with the seabreeze flowing over me the first words of knowledge that i had spoken for how long i know not nothing can be too high or too low for human nature at both ends but i ought to have known better than to do the thing i did give me a pipe was all i said and then i turned away and cared not whether i got my pipe or whether the rising tide extinguished me here is your pipe sir came in a beautiful voice from down below me and we have the tinder ready bunny let me do it now that pipe must have saved my life everybody said so it came and went in curls of comfort through the hollow dying places of my head that had not even blood enough to call for it and then it never left my soul uneasy about anything hammock and all must have gone afloat with the rapid rise of the spring except for colonel loughers foresight who was it that watched me so and would have waited by my side until the waves were over her who was it that kept on listening to let me know while i could not speak who was it that gave a little bit of a sigh every now and then and then breathed hard to smother it who was it or who could it be in the whole wide world but bardie not only this but when i began to be up to real sense again the kindness of every one around me made me fit for nothing in the weakness of expecting all to take advantage of me as is done in health and spirits all the weakness i could find was in my friends and neighbours always labouring to encourage me this to my mind proves almost the wrongness of expecting people to be worse than we are that winter was the most severe all over western europe known for fiveandfifty years i well remember the dreadful winter ad when the severn was frozen with a yard of ice and the whole of the bristol channel blocked with icebergs like great hayricks twelve people were frozen to death in our parish and seven were killed through the ice on the sea the winter of was nothing to be compared to that nevertheless it was very furious and killed more than we could spare of our very oldest inhabitants and but for the extraordinary kindness of colonel lougher that winter must have killed not only me in my weak and wornout condition but also the poor maid of sker if left to encounter the cold in that iceberg for truly speaking the poor old house was nothing else through that winter the snow in swirling sheets of storm first wrapped it up to the windowsills and then in a single night overleaped gables roofs and chimneytops moxy and watkin passed a month of bitter cold and darkness but were lucky enough to have some sheep who kept them warm outside and warmed their insides afterwards and after that the thaw came but all this time there was nobody in my little cottage at newton but poor roger berkrolles and how he kept soul and body together is known to none save himself and heaven for colonel lougher and lady bluett at the very beginning of the frost sent down my old friend crumpy the butler to report upon my condition and to give his candid opinion what was the best thing to do with me after that long struggle now thanks to a fine constitution and the death of the only doctor anywhere on our side of bridgend i had begun to look up a little and to know the time of day crumpy felt my pulse and nodded and then prescribed the only medicine which his own experience in life had ever verified port wine he said was the only thing to put me on my legs again and this he laid before the colonel with such absence of all doubt that on the very same afternoon a low and slow carriage was sent for me and i found myself laid in a very snug room with the firelight dancing in the reflection of the key of the winecellar also here was bardie flitting light as a gnat in springtime and bunny to be had whenever anybody wanted her only her scantling and her tonnage unfitted her for frigateservice what had a poor old fellow like meas in weak moments i called myselfever done or even suffered to deserve to find the world an inn of good samaritans i felt that it was all of pure unreasonable kindness the very thing which a man of spirit cannot bear to put up with i have felt this often when our parson discoursed about our gracious lord and all the things he did for us a man of proper selfrespect would like to have had a voice in it this however as hezekiah told us in the cockpit after we had pickled him might be safely attributed to the force of unregeneracy while a man who is down in luck and constitution also trusts to any stout mortal for a loan of orthodoxy and so did i to our rector lougher brother of the colonel a gentleman who had bought my fish and felt my spiritual needs to him i listened for well he read especially a psalm to which i could for ever listen full of noble navigation deeper even than our soundings in the bay of biscay every night we used to wonder where lieutenant bluett was knowing as we did from my descriptions when the hob was hot what it is to be at sea with all the rigging freezing when the blocks are clogged with ice and make mysterious groanings and the shrouds have grown a beard as cold as their own name is and the deck begins to slip and all the watch with ropes to handle spit upon their palms and strike them dancing with their toes the while one man to another mans hoping to see sparks come out so it is i can assure you who have never been at sea when the barbs of icy spray by a freezing wind are driven like a volley of langrelshot raking the ship from stem to stern shrivelling blue cheeks and red noses shattering quids from the chattering teeth many a time in these bitter nights with the roar of east wind through the firtrees and the rattle of doors in the snowdrift i felt ashamed of my cozy berth and could not hug my comfort from thinking of my ancient messmates turned to huddled icicles but all was ordained for the best no doubt for supposing that i had been at sea through the year or even what single general action was there worthy of my presence it might have been otherwise with me there and in a leading position however even of this i cannot by any means be certain for seamen quite as brave and skilful were afloat at that very time however beyond a few frigate actions and matters far away from home at the cape or in the east indies i did not hear of anything that i need have longed much to partake in so that i did not repent of accepting a harbourappointment at plymouth which upon my partial recovery was obtained for me by sir philip bampfylde an old friend of the portadmiral there for that good sir philip was a little uneasy after shipping me off last autumn lest he might have behaved with any want of gratitude towards me of course he had done nothing of the kind for in truth i had raved for my country soas i came to learn long afterwardsthat when all the risk of infection was over the doctor from barnstaple said that my only chance of recovering reason lay in the air of my native land but at any rate this kind baronet thought himself bound to come and look after me in the spring of the year when the buds were awake and the iron was gone from the soul of the earth he had often promised that fine old tyrant anthony stew to revisit him so now he resolved to kill two birds with one stone as the saying is i had returned to my cottage now but being still very frail and stupid in spite of port wine every day i could not keep the tears from starting when this good and great landowner bent his silver head beneath my humble lintel and forbade me in his calm majestic manner to think for a moment of dousing my pipe and even justice stew who of course took good care to come after him did not use an uncivil word when he saw what sir philip thought of me sir said the general to the squire after shaking hands most kindly with me this is a man whom i truly respect there seems to be but one opinion about him i call him a noble specimen of your fellowcountrymen yes to be sure answered anthony stew but my noble fellowcountrymen say that i am an irishman no doubt whatever about that your worship was the proper thing for me to reply but the condition of my head forbade me almost to shake it if it had pleased the lord to give me only a dozen holes and scarswhich could not matter at my time of lifethere would not by any means have arisen as all the old women of newton said this sad pressure on the brainpan and difficulty of coping even with a man of anthony stews kind but alas instead of opening out the subtle plague struck inwards leaving not a sign outside but a delicate transparency this visit from sir philip did not end without a queer affair whereof i had no notice then being set down by all the village as only fit to poke about among the sandhills and then to die but no one could take the churchclock from me till the bell should be tolling for me and as a matter of duty i drew some long arrears of salary it seems that sir philip drove down one day from pen coed to look after me and having done this with his usual kindness spread word through the children who throughout our lane abounded that really none of his money remained for any more sticks of peppermint it was high time for them to think he said after ever so much education of earning from sevenpence to tenpence aweek for the good of the babies they carried all the children gathered round him at this fine idea really not believing quite that the purse of such a gentleman could have nothing more to say and the girls bearing babes were concave in the back while the boys in the same predicament stuck out clumsily where their spines were setting drive me away said sir philip to the groom drive me straight away anywhere these welsh children are so clever i shall have no chance with them indeed your honour they is said the groom with a grin as behoved a welshman would your honour like to go down by the sea and see our beautiful waterrocks and our old annshent places to be sure said sir philip the very thing we have four hours time to dinner yet and i fear i have worn out poor llewellyn now follow the coastline if you are sure that your master would like it lewis with this young horse and our weight behind your honour nothing ever comes amiss to this young horse here tis tire i should like to see him for a change as we do say and master do always tell me keep saltwater on his legs whenever right cried sir philip who loved the spree being as full of spirits still when the air took his trouble out of him as the young horse in the shafts was so they drove away over the sands towards sker which it is easy enough to do with a good strong horse and a light car behind him and by this time the neighbourhood had quite forgotten all its dread of sandstorms in about half an hour they found themselves in a pretty place of grass and furze known as the locks common which faces the sea over some low cliffs and at the western end coves down to it this is some half a mile from sker house and a ragged dry wall makes the parish boundary severing it from skerland drive on cried sir philip i enjoy all this i call this really beautiful and this fine sward reminds me of devonshire but they ought to plant some trees here the driver replied that there was some danger in driving through sker warren unless one knew the ground thoroughly on account of the number of rabbitholes and the baronet with that true regard which a gentleman feels for the horse of a friend cancelled his order immediately but he continued i am so thirsty that i scarcely know what to do my friend llewellyns hospitality is so overpowering the taste of rum is almost unknown to me but i could not refuse when he pressed me so it has made me confoundedly thirsty lewis your honour said lewis just round that corner in a little break of the rocks there is one of the finest springs in glamorgan ffynnon wen we call it the water does be sparkling so the groom having no cup to fetch the water stood by the horse in the little pant or combe while old sir philip went down to the shore to drink as our first forefather drank and gideons men in the bible whether he lapped or dipped i know not probably the latter at his time of life anyhow he assuaged his thirstwhich rum of my quality could not have caused in a really sound constitution after taking no more than a thimblefuland then for a moment he sate on a rock soothed by the purling water to rest and to look around him the place has no great beauty as of a seaside spring in devonshire but more of cheer and life about it than their ferny grottoes the bright water breaks from an elbow of rock in many veins all uniting and without any cliff above them and then after rushing a very few yards through set stone and loose shingle loses its selfwill upon the soft sand and spreads a way over a hundred yards of vague wetness and shallow shining the mild sun of april was glancing on this and the tide just advancing to see to it when the shadow of a slim figure fell on the stones before sir philip so quietly had she slipped along and appeared from the rocks so suddenly that neither old man nor young maiden thought of the other until their eyes met what why who cried the general with something as much like a start as good conscience and long service had left in him who are you who are you my dear for his eyes were fixed on a fair young damsel of some fifteen summers standing upright with a pad on her head and on the pad a red pitcher over her shoulders and down to her waist fell darkbrown curls abundantly full of gleaming gold where the sun stole through the rocks to dwell in them her dress was nothing but blue welsh flannel gathered at the waist and tucked in front and her beautifully tinted legs and azureveined feet shone under it who are you my pretty creature sir philip bampfylde asked again while she opened her grey eyes wide at him y ferch or scer syr she answered shyly and with the strong guttural tone which she knew was unpleasant to english ears for it was her sensitive point that she could not tell any one who she was and her pride which was manifold always led her to draw back from questions on the other hand the old mans gaze of strong surprise and deep interest faded into mere admiration at the sound of our fine language fair young cambrian i have asked you rudely and you are displeased with me lift your curls my little dear and let me see your face a while i remember one just like it there you are put out again so it was with the one i mean when anything happened hastily the beautiful girl flung back her hair and knelt to stoop her pitcher in the gurgling runnel and then she looked at his silver locks and was sorry for her impatience sir i beg you to forgive me if i have been rude to you i am the maid from the old house yonder i am often sent for this water because it sparkles much more than our own does if you please i must go home sir she filled the red pitcher and tucked the blue skirt as girls alone can manage it and sir philip bampfylde sighed at thinking of his age and loneliness while with an oldfashioned gentlemans grace he lifted the pitcher and asked no more upon whose head he laid it chapter lviii more haste less speed to do what is thoroughly becoming and graceful is my main desire that any man should praise himself and insist upon his own exploits and services to his native land or even should let people guess at his valour by any manner of sidewindsuch a course would simply deprive me of the only thing a poor battered sailor has left to support him against his pension i mean of course humble but nevertheless wellgrounded selfrespect this delicacy alone forbids me even to allude to that urgent and universal call for my very humble services which launched me on the briny waves once more and in time for a share in the glorious battle fought off cape st vincent upon that great st valentines day of i was master of the excellent under captain collingwood and every boy in the parish knows how we captured the saint isidore and really took the saint nicholas though other people got the credit and nearly took a fourdecked ship of guns whose name was the saint miss trinder and who managed to sneak away when by all rights we had got her however let us be content with things beyond contradiction the foremost of which is that no ship ever was carried into action in a more masterly style than the excellent upon that occasion and the weight of this falls on the master far more than the captain i do assure you so highly were my skill and coolness commended in the despatches that if i could have borne to be reduced below inferior men i might have died a real captain in the british navy for as happened to the now captain bowen when master of the queen charlotte i was offered a lieutenants commission and doubted about accepting it had i been twenty years younger of course i must have jumped at the offer but at my time of life and with all my knowledge it would have been too painful to be ordered about by some young dancer therefore i declined at the same time thinking it fair to suggest for the sake of the many true britons now dependent upon me that a small pecuniary remittance would meet with my consideration that faculty of mine however was not called to the encounter i never heard more about it and had to be satisfied with glory but if a man is undervalued often and puts up with it he generally finds that fortune treats him with respect in other more serious aspects for instance what would have happened if providence had ordained to send me into either of those sad mutinies which disgraced our fleets so terribly that deep respect for authority which like the yolk of a nestegg lies calmly inside me waiting to be sate upon as well as my inborn sense of natures resistless determination to end by turning me into a gentleman indications of which must have long ago been perceived by every reader not to mention any common sense of duty in the abstract and wages in the pocketthese considerations must have led me to lay a pistol to the head of almost every man i could find however from such a course of action grace and mercy preserved me and perhaps it was quite as well for i am not sure that i could have stopped any one of the four mutinies entirely although i can answer for it that never would bad manners take the lead in any ship while i was master it is the shillyshallying that produces all the mischief if all our captains had behaved like captain peard and his first lieutenant in the st george off cadiz at the first spread of disaffection it is my opinion that a great disgrace and danger would have been crushed in the bud but what could be expected when our government showed the like weakness twice they went hankering after peace and even sent ambassadors who can ram shot home with pleasure while things of this kind are encouraged to fight it out is the true christianity ordered by the church itself and this we did and are doing still as roger berkrolles prophesied and the only regret i have about it is that a stiffness in my knees enables the other boarders to take a mean advantage of their youth and jump into the chains or portholes of a ship when by my tactics conquered so as to get a false lead of me however no small consolation was to be gained by reflecting how much more prizemoney would accrue to me than to any of these forward fellows so that one might with an unmoved leg contemplate their precipitancy even a sorer grievance was the breaking up and dispersion of our noble and gallant ships company so long accustomed to one another and to sharp discipline in the defence where was captain bampfylde where was lieutenant rodney bluett what was become of our three fine savages even heaviside and hezekiah were in my thoughts continually and out of my knowledge entirely as to the latter worthy gunsmith artillerist to the king and queen and all the royal family i can only at present say that when i had been last at home and before my acceptance of that brief appointment in the plymouth dockyardin short when first i recovered strength after that long illness to cope with the walk both to and froi found occasion to go to bridgend with my uniform on for the sake of the town i had not turned the corner of the bridge a good halfhour before that important fact was known from the riverbank to the churchyard and griffith of the cat and snuffers set up such a welsh hurrah as good as the screech of a wildcat trapped that it went up the hill to newcastle in a word hepzibah heard of me and ran down the hill like a roaring lion demanding her hezekiah what ensued is painful to me even now to speak of for though my conscience was refitting and ready to knock about again after carrying too much sail i could not find it in my heart to give the mother of a rapid family nothing but lies to feed upon many men of noble nature dwell upon nothing but conscience as if that were the one true compass for a man to steer bywhereas i never did find a manoutside my own sunday clotheswhose conscience would not back him up in whatever he had a mind for my own had always worked like a power plainly exposed to every one thereby gaining strength and revolving as fast as a mountain windmill when the corn is falling away to chaff this however was not required in the present instance for hepzibah like a good woman fell from one extreme into the opposite from bitter reviling to praise and gratitude was but a turn of the tongue to her especially when i happened to whisper into the ear of griffith that the whole of my stipend for newton church clock would now according to my views of justice be handed to hezekiahs wife inasmuch as the worthy gunsmith had rejoined the church of england and i said what a dreadful blow this would be to all the nicodemites when the gunofficer returned with money enough to build a chapel however i felt that it served them right because they had lately begun to sneer at his good wifes wonderful prophecies in a word i had promised to find hezekiah and both while in harbour and now when afloat i tried to get tidings not only of him but also of the newton tailor and heaviside and the three wild men as well as young harry savage lieutenant bluett and captain bampfylde for all of these being at sea and in wartime who could say what had befallen them whereas i knew all about most of our people now living ashore in the middle of peace however of course one must expect old shipmates to be parted and with all the vast force now afloat under the british flag it would almost be a wonder if any of us should haul our wind within hailing distance of the others during our cruise in this world nevertheless it did so happen as i plainly will set forth so far as i remember through the rest of the year and the early part of the following year i was knocking about off and on near the straits being appointed to another ship while the excellent was refitting and afterwards to the goliath a fine under captain foley in the month of may all our mediterranean fleet except three ships of the line lay blockading cadiz our admiral the earl st vincent formerly sir john jervis had orders also to watch toulon where a great fleet was assembling and our information was so scant and contradictory that our admiral sent but three ships of the line and a frigate or two to see what those crafty frenchmen might be up to but this searching squadron had a commander whose name was horatio nelson this was not by any means the man to let frogeaters do exactly as they pleased with us i believe in the king of england i have faith in discipline i abhor all frenchmen worse than the very devil such was his creed and at any moment he would give his life for it it is something for a man to know what he means and be able to put it clearly and this alone fetches to his side more than half of the arguers who cannot make their minds up but it is a much rarer gift and not often combined with the other for a man to enter into and be able to follow up ways and turns and ins and outs of the natures of all other men if this is done by practised subtlety it arouses hatred and can get no further but if it be a gift of nature exercised unwittingly and with kind love of manliness all who are worth bringing over are brought over by it if it were not hence i know not whence it was that nelson had such power over every man of us to know what he meant to pronounce it and to perceive what others meant these three powers enabled him to make all the rest mean what he did at any rate such is my opinion although i would not fly in the face of better scholars than myself who declared that here was witchcraft what else could account for the manner in which all nelsons equals in rank at once acknowledged him as the foremost and felt no jealousy towards him even admiral earl st vincent great commander as he was is said to have often deferred to the judgment of the younger officer as for the men they all looked upon it as worth a gold watch to sail under him therefore we officers of the inshore squadron under captain troubridge could scarcely keep our crews from the most tremendous and uproarious cheers when we got orders to make sail for the mediterranean and place ourselves under the command of nelson we could not allow any cheering because the dons ashore were not to know a word about our departure lest they should inform the crappos under whose orders they now were acting and a british cheer has such a ring over the waters of the sea and leaps from wave to wave so that i have heard it a league away when roused up well to windward so our fine fellows had leave to cheer to their hearts content when we got our offing and partly under my conduct for i led the way in the goliath nine seventyfours got away to sea in the night of the th of may and nine liners from england replaced them without a single jack spaniard ever suspecting any movement every one knows what a time we had of it after joining our admiral how we dashed away helterskelter from one end of the world to the other almost in a thorough wildgoose chase because the board of admiralty with their usual management sent thirteen ships of the line especially on a searching scurry without one frigate to scout for them we were obliged to sail of course within signalling distance of each other and so that line of battle might be formed without delay upon appearance of the enemy for we now had a man whose signal was go at em when you see em also as always comes to pass when the sons of beelzebub are abroad a thick haze lay both day and night upon the face of the water so that while sailing in close order upon the night of the shortest day we are said to have crossed the wake of the frenchmen almost ere it grew white again without even sniffing their roasted frogs possibly this is true in spite of all the great nelsons vigilance for i went to my hammock quite early that night having suffered much from a hollow eyetooth ever since i lost sight of poor polly admiral nelson made no mistake he had in the highest degree what is called in human nature genius and in dogs and horses instinct that is to say he knew how to sniff out the road to almost anything trusting to this tenfold when he found that our government would not hear of it but was nearly certain of a mighty landing upon ireland off he set for egypt carrying on with every blessed sail that would or even would not draw we came to that coast at a racing speed and you should have seen his vexation when there was no french ship in the roadstead i have made a false cast troubridge he cried i shall write to be superseded my want of judgment may prove fatal to my king and country for our government had sent him word through the earl st vincent that the great expedition from toulon would sail for england or ireland and he at his peril had taken upon him to reject such nonsense but now as happens by natures justice to all very sanguine men he was ready to smite the breast that had suggested pure truth to him thus being baffled we made all sail and after a chase of six hundred leagues and continually beating to windward were forced to bear up on st swithins day and make for the coast of sicily and it shows the value of good old hands and thoroughly sound experience that i the oldest man perhaps in the fleet could alone guide the fleet into syracuse here our fierce excitement bubbled while we took in water chapter lix in a rocky bower i never hear of a mans impatience without sagely reflecting upon the rapid flight of time when age draws on and business thickens and all the glory of this world must soon be left behind us from the date of my great catch of fish and landing of bardie at pool tavan to the day of my guiding the british fleet betwixt the shoals of syracuse more than sixteen years had passed and scarce left time to count them therefore it was but a natural thing that the two little maidens with whom i began should now be grown up and creating a stir in the minds of young men of the neighbourhood early in this present month of july that northwest breeze which was baffling our fleet off the coast of anatolia was playing among the rocks of sker with the curls and skirts and ribbons of these two fair young damsels or rather with the ribbons of one for bunny alone wore streamers wherein her heart delighted while the maid of sker was dressed as plainly as if she had been her servant not that her inborn love of brightness ever had abandoned her but that her vanities were put down quite arrogantly by master berkrolles whenever she came back from candleston and but for her lessons in music therewhich were beyond rogers compasshe would have raised his voice against her visits to the good colonel for the old mans heart was entirely fixed upon the graceful maiden and his chief anxiety was to keep her out of the way of harm he knew that the colonel loved nothing better as behoved his lineage than true and free hospitality and he feared that the simple and nameless girl might set her affections on some grand guest who would scorn her derelict origin now she led bunny into a cave or rather a snug little cove of rock which she always called her cradle and where she had spent many lonely hours in singing pure welsh melodies of the sweetest sadness feeling a love of the desert places from her own desertion then down she sate in her chair of stone with limpets and barnacles studding it while bunny in the established manner bounced down on a pebble and gazed at her my sons daughter was a solid girl very well built as our family is and raking most handsomely fore and aft her fine black eyes and abiding colour and the modesty inherited from her grandfather and some reflection perhaps of his fame made her a favourite everywhere and any grandfather might well have been proud to see how she carried her dress off the younger maid sate right above her quite as if nature had ordered it so and drew her skirt of homespun camlet over her dainty feet because the place was wet and chilly and anybody looking must have said that she was born to grace the clear outlines of oval face and delicate strength of forehead were moulded as by nature only can such dainty work be done gentle pride and quiet moods of lonely meditation had deepened and subdued the radiance of the large grey eyes and changed the dancing mirth of childhood into soft intelligence and it must have been a fine affair with the sunshine glancing on the breezy sea to take a look at the lights and shadows of so clear a countenance bunny like a frigate riding doused her head and all her outworks forward of the bends and then hung fluttering and doubtful just as if she had missed stays it is not your engagement my dear bunny began delushy as if she were ten years the senior officer you must not suppose for a moment that i object to your engagement it is time of course for you to think among so many suitors of some one to put up with especially after what you told me about having toothache and watkin is thoroughly good and kind and able to read quite respectably but what i blame you for is this that you have not been straightforward bunny why have you kept me in the dark about this one of your many sweetheartings as you always call them and for sure miss then i never did no such thing unless it was that i thought you was wanting him i you surely cannot have thought it i want watkin thomas well miss you need not fly out like that all the girls in newton was after him and if it wasnt you as wanted him it might be him as wanted you which comes to the same thing always i dont quite think that it does dear bunny though you may have made it do so now look up and kiss me dear you know that i love you very much though i have a way of saying things and then i am longing to beg pardon when i have vexed any one it comes of my noble birth i suppose which the girls of newton laugh about how i wish that i were but the child of the poorest good man in the parish but now i am tired of thinking of it what good ever comes of it and what can one poor atom matter you are not a poor atom you are the best and the cleverest and most learnedest and most beautifullest lady as ever was seen in the whole of the land after or rather in the middle of which words our bunny with her usual vigour and true national ardour leaped into the arms of delushy so that they had a good cry together you will wait of course for your granny to come before you settle anything will i indeed cried that wicked bunny and lucky for her that i was not there i shall do nothing of the sort if he chooses to be always away at sea conquering the french for ever and never coming home when he can help it he must make up his mind to be surprised when he happens to come home again for sure then that is right enough well it does seem almost reasonable answered the young lady and i think sometimes that we have no right to expect so much as that of things it is not what they often do and so they lose the habit of it i do not quite understand said bunny and i dont half understand said bardiebutoh my dear what shall i do he is coming this way i am sure and i would not have you know anything of itand of course you must feel that it is all nonsense and i did not mean any harm about courting only you ought to be out of the way and yet at the same time in it our bunny was such a slowwitted girl and at the same time so particular inheriting slowness from her good mother and conscience from third generation that really she could make no hand at meeting such a crisis for now she began to perceive goldlace which alone discomfits the womanrace and sets their minds going upon what they love and so she did very little else but stare i did think you would have helped me bunny delushy cried with aggrievement i wanted to hear your own affairs of course but i would not have brought you here young ladies well met cried as solid a voice as the chops of the channel had ever tautened i knew that you were here and so i came down to look after you sure then sir and i do think that it is very kind of you we was just awanting looking after oh what a fish i do see in that pool please only you now both to keep back i shall be back again now just sir with these words away flew bunny as if her life were set on it what a fine creature to be sure said commander bluett thoughtfully she reminds me so much of her grandfather there is something so strongly alike between them in their reckless outspoken honour as well as in the turn of the nose they have let us follow and admire her a little more cried delushy she deserves it as you say and perhapswell perhaps she likes it young rodney looked at her a little while and then at the ground a little while because he was a stupid fellow as concerns young women he thought this one such a perfect wonder as may well be said of all of them then those two fenced about a little out of shot of each others eyes there was no doubt between them as to the meaning of each other but they both seemed to think it wise to have a little bit of vexing before doing any more and thus they looked at one another as if there was nothing between them and all the time how they were longing i must have yes or no for rodney could not outlast the young lady yes or no you know what i mean i am almost always at sea and tomorrow i start to join nelson with him there is no playwork i hope to satisfy him though i know what he is to satisfy but i hope to do it of course you will delushy answered you seem to give great satisfaction almost everywhere i am sure do i give it you proud creature where i long to give it most how can i pretend to say without being told in what latitude evenas i think your expression isthis amiable desire lies as if you did not know delushy as if i did know captain bluett and another thingi am not to be called delushy much in that way very well then much in another way delushy delushy delicious delushy what makes you so unkind to me tomorrow i go away and perhaps we shall never meet again delushy and then how you would reproach yourself dont you think you would now when never and then come togetheryes i suppose all sailors talk so if i cannot even talk to please you there is nothing more to say i think that the bards have turned your head with their harpings and their fiddlestrings and ballads in very bad welsh no doubt about the charming maid of sker and so on when you are old enough to know better and the young conceit wears out of you you may be sorry miss andalusia for your wonderful cleverness he made her a bow with his handsome hat and her warm young heart was chilled by it surely he ought to have shaken hands she tried to keep her own meaning at home and bid him farewell with a curtsy while he tried not to look back again but fortune or nature was too much for them and their eyes met wistfully these things are out of my line so much that i cannot pretend to say now for a moment what these very young people did and everybody else having done the same with more or less unwisdom according to constitution may admire the power of charity which restrains me from describing them my favourite writer of scripture is st paul who was afraid of nobody and who spent his time in making sails when the thorn in the flesh permitted him and this great writer describes the quick manners of maidens far better than i can wherefore i keep myself up aloft until they have had a good spell of it i have no opinion now what can you expect of me rodney i must stop and think for nearly a quarter of a century before i have an opinion then stay just so and let me admire you till i have to swim with you rodney you are reckless here comes the tide and you know i have got my very best candleston sidelace boots on then come out of this rocky bower which suits your fate so darling and let us talk most sensibly by all means if you think we can there you need not touch me rodneyi can get out very well indeed i know these rocks better than you do perhaps now sit on this rock where old david first hooked me as i have heard that old chatterbox tell fifty times as if he had done some great great thing he did indeed a grand grand thing no wonder that he is proud of it and he has so much to be proud of that you may take it for your highest compliment perhaps there is no other man in the serviceor i might say in all the civilised world but it hurts me to tell what this excellent officer said or even thought of me he was such a firstrate judge by this time that i must leave his opinion blank over the sea they began to look in a discontented quietude as the manner of young mortals is before they begin to know better and with great ideas moving them bunny with the very kindest discretion had run away entirely and might now be seen at the far end of the sands and springing up the rocks on her way to newton so those two sate side by side with their hearts full of one another and their minds made up to face the world together whatever might come of it for as yet they could see nothing clearly through the warm haze of loving being wrapped up in an atmosphere which generally leads to a hurricane but to them for a few short minutes earth and sea and sky were all one universal heaven it will not do cried the maid of sker suddenly awaking with a short deep sigh and drawing back her delicate hand from the broad palm of young rodney it will never never do we must both be mad to think of it who could fail to be mad he answered if you set the example now dont be so dreadfully stupid rodney what i say is most serious of course you know the world better than i do as you told me yesterday after sailing a dozen times round it but i am thinking of other things not of what the world will say but of what i myself must feel and the first of these things is that i cannot be cruelly ungrateful it would be the deepest ingratitude to the colonel if i went on with it went on with it what a way to speak as if you could be off with it when you pleased and my good uncle loves you like his own daughter and so does my mother now what can you mean as if you did not know indeed now rodney do talk sensibly i ought to know if any one does what your uncle and your mother are and i know that they would rather see your death in the gazette than your marriage with an unknown nameless nobody like me sir well of course we must take the chance of that said captain bluett carelessly the colonel is the best soul in the world and my dear mother a most excellent creature whenever she listens to reason but as to my asking their permissionit is the last thing i should dream of i am old enough to know my own mind and to get my own living i should hope as well as that of my family and if i am only in time with nelson of course we shall do wonders for a minute or two the poor young maid had not a word to say to him she longed to throw her arms around him when he spoke so proudly and to indulge her own pride in him as against all the world beside but having been brought up in so much trouble she had learned to check herself so that she did nothing more than wait for him to go on again and this he did with sparkling eyes and the confidence of a young british tar there is another thing my beauty which they are bound to consider as well as all the prizemoney i shall earn and that is that they have nobody except themselves to thank for it they must have known what was sure to happen if they chose to have you there whenever i was home from sea and my mother is so clever tooto my mind it is plain enough that they meant me to do what i have done and pray what is that as if you did not know come now you must pay the penalty of asking for a compliment talk about breeding and good birth and that stuff why look at your hands and then look at mine put your fingers between mineboth hands both handsthats the way now just feel my great clumsy things and then see how lovely yours areas clear as waxtapers and just touched with rose and every nail with a fairy gift and pointed like an almond a nameless nobody indeed what nameless nobody ever had such nails by way of contrast examine mine oh but you bite yours shockingly rodney i am sure that you do though i never saw you you must be cured of that dreadful trick that shall be your first job delushy when you are mrs rodney now for another great sign of birth do you see any peak to my upper lip no i cant say i do but how foolish you are i ought to be crying and you make me laugh then just let me show you the peak to yours honour brightand no mean advantagesthat is to say if i can help it oh heres that blessed moxy coming may the frenchmen rob her henroost now just one promise darling darling just one little promise tomorrow i go to most desperate battles and lucky to come home with one arm and one leg therefore promise a solemn promise to have no one in the world but me i think said the maid with her lips to his ear in the true old coaxing fashion that i may very well promise that but i will promise another thing too and that is not to have even you until your dear mother and good uncle come to me and ask me and that can never never be chapter lx nelson and the nile the first day of august in the year of our lord is a day to be long remembered by every briton with a piece of constitution in him for on that day our glorious navy under the immortal nelson administered to the frenchmen under admiral brewer as pure and perfect a lathering as is to be found in all history this i never should venture to put upon my own authority especially after the prominent part assigned therein by providence to a humble individual who came from newtonnottage for with history i have no patience at all because it always contradicts the very things i have seen and known but i am bound to believe a man of such high principles and deep reading as master roger berkrolles and he tells me that i have helped to produce the greatest of all great victories be that one way or the other i can tell you every word concerning how we managed it and you need not for one moment think me capable of prejudice quite the contrary i assure you there could not have been in the british fleet any man more determined to do justice to all crappos than a thoroughly ancient navigator now master of the goliath we knew exactly what to do every captain every master every quartermaster even the powdermonkeys had their proper work laid out for them the spirit of nelson ran through us all and our hearts caught fire from his heart from the moment of our first glimpse at the frenchmen spread out in that tempting manner beautifully moored and riding in a long fine head and stern every old seaman among us began to count on his fingers prizemoney they thought that we would not fight that night for the sun was low when we found them and with their perpetual conceit they were hard at work taking water in i shall never forget how beautiful these ships looked and how peaceful a french ship always sits the water with an elegant quickness like a frenchwoman at the lookingglass and though we brought the evening breeze in very briskly with us there was hardly swell enough in the bay to make them play their hawsers many fine things have i seen and therefore know pretty well how to look at them which a man never can do upon the first or even the second occasion but it was worth any mans while to live to the age of threescore years and eight with a sound mind in a sound body and eyes almost as good as ever if there were nothing for it more than to see what i saw at this moment sixandtwenty ships of the line thirteen bearing the tricolor and riding cleared for action the other thirteen with the red cross flying the cross of st george on the ground of white and tossing the blue water from their stems under pressure of canvass onward rushed our british ships as if every one of them was alive and driven out of all patience by the wicked escapes of the enemy twelve hundred leagues of chase had they cost us ingratitude towards god every night and love of the devil at morning with dread of our country for ever prevailing and mistrust of our own good selves and now at last we had got them tight and mean we did to keep them captain foley came up to me as i stood on the ratlines to hear the report of the men in the starboard forechains and his fine open face was clouded master he said how much more of this damn your soundings cant you see that the zealous is drawing ahead of us hood has nobody in the chains if you cant take the ship into action i will stand by there to set topgallantsails these had been taken in scarce five minutes agone as prudence demanded for none of us had any chart of the bay and even i knew little about it except that there was a great shoal of rock betwixt aboukir island and the van ship of the enemy and but for my warning we might have followed the two french brigs appointed to decoy us in that direction now having filled topgallantsails we rapidly headed our rival the zealous in spite of all that she could do and we had the honour of receiving the first shot of the enemy for now we were rushing in stern on having formed line of battle towards the van of the anchored frenchmen now as to what followed and the brilliant idea which occurred to somebody to turn the enemys line and take them on the larboard or inner side on which they were quite unprepared for attack no two authorities are quite agreed simply because they all are wrong some attribute this grand manoeuvre to our great admiral nelson others to captain hood of the zealous and others to our captain foley this latter is nearest the mark but from whom did captain foley obtain the hint modesty forbids me to say what welshman it was who devised this noble and most decisive stratagem while patriotic duty compels me to say that it was a welshman and more than that a glamorganshire man born in a favoured part of the quiet village of nn enough unless i add that internal evidence will convince any unprejudiced person that none but an ancient fisherman and thoroughgoing longshoreman could by any possibility have smelled out his way so cleverly our great admiral saw with his usual insight into frenchmen that if they remained at anchor we were sure to man their capstans for crappos fight well enough with a rush but unsteadily when at a standstill and worst of all when taken by surprise and outmanoeuvred and the manner in which the british fleet advanced was enough to strike them cold by its majesty and its awfulness for in perfect silence we were gliding over the darkblue sea with the stately height of the white sails shining and the sky behind us full of solemn yellow sunset even we so sure of conquest and so nerved with stern delight could not gaze on the things around us and the work before us without for a moment wondering whether the lord in heaven looked down at us at any rate we obeyed to the letter the orders both of our admiral and of a man scarcely less remarkable let not the sun go down on your wrath are the very words of st paul i believe and we never fired a shot until there was no sun left to look at it i stood by the men at the wheel myself and laid my own hand to it for it was a matter of very fine steerage to run in ahead of the french line ware soundings and then bear up on their larboard bow to deliver a thorough good raking broadside i remember looking over my left shoulder after we bore up our helm aweather while crossing the bows of the carrier as the foremost enemys ship was called and there was the last limb of the sun like the hoof of a horse disappearing and my own head nearly went with it as the wind of a roundshot knocked me over bear up bear up lads cried captain foley our time has come at last my boys well done llewellyn a finer sample of conning and steerage was never seen let go the best bower pass the word ready at quarters all of you now she bears clear fore and aft damn their eyes let them have it out rang the whole of our larboard battery almost like a single gun a finer thing was never seen and before the ring passed into a roar the yell of frenchmen came through the smoke masts and spars flew right and left with the bones of men among them and the sea began to hiss and heave and the ships to reel and tremble and the roar of a mad volcano rose and nothing kept either shape or tenor except the faces of brave men every ship in our fleet was prepared to anchor by the stern so as to spring our broadsides aright but the anchor of the goliath did not bite so soon as it should have done so that we ran past the carrier and brought up on the larboard quarter of the second french with a frigate and a brig of war to employ a few of our starboard guns by this time the rapid darkness fell and we fought by the light of our own guns and now the skill of our admiral and his great ideas were manifest for every french ship had two english upon it and some of them even three at a time in a word we began with the head of their line and crushed it and so on joint by joint ere even the centre and much more the tail could fetch their way up to take part in it our antagonist was the first that struck being the second of the frenchmans line and by name the conquerant but she found in captain foley and david llewellyn an ant a little too clever to conquer we were a good deal knocked about with most of our main rigging shot away and all our masts heavily wounded nevertheless we drew ahead to double upon the third french ship of the wonderful name of sparticipate from this ship i received a shot which but for the mercy of the lord must have made a perfect end of me that my end may be perfect has long been my wish and the tenor of my life leads up to it nevertheless who am i to deny that i was not ready for the final finish at that very moment and now at this time of writing i find myself ready to wait a bit longer what i mean was a chainshot sailing along rather slowly as they always do and yet so fast that i could not either duck or jump at sight of it although there was light enough now for anything with the french admiral on fire happening to be well satisfied with my state of mind at that moment not from congratulation so much as from my inside conscience i now was beginning to fill a pipe and to dwell upon further manoeuvres for one of the foremost points of all after thoroughly drubbing the enemy is to keep a fine selfcontrol and be ready to go on with it no sooner had i filled this pipe and taken a piece of wadding to light it which was burning handy in spite of all my orders than away went a piece of me and down went i as dead as a dutch herring at least so everybody thought who had time to think about it and the masters dead ran along the deck so far as time was to tell of it i must have lain numb for an hour i doubt with the roar of the guns and the shaking of bulkheads like a shiver jarring me and a pool of blood curdling into me and another poor fellow cast into the scuppers and clutching at me in his groaning when the heavens took fire in one red blaze and a thundering roar that might rouse the dead drowned all the rolling battledin i saw the white looks of our crew all aghast and their bodies scared out of deaths manufacture by this triumph of mortality and the elbows of big fellows holding the linstock fell quivering back to their shaken ribs for the whole sky was blotched with the corpses of men like the stones of a crater cast upwards and the sheet of the fire behind them showed their knees and their bellies and streaming hair then with a hiss like electric hail from a miles height all came down again corpses first being softer things and timbers next and then the great spars that had streaked the sky like rockets the violence of this matter so attracted my attention that i was enabled to rally my wits and lean on one elbow and look at it and i do assure you that anybody who happened to be out of sight of it lost a finer chance than ever he can have another prospect of for a hundredandtwentygun ship had blown up with an admiral and rearadmiral not to mention a commodore and at least complement and when the concussion was over there fell the silence of death upon all men not a gun was fired nor an order given except to man the boats in hopes of saving some poor fellows chapter lxi a savage deed nevertheless our britons were forced to renew the battle afterwards because those frenchmen had not the manners to surrender as they should have done and they even compelled us to batter their ships so seriously and sadly that when we took possession some were scarcely worth the trouble to make us blow up their poor admiral was a distressing thing to begin with but when that was done to go on with the battle was as bad as the dog in the manger what good could it do them to rob a poor british sailor of half his prizemoney and such conduct becomes at least twice as ungenerous when they actually have wounded him my wound was sore and so was i on the following day i can tell you for not being now such a very young man i found it a precious hard thing to renew the power of blood that was gone from me and after the terrible scene that awoke me from the first trance of carnage i was thrown by the mercy of providence into pure insensibility this i am bound to declare because the public might otherwise think itself wronged and perhaps even vote me down as of no value for failing to give them the end of this battle so brilliantly as the beginning i defy my old rival the newton tailor although a much younger man perhaps than myself and with my help a pretty good seaman to take up the tucks of this battle as well as i have donethough not well done even if a tailor can come up and fight which he did for the honour of cambria none of his customers can expect any more than frenchchalk flourishes when a piece of description is down in his books however let him cut his cloth he is still at sea or else under it and if he ever does come home and sit down to his shopboardas his wife says he is sure to dohis very first order shall be for a churchgoing coat with a doubledup sleeve to it for the frenchmen took my left arm away in a thoroughly lubberly manner if they had done it with a good crosscut like my old wound of forty years standing i would at once have set it down to the credit of their nation but when i came to dwell over the subject as for weeks my duty was more and more clear to me it became that instead of honour they had now incurred a lasting national disgrace the fellows who charged that gun had been afraid of the recoil of it half a charge of powder makes the vilest fracture to deal withhowever there i was by the heels and now for nobler people only while my wound is green you must not be too hard on me the goliath was ordered to chase down the bay on the morning after the battle together with the theseus and a frigate called the leader this frigate was commanded by the honourable rodney bluett now a postcaptain and who had done wonders in the height of last nights combat he had brought up in the most brazenfaced manner without any sense of his metal close below the starboard bow of the great threedecker orient and the quarter of the franklin and thence he fired away at both while all their shot flew over him and this was afterwards said to have been the cleverest thing done by all of us except the fine helm and calm handling of hm ship goliath the two ships in chase of which we were despatched ran ashore and surrendered as i was told afterwards for of course i was down in my berth at the time with the surgeon looking after me and thus out of thirteen french sail of the line we took or destroyed eleven and as we bore up after taking possession the leader ran under our counter and hailed us have you a justice of the peace on board our captain replied that he was himself a member of the quorum but could not attend to such business now as making of wills and so on hereupon captain bluett came forward and with a polite wave of his hat called out that captain foley would lay him under a special obligation as well as clear the honour of a gallant naval officer by coming on board of the leader to receive the deposition of a dying man in ten minutes time our good skipper stood in the cockpit of the leader while captain bluett wrote down the confession of a desperatelywounded seaman who was clearing his conscience of perilous wrong before he should face his creator the poor fellow sate on a pallet propped up by the bulkhead and a pillow that is to say if a man can sit who has no legs left him a round shot had caught him in the tuck of both thighs and the surgeon could now do no more for him indeed he was only enabled to speak or to gasp out his last syllables by gulps of raw brandy which he was taking with great draughts of water between them on the other side of his dying bed stood cannibals dick and joe howling and nodding their heads from time to time whenever he lifted his glazing eyes to them for confirmation for it was my honest and highlyrespected friend the poor jack wildman who now lay in this sad condition upon the very brink of another world and i cannot do better than give his own words as put into shape by two clearwitted men captains foley and rodney bluett only for the readers sake i omit a great deal of groaning this is the solemn and dying delivery of me known as jack wildman ab seaman of hm frigate leader now off the coast of egypt and dying through a hurt in battle with the frenchmen i cannot tell my name or age or where i was born or anything about myself and it does not matter as i have nothing to leave behind me dick and joe are to have my clothes and my pay if there is any and the woman that used to be my wife is to have my medals for good behaviour in the three battles i have partaken of my money would be no good to her because they never use it but the women are fond of ornaments i was one of a race of naked people living in holes of the earth at a place we did not know the name of i now know that it was nympton in devonshire which is in england they tell me no one had any right to come near us except the great man who had given us land and defended us from all enemies his name was parson chouane i believe but i do not know how to spell it he never told us of a thing like god but i heard of it every day in the navy whenever my betters were angry also i learned to read wonderful writings but i can speak the truth all the same ever since i began to be put into clothes and taught to kill other people i have longed to tell of an evil thing which happened once among us how long ago i cannot tell for we never count time as you do but it must have been many years back for i had no hair on my body except my head we had a man then who took lead among us so far as there was any lead and i think that he thought himself my father because he gave me the most victuals at any rate we had no other man to come near him in any cunningness our master chouane came down sometimes and took a pride in watching him and liked him so much that he laughed at him which he never did to the rest of us this man my father as i may call him took me all over the great brown moors one night in some very hot weather in the morning we came to a great heap of houses and hid in a copse till the evening at dusk we set out again and came to a great and rich house by the side of a river the lower portholes seemed full of lights and on the flat place in front of them a band of musicsuch as now i lovewas playing and people were dancing i had never heard such a thing before and my father had all he could do to keep me in the black trees out of sight of them and among the thick of the going about we saw our master chouane in his huntingdress this must have been what great people call a masked ball i am sure of it since i saw one when in the bellona there were many women somewhere but at the end of the great light place looking out over the water there was a quiet shady place for tired people to rest a bit when the whole of the music was crashing like a battle and people going round like great flies in a web my father led me down by the riverside and sent me up some dark narrow steps and pointed to two little babies the whole of the business was all about these and the festival was to make much of them the nurse for a moment had set them upright while she just spoke to a young sailorman and crawling as all of us can i brought down these two babies to my father and one was heavy and the other light my father had scarcely got hold of them and the nurse had not yet missed them when on the dark shore by the riverside perhaps five fathoms under the gaiety parson chouane came up to my father and whispered and gave orders i know not what they said for i had no sense of tongues then nor desired it for we knew what we wanted by signs and sounds and saved a world of trouble so only i thought that our master was angry at having the girlchild brought away he wanted only the boy perhaps who was sleepy and knew nothing but the girlchild shook her hand at him and said e bad man bardie knows a ievery one of uswas amazedso very smalloh sir i can tell you no more i think indeed then but you must my friend cried captain foley with spirit enough to set a dead man talking finish this story you thief of the world before you cheat the hangman two lovely childer stolen away from a firstrate family to give a ball of that kindand devil a bit you repent of it poor dying jack looked up at him and then at the place where his legs should have been and he seemed ashamed for the want of them then he played with the sheet for a twitch or two as if proud of his arms still remaining and checked back the agony tempting him now to bite it with his great white teeth ask the rest of us captain he said joe you know it dick you know it now that i am telling you the boy was brought up with us and you call him harry savage i knew the great house when i saw it again and i longed to tell the good old man there but for the sake of our people chouane would have destroyed them all i was tempted after they pelted me so and the old man was so good to me but something always stopped me and i wanted poor harry to go to heavenoh a little drink of water captain foley was partly inclined to take a great deal of poor jacks confession for no more than the raving of a lightheaded man but rodney bluett conjured him to take down every word of it and when this young officer spoke of his former chief and wellknown friend now commodore sir drake bampfylde being knighted for service in india and how all his life he had lain under a cloud by reason of this very matter not another word did our captain need from him but took up his pen again i ought to have told said the dying man slowly only i could not bring myself but now you will know you will all know now my father is dead but dick and joe can swear that the boy is the baby he had beautiful clothes on they shone in the boat but the girlchild had on no more than a smock that they might see her dancing our master did not stay with us a minute but pushed us all into a boat on the tide cut the rope and was back with the dancers my father had learned just enough of a boat to keep her straight in the tideway and i had to lie down over the babies to keep their white clothes from notice we went so fast that i was quite scared having never been afloat before so there must have been a strong ebb under us and the boat which was white must have been a very light one for she heeled with every motion at last we came to a great broad water which perhaps was the rivers mouth with the sea beyond it my father got frightened perhaps and i know that i had been frightened long ago by a turn of the eddy we scrambled ashore and carried the boybaby with us but the boat broke away with a lurch as we jumped for we had not the sense to bring out the rope in half a minute she was off to sea and the girlbaby lay fast asleep in her stern and now after such a long voyage in the dark we were scared so that we both ran for our lives and were safe before daybreak at nympton my father before we got home stripped off the little boys clothes and buried them in a black moorhole full of slime with a great white stone in the midst of it and the child himself was turned over naked to herd with the other children for none of our women look after them and nobody knew or cared to know who he was or whence he came except my poor father and our masterand i myself many years afterwards but now i know well and i cannot have quiet to die without telling somebody the boybaby i was compelled to steal was sir philip bampfyldes grandson and the babygirl his granddaughter i never heard what became of her she must have been drowned or starved most likely but as for the boy he kept up his life and the man who took us most in hand of the name of father david gave the names to all of us and the little one harry savage now serving on board of the vanguard i know nothing of the buried images found by father david my father had nothing to do with that it may have been another of chouanes plans i know no more of anything there let me die i have told all i know i can write my nickname i never had any otherjack wildman at the end of this followed the proper things and the forms the law is made of with first of all the signmanual of our noble captain foley who must have been an irishman to lead us into the battle of the nile while in the commission of the peace and after him captain bluett signed and two or three warrantofficers gifted with a writing elbow and then a pair of barebone crosses meaning cannibals dick and joe who could not speak and much less write in the depth of their emotions chapter lxii a rash young captain now if i had been sewn up well in a hammock and cast overboard as the surgeon advised who i should like to know would have been left capable of going to the bottom of these strange proceedings hezekiah was alive of course and prepared to swear to anything especially after a roundshot must have killed him but for his greasiness and clever enough no doubt he was and suspicious and busyminded and expecting to have all wales under his thumb because he was somewhere about on the skirts of the great battle i led them into but granting him skill and that narrow knowledge of the world which i call cunning granting him also a restless desire to get to the bottom of everything and a sniffing sense like a turnspitdogs of the shankend bone he is roastingnone the more for all that could we grant him the downright power now loudly called for to put two and two together happily for all parties poor hezekiah was not required to make any further fool of himself the stump of my arm was in a fine condition when ordered home with the prizes and as soon as i felt the old bay of biscay over i knocked the doctor he fitted me with a hook after this in consistence with an old fisherman and now i have such a whole boxful of tools to screw on that they beat any hand i ever had in the worldif my neighbours would only not borrow them tushi am railing at myself again always running down and holding up myself to ridicule out of pure contrariety just because every one else overvalues me there are better men in the world than myself there are wiser there are braveri will not be argued down about itthere are some i am sure as honest in their way and a few almost as truthful however i never yet did come across any other man half so modest this i am forced to allude to now in departure from my usual practice because this quality and nothing else had prevented me from dwelling upon and far more from following up some shrewd thoughts which had occurred to me loosely i own and in a random mannerstill they had occurred to me once or twice and had been dismissed why so simply because i trusted other mens judgment and public impression instead of my own superior instinct and knowledge of weather and tideways how bitterly it repented me now of this illfounded diffidence when as we lay in the chops of the channel about the end of october with a nasty headwind baffling us captain rodney bluett came on board of us from the leader he asked if the doctor could report the master as strong enough to support an interview whereupon our worthy bonejoiner laughed and showed him into me where i sate at the latter end of a fine aitchbone of beef and then captain rodney produced his papers and told me the whole of his story i was deeply moved by jack wildmans death though edified much by the manner of it and some of his last observations for a naked heathen to turn so soon into a trousered christian and still more a good foretopman was an evidence of unusual grace even under such doctrine as mine was captain bluett spoke much of this although his religious convictions were not by any means so intense as mine while my sinews were under treatment but even with only one arm and a quarter i seemed to be better fitted to handle events than this young captain was his ability was of no common order as he had proved by running his frigate under the very chains of the thundering big frenchman so that they could not be down on him and yet he could not see half the bearings of jack wildmans evidence we had a long talk with some hot rumandwater for the evenings already were chilly and my natural candour carried me almost into too much of it and the honourable rodney gazed with a flush of colour at me when i gave him my opinions like a raking broadside you may be right he said you were always so wonderful at a long shot llewellyn but really it does seem impossible captain i answered how many things seem so yet come to pass continually i cannot gainsay you llewellyn after all my experience of the world i would give my life to find it true but how are we to establish it leave me alone for that captain bluett if it can be done it shall be done the idea is entirely my own remember it had never occurred to you had it certainly not he replied with his usual downright honesty my reason for coming to you with that poor fellows dying testimony was chiefly to cheer you up with the proofs of our old captains innocence and to show you the turn of luck for young harry who has long been so shamefully treated and now i have another thing to tell you about him that is if you have not heard it no i have heard nothing at all i did not even know what had become of him until you read jacks confession with nelson on board the vanguard that was my doing said the honourable rodney i recommended him to volunteer and he was accepted immediately with the character i gave him but it is his own doing and proud i am of it that he is now junior lieutenant of admiral lord nelsons own ship the vanguard just before nelson received his wound and while powder was being handed up there came a shell hissing among them and hung with a sputtering fuse in the coil of a cable and the men fell down to escape it but young harry with wonderful quickness leaped as he did to save me in san domingo and sent the fuse over the side with a dash then nelson came up for the firing was hot and of course he must be in the thick of it and he saw in a moment what harry had done and he took down his name for promotion being just what himself would have loved to do it will have to be confirmed of course but of that there can be no question after all that we have done and when it turns out who he is i am heartily glad of it captain i cried the boy was worthy of any rank worth goes a little way birth a long way but all these things have to be lawfully proven oh you old villagelawyer as we used to call you at old newton and you deserved it you rogue you did you may have lost your left hand but your right has not lost its cunning he spoke in the purest play and jest and with mutual esteem we parted only i stipulated for a good talk with him about our measures when i should have determined them or at the latest on reaching port the boldest counsel is often the best and naturally recommends itself to a man of warlike character my first opinion especially during the indignant period was that nothing could be wiser or more spirited or more striking than to march straight up to parson chowne and confront him with all this evidence taken down by a magistrate and dare him to deny it and then hale him off to prison and if the law permitted hang him that this was too good for him every one who has read my words must acknowledge the best thing moreover that could befall him for his body was good though his soul was bad and he might have some hopes to redeem the latter at the expense of the former and if he had not through life looked forward to hanging as his latter end and salvation it is quite impossible to account for the licence he allowed himself however on second thoughts i perceived that the really weighty concern before us and what we were bound to think first of was to restore such a fine old family to its health and happiness to reinstate before he died that noble and most kindhearted man full of religious feeling also and of confidence that the lord having made a good man would look after himwhich is the very spirit of king david when his selfrespect returnsin a word to replace in the worlds esteem and what matters far more in true family love that fine and pure old gentleman the muchtroubled sir philip bampfyldethis i say was the very first duty of a fellow nursed by a general and a baronet through the smallpox while it was also a feat well worthy of the master of a lineofbattle ship which was not lost in the battle of the nile and scarcely second even to this was the duty and joy of restoring to their proper rank in life two horribly injured and innocent creatures one of whom was our own bardie therefore upon the whole it seemed best to go to work very warily so it came to pass that i followed my usual practice of wholly forgetting myself and receiving from the honourable rodney bluett that most important document i sewed it up in the watered silkbag with my caul and other muniments and set out for narnton court where i found both polly and the cook and the other comforts but nothing would do for our captain rodneyall young men are so inconsiderateexcept to be off at racing speed for candleston court and his sweetheart delushy and the excellent colonels old port wine and as he was so brisk i will take him first with your good leave if ever words of mine can keep up with him but of course you will understand that i tell what came to my knowledge afterwards with all the speed of men and horses young rodney bluett made off for home and when he got there his luck was such as to find delushy in the house it happened to be her visiting time according to the old arrangement and this crafty sailor found it out from the fine old woman at the lodge so what did he do but discharge his carriage and leave all his kit with her and go on with the spright foot of a mariner to the ancient house which he knew so well then this tall and bold young captain entered by the butlers door the trick of which was well known to him and in a room out of the lobby he stood without his own mother knowing it it was the fall of autumnal night when everything is so rich and mellow when the waning daylight ebbs like a great springtide exhausted into the quickening flow of starlight and the plates were being cleared away after a snug dinnerparty the good colonel sat at the head of his table after the ladies withdrawal with that modest and graceful kindliness which is the sure mark of true blood around him were a few choice old friends such as only good men have friends who would scout the evidence of their own eyes against him according to our fine old fashion these were drinking healths all round not with undue love of rare port so much as with truth and sincerity rodney made a sign to crumpy who had been shaking him by both hands until the tears prevented him just to please to keep all quiet touching his arrival and to let him have a slice or two of the haunch of venison put to grill if there was any left of it and give it him all on a plate together with a twelvepound loaf of farmhouse bread such as is not to be had outside of great britain this was done in about five minutes for even mrs cook respected crumpy and being served up with a quart of ale in crumpys own head privacy it had such a good effect that the captain was ready to face anybody old crumpy was a most crafty old fellowwhich was one reason why i liked him as a contrast to my franknessand he managed it all and kept such a lookout that no one suspected him of any more than an honoured old chum in his stronghold captain bluett also knew exactly what his bearings were and from a loftier point of view than would ever occur to crumpy a man who had carried a gun ship right under the lower portholes of a gun enemy and without any orders to that effect and only from want of some easier business he i think may be trusted to get on in almost anything this was the very thingi do believeoccurring to the mind of somebody sitting as nearly as might be now upon a very beautiful sofa the loveliest work that you can imagine lay between her fingers and she was doing her very best to carry it on consistently but on her lap lay a london paper full of the highest authority and there any young eyes might discover a regular pitpat of tears my dear my dear said lady bluett being not so very much better herself although improved by spectacles it is a dreadful dreadful thing to think of those poor frenchmen killed so many at a time and all in their sins i do hope they had time to think ever so little of their latter end it makes me feel quite ill to think of such a dreadful carnage and to know that my own son was foremost in it do you think my dear that your delicate throat would be any worse in the morning if you were to read it once more to me the people in the papers are so clever and there was something i did not quite catch about poor rodneys recklessness how like his dear father to be sure i see him in every word of it auntie the first time i read it was best the second and third time i cried worse and worse and the fourth time you know what you said of me and i know that i deserved it auntie for having such foolish weak eyes like that you know what i told you about captain rodney and begged you to let me come here no more and you know what you saidthat it was a childs fancy and if it were not it should take its course the colonel was wiser oh auntie auntie why dont you always harken him for a very good reason my dear childhe always proves wrong in the end and i dont i have the very highest and purest respect for my dear brothers judgment every one knows what his mind is and every one values his judgment and no stranger of course can enter into him his views and his largeness and intellect as i do when i agree with him there you have made me quite warm my dear i am so compelled to vindicate him i am so sorryi did not meanyou know what i am auntie my dear i know what you are and therefore it is that i love you so now go and wash your pretty eyes and read that again to me and to the colonel many mothers would be proud perhaps i feel no pride whatever because my son could not help doing it there was something else this excellent ladys son could not help doing he caught the beautiful maid of sker in her pure white dress in a nook of the passage and with tears of pride for him rolling from her dark grey eyes and he could not helpbut all lovers i trow know how much to expect of him thank you rodney delushy cried to a certain extent i am grateful but if you please no more of it and you need not suppose that i was crying about aboutabout anything of course not you darling how long have i lived not to know that girls cry about nothing nine times out of ten at least pearly tears now prove your substance rodney will you let me alone i am not a french decker of guns for you to do just what you like with and i dont believe any one knows you are here yes yes yes ever so many darlings if you likeand with my whole heart i do love you as darling moxy says but one thing this moment i insist uponno not in your ear nor yet through your hair you conceited curly creature but at the distance of a yard i pronounce that you shall come to your mother oh what a shame and with that unfilial view of the subject he rendered himself after all those mortal perils into the arms of his mother with her usual quickness delushy fled but came back to the drawingroom very sedately and with a rosecoloured change of dress in about half an hour afterwards how do you do captain rodney bluett madam i hope that i see you well lady bluett was amazed at the coolness of them and in her heart disappointed although she was trying to argue it down and to say to herself how wise of them she knew how the colonel loved this young maid yet never could bear to think of his nephew taking to wife a mere waif of the sea the lady had faith in herself that she might in the end overcome this prejudice but of course if the young ones had ceased to care for it she could only say that young people were not of the stuff that young people used to be while she revolved these things in her tender warm and motherly bosom the gentlemen came from the diningroom to pay their compliments to the ladies and to have their tea and all that according to the recent style of it they bowed very decently as they came in not being topers by any means and the lady of the house arose and curtsied to them most gracefully then rodney who had found occasion ere this to salute colonel lougher and his visitors led forward the maid and presented her to them with a very excellent naval bow my dear uncle and friends of the family he began while she trembled a little and looked at him with astonishment allow me the favour of presenting to you a lady who will do me the honour of becoming my wife very shortly i hope the colonel drew back with a frown on his face lady bluett on the other hand ran up what is the meaning of this she cried and not a word of it to your own mother oh andalusia how shocking of you i think sir said the colonel looking straight at the youth that you might have chosen a better moment to defy your uncle than in the presence of his oldest friends it is not like a gentleman sir it cuts me to the heart to say such a thing to the son of my own sister but sir it is not like a gentleman the old friends nodded to one another in approval of this sentiment and turned to withdraw from a family scene wait if you please cried rodney bluett colonel lougher i should deserve your reproach if i had done anything of the kind my intention is not to defy you sir but to please you and gratify you my dear uncle as your lifelong kindness to me and to this young lady deserves and i have chosen to do it before old friends that your pleasure may be increased by their congratulations instead of being ashamed sir of the origin of your future nieceor you my dear mother of your daughter you may well be proud of it she belongs to one of the oldest families in the west of england she is the grandchild of sir philip bampfylde of narnton court near barnstaple and i think i have heard my mother speak of him as an old friend of my father to be sure to be sure exclaimed lady bluett ere the colonel could recover himself the bluetts are an old westcountry family but the bampfyldes even older come to me my pretty darling there dont cry so or if you must come in here and i will help you rodney my dear you have delighted us and you have done it most cleverly but excuse my saying that an officer in the army would have known a little better what ladies are than to have thrown them into this excitement even in the presence of valued friends come here my precious the gentlemen will excuse us for a little while let me kiss colonel lougher first whispered delushy all frightened crying and quivering as she was she could not forget her gratitude so she bowed her white forehead and drooped her dark lashes under the old mans benevolent gaze sit down my dear friends said colonel lougher as soon as the ladies had left the room my good nephews tactics have been rather blunt and of the aboukir order however he may be quite right if this matter requires at once to be spread abroad at any rate my dear boy i owe you an apology rodney i beg your pardon for the very harsh terms i used to you with these words he stood up and bowed to his nephew who did the same to him in silence and then they shook hands warmly after which the young captain told his story to which they all listened intentlyfive being justices of the shire and one the lordlieutenantall accustomed to examine evidence it seems very likely said colonel lougher as they waited for his opinion that david llewellyn is a most shrewd fellow but he ought to have said more about the boat there is one thing however to be done at onceto collect confirmative evidence there is another thing to be done at once cried rodney bluett warmlyto pull chownes nose and despite his cloth i will do it roundly my young friend said the lordlieutenant prove it first and then i think there are some people who would pardon you chapter lxiii polly at home lest any one should be surprised that sir philip bampfylde could have paid two visits to this delightful neighbourhood without calling on our leading gentleman and his own fellowofficer colonel lougherin which case the questions concerning delushy would have been sifted long agoi had better say at once what it was that stopped him when the general thought it just worth while though his hopes were faint about it to inquire into the twisted story of the wreck on our coast as given by the celebrated felix farley the first authority he applied to was coroner bowles who had held the inquest coroner bowles told him all he knew half of which was wrong of course by means of hezekiah and gave him a letter to anthony stew as the most active and penetrating magistrate of the neighbourhood nothing could have been more unlucky not only did stew baffle my desire to be more candid than the day itself by his official browbeating and the antipathy between usnot only did stew like an oversharp fellow trust one of the biggest rogues unhungin his unregenerate dissenting days and before we gave him six dozen which certainly proved his salvationi am sorry to say such things of my present good neighbour kiah but here he is now and subscribes to it hezekiah perkins whose view of the shipwreck and learned disquisition on sand misled the poor coroner and all of the jury except myself so blindly that we drowned the five young men and smothered the babynot only did stew i say get thus far in bewilderment of the subject but he utterly ruined all chance of clearing it by keeping sir philip from candleston court if you ask me how i can only say in common fairness to anthony stew who is lately gone poor fellow to be crossexamined by somebody sharper even than himselfone to whom i would never afford material for unpleasant questions by speaking amiss of a man in his powerespecially when so needless in a word to treat stew as i hope myself to be treated by survivors i admit that he may not have wished to keep sir philip away from the colonel but the former having once accepted stews keen hospitality and tried to eat fish which i might have bettered had i known of his being there felt with his usual delicacy that he ought not to visit a man at feud with the host whose saltand very little elsehe was then enjoying for mrs stew was more bitter of course than even her husband against colonel lougher and roundly abused him the very first evening of sir philips stay with them so that the worthy general passed the gates of the excellent colonel halfadozen times perhaps without once passing through them enough about that and i need only say before returning to my own important and perhaps sagacious inquiries in devonshire that the news so hastily blurted out by captain rodney bluett caused many glad hearts in our parish and neighbourhood but nevertheless two sad ones of these one belonged to roger berkrolles and the other to moxy thomas the child had so won upon both these not only by her misfortunes and the way in which she bore them but by her loving disposition bright manner and docility that it seemed very hard to lose her so even though it were for her own good upon this latter point master berkrolles when i came to see him held an opinion the folly of which surprised me from a man of such reading and history in real earnest he laid down that it might be a very bad thing for the maid and make against her happiness to come of a sudden into high position importance and even money such sentiments are to be found i believe in the weaker parts of the bible such as are called the new testament which nobody can compare to the works of my ancestor king david and which if you put aside saint paul and saint peter who cut the mans ear off and rejected quite rightly the tablecloth exhibit to my mind nobody of a patriotic spirit as for moxy she would not have been a woman if she had doubted about the value of high position coin of the realm and rich raiment nevertheless she cried bitterly that this child as good as her own to her and given her to make up for them and now so clever to see to things and to light the fire and show her the way lady bluett put her dress on should be taken away in a heap as it were just as if the great folk had minded her she blamed our poor bunny for stealing the heart of young watkin who might have had the maid according to his mothers fancy with money enough to restock the farm now things had proved so handsome as if everybody did not know that bardie would never think twice of watkin while his mother hearing of the ships i had taken as all over the parish reported had put poor watkin on bread and water until he fell in love with bunny however now she cried very severely and in a great measure she meant it leaving all newton and nottage and sker and even bridgend to consider these matters with a pleasing divergence of facts and conclusions i find it my duty however repugnant to speak once more of my humble self in adversity my native dignity and the true grandeur of cambria have always united against my own feelings to make me almost selfconfident or at any rate able to maintain my position and knock under to nobody but in prosperity all this drops extreme affability and my native longing to give pleasure mark my deportment towards all the world and i almost never commit an assault in this fine and desirable frame of mind i arrived at narnton court once more sooner perhaps than captain bluett having so much further to go burst in on his friends at candleston although i have given his story precedence not only on account of his higher rank but because of the hurry he was in on the other hand my part seemed to be of a nice and delicate characterto find out all that i could without making any noise in the neighbourhood to risk no chance if it might be helped of exciting sir philip bampfylde and above all things no possibility of arousing chowne till the proper time for his craft was so great that he might destroy every link of evidence if he once knew that we were in chase of him even as he could outfox a fox when things of importance take their hinge a good deal upon feminine evidence the first thing a wise man always does is to seek female instinct if he sees his way to guide it and to have the helm of a woman nothing is so certain as a sort of a promise of marriage a man need not go too very far and must be awake about pen and ink and witnesses and so on but if he knows how to do it and has lost an arm in battle but preserved an unusually fine white beard and has had another wife before who was known to make too little of him the fault is his own if he cannot manage halfadozen spinsters my reputation had outrun meas it used to do sometimes too oftenfor in the despatches my name came after scarcely more than fifty though it should have been one of the foremost five however my wound was handsomely chronicled and with a touch of my own description such as is really heartfelt of course it was not quite cured yet and i felt very shy about it and the very last thing i desired was for the women to come bothering tush i have no patience with them they make such a fuss of a trifle but being bound upon such an errand and anxious to conciliate them so far as selfrespect allowed and knowing that if i denied myself to them the movement would be much greater i let them have peeps and perceive at the same time that i really did want a new set of shirts halfadozen of damsels began at once to take my measure and the result will last my lifetime but amid all this glorification whenever i thought of settling there was one pretty face that i longed to see and to my mind it beat the whole of them what was become of my pretty polly the lover of my truthful tales and did she still remember a brave though not young officer in the navy who had saved her from the jaws of death by catching smallpox from her these questions were answered just in time and in the right manner also by the appearance of polly herself outblushing the rose at sight of me and without a spot on her face except from the very smart veil she was wearing for she was no longer a servant now but free and independent and therefore entitled to take the veil and she showed her high spirit by doing this to the deep indignation of all our maidservants and still more indignant were these young women when polly demeaned herself as they declared with a perfectly shameless and brazenfaced manner of carrying on towards the noble old tar they did not allow for the poor things gratitude to the only one who came nigh her in her despairing hour and saved her life thereby nor yet for her sorrow and tender feeling at the dire consequence to him and it was not in their power perhaps to sympathise with the shock she felt at my maimed and warbeaten appearance however i carried the whole of it off in a bantering manner as usual still there was one resolution i came to after long puzzling in what way to cope with the almost fatal difficulty of having to trust a woman so i said to myself that if this must be done i might make it serve two purposesfirst for discovery of what i sought and then for a test of the value of a female about whom i had serious feelings these were in no way affected by some news i picked up from nanette or as she now called herself the widow heaviside not that my old friend had left this world but that he gave a wide berth to the part containing his beloved partner she with a frenchwomans wit and sagacity saw the advantage of remaining in the neighbourhood of her wrongs and here with the pity now felt for her and the help she received from sir philip himself and her own skill in getting up womens fal lals she maintained her seven children cleverly after shedding some natural tears for the admired but fugitive heaviside she came round of course to her neighbours affairs and though she had not been at narnton court at the time when the children were stolen she helped me no little by telling me where to find one who knew all that was known of it this was a farmers wife now at burrington as i found out afterwards a village some few leagues up the tawe and her name was mrs shapland from her my friend the captain shall decouver the everything of this horrible affair said nanette who now spoke fine english she was thewhat you callthe bonne the guard of the leetle infants i know not where she leeves some barbarous name i do forgetbut she have one cousin a jolly girl of the leetle namepray how can you make such thing of mary what do you mean polly i asked that is what we make of mary and what polly is it then madame yes paullee the paullee which have that horrible pest that makes holes in the faces verole we call it the paullee that was in the great mansion until she have the money left the niece of the proud woman of manage you shall with great facility find that paullee of course i could for she had told me where i might call upon her which i did that very same afternoon and a pretty and very snug cottage it was just a furlong or so above the fine old village of braunton with four or five beautiful meadows around it and a bright pebbly brook at the turn of the lane the cottage itself even now in november was hung all over with china roses and honeysuckle in its second bloom which it often shows in devonshire and up at the window that shook off the thatch and looked wideawake as a dogs house a face more bright than the roses came and went away and came again to put a good face upon being caught hereupon i dismissed the boys who with several rounds of cheers had escorted me through braunton and with genuine thankfulness i gazed at the quiet and pleasing prospect so charming now in the fall of the leaf what would it be in the springtime with the meadows all breaking anew into green and the trees all ready for their leaves again also these bright red devonshire cows all belonging to polly and even now streaming milkilya firkin apiece was the least to expect of them in the merry may month a very deep feeling of real peace and the pleasure of small things fell on me for a man of so many years and one arm might almost plead to himself some right to shed his experience over the earth when his blood had been curdling on so many seas the very same thought was in pollys eyes when she ran down and opened the door for me the whole of this property was her own or would be at least when her old grandmother would allow herself to be buried that old woman now was ninetyfive if the parsons had minded the register and a woman more fully resolved to live on i never had the luck to meet with and the worst of it was that her consent to pollys marriage was needful under the ancient cowkeepers will with all of the meadows so described that nobody could get out of them hereupon somehow i managed to see that a very bold stroke was needed and i took it and won the old lady over by downright defiance i told her that she was a great deal too young to have any right to an opinion and when she should come to my time of life she would find me ready to hearken her she said that no doubt it was bred from the wars for sailors to talk so bravely but that i ought to know betterwith a fie and a sigh and a fie again to none of this would i give ear but began to rebuke all the young generations holding to ridicule those very points upon which they especially plume themselves until this most excellent woman began to count all her cows on her fingers her cant have them no her shant have they she cried with a power which proved that she saw them dropping into my jaws almost her hant a got em yet and why should her have em into this very fine feeling and sense of possession i entered so amiably that amid much laughter and many blushes on the part of polly who pretended to treat the whole thing as a joke the old lady put on her silver goggles and set down her name to a memorandum prepared on the spur of the moment by me whereupon i quite made my mind up to go bravely in for it and recompense polly for all her faith and gratitude and frugality if she should prove herself capable of keeping counsel also to this intent i expressed myself as elegantly as could be having led polly out to the wooden bridge that nobody else might hear me for that fine old woman became so deaf all of a sudden that i had no faith in any more of her organs and desired to be at safe distance from her as well as to learn something more of the cows nor did i miss the chance for all of them having been milked by polly came up to know what i had to say to her and their smell was beautiful so i gave them a bit of salt out of my pocket such as i always carry when ashore and offered them some tobacco and they put out their broad yellow lips for the one and snorted and sneezed at the other when these valuable cows were gone to have a little more grazing i just made polly aware of the chance that appeared to be open before us in short i laid clearly before her the whole of my recent grand discovery proving distinctly that with nothing more than a little proper management i possessed therein at least an equivalent for her snug meadow homestead and all the milchcows and the troutstream only she must not forget one thing namely that the whole of this value would vanish if a single word of this story were breathed any further off than our own two selves until the time was ripe for it of course i had not been quite such a fool as to give nanette the smallest inkling of any motive on my part beyond that pure curiosity with which she could so well sympathise also it had been settled between captain bluett and myself that a fortnight was to be allowed me for hunting up all the evidence before he should cross the channel unless i took it on myself to fetch him polly opened her blue eyes to such a size at all i told her that i became quite uneasy lest she should open her mouth in proportion for if my discovery once took wind before its entire completion there would be at least fifty jealous fellows thrusting their oars into my own rowlocks and robbing me of my own private enterprise also miss polly gave way to a feeling of anger and indignation which certainly might be to some extent natural but was to say the least of it in a far greater measure indiscreet and even perilous oh the villain oh the cruel villain she exclaimed in a voice that quite alarmed me considering how near the footpath was and a minister of the gospel too oh the poor little babes one adrift on the sea and the other among them naked savages what a mercy as they didnt eat him and to blame the whole of it on a nice harmless kindspoken handsome gentleman like our captain oh let me get hold of him that my dear polly we never shall do if you raise your voice in this way now come away from these trees with the ivy and let us speak very quietly this dear creature did as nearly as could be expected what i told her so that i really need not repent of my noble faith in the female race this encouraged me from its tendency to abolish prejudice and to let the weaker vessels show that there is such a thing as a cork to them men are apt to judge too much by experience on this subject when they ought to know that experience never does apply to women any more than reason does nevertheless my polly saw the way in and out of a lot of things which to me were difficult especially as to the manner of handling her cousin mrs shapland a very good woman in her way but a ticklish one to deal with and all the credit for all the truth we get out of mrs shapland belongs not to me any more than herself but goes down in a lump to poor polly to pass this lightlyas now behoves mejust let me tell what susan shapland said when i worked it out of her any man can get the truth out of a woman if he knows the way i mean of course so far as she has been able to receive it to expect more than this is unreasonable and to get that much is wonderful however polly and i between us did get a good deal of it of course we did not let this good woman even guess what we wanted with her only we borrowed a farmers cart from bang my old boy who was now set up in a farm on his grandmothers ashes and his horse was not to be found fault with if a man did his duty in lashing him this i was ready to understand when pointed out by polly and he never hoisted his tail but what i raked him under his counter so after a long hill commanding miles and miles of the course of the river we fetched up in the courtyard of farmer shapland and found his wife a brisk sharp woman quite ready to tell her story but what she did first and for us at this moment was to rouse up the fire with a great dry fagot crackling and sparkling merrily for the mist of november was now beginning to crawl up the wavering valley and the fading light from the west struck coldly on the winding river in such a case and after a drive of many miles and much scenery any man loves to see pots and pans goaded briskly to bubbling and sputtering or even to help in the business himself so far as the cook will put up with it and then if a foolish good woman allows him as pride sometimes induces her to lift up a potlid when trembling with flavour or give a shake to the fryingpan in the ecstasy of crackling or even to blow on the iron spoon and then draw in his breath with a drop of itwhat can he want with any scenery out of the window or outside his waistcoat such was my case i declare to you in that hospitable house with these good people of burrington nor could we fall to any other business until this was done with then after dark we drew round the fire with a blackjack of grand old ale and our pipes to hear mrs shaplands story chapter lxiv susan quite acquits herself it really does seem as wise a plan as any i am acquainted with to let this good woman act according to the constitution of her sexthat is to say to say her say and never be contradicted we contradicted her once or twice to reconcile her to herself but all that came of it was to make her contradict perhaps herself but certainly us ten times as much she did her best to explain her meaning and we really ought to enter more into their disabilities therefore let her tell her story as nearly in her own words poor thing as my sense of the english language can in any style agree with i was nurse at narnton court ever so many years agowhen my name was susan moggeridgecharley you cannot deny it you know and all of us must be content to grow old it is foolish to look at things otherwise twelve and six that makes eighteen now captain wells you know it do and charley can you say otherwise then it must have been eighteen years agone when i was took on for undernurse because the princess was expecting the same as the butler told me and it came to pass on a sunday night with two miles away from the doctor orders had been given but they foreigners always do belie them too soon always or too late and these two little dears was too soon by reason of the wonderful child the eldest one was prepared for a maid she was and the other a boy two real beauties both of them as fair as could be with little clear dots under their skin in corner places because of their mother the princess but nothing as any one would observe except for a beauty to both of them the boy was the biggest though the girl came first and first was her nature in everything except of course in fatness and by reason of always dancing not six months old was that child before she could dance on the kitchen table with only one hand to hold her up and a pleasure it was to look at her and laugh with her little funny face and nod her head she would as if she saw to the bottom of everything and when she were scarce turned the twelvemonth she could run likeoh just like anything and roll over and over on the grass with her pomyolianian dog as she called him and there wasnt a word in the language as ever come amiss to her but for the rs or the ys in it words such as i could lay no tongue to she would take and pronounce right off and then laugh at herself and everybody and the way she used to put her hands out laying down the law to all of uswe didnt want a showman in the house so long as we had miss bertha or bardie as she called herself though christened after her mother everybody the poor little mite she expected everybody to know her name and all about her and nothing put her in such a passion as to pretend not to know who she was ise bardie she used to cry out with her little hands spread and her bright eyes flashing ise bardie i tell a and evelybody knows it oh yes and she never could say thbut niss and nat for this and that and how angry she used to be to be sure if anybody mocked her as we used to do for the fun of it but even there she was up to us for she began to talk french for revenge upon us having taken the trick from her mother likewise the boy was a different child altogether in many ways he scarcely could learn to speak at all because he was a very fine child indeed and quiet and fat and easy he would lie by for hours on a velvet cushion and watch his little sister having her perpetual round of play dolls and horses and noahs arks and all the things that were alive to her and she talking to them whiles the hourhe took no more notice than just to stroke them and say boo boo or poor poor which was nearly all that he could say not that he was to blame of course nor would any one having sense think of it especially after he took the pink fever and it struck to his head and they cut his hair off beautiful curls as was ever seen and some of them in my drawer upstairs now with the colour of gold streaking over them philip his name was of course from sir philip and being the heir to the title but his clever sister she always called him little brother as if he was just born almost when he weighed pretty nearly two of her sir philip the good old gentleman was away in foreign parts they said or commanding some of the colonies up to the time when these two twins were close upon two years old or so i remember quite well when he came home with his luggage marked general bampfylde and we said it was disrespectful of the government to call him so when his true name was sir philip he had never seen his grandchildren till now and what a fuss he made with them but they had scarcely time to know him before they were sadly murdered or worse perhaps for all that any one knows to the contrary because sir philips younger son captain drake bampfylde came from the seas and america just at this time no one expected him of course from among such distant places and he had not been home for three years at least and how noble he did look until we saw how his shirts were cobbled and every one all about the place said that his little finger was worth the whole of the squires body because the squire his elder brother and the heir of sir philip was of a nature not to saybut i cannot make it clear to you no one could say a word against him only he were not what you may call itnot as we devonshire people arenot with a smile and kind look of the eye the same as captain drake was this poor captain drakepoor or bad i scarce know which to put it after all i have heard of himanyhow his mind was set upon a little chit of a thing not more than fifteen at this time her name was isabel carey and her father had been a nobleman and when he departed this life he ordered her off to narnton court so she did at an early age and being so beautiful as some thought she was desperate with the captain they used to go walking all up in the woods or down on the river in a boat until it was too bad of them the captain i daresay meant no harm and perhaps he did none but still there are sure to be talkative people who want to give their opinions if charley had carried on so with me whatever should i have thought of myself well there was everybody saying very fine things to everybody gay doings likewise and great feasts and singing and dancing and all the rest and the captain hired a pleasureboat by name the wild duck of appledore and i never shall forget the day when he took a whole pack of us for a sail out over barnstaple bar and back i was forced to go because he needs must take the children and several even old people were sick but no one a quarter so bad as me and it came into my mind in that state that he was longing as well as welcome to cast us all into the raging sea however the lord preserved us this little ship had one mast as they call it and he kept her generally in a little bend just above the salmonweir so as to see the men draw the pool and himself to shoot the wildfowl from a covered place there is and by reason of being so long at sea he could not sleep comfortable at the court but must needs make his bed in this pleasuringship and to it he used to go to and fro in a little white boat as belonged to it all this time the weather was so hot we could scarcely bear our clothes on and were ready to envy them scandalous savages belonging to the famous parson chowne who went about with no clothes on there was one of these known to be down on the burrows abathing of his wife and family if a decent woman may name them so well the whole of these gay goings on to celebrate the return of sir philip and of captain drake and all that they owed to the lord for his goodness was to finish up with a great dinner to all the tenants on the property and then on the childrens birthday a feasting of all the gentry around and a dance with all sorts of outlandish dresses and masks on in the evening for the fashion of this was come down from london and there had been a party of this sort over to lord bassetts and the neighbourhood was wild with it and after this everything was to be quiet because my lady the princess bertha was again beginning to expect almost and now captain wells you would hardly believe what a blow there was sent by the will of the lord upon all of this riot and revelry there was many of us having pious disposals as well as religious bringingsup whose stomachs really was turned by the worldliness as was around us young ladies of the very best families instead of turning their minds to the lord turning of themselves about with young men laying hold of them as if there was nothing more to be said than kiss me quick and ill do it again but there was a judgment coming they might lay the blame on me if they like there is folk as knows better that very night it was so hot with the sun coming up from the river that even the great hall the dance was to be in was only fit to lie down in so that captain drake in his manofwar voice shouted and i think i can hear him now ladies and gentlemen i propose that we have our dance out on the terrace this was the open madeup flat between the house and the river and the captains offer was caught up at directly the gentlefolk seen the moon here they were going on ever so long and the more of twirling round they had and of making heel and toe and crossing arms and even frontesses the more they seemed to like it also the music up and down almost as bad as they was so that what with the harlequin dresses and masquerading and mummeries scarcely any one could have the head to be sure of any one else almost i could not help looking at them although my place was to heed the children only and keep them out of mischief and take them to bed at the proper time but captain drake who was here there and elsewhere making himself agreeable up he comes to me with a bottle and he says mary have some my name is not mary but susan sir and much at your service i answered so that he poured me a great glassful and said that it was samsomething i was not so rude as to give him denial but made him a curtsy and drank it for it was not so strong as my fathers cider no nor so good to my liking and for any to say that it got in my head shows a very spiteful woman the captain went on to the other maids as were looking on for the life of them all being outofdoors you must mind and longing to have their turn at it but i held myself above them always and went back to my children these were in a little bower made up for the occasion with boughs of trees and twisted wood and moss from the forest to lie upon master philip was tired and heavy and working his eyes with the backs of his hands and yawning and falling away almost but that little bertha was as wideawake as a lark on her nest in the morning everywhere she was looking about for somebody to encourage her to have more play as she always called for and more play continually that child was so full of life it was more play all day long with her and even now in the fiery heat and thorough down thirst of the weather nothing was further from her mind than to go to bed without a gambol for it she had nothing on but her little shift or underfrock i should call it made by myself when the hot weather came from a new jemmyset of the princess and cut out by my lady to fit her for the sake of the coolness her grand white upper frock trimmed with lace had been taken off by her papa i believe when the visitors would have her dance on the table and make speeches to them the poor little soul was so quick and so hot well i do declare to you captain wells and charley polly likewise which will believe me though the men may not it was not more than a minute or so much perhaps i should say not half a minute as i happened to turn round to pass a compliment with a young man as seemed struck with me the sunday before in churchtime a sailor he were and had come with the captain and was his mate of the pleasureboat a right down handsome young man he wasno call for you to be jealous charley beneath the salt waves he do lie well i turned back my head in about five seconds and both of the babes was gone out of my sight at first i were not frightened much i took it for one of miss berthas tricks to make off with her little brother so strong she was on her legs though light that many a time she would lift him up by his middle and carry him half round the room and then both of them break out laughing ill whip you you see if i dont i cried as i ran round the corner to seek for them though whip them i never did poor dears any more than their own mother did i ran all about for five minutes at least around and among the branches stuck in to make the bower and every moment i made up my mind for miss bardie to pop out on me but pop out she never did nor will until the day of judgment when i began to see something more than an innocent baby trick in it and to think i daresay of these two babies value with all the land they were born to the first thing i did was to call out jack such being all sailors names of course but jack was gone out of all hearing and most folk said it was jack that took them to the contrary i could swear but who would listen to me when the lie went out that i was quite tipsy of the rest i cannot speak clearly because my heart flew right up into my brain directly moment the people came round shouting at me for the children and of these the very worst was parson chowne if it had been his own only childrensuch as he says he is too good to havehe scarcely could have been more rampagious not to use worse words of him the first thing that every one ran to of course was the parapetch and the river and a great cry was made for captain drake bampfylde from his knowledge of the waterways but though all the evening foremost in conducting everything now there was no sign to be had of him or of who had seen him last and it must have been an hour ere ever he come and then of course it was too late i was so beside myself all that night that i cannot tell how the time went by i remember looking over the parapetch at a place where the water is always deep and seeing the fishermen from the salmonweir dragging their nets for the poor mites of bodies and my blood seemed to curdle inside me almost every time they came out with a stone or a log nothing was found from that night to this day and nothing will ever be found of it i was discharged and a great many others not the first time in this world i believe when the bottom of the whole was witchcraft here charley put something hot in my glass the evenings are getting so dark and i never can see the moon and the water like that and the trees without remembering now ask me no more if you please good people when mrs shapland had finished this tale and was taking some wellearned refreshment polly and i looked at one another as much as to say that settles it nor did we press her with any more questions until her mind had recovered its tone by frying some slices of ham cut thin and halfadozen newlaid eggs for us then i approached her with no small praise which she deserved and appeared so far as i could judge to desire perhaps and with a little skill on my part she was soon warmed up again having tasted eggflip to be sure of it yes captain wells you can see through the whole of it sailors can understand a river when nobody else knows anything the captain came forward as soon as he could and he says you fools what are you about an hour ago the tide was running five knots an hour where you be dragging if the poor children fell over they must be down riverbar by this time and off he set out on a galloping horse to scurry the sandhills somehow and scurry was now the whole of it sir philip came forth and that poor squire philip and a thousand pounds was as freely talked of as if it was halfpence and every one was to be put in prison especially me if you please as blameless as the unborn babe was and that very night the princess were taken and died the next day upsetting everything ever so much worse than ever for poor squire philip fell into a trance so to say out of sheer vexation he cried out that the hand of the lord was upon him and too heavy for him to bearparticular from his own brother and after that not an inch would he budge to make inquiry or anything but shut himself up in his dead wifes rooms and there he have moped from that day to this in a living grave as you may call it in reply to my question what reasons the squire or any one else might have for charging the captain with so vile a deed this excellent woman set them forth pretty much to the following purport first it was the captain himself who proposed the dancing on the terrace second it was his own man who drew her attention away from the children after a goblet of wine had been administered by the master third it was his own boat which was missing and never heard of afterwards fourth the captain himself disappeared from the party at the very time that the children were stolen and refused to say whither or why he was gone that active and shrewd man parson chowne no sooner heard of the loss than he raised a cry for the captain all over the terrace to come and command the fishermen and though as a friend of the family chowne would never express an opinion he could not undo that sad shake of the head which he gave when no captain could be found fifth a man with a captains hat was seen burying two small bodies that night in the depth of braunton wilderness though nothing was heard of it till the next week through the savageness of the witness and by that time the fierce storm on the sunday had changed the whole face of the burrows so that to find the spot was impossible sixth it was now recalled to mind that drake bampfylde had killed a poor schoolfellow in his young days for which the lord had most righteously sent a shark in pursuit of him it was likely enough that he would go on killing children upon occasion seventh reason and perhaps worth all the restonly think what a motive he had for it no one else could gain sixpence by it drake bampfylde would gain everythingthe succession to the title and estates and the immediate right to aspire to the hand of the beautiful heiress miss carey who was known to favour him an elderly woman who had been in the workhouse and throve upon that experience said that the captain would never have done it for he might have to do the like thing again every time the poor princess should happen to be confined almost but who could listen to this poor creature while the result lay there before them thus the common people reasoned but our susan attached no weight to any except the last argument as for one she knew quite well that the young seaman sauntered there quite by chance and quite by chance she spoke to him and as for wine she could take a quart of her fathers cider and feel it less than she could describe to any one and as for a rummer of that stuff she had it was quite below contempt to her and concerning the captain just being away and declining to say where he was like a gentleman none but ignorant folk could pretend not to know what that meant of course he was gone between the dances for a little cool walk in the firwoods together with his isabel and to expose her name to the public with their nasty way of regarding things was utterly out of the question to a real british officer and to finish it mrs shapland said that she was almost what you might call a young woman even now at any rate with ten times the sense any of the young ones were up to and ten years of her life she would give if charley would allow of her to know what became of them two little dears and to punish the villain that wronged them hereupon my warmth of heart got the better of my prudence my wise and pure intention was to get out of this good woman all i could but impart to her nothing more than was needful just to keep her talking experience shows us that this need be very little indeed if anything in a female dialogue but now i was brought to such a pitch of tenderness by this time with my heart in a rapid pulse of descriptions and the eggflip going round sturdily also polly looking at me in a most beseeching way that i could not keep my own counsel even but was compelled to increase their comfort by declaring every thing chapter lxv so does poor old davy hereupon you may well suppose that the grass must no longer grow under my feet with one man and positively two women in this very same county having possession of my secret how long could i hope to work this latter to any good purpose luckily burrington lay at a very great distance from nympton on the moors and with no road from one to the other so that if mr and mrs shapland should fail of keeping their promised tightness at least two barnstaple marketdays must pass before nympton heard anything and but for this consideration even their style of treatment would not have made me so confiding on the following morn while looking forth at pigs and calves and cocks and ducks i perceived that the crash must come speedily and resolved to be downright smart with it so after making a brisk little breakfast upon the two wings and two legs of a goose grilled with a trifle of stuffing there was but one question i asked before leaving many warm tears behind me good mistress shapland would you know that jemmyset of the child if you saw it captain wells i am not quite a natural my own stitching done with a clubhead all of it and of a threelined thread as my uncles and nobody else had to barnstaple likewise the mark of the princess done a mannygram as they call it the weather was dull and the time of year as stormy as any i know of nevertheless it was quite fine now and taking upon myself to risk five guineas out of my savings ilfracombe was the place i sought and found it with some difficulty thus might barnstaple bar be avoided and all the tumbling of inshore waters and thus with no more than a pilotyawl did i cross that dangerous channel at the most dangerous time of the year almost nothing less than my royal clothes and manifest high rank in the navy could have induced this fine old pilot to make sail for the opposite coast in the month of november when violent gales are so common with us but i showed him two alternatives three golden guineas on the one hand impressment on the other for a pressgang was in the neighbourhood now and i told him that i was its captain and that we laughed at all certificates and not being sure that this man and his son might not combine to throw me overboard steal my money and run back to port i took care to let them perceive my entry of their names and my own as well in the register of the coastguard however they proved very honest fellows and we anchored under porthcawl point soon after dark that evening having proved to the pilot that he was quite safe here unless it should come on to blow from southeast of which there was no symptom and leaving him under the care of sandy who at my expense stood treat to him i made off for candleston not even stopping for a chat with roger berkrolles the colonel of course as well as his sister lady bluett and rodney wore delighted with what i had to tell them while the maid herself listened with her face concealed to the tale of her own misfortune once or twice she whispered to herself oh my poor poor father and when i had ended she rose from the sofa where lady bluetts arm was around her and went to the colonel and said how soon will you take me to my father my darling bertha said the colonel embracing her as if she had been his daughter we will start tomorrow if llewellyn thinks the weather quite settled and the boat quite safe he knows so much about boats you see it would take us a week to go round by land but we wont start at all if you cry my dear i did not altogether like the tone of the colonels allusion to me still less was i pleased when he interrupted lady bluetts congratulations thanks and fervent praises of my skill perseverance and trustiness in discovering all this villany humph said the colonel i am not quite sure that this villany would have succeeded so long unless a certain small boat had proved so adapted for fishing purposes why henry cried his sister how very unlike you what an unworthy insinuation after all mr llewellyn has done it is positively ungrateful and he spoke of that boat in this very room as i can perfectly well remember notoh noti am sure any more than a very few years ago my dear exactly said the colonel too few years ago if he had spoken of that at the time as distinctly as he did afterwards when the heat of inquiry was over and when sir philip himself had abandoned it i do not see how all this confusion between the loss of a foreign ship and the casting away of a british boat could have arisen or at any rate could have failed to be cleared away llewellyn you know that i do not judge hastily sir i condemn your conduct oh colonel how dreadful of you mr llewellyn go and look at the weather while i prove to the colonel his great mistake you did speak of the boat at the very inquest in the most noble and positive manner and nobody would believe you as you your very self told me what more could any man do we are none of us safe if we do our very best and have it turned against us my conscience all this time was beating so that i could hear it this is a gift very good men have and i have made a point of never failing to cultivate it in this trying moment with even a man so kind and blameless suddenly possessed no doubt by an evil spirit against me stanch as rock my conscience stood and to my support it rose creditably for both of us colonel lougher my answer was you will regret this attack on the honour of a british officer one moreover whose greatgrandfather harped in your honours family captain bluett understands the build of a boat as well as i do he shall look at that boat tomorrow morning and if he declares her to be englishbuilt you may set me down with all my stripes and medals for a rogue sir but if he confirms my surety of her being a foreigner nothing but difference of rank will excuse you colonel lougher from being responsible to me my spirit was up as you may see and the honour of the british navy forced me to speak strongly although my affection for the man was such that sooner than offend him i would have my other arm shot away llewellyn said the colonel with his fine old smile spreading very pleasantly upon his noble countenance you are of the peppery order which your old welsh blood produces think no more of my words for the present and if my nephew agrees with you in pronouncing the boat a foreigner i will give you full satisfaction by asking your pardon llewellyn it was enough to mislead any man not to dwell upon this mistake committed by so good a man but which got abroad somehowthough my old friend crumpy i am sure could never have been listening at the doorbe it enough in this hurry to say that on the next morning i was enabled to certify the weather a smartish breeze from the northnorthwest with the sea rather dancing than running took poor bardie to her native coast from which the hot tide had borne her before we set sail i had been to sker in colonel loughers twowheeled gig and obtained from good moxy the childs jemmyset from the old oak chest it was stored in and now i did a thing which must for ever acquit me of all blame so wrongfully cast upon me that is to say i fetched out the old boat which sandy macraw had got covered up and releasing him in the most generous manner from years and years of backrent what did i do but hitch her on to the stern of the pilotyawl for to tow not only this but i managed that rodney should sail on board as her skipper and for his crew should have somebody who had crossed the channel before in that same poor and worthless boat sixteen years agone i do declare and they did carry on a bit now and then when our spritsail hid them from our view for the day was bright and the sea was smooth the colonel and i were on board of the yawl enjoying perfect harmony for captain rodney of course had confirmed my opinion as to the build of the boat and his uncle desired to beg my pardon which the largeness of my nature quite refused to hear of if a man admits that he has wronged me satisfied i am at once and do not even point out always that i never could have done the like to him colonel lougher had often been at sea in the time of his active service and he seemed to enjoy this trip across channel and knew all the names of the sails and spars but falling in as we did with no less than three or four small craft on our voyage he asked me how delushys boat could possibly have been adrift for a whole night and day on the channel without any ship even sighting her i told him that this was as simple as could be during that state of the weather a burning haze or steam from the land lay all that time on the water and the lower part thereof was white while the upper spread was yellow also the sea itself was white from the longcontinued calmness so that a white boat scarcely would show at half a mile of distance and even if it did what sailors were likely to keep a smart lookout in such roasting weather men talk of the heat ashore sometimes but i know that for downright smiting blinding and overwhelming sunpower there is nothing ashore to compare with a ship also i told the colonel now that his faith in me was reestablished gliding over the water thus i was enabled to make plain to him things which if he had been ashore might have lain perhaps a little beyond his understanding i showed him the set of the tides by tossing corks from his bottles overboard and begging him to take a glass of my perspective to watch them and he took such interest in this and evinced so much sagacity that in order to carry on my reasoning with any perspicacity cork after cork i was forced to draw to establish my veracity because he would argue it out that a boat unmanned and even unmasted never could have crossed the channel as bardies boat must needs have done i answered that i might have thought so also and had done so for years and years till there came the fact to the contrary of which i was pretty well satisfied now and when the boat was produced and sworn to who would not be satisfied also i begged to remind him how strongly the tide ran in our channel and that even in common weather the ebb of the spring out of barnstaple river might safely be put at four knots an hour till hartland point was doubled here about two in the morning the flood would catch the little wanderer and run her up channel some ten or twelve miles with the nightwind on the starboardbeam driving her also northward when this was exhausted the ebb would take her into swansea bay almost being so light a boat as she was with a southern breeze prevailing and then the next flood might well bring her to skerexactly the thing that had come to pass moreover i thought as i told the colonel although of course with diffidence from long acquaintance with tropical waters and the power of the sun upon them i thought it by no means unlikely that the intense heat of the weather then for more than six weeks prevailing might have had some strong effect on the set and the speed of the currents however no more of arguments what good can they do when the thing is there and no reasoning can alter it even parson chowne might argue and no doubt would with himself although too proud with other people that all he did was right and himself as good a man as need be we ran across channel in some six hours having a nice breeze abaft the beam and about the middle of the afternoon we landed at ilfracombe cleverly this is a little place lying in a hole and with great rocks all around it fair enough to look at but more easy to fall down than to get up them and even the barnstaple road is so steep that the first hill takes nearly two hours of climbing therefore in spite of all eager spirits we found ourselves forced to stay there that night for no one would horse us onwards so late at this november season perhaps however it was worth while to lose a few hours for the sake of seeing delushys joy in her native land this like a newlyopened spring arose and could not contain itself as soon as her foot touched the shore i began to look forward to a bout of it for i understand young women now very well though the middleaged are beyond me these latter i hope to be up to if ever i live to the age of fourscore years as my constitution promises and if the lord should be pleased to promote me to the ripe and honest century as was done to my greatgrandfather then i shall understand old women also though perhaps without teeth to express it however this was a pretty thing and it touched me very softly none but those who have roamed as i have understand the heartache for my native land i had it ever and continually and in the roar of battle i was borne up by discharging it and so i could enter into our poor bardie going about with the tears in her eyes for she would not allow me to rest at the inn as i was fain to do in the society of some ancient fishermen and to leave the gentlefolk to their own manner of getting through the evening come out she cried old davy you are the only one that knows the way about this lovely place of course i had no choice but to obey sir philips own granddaughter although i could not help grumbling and thus we began to explore a lane as crooked as a corkscrew and with ferns like palmtrees feathering in among them little trickling rills of water tinkled or were hushed sometimes by moss and it looked as if no frost could enter through the leafy screen above what a country to be born in what a country to belong to exclaimed the maid continually sipping from each crystal runnel and stroking the ferns with reverence uncle henry dont you think now that it is enough to make one happy to belong to such a land well my dear said her uncle henry as she had been ordered to call the colonel i think it would still more conduce to happiness for some of the land to belong to you ah llewellyn i see is of my opinion so i was and still more so next day when having surmounted that terrible hill we travelled down rich dairy valleys on our road to barnstaple here we halted for refreshment and to let delushy rest and beautify herself although we could see no need of that and now she began to get so frightened that i was quite vexed with her her first duty was to do me credit and how could she manage it if her eyes were red the colonel also began to provoke me for when i wanted to give the maid a stiff glass of grog to steady her he had no more sense than to countermand it and order a glass of cold water as soon as we came to narnton court we found a very smart coach in the yard that quite put to shame our hired chaise although the good colonel had taken four horses so as to land us in moderate style of course it was proper that i who alone could claim sir philips acquaintance as well as the merit of the whole affair should have the pleasure of introducing his new grandchild to him so that i begged all the rest to withdraw and the only names that we sent in were captain llewellyn and miss delushy therefore we were wrong no doubt in feeling first a little grievance then a largeminded impatience and finally a strong desireay and not the desire aloneto swear before we got out of it i speak of myself and captain bluett two good honest sailors accustomed to declare their meaning since the war enabled them but colonel lougher who might be said from his want of active service to belong to a past generation as well as delushy who was scarcely come into any generation yetthese two really set an example good though hard to follow chapter lxvi the maid at last is dentified however as too often happens we blamed a good man without cause a good man rarely deserves much blame whereas a bad man cannot have too muchwhether he has earned it or otherwiseto restrain him from deserving more the reason why sir philip bampfylde kept us so long waiting proved to be a sound and valid one namely that he was engaged in earnest and important converse with his daughterinlaw lady bampfylde now wife if you will please to remember to commodore sir drake bampfylde although by birth entitled the honourable isabel carey the one that had been so good to me when i was a ferryman of superior order certainly but still no more than a ferryman since my rise in the world began i have found out one satisfactory thingthat a man gets on by merit how long did i despair of this and smoke pipes and think over it seeing many of my friends advancing by what i call roguery and but for the war which proves the hearts and reins of men as my ancestor says i might still have been high and dry being too honest for the fishtrade however true merit will tell in the end if a man contrives to live long enough so when the beautiful lady came out through the room where i sate waiting as i touched my venerable forelock to her as humbly as if for a sixpenny piece a brave mans honest pride wrought weakness in my eyes as i gazed at her i loved her husband and i loved her and i thought of the bitter luck between them which had kept them separate partly of course the glory of england and duty of a proud mans birth partly also bad luck of course and a style of giving in to it but ten times more than these the tricks that lower our fellowcreatures this noble and stately lady did not at first sight recognise me but when i had told her in very few words who i was and what i had done and how long i had sailed with her husband and how highly he respected me her eyes brightened into the old sweet smile although they bore traces of weeping my name is not lady carey she said for i was calling her thus on purpose not knowing how she was taking wedlock and being of opinion that an honourable miss ought always to be called a lady my name is lady bampfylde and i like it if you please although i remember mr llewellyn what your views are of matrimony you used to declare them only too plainly whenever we crossed your ferry for the purpose as i used to think of driving poor nanette to despair of you and a lucky thing for me your ladyship to have acted so consistently but his honour the commodore of course holds the opposite opinion it is hard to guess the opinions of a commodore always on service sir drake as i daresay you have heard can scarcely bear to come home now i saw that she was vexed by something and also vexed with herself perhaps for having even hinted it for she turned her beautiful face away and without a word would have left me but with my usual quickness of step i ran into the lobbyplace and back in a moment with our delushy clinging like a woodbine to a post at such moments i never speak until women begin with questions it saves so much time to let them begin because they are sure to insist on it meanwhile delushy was making the prettiest curtsy that presence of mind permitted you lovely dear why who are you cried lady bampfylde with a start that made me dread hysterics i do not know madam answered delushy with the whole of her mind so well in hand by reason of years of suffering but many people believe me to be the bertha bampfylde that was lost nearly twenty years agone what the baby the babyat least one of the babiesthat my husbanddavid llewellyn this is very cruel of you and that was all the thanks i got while what could i have done otherwise in five minutes more she would have been off in her grand coach with six horses after offending sir philip so much that he could not have borne to look after her although of course he was now coming out like a gentleman to a visitor seeing such a paynight coming and a large confusion i begged colonel lougher and captain bluett to keep for a little while out of it and nothing could more truly prove how thoroughly these were gentlemen than that they withdrew to a niche of the underbutlers pantry wherein they could hear no word of it it was now my place to stand forward bravely and to put things clearly without any further loss of reason and even without considering how these delicate ladies might contrive to take my meaning nicely to spare good ladies from any emotion is one of the main things of my life although they show such a want of gratitude when i have done my utmost but as for frightening sir philip of course i had no scruple about that because of his confidence in the lord therefore abandoning lady bampfylde to the care of her maid who was running up from the servants hall to look after her i fixed my hook screwed on for the purpose firmly into delushys sleeve that she might not faint or run away or do anything else unreasonable and i led her up the long hall to meet sir philip as he came down the steps at the upper end thereof the old general looked rather haggard and feeble as if the power of his life were lowered by perpetual patience but something had happened to vex him no doubt in his interview with lady bampfylde so that he walked with more than his usual stateliness and dignity he had never beheld me as a onearmed man nor yet in my present uniform for i took particular care to avoid him during the day or two spent at his house before i went to burrington so for a moment he did not know me but gazed with surprise at the lovely figure which i was sustaining so clumsily sir philip bampfylde allow me i said stretching forth my right hand to him to repay you for some of the countless benefits you have heaped upon me by presenting you with your longlost granddaughterand your grandson to come afterwards it cannot be it cannot be was all he could say although for so many years he had shown his faith that it must be his fine old countenance turned as white as the silver hair that crowned it and then as red as it could have been in the hopeful blush of boyhood and the pure and perfect delicacy of high birth quickened with sorrow prevented him from examining delushy as he longed to do speak up child speak up said i giving her a haul with my hook as when first i landed her cant you tell your dear grandfather how glad you are to see him that i will with all my heart the maiden answered bashfully yet lifting her eyes to the old mans face with pride as well as reverence as soon as i perceive that you sir wish to hear me say it you will not think me rudei am scarcely strong enough for thisit has come on me so suddenly and it must be quite as bad for you lead the young lady to a chair llewellyn or stay i beg your pardon it will perhaps be better to call our kind and worthy housekeeper sir philip perceived a thing which had escaped me though brought to my notice beforehand by our good colonel lougher that is to say how hard it would be upon the feelings of this young girl to have her identity as crowner bowles entitled it discussed in her own presence therefore she was led away by that regular busybody the housekeeper mrs cockhanterbury while i begged leave to introduce colonel lougher and captain bluett to sir philip bampfylde and then when all had made their bows and all due salutations i was called upon to show my documents and explain the evidence so carefully gathered by me it is as much above my power as beyond my purpose to tell how that ancient and noble gentleman after so much worry from the long neglect of providence took as if he had never deserved it this goodness of the lord to him of course in my class of life we cannot be always dwelling on children whose nature is provoking always and in nothing more so than that they will come when not wanted yet are not forthcoming with the folk who can afford them nevertheless i think that if the lord had allowed any thief of a fellow much more one of his own ministers to steal two grandchildren of mine and make a savage of one baby and of the other a castaway the whole of my piety would have been very hard pushed to produce any gratitude sir philip however did appear most truly desirous to thank god for this great mercy vouchsafed to him even before he had thoroughly gone through the ins and outs of the evidence for he begged us to excuse him while he should go to see to our comfort and two fine bottles of wine white and red appeared and began to disappear under my hatches mainly before our noble host came back to set us a good example and when he came he had quite forgotten to dust the knees of some fine kerseymere and the shins of black silk stockings deep sense of religion is quite in its place when a man has had one arm shot off still more so if both arms are gone and after a leg indispensable nevertheless it must not be intruded upon any one no not even by the chaplain till the doctor shakes his head knowing also that colonel lougher had a tendency towards it enough to stop the decanters if he should get upon that subject with the arguments it sticks fast in i was delighted to see delushy slipping into the room as if she had known the place for a century the general clearly had managed to visit her during the time of his absence from us what passed between them matters not except that he must have acknowledged her for now she went up to him and kissed him rather timidly perhaps but still she touched his forehead then he arose and stood very upright as if he had never begun to stoop and passing his arm round her delicate waist both her hands he took in his and as they faced us we were struck with the likeness between blooming youth and worn but yet majestic age gentlemen he said or rather i should call you kind good friends you have brought me not only a grandchild but the very one i would have chosen if the whole world gave me choice byandby you shall see her stand by the picture of my dear and longlamented wife that i think will convince you that we want no further evidence for me these thumbnails are enough bertha show your thumbnails she laughed her usual merry laugh although she had been crying so while she spread her dainty hands exactly as she used to spread them when she was only two years old with me alone to look at her here it is sir cried the general overlooking me in the rush of his sentiments towards the colonel here is the true bampfylde mark even the bassets have it not nor the traceys nor the st albyns will you oblige me by observing that these two thumbnails have a most undoubted right and left to them bertha do try to keep still for a moment well i declare said the colonel calmly taking out his eyeglass yes i declare you are right my good sir here is a most evident right and leftandalusia do stand stillnot only in the halfmoons at the base but in the vein and what i may call the radiants of the pinkness i cannot express my meaning butmy darling come and kiss me this delushy did at once as for years she used to do and not being certain even now whether she ought to forsake the colonel for a general though proved to be a very fine and newlyturned up grandfather none of us had thought of her and the many shifts of female wind coming to pass perhaps inside her little brain and heart so wherefore this poor david who desires always to be the last but by force of nature is compelled for ever to take the leadi it was who got her off to bed that we might talk of her chapter lxvii dog eats dog to a man whose time of life begins to be a subject of some consideration to him when the few years still in hope can be counted on a hand and may not need a finger and with the tide of this world ebbing to the inevitable seato him there is scarcely any sweet and gentle pastime more delightful than to sit on a bank of ancient moss beside a tidal river and watch the decreasing waters and prove his own eternity by casting a pebble into them hence it was that sir philip bampfylde on the very morning after i gave him back his grandchild sate gazing into the ebb of the tawe some fifty yards below the spot whence jack wildmans father carried off so wickedly that helpless pair of children here it was my privilege to come up to sir philip and spread before him my humble reasons for having preferred the kitchen last night to the diningroom and the drawingroom it was consistent with my nature and he though wishing otherwise agreed not to be offended then i asked him how the young lady whose health every one of us had honoured all over the kitchentable had contrived to pass the night and whether she had seen her father yet he said she had slept pretty well considering but that as concerned her father they had not thought it wise to let her see him until the doctor came there was no telling how it might act upon squire philips constitution after so many years of misery cobwebs and desolation for providence had not gifted him with a mind so strong as his fathers was and the sudden break in on the death of the mind has been known in such a case to lead to bodily decease but few things vexed the general more than that wretched lie of chownes and slander upon a loyal family while in service of the crown what captain drake had landed from the boat was not an armchest but a chest of plate and linen belonging to his brother which he would no longer borrow while the squire so cruelly dealt with him then i asked sir philip whether the ancient builder over at appledore had been sent for to depose to the boat for we had brought that little craft on the top of our coach from ilfracombe the general said that i might see him even now examining her if i would only take the trouble to look round the corner but he himself was so well convinced without any further testimony that he did not even care to hear what the old man had to say of it any more than he cared for the jemmyset this however is not my manner of regarding questions not from any private fountains of conviction and so on but out of the mouths of many witnesses shall a thing be established therefore i hastened round the corner to sift this ancient boatwright as surly a fellow as ever lived and from his repugnance to my uniform one who had made more money i doubt by the smugglers keg than the shipwrights adze entering into his nature at sight i took the upper hand of him as my rank insisted on hark ye now master shipcarpenter where was this little craft put together according to your opinion either this fellow was deaf as a post or else he meant to insult me for he took no more notice of me than he did of the pigs that were snuffling at beechnuts down by the side of the landingplace i am not the right man to put up with insolence therefore i screwed my hammerhead into the socket below my muscles and therewith dealt him a tap on his hat just to show what might come afterwards receiving this administration and seeing that more was very likely from the same source to be available what did this rogue do but endeavour to show the best side of his manners wherefore to let him have his say here is his opinion this here boat be the same as i built year as my wife were took with quinzy and were called home by the lord i built her for wildduck of appledore a little dandyrigged craft as used to be hired by capen bampfylde to this here boat i can swear although some big rogue have been at work painting her as knew not how to paint and a lubber no doubt every now and then patching her up or repairing of her the name in her stern have been painted up from wildduck appledore into santa lucia salvador three or four letters are my own the rest are the work of some pirate she be no more foreignbuild than i be but a sailor accustomed to foreign parts would be sure to reckon so reason why i served my time with a builder over to portauprince and i should like to see the man anywhere round these here parts as can tuck in the bends as i does leaving this conceited fellow to his narrow unpleasantness i turned my head and there beheld captain bluett harkening come he cried out in his hearty manner what a cooks boiling of fools we are here we are chewing a longchewed quid while the devil that brewed this gale of wind may fly far away and grin at us llewellyn do you mean to allow hush i said softly for that low shipwright showed his eyes coming up under his cap and i saw that he was that particular villain after his scurrilous words about me who would sell his soul to that wretch of a chowne for halfacrown aweek almost therefore i led our young captain bluett well away out of this fellows hearing davy said he we all know your courage your readiness and your resources still you appear to be under a spelland you know you are superstitious about this cunning and cowardly blackguard who frightens the whole of this country as he never could frighten glamorganshire i have no fear of him sir i said i will go with you to confront him why your teeth are ready to chatter llewellyn and your lips are blue you who stood like a milestone they tell me at the helm of the goliath or like a clock going steadily tick before we fired a shot and with both shell and shot through your grey whiskers but captain a minister of the lord master a minister of the devilonce for all today i go to horsewhip him if he is young enough or to pull his nose if he is old enough and old harry be with him in choice of the two zounds sir is it a thing to laugh at rodney bluett was well known to every one who served under him for the mildness of his language and the want of oaths he had and so of course for his selfcontrol and the power of his heart when it did break forth everybody loved him because he never cursed any one at a venture and kept himself very close to facts however hard driven by circumstances so that i was now amazed to hear this young man spoil my pipe with violent emotions have you consulted sir philip i asked it is his place to take up the question what question there is no question the thing is proved my duty is plain sir philip is too old to see to it the squire is a spooney the commodore is not here yet i have spoken to his wife who is a very sweet and wise lady and she agrees with me that it will save the family a world of scandal and perhaps failure of the law for me to take the law into my own hands and thrash this blackguard within an inch of his life to be sure and save her husband from the risk of tackling a desperate man it is most wise on her part but i beg you my dear sir for the sake of your dear uncle and your good mother keep clear of this quarrel you know not the man you have to deal with even if you can thrash him which is no easy business he will shoot you afterwards he is the deadest shot in the county hurrah cried rodney tossing up his hat that entirely settles it come along old fellow and show us the way and not a word to any one now this may seem a very mad resolve for a man of my sense to give into but whether i turned myself this way or that i could see no chance of bettering it if i refused to go young rodney as i could see by the set of his mouth would go alone and perhaps get killed and then how could any of the family ever look at me again on the other hand if i should go to the colonel or to the general for opinion and to beg them to stop it my interferencenine chances to onewould only end in giving offence among the superior orders add to this my real desire to square it out with chowne himself after all his persecution and you may be able to forgive me for getting upon horseback after many years of forbearance and with my sugarnippers screwed on to lay hold by the forestay if she should make bad weather also i felt it my duty to take a doublebarrelled pistol heavily loaded and well primed captain rodney forged ahead so on a real huntingcraft that my dappled grey being warranted not to lurch me overboard could not keep in line whatever sail i made upon her my chief rule in life is not to hurry what good ever comes of it people only abuse you and your breath is too short to answer them moreover i felt an uneasy creaking in my bends from dousing forward and then easing backward as a man must do who knows how to ride the captain was wroth with me out of all reason but as he could not find the way to nympton moors without me i was enabled to take my leisure having the surety of overgetting him when the next crossroad came therefore it was late afternoon when we turned into the black firgrove which led up to the house of chowne and rodney bluett clutched the big whip in his hand severely for we had asked at the little inn of which i spoke a long time ago whether the parson was now at home ay that un be said the man with a grin for we did not see the landlady but ye best way not to go nigh un already i seemed not to feel as i hoped in the earlier stage of the journey my thoughts had been very upright for a while and spirited and delighted but now i began to look at things from a different point of view almost it is not mans business to worry his head about righting of wrongs in this world unless they are done to himself and if so revenge is its name and an ugly one long life leads one to forgive when to carry it on would be troublesome through the drip of dying leaves the chill of dull november now began to darken over us as we turned the corner of chownes own road and faced his lonely mansion the house had a heavy and sullen look according to my ideas not receiving light and pleasure of the sun when possible heavy firtrees overhung it never parting with their weight and the sunset when there was any could not pierce the holmoaks what a gloomy and devilish place cried rodney bluett beginning to tremble from some unknown influence upon my soul if i lived here i should be hatching plots myself or is it the nature of the man that has made the place so horrible let us go back said i come back my good sir i conjure you such a man should be left to god to punish in his own good time hark cried rodney pulling up and listening through the gloomy wood that was a womans scream i am sure is he murdering some more little ones we listened and heard a loud piercing shriek that made our hair stand on end almost so mad was it and so unearthly and then two more of yet wilder agony and after that a long low wailing on on cried rodney bluett you know these paths gallop on davy you go first i answered your horse is fresher i am comingto be sure i amdo you think i am frightened well i dont know he replied but i am not ashamed to own that i am clapping spurs to his horse he dashed on and thoroughly miserable as i felt there was nothing for me but to follow him in the name of the lord what a sight we came on where the drive sweeps round at the corner of the house under a dark tree of some sort and on a garden bench we discovered the figures of two women or rather one sate on the bench the other lay stretched on the ground with her head cast recklessly back on the ledge her hair spread in masses over it and both hands pressed on her eyes and ears to shut out sight and hearing her lips were open and through her white teeth came wails of anguish that would have been shrieks if nature had not failed her but the elder woman sate upright in scorn of all such weakness with her gaunt figure drawn like a cable taut no sign of a tear on her shrunken cheeks and the whole of her face as numb and cold as an iced figurehead in the arctic seas yet no one with knowledge of the human race could doubt which of these two suffered most we reined up our horses and gazed in terror for neither of them noticed us and then we heard from inside the house sounds that made our flesh creep barking howling snapping of teeth baying as of a human bloodhound frothy splutterings of fury and then smothered yelling her have a gat un now cried a clown running round the end of the house as if he were enjoying it reckon our passon wunt baite much moore after passon jack be atop of un oh sir oh sir oh for gods sake sir cried the poor lady who had lain on the ground rushing up to us and kneeling and trying to get hold of us you must have come to stop it sir only one hourallow him one hour dear dear sirs for repentance he has not been a good man i know but i am his own wife good kind sirsand if he could only have a little time if it were only half an hourhe might he might here a sound of throttling came through a broken windowpane and down she fell insensible what does it mean cried rodney bluett is it murder madness or suicide follow me davy here i go anyhow into the thick of it he dashed through the window and i with more caution cocking my pistol followed him while i heard the clown shouting after us danged vules both of e bide outside bide outside i tell e oh that we had remained outside i have been through a great deal of horrible sights enough to harden any man and cure him of womanly squeamishness yet never did i behold or dream of anything so awful as the scene that lay before me people were longing to look at it now but none save ourselves durst enter it was chownes own diningroom all in the dark except where a lamp had been brought in by a trembling footman who ran away knowing that he brought this light for his master to be strangled by and in the corner now lay his master smothered under a featherbed yet with his vicious head fetched out in the last rabid struggle to bite there was the black hair black face and black tongue shown by the frothy wainscot or between it and the ticking on the featherbed lay exhausted and with his mighty frame convulsed so that a child might master him parson jack rambone the strongest man whose strength like all other powers had laid a horrible duty upon him sobbing with all his great heart he lay yet afraid to take his weight off and sweating at every pore with labour peril of his life and agony oh dick dick he said quite softly and between his pantings how many larks have we had together and for me to have to do this to you i am sure you knew me before you died i think you know me now dick oh for gods sake shut your eyes darling dick are you dead are you dead you are the very cleverest fellow ever i came across of you can do it if you like oh dear dick dick my boy do shut your eyes we stood looking at them with no power to go up to them all experience failed us as to what was the proper thing to do till i saw that chownes face ought to have a napkin over it none had been laid for dinner but i knew where butlers keep them when i had done this parson jack who could not escape from the great black eyes arose and said i thank you sir he staggered so that we had to support him but not a word could we say to him i am bitten in two places if not more he rather gasped than said to us as he laid bare his enormous arms i care not much i will follow my friend or if the lord should please to spare me henceforth i am an altered man and yet for the sake of my family will you heat the kitchen poker chapter lxviii the old pitcher at the well again it helps a thoughtless man on his road towards a better kingdom to get a glimpse every now and then of such visitations of the lord when i was a little boy nothing did me so much good in almost all the bible as to hear my father read the way in which herod was eaten of worms and now in mature years i received quite a serious turn by the death of this parson chowne of ignominious canine madness and still more when i came to know by what condign parental justice this visitation smote him for while the women were busy upstairs by candlelight and with some weeping it fell to parson rambones lot to lay the truth before us this great man took at once to captain rodney bluett as if he had known him for years nor did he fail to remember me and in his distress to seek some comfort from my simple wisdom so having packed all the country boobies constables doctors and so on out of the house we barred the door made a bright fire in the kitchen and sat down in front of it while a nice cook began to toss up some sweetbreads and eggs and hamcollops and so on for our really now highly necessary sustenance you may remember the time i met with a very nice fellow then chownes headgroom who gave me a capital supper of tripe elegantly stewed by a young cookmaid himself lamenting the stress laid upon him by circumstances not to make his wife of her he told me then with a sigh of affection between his knife and fork that social duties compelled him instead to marry a publicans daughter with fifty pounds down on the nail he believed if it was a penny nevertheless he felt confident that all would be ordered aright in the end now providence had not allowed such a case of faith to pass unrewarded he married the publicans daughter got her money and paid the last sad duties to her out of the pocket of his fatherinlaw in a christianminded manner and then back he came to nympton rectory and wedded that same cookmaid who now was turning our ham so cleverly with the eggslice thus we could speak before them both without the least constraint and indeed he helped us much by his knowledge of the affairs of the family also two justices of the peace who had signed the warrant for poor chownes end upon the report of the doctors but could find no one of strength and courage to carry it out except parson jack these sate with us to get their supper before the long cold ride over the moors and there sate parson jack himself with his thick hands trembling hopeless of eating a morsel but dreading to be left alone for a moment what a difference it will make in all this neighbourhood to be sure so said one of their worships ay that it will answered his brother magistrate since tom faggus died there has not been such a man to be found nowhere round these here parts no nor tom faggus himself said the other a noble highwayman he were but for mind not fit to hold a candle to our lamented friend now lying up there in the counterpane parson jack shuddered and shook his great limbs and feigned to have done so on purpose and then in defiance collected himself and laid his iron hand on the table watching every great muscle to see how long he could keep it from trembling then i arose and grasped his handfor nobody else understood him at alland he let me take it with reluctance wonder and then deep gratitude he had been saying to himselfas i knew though his lips never moved and his face was set in scorn of all our moralisingwithin himself he had been thinking i am jack ketch i am worse i am cain i have murdered my own dear brother and i who had seen him brand his bitten arm with the red hot poker laying the glowing iron on until the blood hissed out at it i alone could gage the strength of heart that now enabled him to answer my grasp with his poor scorched arm and to show his great tears and check them enough of this i cannot stand these melancholy subjects a man of irreproachable life with a tendency towards gaiety never must allow his feelings to play ducks and drakes with him if the justice of the almighty fell upon chowneas i said it wouldlet chowne die and let us hope that his soul was not past praying for it is not my place to be wretched because the biggest villain i ever knew showed his wit by dying of a disease which gave him power to snap at the very devil when in the fulness of time he should come thirsting to lay hold of him and but for my purpose of proving how purely justice does come home to us well contented would i be to say no more about him why had he been such a villain through life because he was an impostor why did he die of rabid madness under the clutch of his own best friend because he lashed his favourite hound to fly at the throat of his own grandfather not only does it confirm ones faith in the honesty of breeding but it enables me to acquit all the chownes of devonshireand a fine and wholesome race they areof ever having produced such a scamp in true course of legitimacy also enables me not to point out so much as to leave all my readers to think of the humble yet undeniable traces of old davys sagacity what had i said to mrs steelyard when she overbore me so upon an empty stomach madam i said your son you mean and it proved to be one of my famous hits at a range beyond that of other men when great stirs happen truth comes out as an earthquake starts the weasels everybody knows what fine old age those wandering gypsies come to the two most killing cares we have are money and reputation here behold gypsy wisdom the disregard of the latter of the two does away with the plague of the former they take what they want while we clumsy fellows toil for the cash as the only way to get the good estimation hence it was that chownes grandfather came about stealing as lively as ever at the age of ninety a wiry and leathery man he was and had once been a famous conjurer and now in his old age he came to sleep in his grandsons barn and to live on his grandsons ducks potatoes and pigeons this was last harvesttime just as chowne was enjoying his bit of cubhunting turning in from his sport one day in a very sulky humour with the hounds he was educating the parson caught his grandfather withdrawing in a quiet manner from a snug little henroost not knowing who it was for his mother had never explained a thing to him not even that she was his mother he thought it below his dignity to ride after this old fellow but at his heels stalked a tall young hound who had vexed him all day by surliness and was now whipped in for punishment at himloo boy he called out hike forrard catch him by the leg boy but the hound only showed his teeth and snarled so that chowne let out his long lash at him in a moment the dog sprang at his master who was riding a low cobhorse and bit him in the thigh and the horse in the shoulder and then skulked off to his kennel the hound was shot and the horse shared his fate in less than six weeks afterwards and as for the parson we know too well what they were forced to do with him in her first horror that stony woman even mrs steelyard when her son came ravening at her could not keep her secret it is the judgment of god she cried after all there is a god he set the dogs at his grandfather and now he would bite his own mother how she had managed to place him in the stead of the real chowne heir i never heard or at least no clear account of it for she was not as we know already one who would answer questions let him rest whoever he was his end was bad enough even for him enough of this frightfor it was a fright even to me i assure youlet us come back to the innocent people injured so long by his villany to begin with parson jack never in all his life had he taken a stroke towards his own salvation until by that horrible job he earned repentance fear and conscience and not only this for none of these would have stood him in any service with chowne still at his elbow but that the facewhich had drawn him for years like a loadstone of hell to destructionnow ever present in its terror till his prayers got rid of it shone in the dark like the face of a scarecrow if ever he durst think of wickedness his wife found the benefit of this change and so did his growing family and so did the people who flocked to his church in the pleasure of being afraid of him in the roads he might bite but in his surplice he was bound to behave himself or at least he must bite the churchwarden first yet no one would have him to sprinkle a child until a whole year was over and then he restored himself under a hint from a man beyond him in intellect he made everybody allow that the poker had entirely cured him by preaching from the bottom of his chest with a glass of water upon the cushion a sermon that stirred every heart with the text is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing i quit him with sorrow because i found him a man of true feeling and good tobacco we got on together so warmly that expense alone divided us he would have had me for parishclerk if i could have seen my way to it what prevails with a man like me foremost first of everything why love of the blessed native landwhich every good welshman will love me for i may have done a thing now and then below our native dignity except to those who can enter into all the things we look at it is not our nature altogether to go for less than our value we know that we are of the oldest blood to be found in this ancient island and we ask nothing more than to be treated as the superior race should be in the presence of such great ideas who cares what becomes of me i really feel that my marriage to polly and prolongation of a fine old breed scarcely ought to be spoken of a man who has described the battle of the nile need not dwell on matrimony hurried speech does not become me on any other subject everybody has the right to know and everybody does know how the whole of north devon was filled with joy talk and disputation as to commodore bampfylde and the brightness of his acquittal they drew him from barnstaple in a chaise with only two springs broken men having taken the horses out and done their best at collarwork he would have gladly jumped out and kicked them but for the feeling of their goodwill nothing would have detracted from this and the feasts that were felt to be due upon it if squire philip had only known how not to die at a time when nobody was seasonably called on to think of death but when he learned the shame inflicted by himself on his ancient race through trusting chowne and misbelieving his brother out of the selfsame womb and above all when he learned that chowne was the bastard of a gypsy he cast himself into his brothers arms fetched one long sigh and departed to a better world with his hat on this was the best thing that he could do if he had chosen the time aright and it saved a world of trouble sir philip felt it a good bit of course and so did sir drake bampfylde nevertheless if a living man withdraws into a shell so calmly what can he expect more lively than his undertakers this was good and left room for harry or rather young philip bampfylde to step into the proper shoes and have practice how to walk in them yet he was so caught with love of service and of the navy and so mad about nelson that the general could not help himself but let him go to sea again nelson is afloat just now the crappos and the dons appear to have made up their minds against us and the former have the insolence to threaten a great invasion if i only had two arms i would leave my polly to howl about me as it is they have turned me into a herring colonel lougher has raised a regiment and i am first drillsergeant our dear maid of sker would also give her beautiful son only six months old bampfylde lougher bluett to go to the wars and to fight the french if any one could only show her the way to do without him he cocks up his toes in a manner which proves that his feet are meant for ratlines how the war is raging i run to and fro upon hearing of felix farleys journal and am only fit to talk of it sir philip comes down with his best tobacco whenever he stops at candleston and a craft has been built for me on purpose by the old fellow at appledore and her name it is the maid of skerto dance across the channel whenever a onearmed man can navigate colonel lougher and even lady bluett have such trust in me that they cross if their dear delushy seems to pine too much for her husband and the maid herself has brought her son as proud as if he came out of a wreck to exhibit him to moxy and roger and bunny and stradling the clerkin a word to all the parish and the extraparochial district now i hope that nobody will ask me any more questions concerning any one male or female
