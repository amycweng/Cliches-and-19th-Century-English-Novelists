xix xx xxi xxii xxiii xxiv xxv xxvi xxvii xxviii cradock nowell chapter i within the new forest and not far from its western boundary as defined by the second perambulation of the good king edward the first stands the old mansion of the nowells the hall of nowelhurst not content with mere exemption from all feudal service their estate claims privileges both by grant and custom the benefit of morefall trees in six walks of the forest the right of digging marl and turbary illimitable common of pannage and license of drawing akermast pastime even of hawking over some parts of the crown landall these will be catalogued as claims quite indefeasible if the old estates come to the hammer through the events that form my story with many of these privileges the royal commissioners will deal in a spirit of scant courtesy when the nowell influence is lost in the neighbouring boroughs but as yet these claims have not been treated like those of some poor commoners pooh pooh my man dont be preposterous you know as well as i do these gipsy freedoms were only allowed to balance the harm the deer did and if the rights of that ancient family are ever called in question some there are which will require a special act to abolish them for charles the second of merry memory saddened somewhat of late years espied among the maids of honour an uncommonly pretty girl whose name was frances nowell he suddenly remembered what had hitherto quite escaped him how old sir cradock nowellbeautiful fannys fatherhad saved him from a pikethrust during cromwells crowning mercy in gratitude of course for this he began to pay most warm attentions to the hampshire maiden he propitiated that ancient knight with the only boon he cravedcraved hitherto all in vaina plenary grant of easements in the neighbourhood of his home soon as the charter had received the royal seal and signature the old gentleman briskly thrust it away in the folds of his velvet mantle then taking the same view of gratitude which his liege and master took home he went without delay to secure his privileges when the king heard of his departure without any kissing of hands he was in no wise disconcerted it was the very thing he had intended but when he heard that lovely fanny was gone in the same old rickety coach even ere he began to whisper and with no leave of the queen his majesty swore his utmost for nearly half an hour then having spent his fury he laughed at the sell as he would have called it if the slang had been invented and turned his royal attention to another of his wifes young maidens nowelhurst hall looks too respectable for any loose doings of any sort it stands well away from the weeping of trees like virtue shy of sentiment and therefore has all the wealth of foliage shed just where it pleases around it from a rising ground the house has sweet view of all the forest changes and has seen three hundred springs wake in glory and three hundred autumns waning spreading away from it wider wider slopes the chase as they call it with great trees stretching paternal arms in the vain attempt to hold it for two months of the twelve when the heather is in blossom all that chase is a glowing reach of amaranth and purple then it fades away to pale orange dim olive and a rusty brown when christmas shudders over it and so throughout young green and russet till the july tint comes back again oftentimes in the fresh spring morning the blackcocksheathpoults as they call themlift their necks in the livening heather swell their ruffing breasts and crow for their rivals to come and spar with them below the chase the whiskers of the curling wood converge into a giant beard tufted here and there with hues of a varying richness but for the main of it swelling and waving crisping fronding feathering coying and darkening here and there until it reach the silver mirror of the spreading sea and the seaman looking upwards from the warship bound for india looking back at his native land for the last of all times it may be over brushwood waves and billows of trees and the long heave of the gorseland now thats the sort of place he says as the distant gables glisten the right sort of berth for our jolly old admiral and me for his butler please god when weve licked them crappos as ought to be southwest of the house half a mile away and scattered along the warren the simple village of nowelhurst digests its own ideas in and out the houses stand endwise crossways skewified anyhow except upside down and some even tending that way it looks like a game of dominoes when the leaves of the table have opened and gape betwixt the players nevertheless it is all good english for none are bitterly poor there in any case of illness they have the great house to help them not proudly but with feeling and more than this they have a parson who leads instead of driving them there are two little shops exceedingly anxious to undersell each other and one mild alehouse conducted strictly upon philosophic principles philosophy under pressure a caviller would call it for the publican knows and so do his customers that if poachers were encouraged there or any uproarious doings permitted except in the week of the old and new year down would come his licenseboard like a flag hauled in at sunset pleasant folk who there do dwell calling their existence life and on the whole enjoying it more than many of us do forasmuch as they know their neighbours far better than themselves and perceive each cousins need of trial and console him when he gets it not but what we ourselves partake the first and second advantages only we miss the fruition of them by turning our backs on the sufferer nowelhurst village is not on the main road but keeps a straggling companionship with a quiet parish highway which requires much encouragement this little highway does its best to blink the many difficulties or if that may not be to compromise them and establish a pleasant footing upon its devious wandering course from the lymington road to ringwood here it goes zig to escape the frown of a heavybrowed crest of furzery and then it comes zag when no soul expects it because a little stream has babbled at it it even seems to bob and dip or jump as the case may be for fear of prying into an old oaks storey or dusting a piece of grass land the hardhearted traveller who lives express and is bound for the train at ringwood curses too often up hill and down dale the quiet lanes inconsistency what right has any road to do anything but go straight on end to its purpose what decent road stops for a gossip with flowersflowers overhanging the steep ascent or eavesdropping on the rabbitholes and as for the beauty of fernsconfound them they shelter the horseflythat horrible forestfly whose tickling no civilized horse can endure even locusts he has heard of as abounding in the new forest and if a swarm of them comes this very hot weather goodbye to him horse and trap newest patterns sweet plaid and chaste things and goodbye to thee thou bustling travellerwhether technically so called or otherwisea very good fellow in thy way but not of natures pattern so countersunk so turned in a lathe so pressed and rolled by steampower and then condensed hydraulically that the extract of flowers upon thy shirt is but as the oil of machinery but we who carry no chronometer neither puff locomotivelynow he is round the cornerlet us saunter down this lane beyond the markoak and the blacksmiths even to the sandy rise whence the hall is seen the rabbits are peeping forth again for the dew is spreading quietude the sun has just finished a good days work and is off for the western waters over the rounded heads and bosses and then the darker dimples of the manycoloured foliagemanycoloured even now with summers glory fusing itover heads and shoulders and breasts of heaving green floods the lucid amber trembling at its own beautythe first acknowledged leniency of the july sun now every moment has its difference having once acknowledged that he may have been too downright in his ride of triumph the sun like every generous nature scatters broadcast his amends over holt and knoll and lea and narrow dingle scooped with shadow where the brook is wimpling and through the breaks of grass and gravel where the heather purples scarcely yet in prime flush and down the tall wood overhanging mossed and lichened green and grey as the grove of druidsover through and under all flows pervading sunset then the birds begin discoursing of the thoughts within themthoughts that are all happiness and thrill and swell in utterance through the voice of the thicketbirdsthe mavis the whinchats and the warblerscomes the tap of the yaffingale the sharp short cry of the honeybuzzard above the squirrels cage and the plaining of the turtledove but from birds and flowers winding roads and woods and waters where the trout are leaping come we back to the only thing that interests a man muchthe life the doings and the death of his fellowmen from this piece of yellow road where the treeroots twist and wrestle we can see the great old house winking out of countless windows deep with sloping shadows mantling back from the clasp of the forest in a stately sad reserve it looks like a house that can endure and not talk about affliction that could disclose some tales of passion were it not undignified that remembers many a generation and is mildly sorry for them oh house of the nowells grey with shadow wrapped in lonely grandeur cold with the dews of evening and the tone of sylvan nightfall never through twenty generations hast thou known a darker fortune than is gathering now around thee growing through the summer months deepening ere the leaves drop all men we know are born for trial to work to bear to purify but some there are whom god has marked for sorrow from their cradle and strange as it appears to us whose image is inverted almost always these are they who seem to lack no probation the gentle and the large of heart the meek and unpretending yet gifted with a rank of mind that needs no selfassertion trebly vexed in this wayfaring we doubt not they are blest tenfold in the everlasting equipoise perhaps it was the july evening that made me dream and moralise but now let us gaze from that hill again under the fringe of autumns gold in the ripeness of october the rabbits are gone to bed much earliercomparatively i mean with the suns retirementbecause the dew is getting cold and so has lost its flavour and a nest of young weasels is coming abroad and really makes it unsafe my dear says mrs bunny to her third family to keep our longstanding engagements send cards instead says the timid miss cony i can write them mamma on a polypod now though the rabbits shirk their duty we can see the congregation returning down the village from the church which is over the bridge towards lymington and seems set aside to meditate in straggling groups as gossip lumps them or the afternoon sermon disposes home they straggle wondering whether the girl has kept the fire up kept the fire blissy is the bodily form of the housethought but all the experienced matrons of the village have got together and two who have served as monthly nurses are ready to pull sidehair out there is nothing like science for setting people hard by the ears and the throatstrings but we who are up in the forest here can catch no buzz of voices nor even gather the point of dispute while they hurry on to recount their arguments and triumph over the virile mind which of course knows nothing about it the question is when lady nowell will give an heir to the name the house the village the estates worth fifty thousand a yearan heir long time expected hoped for in vain through six long years now reasonably looked for all the matrons have settled that it must be on a sunday everybody knows that sunday is the day for all grand ceremonies even nanny gammons pigsbut why pursue their argumentsthe taste of the present age is so wonderfully nice and delicate i can only say that the gammers who snubbed the gaffers upon the subject miscarried by a fortnight though right enough hebdomadally they all fixed it for that day fortnight but it was done while they were predicting and not even the monthly nurses anticipated no one ever guessed at the contingency oftwins chapter ii whishtrew whishtrew every bit of me whativer will i do god knows the blue ribbon there forenint me and the blessed infants one to aich side the good nurse fell against a chest of drawers as she uttered this loud lament the colour ebbed from her cherry cheeks and her sturdy form shook with terror she had scarcely turned her back she could swear upon her precious charges and now only look at the murder of it two little cots stood side by side not more than four feet asunder and on each cot fast asleep lay a fine baby some three or four days old upon the floor between them was a small rosette of blue ribbon the infants were slumbering happily and breathing as calmly as could be each queer little dump of a face was nestled into its pillow and a small red podge which was meant for an arm lay crosswise upon the flannel nothing could look more delicious to the eyes of a fine young woman nevertheless that fine young woman mrs biddy ogaghan stood gazing from one cot to the other in hopeless and helpless dismay her comely round face was drawn out with horror her mouth wide open and large tears stealing into her broad blue irish eyes and the illigant spots upon them as like as two blemishing spannels nor the blissed saints in heaven if so be they was tuk to glory afore they do be made hairyticks cudnt know one from the ither no more nor the winds from the brazes and there go the doctors bell again oh whurrastrew whurra whurra now biddy ogaghan would scarcely have been headnurse at nowelhurst hall before she was thirty years old but for her quick selfreliance she was not the woman therefore to wring her hands long and look foolish her irish wit soon suggested so many modes of solution all so easy and all so delightfully free from reason that the only question was how to listen to all at once first she went and bolted carefully both the doors of the nursery then with a look of triumph she rushed to her yellow workbox snatched up a roll of narrow tape some pins and a pair of scissors and knelt upon the floor very gingerly where the blue ribbon lay then having pinned one end of the tape to the centre of the rosette and the rosette itself to the carpet she let the roll run with one hand and drew the tape tight with the other until it arrived at the nose of the babe ensconced in the righthand cot there she cut it off sharply with a snip that awoke the child who looked at her contemplatively from a pair of large grey eyes leaving him to his meditations she turned the tape on the pin and drew it towards the nasal apology of the other infant the measure would not reach it was short by an inch and a half what clearer proof could be given of the title to knot and pendency but alas for biddys triumph the infant last geometrised awoke at that very moment and lifting his soft fat legs in order to cry with more comfort disclosed the awkward fact that his left knee was nearer by three inches to the allimportant rosette than was any part of his brother biddy shook anew as she drew the tape to the dimples what is the legal centre of a human being upon my word i think i should have measured from the ere further measurement could be essayed all the premises were gone utterly for the baby upon the right contrived to turn in the flannels as an unsettled silkworm pupa rolls in his cocoon and he managed to revolve in the wrong direction it was his fate through life instead of coming towards the rosette as a selfish baby would have done away he went with his grey eyes blinking at the handle of the door then he put up his lips like the ring of a limpet and poked both his little fists into his mouth well i never cried bridget that settles it altogether plase the saints an he were a rogue its this way hed ha come over on his blessed little empty belly my darlin dumplin dillikins its you as it belongs to and a fool i must be to doubt of it dont i know the bend o your nose and the way your purty lips dribbles then and to think i was near a robbing you what with the sitting up o nights and the worry of that carroty spalpeen and the way as they sends my meals up paddy ogaghan as is in glory wud take me for another mans wife with great relief and strong conviction mrs ogaghan began to stitch the truant rosette upon the cap of the lastmentioned baby whence or from that of the other it had dropped through her own loose carelessness before they were cuddled away and with that ribbon she stitched upon him the heritage of the old family the name of cradock nowell borne by the eight last baronets and the largest estates and foremost rank in all the fair county of hants sure an it wont come off again said biddy to the baby as she laid down her needle for like all genuine irishwomen she despised a thimble and its meself as is to blame for not taking a nick on your ear dear a big fool i must be only to plait it in afore and only for thinkin as it wud come crossways when you wint to your blissed mammy dear and little more you be likely to get there im afeared me darlin an skeared anybody would be to hoort so much as a hair o your skull until such time as you has any you little jule of jewels and i kisses every bit on you and knows what you be thinking on in the dead hoor of the night bless your ticksywicksies and the ground as you shall step on and the childer as you shall have unprepared as yet to contemplate the pleasures of paternity master cradock nowell elect opened great eyes and great mouth in the untutored wrath of hunger while from the other cot arose a lusty yell as of one already visited by the injustice of the world this bitter cry awoke the softness and the faint misgivings of the irishwomans heart and the pity of the world it is ye cant both be the eldest and bedad you should if biddy ogaghan had the making of the laws there shant be any one iver can say as ye havent had justice me honey leaving both the unconscious claimants snugly wrapped and smiling she called to her assistants now calmly at tea in an inner room miss penny run down now just without thinking and give my compliments mrs ogaghans kind compliments to the housekeepers room and would mrs toaster oblige me with her big square scales no weights you neednt bring you know only the scales and be quick with them and please maam what shall i say as you wants them for never you mind jane penny wait you till your betters asks of you and maynt i weigh my grandfathers silver without ask you jane penny and likely youd rather not and good reason for that same i dessay after the way as i leaves it open overlooking this innuendo as well as the slight difficulty of weighing without weights imaginary bullion miss penny hurried away for the wrath of the nurse was rising and it was not a thing to be tampered with when jane returned with the beam of justice and lingered fondly in the doorway to watch its application the headnurse sidled her grandly into the little room and turned the key upon her go and finish your tea miss penny no draughts in this room if you please miss save their little sowls and divil a hair upon them now come here my two chickabiddies adjusting the scales on the bed where at night she lay with the infants warm upon her she took the two red lumps of innocence in her wellrounded arms and laid one in either scale as she did so they both looked up and smiled it reminded them i suppose of being laid in their cradles blessing them both and without any nervousnessfor to her it could make no differenceshe raised by the handle the balance it was a very nice questionwhich baby rose first from the counterpane so very slight was the difference that the rosette itself might almost have turned the scale but there was a perceptible difference of perhaps about half an ounce and that in favour of the sweettempered babe who now possessed the ribbon and who as the other rose slowly before him drew up his own little toes and tried prematurely to crow at him prematurely my boy in many ways no further mistrust was left in the mind of mrs ogaghan henceforth that rosetted infant is like to outweigh and outmeasure his brother a hundredfold a thousandfold in every balance by every standard save those of self and of true love and perhaps of the kingdom of heaven chapter iii the reason why mrs ogaghan generally so prompt and careful though never very lucid had neglected better precautions in a matter so important was simply and solely thislady nowell the delicate mother was dying it had been known ever since the birth that she had scarcely any chance of recovery and biddy loved her with all her warm heart and so did every one in the house who owned a heart that could love in the great anxiety all things were upside down none of the servants knew where to go for orders and few could act without them the housekeeper was all abroad housesteward there was none headbutler hogstaff cried in his pantry and wiped his eyes with the leathers and as for the master of them all sir cradock nowell himself he rarely left the darkened room and when he did he could not see well a sweet frail creature the young mother was wedded too early as happens here more often than we are aware of then disappointed and grieving still more at her husbands disappointment she had set her whole heart so long and so vainly upon prospective happiness that now it was come she had not the strength to do anything more than smile at it and smile she did very sweetly all the time she knew she was dying she felt so proud of those two fine boys and could not think how she had them ever so many times sir cradock hanging fondly over her wan sweet face ordered the little wretches away who would keep on coming to trouble her but every time she looked up at him with such a feeble glory and such a dash of humouryouve got them at last and now you dont care a bit about them but oh please do for my sake every time her fading eyes followed them to the door so that the loving husband cold with the shadow of the coming void had to whisper bring them back put them here between us although he knew that she was dying he could not feel it yet the mind admitted that fearful truth but the heart repulsed it further as she sunk and further yet from his pleading gaze the closer to her side he crept the more he clasped her shadowy hands and raised her drooping neck the fonder grew the entreating words the whispers of the lovetime faint smiles that hoped to win her smile although they moved in tears and smile she did once more on earth through the ashy huethe shadow of the souls wings flutteringwhen two fresh lives bought by her death were shown for the farewell to her and if its wrong then shell make it right thought the conscientious biddy i can take my oath ont she knowed the differ from the very first though nobody else couldnt see it barring the caps they was put in now if only that gossoon will consent to her see them once more and it cant hurt the poor darlinand the blessing as comes from the deaths gaze mrs ogaghans doubts were ended by the entrance of the doctor a spare short man with a fiery face red hair and quick little eyes he was not more than thirty years old but knew his duties thoroughly nevertheless he would not have been there but for the sudden emergency he was now come to fetch the nurse having observed that the poor mothers eyes were gleaming feebly once and again towards the door that led to the nursery and at last she had tried to raise her hand and point in that direction so in came biddy sobbing hard with a babe on either arm and she curtseyed cleverly to sir cradock without disturbing the equipoise but the mothers glance was not judicial as poor biddy had expectedher heart and soul were far beyond rosettes and even titles in one long yearning look she lingered on her newborn babes then turned those hazy eyes in fondness to her kneeling husbands then tried to pray or bless the three and shivered twice and died for days and weeks sir cradock nowell bore his life but did not live all his clear intellect and strong will noble plans and useful labours all his sense of truth and greatness lay benumbed and frozen in the cold track of death he could not bear to see his children he would not even hear of them they had robbed him of his loved one and what good were they little red things perhaps he would love them when they grew like their mother those were not his expressions for he was proud and shy but that was the form his thoughts would take if they could take any no wonder that he for a time was lost beyond the verge of reason because that blow which most of all stuns and defeats the upright man had descended on himthe blow to the sense of justice this a man of large mind feels often from his fellowmen never from his maker but sir cradock was a man of intellect rather than of mind to me a large mind seems to be strong intellect quickened with warm heart sir cradock nowell had plenty of intellect and plenty of heart as well but he kept the two asunder so much the better for getting on in the world so much the worse for dealing with god a man so constituted rarely wins till overborne by trouble that only knowledge which falls like genius where our father listeth so the bereaved man measured justice by the ells and inches of this world and it did seem very hard that he who had lived for twenty years from light youth up to the balance age of forty not only without harming any fellowmortal but upon fair average to do good in the worldit seemed i sayit was thought hemost unjust that such a man could not set his serious heart upon one little treasure without losing it the moment he had learned its value now with pride to spur sad memorybronze spurs to a marble horsehe remembered how his lovely violet chose him from all others gallant suitors crowded round her for she was rich as well as beautiful but she quietly came from out them all for him a man of twice her age and he who had cared for none till then and had begun to look on woman as a stubbybearded man looks back at the romance of his first lather he first admired her grace and beauty then her warmth of heart and wit then scorning all analysis her own sweet self and loved her a few days after the funeral he was walking sadly up and down in his lonely library caring no whit for his onceloved books for the news of the day or his business and listless to look at anything even the autumn sunset when the door was opened quietly and shyly through the shadows stole his schoolfellow of yore his truest friend john rosedew with this gentleman i take a very serious liberty but he never yet was known to resent a liberty taken honestly that however does not justify me john rosedew i intend to call him because he likes it best and so he would though ten times a bachelor of divinity a late viceprincipal of his college and the present rector of nowelhurst formerly i did my best loving well the character to describe that simpleminded tenderhearted yeoman john huxtable of tossils barton in the county of devon like his as like any two of natures evervaried works were the native grain and staple of the rev john rosedew beside those little inborn and indying variations which nature still insists on that she may know her sons apart those two genial britons differed both in mental and bodily endowments and through education in spite of that they were and are as like to one another as any two men can be who have no smallness in them small men run pretty much of a muchness as the calibre increases so the divergence multiplies farmer huxtable was no fool but having once learned to sign his name he had attained his maximum of literary development john rosedew on the other hand although a strong and wellbuilt man who had pulled a good oar in his day was not in bulk and stature a match for hercules or milo unpretending gentle a lover of the truth easily content with others but never with himself even now at the age of forty he had not overcome the bashfulness and diffidence of a fine and sensitive nature and firstrate scholar as he was he would have lost his class at oxford solely through that shyness unless a kind examiner who saw his blushing agony had turned from some commonplace of sophocles to a glorious passage of pindar then carried away by the noble poet john rosedew forgot the schools the audience even the row of examiners and gave grand thoughts their grand expression breathing free as the winds of heaven nor till his voice began to falter from the high emotion and his heart beat fast though not from shame and the tears of genius touched by genius were difficult to check not till then knew he or guessed that every eye was fixed upon him that every heart was thrilling that even the stiff examiners bent forward like eager children and the young men in the gallery could scarcely keep from cheering then suddenly in the full sweep of magnificence he stopped like an eagle shot now the parson ruddy cheeked with a lock of light brown hair astray upon his forehead and his pale blue eyes looking much as if he had just awoke and rubbed them came shyly and with deep embarrassment into the darkening room for days and days he had thought and thought but could not at all determine whether and when and how he ought to visit his ancient friend his own heart first suggested that he ought to go at once if only to show the bereaved one that still there were some to love him to this right impulseand the impulse of a heart like this could seldom be a wrong onerose counterchecks of worldly knowledge such little as he had and it seemed to many people strange and unaccountable that if mr rosedew piqued himself upon anything whatever it was not on his learning his purity or benevolence it was not on his gentle bearing or the chivalry of his soul but on a fine acquirement whereof in all opinions except indeed his own he possessed no jot or tittlea strictlydisciplined and astute experience of the world now this supposed experience told him that it might seem coarse and forward to offer the hard grasp of friendship ere the soft clasp of love was cold that he as the clergyman of the parish would appear to presume upon his office that no proud man could ever bear to have his anguish pryed into these and many other misgivings and objections met his eager longings to help his dear old friend suddenly and to his great relieffor he knew not how to begin though he felt how and mistrusted itthe old friend turned upon him from his lonely pacing and held out both his hands not a word was said by either what they meant required no telling or was told by silence long time they sat in the western window john rosedew keeping his eyes from sunset which did not suit them then at last he said in a low voice which it cost him much to find what name dear cradock for the younger babe your own of course for the elder no name john but his sweet mothers unless you like to add his uncles john rosedew was puzzled lamentably he could not bear to worry his friend any more upon the subject and yet it seemed to him sad false concord to christen a boy as violet but he argued that in botanical fact a violet is male as well as female and at such a time he could not think of thwarting a widowers yearnings in spite of all his worldly knowledge it never occurred to his simple mind that poor sir cradock meant the ladys maiden surname which i believe was incledon and yet he had suggestive precedent brought even then before him for sir cradock nowells brother bore the name of clayton which name john rosedew added now and found relief in doing so thus it came to pass that the babe without rosette was baptized as violet clayton while the owner of the bauble received the name of cradockcradock nowell now the ninth in lineal succession the father was still too broken down to care about being present godfathers and godmothers made all their vows by proxy mrs ogaghan held the infants and one of them cried and the other laughed the rosette was there in all its glory and received a tidy sprinkle and the wearer of it was as usual the one who took things easily as the common children said who came to see the great ones loustering the whole affair was rather like a white burying than a baptism nevertheless the tenants and labourers moistened their semiregenerate clay with many a fontful of good ale to ensure the success of the ceremony chapter iv it is not pleasant to recur to have a relapse of chronology neither does it show good management on the part of a writer nevertheless being free of time among these forest byways i mean to let the pig now by the ear unfold his tail or curl it up as the weather suits him and now he runs back for a month or two trailing the rope from his left hindleg poor lady nowell had become a mother as indeed we learned from the village gossip nearly a fortnight before the expected time dr jellicorse buller a very skilful man in whom the hall had long confided was suddenly called to london the day before that on which we last climbed the hill towards ringwood with sir cradocks full consent he obeyed the tempting summons so in the hurry and flutter of that october sunday it seemed a most lucky thing to obtain in a thinlypeopled district the prompt attendance of any medical man and but that a gallant regiment then happened to be on the march from dorchester to southampton there to embark for india no masculine aid would have been forthcoming till after the event but the regimental surgeon whose name was rufus hutton did all that human skill could do and saved the lives of both the infants but could not save the young mother having earned sir cradocks lasting gratitude and biddy ogaghans strong execrations he was compelled to rejoin his regiment then actually embarking the twins grew fast and throve amain under mrs ogaghans motherly care and shook the deeprooted country faith that children brought up by hand are sure to be puny weaklings nor was it long till nature reasserted her authority and claimed her rights of compensation the father began to think more and more first of his duty towards the dead mother and then of his duty towards his children and ere long affection set to work and drove duty away till called for which happened as we shall see presently by the time those two pretty babies were busy about their teeth cradock nowell the elder was so deep in odontology that biddy herself could not answer him and was afraid to ask any questions he watched each little white cropper as a girl peers day by day into a starting hyacinth then when they could walk they followed daddy everywhere and he never was happy without them it was a pretty thing to see them toddling down the long passages stopping by the walls to prattle crawling at the slippery parts where the newlyinvented tiles shone and the father would dance away backwards from them forgetting all about the grand servants clapping his hands to encourage them and holding an orange as prize for a crawlingracethen whisk away round a corner and lay his cheek flat to the wainscot to peep at his sons and learn which of them was the braver and in those days i think he was proud to find that cradock nowell the heir of the house was by far the more gallant baby which of the two was the prettier not even sharp biddy could say so strongly alike they were that the palm of beauty belonged to the one who had taken least medicine lately then as they turned two years and a half and could jump with both feet at once without the spectator growing sad on the subject of biped deficiencies their father would lie down on the carpet and make them roll and jump over him he would watch their little spotted legs with intense appreciation and if he got an oral sprinkle from childhoods wild sense of humour instead of depressing him i declare it quite set him up for the day sir and he never bothered himself or them by attempts to forecast their destinies there they were enjoying themselves uproariously happy as proud as punch of their exploits and the father a great deal prouder all three as blest for the moment as full of life and rapture as god meant his creatures to be so often as they are wise enough and in the name of god let them be so but then there came a time of spoiling a time of doing just what they liked even after their eyes were opening to the light and shadow of right and wrong if they smiled or pouted or even criedthough in that they were very moderatein a fashion which descended to them from their darling mother thereupon great right and law and even toughest prejudice fell flat as rolled dough before them so they toddled about most gloriously with a strong sense of owning the universe next ensued a time of mighty retribution astra with her feelings hurt came down for a slashing moment fond as he was and far more weak than he ever had been before sir cradock nowell was not a fool he saw it was time to check the license ere mischief grew irretrievable something flagrant occurred one day both the children were in for it they knew as well as possible that they were jolly rogues together and together in their childish counsel they resolved to stand it out the rumour was that they had stolen into mrs toasters choicest cupboard and hardly left enough to smell at in a twopound pot of greengage jam anyhow there they stood scarlet in face and bright of eye back to back with their broad white shoulders their sturdy legs set wide apart and their little heels stamping defiantly mrs toaster had not the heart to do anything but kiss them with a number of o fies and they accepted her kisses indignantly and wiped their lips with their pinafores they knew that they were in the wrong but they had not tried to conceal it and they meant to brazen it out they looked such a fine pair of lords of the earth and vindicated their felony with so grand an air such high contempt of all justice that cookey and hogstaff empannelled as jury said drat the little darlings let em have the other pot mem but as their good star would have it mrs ogaghan came after them upsetting the mere nisi prius verdict she marched them off one in either hand to the great judge sitting in banco sir cradock himself in the library with the sense of heavy wrong upon them the little hearts began to fail as they climbed with tugs instead of jumps and no arithmetic of the steps the narrow flight of stone stairs that led from regions culinary but they would not shed a tear not they nor even say they were sorry otherwise biddy who herself was crying would have let them go with the tap of a battledore poor little souls they got their deserts with very scanty ceremony when biddy began to relate their crime one glance at their fathers face was enough they hung behind and dropped their eyes and flushed all under their curling hair yet little did they guess the indignity impending hogstaff had followed all the way and so had mrs toaster to plead for them sir cradock sent them both away and told biddy to wait outside then he led his children to an inner room and calmly explained his intentions these were of such a nature that the young offenders gazed at each other in dumb amazement and horror which very soon grew eloquent as the sentence was being executed but the brave little fellows cried more even then at the indignity than the pain of it then the stern father ordered them out of his sight for the day and forbade every one to speak to them until the following morning and away the twins went hand in hand down the cold cruel passage their long flaxen hair all flowing together and shaking to the sound of their contrite sobs and heartpangs at the corner by the stewards room they turned with one accord and looked back wistfully at their father sir cradock had been saying to himself as he rubbed his hands after the exercisea capital days work what a deal of good it will do them the selfwilled little rascals but the look cast back upon him was so like their mothers when he had done anything to vex her that away he rushed to his bedroom and had to wash his face afterwards but of course he held to his stern resolve to see them no more that evening otherwise the lesson would be utterly thrown away holding to it as he did the effect surpassed all calculation it was the turningpoint in their lives my boy you know it hurts me a great deal more than you says the hypocritical usher who rather enjoys the caneswing the boy knows it is hypocrisy and is morally hurt more than physically but wholly different is the result when the patient knows and feels the deep love of the agent and cannot help believing that justice has flogged the judge and hitherto their flesh had been intemerate and inviolable the strictest orders had been issued that none should dare to slap them and all were only too prone to coax and pet the beautiful angels little angels treated so they would soon have been little devils as for the warning given last week they thought it a bit of facetiousness so now was the time of all times to strike temperately but heavily that night they went to bed before dark without having cared for tea or toast and biddys soft heart ached by the pillow as they lay in each others arms hugged one another having now none else in the world to love and sobbed their little troubles off into moaning slumber on the following morning without any concert or debate and scarcely asking why the little things went hand in hand united more than ever by the recent visitation as far as the door of their fathers bedroom there they slank behind a curtain and when he came out the rings above fluttered with fear and love and hope much as the fathers heart was craving he made believe to walk onward till craddy ran out neck or nothing and sprang into his arms after this great event their lives flowed on very happily into boyhood youth and manhood they heartily loved and respected their father they could never be enough with john rosedew and although they quarrelled and fought sometimes they languished and drooped immediately when parted from one another as for biddy ogaghan now a high woman in the household her only difficulty was that she never could tell of her two boys which to quote as the more astounding if you plase maam she always concluded therell not be so much as the lean of a priest for anybody iver to choose atwane the bootiful two on them no more than there was on the day when my blissed selfmurder nowany more i manes nor the differ a peg can find twane a murphy and a purratie and a murphy i must be to tark so free as i does of the things as is above me says patrick ogeoghegan to meself one dayglory be to his sowl and a gintleman every bit of him lave out where he had the smallpuxbiddy he says hould your pratietrap or ill shove these here bellises down it and for my good it would have been as i am thankful to acknowledge that same though i didnt see it that day thank the lord ah musha musha a true gintleman he were and lave me out his fellow maam if iver you comes acrass him but in spite of biddys assertion there were many points of difference outward and inward too between cradock and clayton nowell by this time the violet was obsolete except with sir cradock who rather liked it and with young crad who had corrupted it into the endearing viley john rosedew had done his utmost to extinguish the misnomer being sensitive on the subject from his horror of false concord as attributed to himself although the twins were so much alike in stature form and feature that it required care to discern them after the sun was down no clearsighted person would miscall them when they both were present and the light was good clayton nowells eyes were brown cradocks a dark grey cradocks hair was one shade darker and grew more away from his forehead and the expression of his gaze came from a longer distance clayton always seemed up for bantering cradock anxious to inquire and to joke about it afterwards if occasion offered then cradocks head inclined as he walked a little towards the left shoulder claytons hung almost imperceptibly somewhat to the right and cradocks hands were hard and dry claytons soft as good french kid and as regards the inward man they differed far more widely every year their modes of thought fancies tastes and habits were diverging more decidedly clayton sought command and power and to be admired cradocks chief ambition was to be loved by every one and so with intellectual matters clayton showed more dash and brilliance cradock more true sympathy and thence more grasp and insight clayton loved the thoughts which strike us cradock those which move us subtly but as they lived not long together it is waste of time to finesse between them whatever they were they loved one another and could not bear to be parted meanwhile their uncle john as they always called mr rosedewtheir uncle only in the spiritwas nursing and making much of a little daughter of his own long before lady nowells death indeed for ten long years before he obtained the living of nowelhurst with the little adjunct of rushford he had been engaged to a ladylove much younger than himself whose name was amy venn not positively engaged i mean for he was too shy to pop the question to any one but himself for more than seven years of the ten but all that time amy venn was loving him and he was loving her and each would have felt it a grievous blow if the other had started sideways miss venn was poor and had none except her widowed mother to look to and hence the parson was trebly shy of pressing a poor mans suit he a very truthful mortal had pure faith in his amy and she had the like in him so for several years he shunned the commonroom and laid by all he could from his fellowship collegeappointments and professorship but when his old friend sir cradock nowell presented him to the beneficenot a very gorgeous one but enough for a quiet parsons familyhe took a clean white tie at once vainly strove to knot it grandly actually got his scout to brush him and after three glasses of commonroom port strode away to his amy at kidlington there he found her training the apricot on the south wall of her mothers cottage one of the three great apricottrees that paid the rent so nicely what a pity they were not peaches they would have yielded so fit a simile but peachbloom will not thrive at kidlington except upon ladies faces three months afterwards just when all was arranged and mrs venn was at last persuaded that hampshire is not all pigs and rheumatism forests and swamps and charcoal when john with his voice rather shaky and a patch of red where his whiskers should have been had proclaimed his own banns three timesfor he was a very odd fellow in some things and scorned the royal road to wedlockjust at that time i say poor lady nowells confinement upset all calculation and her melancholy death flung a pall on weddingfavours not only through respect but from real sympathy with the faithful friend john rosedew and amy held counsel together and deferred the longpending bridal said john who always thought in greek except when latin hindered him but few young ladies will admitand nowadays they all understand itthat the apophthegm is applied well however it did come off at last john rosedew when his banns had been rolling in his mind in the form of greek senarii for six months after the first time of outasking set to and read them all over again in public to revive their efficacy and to surrebut all let and hindrance he was accustomed now to so many stops that he felt surprised when nobody rose to interpellate and so the banns of john rosedew bachelor and amy venn spinster c were read six times in nowelhurst church and six times from the desk at kidlington and sooth to say it was not without significance tant molis erat to produce our beautiful amy on the nuptial morning sir cradock whom they scarcely expected gathered up his broken courage sank his own hap in anothers and was present and tried to enjoy himself how shy john rosedew was how sly to conceal his blushes how spry when the bride glanced towards him and nobody else looked that wayall this very few could help observing but they liked him too well to talk of it enough that the friend of his youth thoroughly understanding john was blessed with so keen a perception of those simple little devices that at last he did enjoy himself which he deserved to do for trying when the twins were nearly three years old mrs rosedew presented john with the very thing he wished for most an elegant little girl and here the word elegant is used with forethought and by prolepsis though mrs ogaghan lent for a time to the rectory employed that epithet at the first glance even while announcing the gender muckstraw then and shes illigant intirely an its hopin i be as therell only be two on her one for each of me darlin boys and now cudnt you manage it doctor dear but alas the supply was limited and no duplicate ever issued lucina saw john rosedews pride and was afraid of changing his character to all his oxford friends he announced the fact of his paternity in letters commencingnow what do you think my dear fellow what do you think of thisthe most astounding thing has happened c c he thought of it himself so much that his intellect grew dreamy and he forgot all about next sundays sermon until he was in the pulpit and four weeks after that he made another great mistake which horrified him desperately though it gratified the parish it had been arranged between his amy and himself that if she felt quite strong enough she should appear in church on the sunday afternoon to offer the due thanksgiving in the grey old church at nowelhurst a certain pew had been set apart by custom immemorial for the use of goodwives who felt grateful for their safe deliverance here mrs rosedew was to present herself at the proper period with the aid of biddys vigorous arm down the hill from the rectory as yet she was too delicate to bear the entire service the august afternoon was sultry and the church doors stood wide open while the bees among the churchyard thyme drowsed a sleepy sermon as luck would have it a recruiting sergeant toling for the sons of ytene finding the road so dusty and the alehouse barred against him came sauntering into the church during the second lesson for a little mild change of air espying around him some likely rustics he stationed himself in the vacant churching pew because the door was open and the position prominent all right thought the rector who was very shortsighted how good of my darling amy to come but i wonder she wears her scarlet cloak to come to church with and in such weather but perhaps dr buller ordered it for fear of her catching cold so at the proper moment he drew his surplice round him looked full at the sergeant standing there by the pillar and commenced majestically though with a trembling voice forasmuch as it hath pleased almighty god of his goodness to give you safe deliverance and hath preserved you in the great danger of childbirth you shall therefore give hearty thanks unto god and say the sergeant looked on very primly with his padded arms tightly folded and his head thrown back calling war and victory into his gaze for the credit of the british army then he wondered angrily what thethose chawbacons could see in him to be grinning at i am well pleased c continued john rosedew sonorously for he had a magnificent voice and still regarding the sergeant with a look of tender interest even sir cradock nowell could scarcely keep his countenance but the parson went through the whole of it handsomely and to the purpose thinking only throughout it of gods great mercies to him so beloved he was already and so much respected that none of the congregation had the heart to tell him of his mistake as he talked with them in the churchyard though he thought even then that he must have his bands as he often had at the back of his neck but on his way home he overtook an old hobbler who enjoyed a joke more than a scruple how are you simon tapscott how do you do today glad to see you at church simon said the parson holding his hand out as he always did to his parishioners unless they had disgraced themselves purty vair measter purty vair i be vor a woald galley baggar as ave bin in the low countries and dwoant know sin from righteousness this last was a gross perversion of a passage in the sermon which had ruffled ancient simon cant goo much howiver by rason of the rhymatics now cud e do it to i measter cud e do it to i and ill thraw down bath my critches good vor one sojer good vor anoother do what for you simon fill your old canteen or send you a pound of

simon do you know what you are saying but i cannot bear to tell of john rosedew humiliated he was humble enough by nature so fearful was the parson of renewing that recollection within the sacred walls that no thanks were offered there for the birth of sweet amy rosedew save by or on behalf of that recruiting sergeant chapter v when cradock and clayton were ten years old they witnessed a scene which puzzled them and dwelt long in their boyish memories job hogstaff was going to ringwood and they followed him down the passage towards the entrancehall emphatically repeating the commissions with which they had charged him old job loved them as if they were his grandsons and would do his utmost to please them but they could not trust his memory or even his capacity now job cried little cradock pulling at his coatlappet its no good pretending that you know all when you wont even stop to listen im sure youll go and make some great mistake as you did last tuesday mind you tell mr stride its for master cradock nowell and they must be sure to give you a good one or i shall send it back now just tell me what i have told you i ought to have written it down but i wasnt sure how to spell groove why master crad im to say a long spill very sharp at the end sharp at the point job not blunt at the end like a new blacklead pencil and whatever you do job dont forget the catgut for my crossbow one size larger than last time hold your jaw viley till ive quite finished or hell ask for a top made of catgut both the boys laughed at this you could hear them all down the long passage any small folly makes a boy laugh well master crad you must think me a muff as you call it and the groove is to go quite up to the spill there must be two rings below the crown of it below the crown indeed on the fat part i said three times now viley you know you heard me well well cried job in despair two rings on the fat part and no knot at all in the wood and at least six inches round and and welli think thats all of it thank the lord all of it indeed well you are a nice fellow didnt i tell you so viley why youve left out altogether the most important point of all job the wood must be a clear bright yellow or else a very rich gold colour and im to pay for it next tuesday because i spent my weeks money yesterday as soon as ever i got it andoh viley cant you lend a fellow sixpence no not to save my life sir why craddy you know i wouldnt let you go tick if i could the boys rushed at one another half in fun and half in affection and seizing each other by the belt of the lightplaid tunic away they went dancing down the hall while hogstaff whistled a polka gently with his old eyes glistening after them a prettier pair or better matched never set young locks afloating each put his healthy clear bright face on the shoulder of the other each flung out his shortsocked legs and pointed his dainty feet you could see their shapely calves jerked up as they went with double action and the hollow of the back curved in as they threw asunder recklessly then clasped one another again and you thought they must both reel over sir cradock nowell hated trousers and would not have their hair cropped because it was like their mothers otherwise they would not have looked one quarter so picturesque before the match was fairly finishedfor they were used to this sort of thing and the object always was to see which would give in firstit was cut short most unexpectedly while they were taking a sharp pirouette down at the end of the halland as they whirled round i defy their father to have known the one from the otherthe door of the stewards room opened suddenly and a tall dark woman came out the twins in full merriment dashed up against her and must have fallen if she had not collared them with strong and bony arms like little gentlemen as they were every atom of them they turned in a moment to apologise and their cheeks were burning red they saw a gaunt old woman wideshouldered stern and forcible oo ah a bonnie pair yeve gat as i see in all my life lang but yell get no luck o them tak the word o threescore year yell never get no luck o them you that calls yoursel craydock nowell she was speaking to sir cradock who had followed her from the stewards room and who seemed as much put out as a proud man of fifty ever cares to show himself he made no answer and the two poor children fell back against a sidebench ill no talk o matters noo youve a gien me my refoosal and i tak it once for all but yell be sorry for the day ye did it craydock nowell to the great amazement of hogstaff who was more taken aback than any one else sir cradock nowell without a word walked to the wide front door with ceremony as if he were leading a peeress out he did not offer his arm to the woman but neither did he shrink from her she gathered her dark face up again from its softening glance at the children and without another word or look but sweeping her skirt around her away she walked down the broad front road as stiff and as stern as the oaktrees chapter vi the lapse of years made little difference with the reverend john rosedew except to mellow and enfranchise the heart so free and rich by nature and to pile fresh stores of knowledge in the mind so stored already of course the parson had his faults in many a little matter his friends could come down upon him sharply if minded so to do but any one so minded would not have been fit to be called john rosedews friend his greatest fault was one which sprang from his own high chivalry if once he detected a person whether taught or untaught in the attempt to deceive or truckle that person was to him thenceforth a thing to be pitied and prayed for large and liberal as his heart was charitable and even lenient to all other frailties the presence of a lie in the air was to it as ozone to a testpaper and then he was always sorry afterwards when he had shown his high disdain for who could disprove that john rosedew himself might have been a thorough liar if trained and taught to consider truth a policeman with his staff drawn another fault john rosedew hadand i do not tell his foibles as our friends do to enjoy themhe gave to his books and their bygone ages much of the time which he ought to have spent abroad in his own little parish but this could not be attributed to any form of selfindulgence much as he liked his books he liked his flock still better but never could overcome the idea that they would rather not be bothered if any one were ailing if any one were needy he would throw aside his theophrastus and be where he was wanted with a mild sweet voice and gentle eyes that crannied not like a cranes bill into the family crocks and dustbin it was a part and no unpleasant one of his natural diffidence that he required a poor mans invitation quite as much as a rich ones ere ever he crossed the threshold unless trouble overflowed the impluvium in all the parish of nowelhurst there was scarcely a man or a woman who did not rejoice to see the rector pacing his leisurely rounds carrying his elbows a little out as men with large deltoid muscles do wearing his old hat far back on his head so that it seemed to slope away from him and smiling quietly to himself at the children who tugged his coattails for an orange or a halfpenny he never could come out but what the urchins of the village were down upon him as promptly as if he were applepie and many of them had the impudence to call him uncle john before his hair was grey instead of going to school the boys were apprenticed to him in the classics and still more pleasantly he taught them to swim and fish and row of riding he knew but little except from the treatise of xenophon and a paper on the pelethronian lapiths so they learned it as all other boys do by dint of crown and hard bumpage moreover mark stote head gamekeeper took them in hand very early as his pupils in woodcraft and gunnery to tell the truth uncle john objected to this accomplishment he thought that the wholesome excitement and exercise of shooting afforded scarcely a valid reason for the destruction of innocent life however he recollected that he had not always thought sohis conversion having been wrought by the shrieks of a wounded hareneither did he expect to bind all the world with his own girdle sir cradock insisted that the young idea should be taught to shoot and both the young ideas took to it very kindly perhaps on the whole they were none the worse for the want of publicschool training what they lost thereby in quickness suspicion and effrontery was more than balanced by the gain in purity simplicity love of home and kindliness for nature had not gifted them with that vulgar arrogance for which the best prescription is calcitration nine times a day and clean the boots for kicking you every year their father took them for a month or two to london to garnish with some courtly frilling the knuckles of his hampshire hams but they only hated it thorough agricoles they were and well knew their own blessings and sweet and gladsome was the morning after each return though it might be blowing a gale of wind or drizzling through the ashleaves and then the headlong rush to see beloved uncle john nature they loved in any form sylvan agrarian human when that human form was such as they could climb and nestle in and there was not in the parish nor in all the forest any child so rough and dirty so shockheaded and such a scamp that it could not climb into the arms of john rosedews fellowfeeling but i must not dwell on these pleasant days the fathers glory the hopes of the sons the love of all who came near them and the blessings of mrs ogaghan they were now to go to oxford and astonish the natives there by showing that a little hic hc hoc may come even out of galilee that a youth never drawn through the wiregauge of eton harrow or rugby may carry still the electric spark and be taper and wellrounded half their learning accrued sub dio in the manner of the ancients uncle john would lead them between the trees and down to some forest dingle the boy on his right hand construing aloud or parsing very slowly the little spark at his left all glowing to explode at the first mistake made the running until he tripped and fell mentally and even then he was set on his legs unless the other was down upon him but in the latter case the yokemate leaped into the harness the strokeoar on the river that evening was awarded to the one who paced the greatest number of stades in the active voice of expounding the accuracy the caution born of this warm rivalry became at last so vigilant that the boy who won the toss for the righthand place at starting was almost sure of the strokeoar so they passed the matriculation test with consummate ease and delighted the college tutor by their clear bold writing they had not read so much as some men have before entering the university but all their knowledge was close and firm and staunch enough for a springboard and they wrote most excellent latin prose and greek verse easily flowing however sir cradock was very nervous on the eve of their departure for the first term of oxford residence and led john rosedew in whose classical powers he placed the highest confidence into his private room and there begged him as a real friend tested now for forty years to tell him bluntly whether the boys were likely to do him credit dont spare me john and dont spare them only let us have no disappointment about it my dear fellow my dear fellow cried john tugging at his collar as he always did when nonplussed for fear of losing himself how on earth can i tell most likely the men know a great deal more in the university now than they did when i had lectures havent i begged you fifty times to have down a young firstclassman yes i know you have john but i am not quite such a fool nor so shamelessly ungrateful to upset the pile of your ten years labour and rebuild it upon its apex and talk to me of young firstclassmen why you know as well as i do john that there is not one of them however brilliant with a tenth part of your knowledge it could never be any more than a young tree can carry the fruit of an old one why when you took your own firstclass they could only find one man to put with you and you have never ceased to read read read ever since you left old oriel and chiefly in taste and philology and such a memory as you have john i am ashamed of you you want to impose upon me and sir cradock fixed the parsons eyes with that keen and pointblank gaze which was especially odious to the shy john rosedew i am sure i dont you cannot mean that he replied rather warmly for like all imaginative men when of a diffident cast he was desperately matteroffact the moment his honour was played with his friend began to smile at him drawing up his grey moustache and saying yes john you are a donkey i know that i am said john rosedew shutting his eyes as he loved to do when he got on a favourite topic by the side of those mighty critics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesthe scaligers the casaubons the vossii the stephaniwhat am i but a starving donkey without a thistle left for him but as regards our english criticsat least too many of themi submit that we have been misled by the superiority of their latin and their more slashing style i doubt whether any of them had a tenth part of the learning or the sequacity of genius come john i cant stand this you know and the boys will be down here directly they are so fond of brown sherry well to return to the subjecti own that i was surprised and hurt when a former professor of greek actually confounded the olic form of the plusquam perfectum of so common a verb as yes john i know all about that and how it spoiled your breakfast but about the boys the boys john and again as to the delicate subsignificance not the wellknown tortuousness of in composition but confound it john theyve got all their things packed theyll be here in a moment pretending to rollick for our sakes and you wont tell me what you think of them well i think there never were two finer fellows to jump a gate since the days of castor and pollux hunc equis illum superare pugnis you remember how you took me down for construing pugnis wrongly when we were at sherborne yes and how proud i was john you had been at the head of the form for three months and none of us could stir you but you came back again next day in the fifth neid but here come the villainsnow its all over and so the boys went away and their father could not for his life ascertain what opinion his ancient friend had formed as to the chances of their doing something good at oxford simple and straightforward as mr rosedew was no man ever lived from whom it was harder to force an opinion he saw matters from so many aspects everything took so many facets shifting lights and playing colours from the versatility of his mind that whoso could fix him at such times and extort his real sentiments might spin a diamond ring and shave by it he had golden hopes about his nephews as he often called them but he would not pronounce those hopes at present lest the father should be disappointed and so the boys went up to oxford half a moon before the woodcocks came chapter vii i do not mean to write at large upon university life because the theme has been outthesed by men of higher powers it is a brief olympic a derby premature wherein to lose or win dependstraining health ability and industry being grantedupon the early stoning or late kernelling of the brain without laying claim to much experience any one may protest that our brains are worked a deal too hard at the time of adolescence we lose thereby their vivific powers and their originality the peach throws off at the critical period all the fruit it cannot ripen the vine has no such abjective prudence and cripples itself by enthusiasm the twins were entered at merton and had the luck to obtain adjoining garrets sir cradock had begun to show a decided preference for clayton as he grew year by year more and more like his mother but this was not the only reason why he would not listen to some fools suggestion that cradock the heir to the property should be ranked as a gentlemancommoner that stupid distinction he left for men who require selfassertion admiring as he did the sense and spirit of that master well known in his day who to some golden cad insisting that his son should be entered in that college as a gentlemancommoner angrily replied sir all my commoners are gentlemen but the brothers were very soon parted clayton got sleeved in a scholars gown while cradock still fluttered the leadingstrings et tunic manicasyou effeminate viley said cradock admiring hugely when his twin ran up to show himself off after winning a corpus scholarship and the governor wont allow me a chance of a parasol for my elbows sir cradock a most determined man and a very odd one to deal with had forbidden his elder son to stand for any scholarship except those few which are of the university corporate a youth of your expectations he exclaimed with a certain bitterness for he often repined in secret that clayton was not the heir a boy placed as you are must not compete for a poor young lads viaticum you may go in for a university scholarship though of course you will never get one an examination does good i have heard to the unsuccessful candidates but dont let me hear about it not even if by some accident you should be the lucky one craddy was deeply hurt he had long perceived his fathers partiality for the son more dashing yet more effeminate more pretentious and less persistent so cradock set his heart upon winning craven hertford or ireland and never even alluding to it in the presence of his father hence it will be evident that the youth was proud and sensitive amy amata peramata a me cried the parson to his daughter now a lovely girl of sixteen straight slender and wellpoised how glad and proud we ought to be of claytons great success pa dear he would never have got it i am quite certain of that if cradock had been allowed to go in and i think it is most unfair shamefully unjust that because he is the eldest son he is never to have any honour and amy coloured brilliantly at the warmth of her own championship but her father could not see it so i am inclined to thinkjohn rosedew was never positive except upon great occasionsperhaps i should say perpend if i were fond of hybrid english i dont mean about the unfairness amy for i think i should do the same if i were in sir cradocks place i mean that our crad would have got it instead of clayton with health and fortune favouring but it stands upon a razors edge you can construe that amy yes pa when you tell me the english how the green is coming out on the firtrees so faint and yet so bright oh papa what greek subsignificance as you sometimes call it is equal to that composition well my poppet i am so shortsighted i would much rather have a triply composite verb than three good kisses from me daddy well there they are at any rate because i know you are disappointed and the child herself more bitterly disappointed as becomes a hot partisan ran away to sit under a sprawling larch just getting new nails on its fingers for the spring was awaking early it was not more than a week after this and not very far from allfoolsday when clayton directly after chapel rushed into cradocks garret hot breathless and unphilosophical cradock calm and thoughtful as he usually was poked his head through the open slide of the dusthole called a scouts room and brought out three willowpattern plates a little too retentive of the human impress and an extra knife and fork darkbrowed at the tip of the handle then he turned up a corner of tablecloth where it cherished sombre memories of a tearful teapot and set the mustardpot to control it nor long before he doubled the coffee in the strainer of the biggin and shouted corker thrice far as human voice would gravitate down the well of the staircase meanwhile master clayton stood fidgeting and doffed not his scholarly toga corker the scout a short fat man came up the stairs with dignity and indignation contending he was amazed that any freshman should have the cheek to holler so mr nowell was such a quiet young man that the scout looked for some apology corker a commons of bread and butter and a cold fowl and some tongue be quick now before the buttery closes and as i see i am putting you out in your morning work get a quart of ale at your dinnertime yes sir to be sure sir i wish all the gentlemen was as thoughtful no craddy never mind that cried his brother reddening richly for clayton was fair as a lady i only want to speak to you aboutwell perhaps you know what it is i have come for is that fellow gone from the door i am sure i dont know go and look yourself but dear viley what is the matter oh cradock you can so oblige me and it cant matter much to you but to me with nothing to look to it does make such a difference cradock never could bear to hear thisthat his own twinbrother should talk as he often did so much in the pauper strain and all the while clayton was sure of l under their mothers settlement but crad was full of wild generosity and had made up his mind to share nowelhurst if he could do so with his brother he began to pull claytons gown off he would have blacked his shoes if requested he always thought himself vileys prime minister whatever it is my boy viley you know i will do it for you if it is only fair and honourable oh it is no great thing i was sure you would do it for me to do just a little bit under your best in this hot scrimmage for the ireland i am not much afraid of any man crad except you and brown of balliol viley i am very sorry that you have asked me such a thing even if it were in other ways straightforward i could not do it for the sake of the father and uncle john and little amy dont you know that the governor doesnt want you to get it you are talking nonsense cradock downright nonsense to cover your own selfishness and that frizzleheaded amy indeed i would rather talk nonsense than fraud clayton and i cant help telling you that what you say about my father may be true but is not brotherly and your proposal does you very little honour and i never could have thought it of you and i will do my very utmost and as for amy indeed she is too good for you to speak ofandand he was highly wroth at the sneer about amys hair which he admired beyond all reason as indeed he did every bit of her but without letting any one know it he leaned upon the table with his thumb well into the mustardpot this was the first real quarrel with the brother he loved so much and it felt like a skewer poked into his heart well elder brother by about two seconds cried clayton twitching his plaits up well upon his coatcollar ill do all i can to beat you and i hope brown will have it not you theres the cash for my commons i know you cant afford it until you get a scholarship clayton flung halfacrown upon the table and went down the stairs with a heavy tramp knocking over a dish with the college arms on wherein corker was bringing the fowl and the tongue corker got all the benefit of the hospitable doings and made a tidy dinner out of it for cradock could eat no breakfast it was the first time bitter words had passed between the brothers since the little ferments of childhood which are nothing more than sweetword the moment they settle down and he doubted himself he doubted whether he had not been selfish about it it was the third day of the examination and when he appeared at ten oclock among the forty competitors he was vexed anew to see that clayton had removed to a table at the other end of the room so as not to be even near him the piece of greek prose which he wrote that morning dissatisfied him entirely and then again he rejoiced at the thought that viley need not be afraid of him he had never believed in his chance of success and went in for the scholarship to please others and learn the nature of the examination next year he might have a fairer prospect this yearas all the university knewbrown of balliol was sure of it nevertheless by the afternoon he was in good spirits again and found a mixed paper which suited him as if uncle john had set it one of the examiners had been some twenty years ago a pupil of john rosedew and this of course was a great advantage to any successor alumnus though neither of them knew the other it is pleasant to see how the old ideas germinate and assimilate as the olive and the baobab do after the fires of many summers clayton a placable youth even when he was quite in the wrong as in the present instance came to craddys rooms that evening begged him not to apologise for his expressions of the morning and compared notes with him upon the doings of the day bless you crad he cried after a glass of firstrate brown sherrynot the vile molassied stuff thick as the sack of falstaff but the genuine thing with the light and shade of brown olives in the sunset and not to be procured of course from any oxonian winedealeroh crad if we could only wallop that brown of balliol between us i should not care much which it was he has booked it for such a certainty and does look so cocky about it did you see the style he walked off before hall arm in arm with a master of arts and spouting his own iambics firstrate ones i dare say viley have a pipe old fellow after all it doesnt matter much folk who have never been in them think a deal the most of these things the winemerchant laughs at beeswing and so i suppose it is with all trades cradock was not by any means prone to the discourse sententious and the present lapse was due no doubt to the reaction ensuing upon his later scene with viley wherein each had promised heartily to hold fast by the brotherhood on the following saturday morning john rosedews face flushed pucecolour as he opened his letters at breakfasttime hurrah amy darling hurrah my child terque quaterque et novies evoe eat all the breakfast melimel i wont tell you till i come back oh wont you indeed cried amy with her back against the door and her arms in mock grimness folded i rather think you will papa unless you have made up your mind to choke me and you are half way towards it already john saw that peculiar swell of her throat which had frightened him so oftenher dear mother had died of bronchitis and he knew nothing of medical subjectsand so he allayed her excitement at once gave her over to miss eudoxia who was late in her bedroom as usual and then set off at his utmost speed to tell his old friend sir cradock and a fine turn of speed he still could show though the whiskers under his collegecap stuck on anyhow in the hurry were as white as the breast of a martin quivering under the eaves since he lost his wife he had never cared to walk fast subsiding into three miles an hour as thoughtful and placid men will do when they begin to thumb their waistcoats but now through the waking life of the chase where the brown fernstalks bent over the ammon horn of the lifting frond and the fescue grass was beading rough with dew already here and among the rabbitholes nimbly dodging the undermine ran as hard as a boy of twelve the man of threescore john rosedew without stopping to knock as usual he burst in upon sir cradock now sitting all alone at his simple oldfashioned breakfast classical and theological training are not locomotive as we all know to our cost and the rector stood gasping ever so long with both hands pressed to his side why john quick quick you frighten me is your house on fire old fellowold fellow such news shake handsever since the charta forest shake hands again oh i feel rather sick pray excuse me what is it john do be quick i must send for mrs ogaghan and the stomachpump biddy was now the licensed doctoress of the household and did little harm with her simples if she failed of doing good times there open it look university news crad and clayton wondering smiling placidly anxious sir cradock tore open the paper and found after turning a great many corners the university news then he read out with a trembling voice after glancing over it silently the ireland scholarship has been awarded to cradock nowell of merton college proxime accessit clayton nowell scholar of corpus christi unless we are misinformed these gentlemen are twinbrothers grintie grintie grunt oos be arl tew blunt naw oose hampshire hogs but to zhow the way in bogs so john rosedew quoted in the fulness of his glory from an old new forest rhyme johns delight transcended everything because he had never expected it he had taken his own degree ere ever the ireland was heard of but three pupils of his had won it while he was still in residence of that he had not thought much but now to win it by proxy in his extreme old age as he began to consider it and from all the crack public schoolmen and with his own pet alumni whom no one else had taught anythingsuch an ossa upon pelion such an olympus on ossano wonder that the snow of his whiskers shook and the dew trembled under his eyelids sir cradock on the other hand had never a word to say but turned his head like one who waits for a storm of dust to go by why cradock old friend what on earth is the matter you dont seem at all delighted yes i am of course john as delighted as i ought to be but i wish it had been viley he wants it so much more and he is so like his mother so is crad every bit as much an enlarged and grander portrait cant you see the difference between a large heart and a mere good one will no one ever appreciate my noble and simple craddy john rosedew spoke warmly and was sorry before the breath from his lips was cold not that he had no right to say it but because he felt that he had done far more harm than good chapter viii honours flash in the summer sun as green corn does in the morning then they gleam mature and mellow at the time of reaping they are bagged perhaps by a womans arm with a cut below the knees set on their butt for a man to sit under while eating his bread and cheese then they wither and are tossed into chaff by a contumelious steamengine with a leathern strap inflexible cradocks ireland has gone by and another has succeeded it and this has fallen as most things fall to the sap of perseverance steeltipped with hard selfconfidencethis ireland has fallen to the lot of brown balliolensis clayton would not go in for it his pride or rather vanity would not allow him to do so was he going to take cradocks leavings and be a year behind him when he was only two minutes younger however he went in for the hertford and what was a great deal more he got it for cradock would not stand and even if he had perhaps the result would have been the same viley had made up his mind to win it and worked very hard indeed and so won it very easily cradock could usually beat him in greek but not so often in latin and clayton wrote the prettiest most tripping coquettish neatankled hendecasyllables that ever whisked roguishly round a corner wondering where catullus was ah lighthearted poet sensitively sensuous yet withal deephearted with a vein of golden philosophy and a pensive tenderness nowadays we overlook thee horace is more fashionable more suited to a flippant age because he has no passion early on a sunripe evening in the month of june when the sun was shifting the shadows of the hills and doffed the jaded oxens yoke distributing the love time from his waning chariot a forest dell soft clear and calm was listening to its thrushes and more than at the throstles flute or flageolet of the blackbird oaks and chestnuts pricked their ears at the voice of a gliding maiden where the young fern was pluming itself arching lifting ruffling in filigree light perspective and depth of gothic tracery freaked by the nip of fairy fingers tremulous as a coral grove in a crystal undercurrent the shyer fronds still nestling home uncertain of the world as yet and coiled like catherinewheels of green where the cranesbill pushed like zedekiah and the succory reared its skyblue windmill open for business till pm where the violet now was rolled up in the seedpod like a stylite millipede and the great bindweed in its crenate horn piped and fluted spirally had forgotten the noonday flaunt here and over the nibbled sward where the crisp dew was not risen yet here came wandering the lightest foot that ever passed but shook not the mossbed of the glowworm under the rigorous oaks so corded seamed and wenned with humps of grey the stately sleek mousecoloured beech the dappled mossberidden ash and the birchtree peeling silverly beneath the murmuring congress of the sunproof leaves and again in the open breaks and alleys where light and shade went seesaw by and through and under all feeling for and with every one glanced and gleamed and glistened and listened the loveliest being where all was love the pet in the nest of nature of all the beauty in that sweet dell where the foot of man came scarcely once in a year of all the largesse of earth and heaven of all the grace which is natures gratitude to her heavenly father there was not one from the lilybell to the wild rose and the heathersprig fit for a man to put in his bosom and look at amy rosedew it is told of a certain good mans child whose lineage still is cherished that when she was asked by her father halfbantering half in earnest to tell him the reason why everybody loved her so she cast down her eyes with a puzzled air then opened them wide as a child does to the sunrise of some great truthfather perhaps it is because i love everybody so lucan has it in a neater form amorem quris amando and that was amy rosedews secret by herself undreamed oflovely because she could not help loving all our god has made and of all the fair things he has made and pronounced to be very good since sunshine first began to gleam to glow and to fade away what home has beauty found so bright so rich in varied elegance so playfully receptive of the light shed through creationthe light of the makers smileas a young maiden pure of heart natural true and trusting she came to the brink of a forest pool and looked at herself in the water not that she thought more than she could help of the outward thing called amy but that she wondered how her old favourites cradock and clayton nowell would esteem her face and style of dress now she was turned seventeen most likely they had seen ever so many girls both at oxford and in london compared with whom poor amy was but a rustic phidyle just fit to pick sticks in the new forest the crystal mirror gave her back even the shade on her own sweet face which fell from the cloud of that simple thought for she stood where the westering sunshine failed to touch the water but flushed with rich relief of gold the purity of her figure every sapling dappled hazel sloughing birch or glabrous maple glistened with the plumes of light and every leaf was twinkling the columns of the larger trees stood like metal cylinders whereon the level gleam rules a streak and glints away round the rounding elbows arms and old embracings backed with a bodyground of green laced with sunsets golden bodkin ever shifting every eyeletbranch and bough and trunk and leaves ruffling and twisting or staunch and grand they seemed but a colonnade and arch for the sun to peep through at the maiden and tell of her on the calm waters floating fleeting shimmering there in a frame of stately summer flags vivid upon the crystal shade and twinkling every now and then to the plash of a distant moorhen or the dip of a swallows wing lay her graceful image wondering in soft reply to her play of wonder she took off her light chip hat and laughed lo the courteous picture did the same she offered with a mincing air her little frail of woodstrawberries and the shadowy amy put them back with the prettiest grace ever dreamed of then she cast the sparkling night of her tresses down the white shoulders and over her breast and the other amy was looking at her through a ripple of cloudiness with the lissom waist retiring she smoothed her hair like a scarf around her withdrew her chin on the curving neck and bowed the shapely forehead well pleased to see thus the foreshortening undone and the pure bright oval shown as in a glass then frightened almost at the lustrous depth of her large grey eyes deepfringed with black she thought of things all beyond herself and woke from natures innocent joy in her own brief luck of beauty to the bashful consciousness the down of a maidens dreamings bridling next at her mirrored face with a sudden sense of humour all the time she watched the red lips and the glimmer of pearls between them amy she cried now after this dont come to me for a character unless you want one you pretty dear for conceit and selfadmiration so saying she tossed her light head at herself and looked round through her flickering cloudlets what did she see what made the dark water flame upon the instant with a richer glow than sunset the delicate cheeks the fair forehead and neck even the pearly slope of the shoulders were flooded with deepest carmine her pride fell flat as the cistus stamen at a touch droops away on the petal then she shrank back into a flowering broom and cowered among the spikelets and dared not move to wipe away the tears she was so mad with oh the wretched abasement earned by a sweet little bit of vanity how she hated herself and the light and the water her senseless habit of thinking aloud above all her despicable fancy that she was growingwhat nonsensesuch a pretty girl thenceforth and for ever she felt quite sure she never could look in a glass again unless it were just for a moment to put her hair to rights when she got home to think of my hair all down my neck and the way i had turned in the gathersthe poor little thing had been making experiments how she would look in a lownecked dressoh that was the worst thing of all i might have laughed at it but for that and now i am sure i can never even peep at his face again whatever will he think of me and what would my papa say after crying until she began to laugh she resolved to go straight home and confess all her crime to aunt eudoxia john rosedews maiden sister who had come to live with him when he lost his wife three dreary years agone so amy rolled up her long hair anyhow without a bit of pride in it shrank away and examined herself to be sure that all was right and after one peep came bravely forth trying to look as much as possible like her good aunt doxy then she walked at her stateliest with the basket of strawberries picked for papa in one hand and the other tightly clasped upon the bounding of her heart but her eyes were glancing right or left like a fawns when a lion has roared and even the youngest trees saw quite well that however rigid with miss eudoxia the gliding form might be it was poised for a dart and a hide behind them at every crossing shadow but fortune favours the brave she won her own little sallyport without the rustle of a blackberryleaf and thereupon rushed to a hasty and ostrichlike conclusion she felt quite sure that after all none but the waters and winds could tell the tale of her little coquetry beyond all doubt cradock nowell was deep in the richest mental metallurgy tracing the vein of greek iambics as he did before his beard grew and she never never would call them stupid iambics again cradock who had seen her but turned away immediately as became a gentleman did not for the moment know his little amy rosedew a year and a half had changed her from a stripling jumping girl to a shy and graceful maiden dreadfully afraid of sweethearts she had not been away from nowelhurst throughout that year and a half for her father could not get on without her for more than a month at a time and all that month he fretted but the twins had spent the last summer in germany with a merry reading or talking party and their christmas and easter vacations were dragged away in london through a strange whim of sir cradock nowell at least they thought it strange but there was some reason for it young cradock nowell was not such a muff as to be lost in greek senarii no trimeter acatalectics of truest balance and purest fall could be half so fair to scan not harmony of the golden hair and her nine pierid daughters round the crystal spring were worth a glance of the mental eye when fortune granted bodily vision of our unconscious amy but he did not stand there watching mutely as some youths would have done for a moment indeed he forgot himself in the flush of admiration the next moment he remembered that he was a gentleman and he did what a gentleman must have donewhether marquis or labourer he slipped away through the bushes feeling as if he had done some injury then the maiden glancing round caught one startled glimpse as nyssia did of the stealthy gyges or diana of acton from that one glimpse she knew him though he was so like his brother but he had failed to recognise the amy of his boyhood chapter ix miss eudoxia was now the queen of the little household and the sceptre she bore was an iron one to all except her niece johnthat easy goodnatured parson who coming in from the garden or parish any summer forenoon would halt in the long low kitchen if a nice crabbed question presented itself take his seat outright upon the corner of the ancient dresser and then and there discuss some moot point in the classics or tie and untie over again some fluffy knot historical which after all is but a pucker in the tatters of a scarecrow and all the while he would appeal to the fat cook or the other maidfor the house only kept two servants and all the while miss amy would poke in little pikepoints of impudence and ignorancejohn i must confess at last was threatened so with dishclouts pepper and even rollingpins that the cook began to forget the name of plato which had struck her and the housemaid could not justly tell what tibullus says of pales john you are so lamentably deficient in moral dignity and the mutton not put down yet and the kidneybeans getting ropy if you must sit there you might as well begin to slice the cucumber i dare say youd do that even to be sure doxy so i will i sharpened my knife this morning doxy indeed and before the servants i am sure johanna must have heard you though she makes such a rattle in there with the rollingpin like a doctors pestle and mortar she always does when i come out to pretend she is so busy and most likely she has been listening for half an hour and laughing at your flummery what do i care about acharniusnow dont tell me any jokes if you please brother john with butter on both your legs too oh if i could only put you in a passion i might have some hopes of you then but i should like to see the woman that could you have so little selfrespect eudoxia that is the very converse of senecas proposition then seneca didnt know how to converse and i wont be flouted with him seneca to me indeed or any other heathen let me tell you one thing john rosedewmiss eudoxia now was wrathful not nettlesome only but spinous perhaps it would be rude to hint that in this latter word may lurk the true etymon of spinsterlet me tell you one thing and perhaps youll try to remember it for with all your wonderful memory you never can tell tomorrow what i said today surely not dear doxy because you talk so much it is related of that same seneca that he could repeat fiddlesticks now you want to turn off the hometruth you feel to be coming but you shall have it john rosedew and briefly it is this although you do sit on the dresser your taste is too eclectic you are a very learned man but your learning gilds foul idols you spend all your time in pagans company while the epistles and gospels have too little style for you oh aunt eudoxia how dare you talk to my papa like that my own daddy and me to hear you and just now you flew into a pet because you fancied johanna heard him call you doxy i am astonished at it aunt doxy and it is not true not a word of it come with me father dearest and we wont say a word to her all the afternoon even young amy saw that her father was hit very hard there was so much truth in the accusation so much spiteful truthamong thy beauties nuda veritas a smooth skin is not onethat poor john felt as if aristophanes were sewn up henceforth in a pigsack he slunk away quietly to his room and tried to suck some roots hebraic whence he got no satisfaction he never could have become a great theological scholar after all a man must do what god has shaped his mind for so in a week john rosedew got back to his native element but sister doxys rough thrust made the dresser for many a month like the bottom of a pincushion when the pins are long and the bran has leaked out at the corner now miss eudoxia rosedew was always very sorry when she had indulged too much in the pleasure of hurting others it was not in her nature to harm any living creature but she could not understand that hurt is the feminine of harmthe feminine frequentative if i may suggest that anomaly she had a warm impulsive heart and sided almost always with the weaker party convinced profoundly as she was of her brothers great ability she believed whenever a question arose that the strength was all on his side and so she went dead against him one thing and the most material one she entirely overlooked as a sister is apt to do to wit the breadth and modesty of her brothers nature one thing i say for the two are one so closely are they united it is a goodly sight to see john rosedew and his sister upon their way to church she supporting the family dignity with a maid behind her to carry the booksthat it may please thee to defend us with a real footmanjust touching johns arm with the tips of her glove because he rolls so shockingly and even his sunday coat may be greasy then if a little girl comes by lady eudoxiaas the village half in joke and half in earnest has already dubbed herlady eudoxia never looks at her they are so selfimportant now even those brats of children but she knows by instinct whether that little girl has curtseyed if she has it is nicely acknowledged but if she has not what a chill runs down the ladys rigid spine john did you see that see what doxythree sugarplums my little dear and a few of our coughlozenges i heard you cough last sunday and you may suck them in the sermon time because they dont smell of peppermint and they are quite as nice as liquorice how is your mammy my darling well johnwell mr rosedewif you have no more sense of proprietyand so near the house of god and miss eudoxia walks on in front while the girl who failed to curtsey has thrust one brown hand long ago into the parsons ample palm and with the other is stoking that voracious engine whose vernacular name is mouth amy of course is at the school where this little girl ought by rights to have been only for her cough which would come on so dreadfully when the words were hard to spell and when they meet amy by the gate the double gate of the churchyardboth sides only opened for funerals how smooth and rich and calm she lookscalm yet with a heart of triumph as her own class clusters round her and wont even glimpse at the boysnot even the very smallest boyone of whom has the cheek to whistle and pretends that he meant the old hundredth but in spite of all this eudoxian grandeur there was not a poor man in nowelhurstno nor even a womanwho did not feel in earnest heart faith and goodwill towards her for the worldly nonsense was cast aside when she stood in the presence of trouble and her native kindness and vigour shone forth till the face of grief was brightened then she forgot her titled grandmotherso often quoted and such a bore the countess of driddledrum and dromoreand glowed and melted as all must do who are made of good carbon and water so let her walk into the village church with the pride which she is proud of her tall and comely figure shown through the scarf of lavender crape her dark silk dress on the burial flags wiping dust from the memory of john stiles and his dear wife susan and oh johanna thou goodly fat cookmaid dishing up prayerbooks and guides to the altar and thy gloves on the top ostentatiouslygloves whose fingers are to thine as vermicelli to sausages johanna spoil not our procession by loitering under the hollow oak to wink at thy sweetheart jem pottles neither do thou oh hollow oak look down upon us and tell of the tree only one generation before thee under thy branches the arab himself had better not talk of lineage some acorn spat forth halfcrunched and bedribbled by the deer or the swine of the forest and in danger perhaps of being chewed afterwards by the ancestors of royaltyour familytrees are young fungus to thee and our roots of nobility pignuts chapter x the scenery of the new forest is of infinite variety but the wooded parts may be ranged perhaps in a free loosebranching order as befits the subject into some three divisions which cross and interlace each other as the trees themselves do first and most lovely the glades and reaches of gentle park and meadow where the beechtree invades not seriously or at any rate not with discipline but straggles about like a tall centurion amused by ancient britons here are the openings winged with fern and ruffling to the west wind and the crimped oval leaves of the alder rustle over the backs of the bathing cows in and out we glance or gaze through the groined arcade of trees where the sun goes wandering softly as if with his hand before his eyes of such kind is the queens bower wood beside the boldre water of the second type most grand and solemn is the tall beechforest darkening the brow of some lonely hill and draping the bosomed valleys such is mark ash wood four miles to the west of lyndhurst overhead is the vast cool canopy underfoot the soft brown carpet woven by a thousand autumns no puny underwood foils the gaze no coppicewhispers circulate on high there moves one long unbroken and mysterious murmur and all below grey twilight broods in a lake of silent shadow through this the ancient columns rising smooth dovecoloured or glimpsed with moss others fluted crannied bulging hulked at the reevings of some great limb others twisted spirally and tortuously rooting a thousand giants receding clustering opening latticepeeps between them standing forth to stop the view or glancing some busy slant of lightin the massive depth of gloom they seem almost to glide the third and most rudely sylvan form is that of the enclosures where the intolerant beech is absent and the oak the spruce and the spanish chestnut protect the hazel the fern and bramble the dogrose and the honeysuckle in a bowering gleaming twinkling valley such as i have first described we saw miss amy rosedew admiring her own perfections and now some three months afterwards a certain young lady not wholly unlike her is roaming in a deep enclosure thick with oaks and underwood it lies about a furlong from the western lodge of nowelhurst and stretches away towards the sunset far from the eye of house or hut even the lonely peatman who camps or camped while so allowed beneath the open sky wherever the waste yields labour freely and no prescription bars himeven he finds nothing here to draw his sauntering footstep the gorse prefers more open places the nuts are few and hard to reach the fuelturf is not worth cutting and the fuelwood he dare not hew in short there is nothing there to tempt him as for shade and solitude and the crystal rill he gets a deal too much of that sort of thing already by the side of that crystal rill and where the trees hung thickest in the grey gloom of that michaelmas evening walked the aforesaid maiden and what we had not bargained for a gentle youth beside her the light between the lapping boughs and leaveswhose summer whisper grew hoarse in autumns rustlethe clouded light fell charily but showed the figures comely as either could wish of the other the maidens face was turned away but one hand lay in her lovers with the other she was drawing close the loose folds of her mantleher flushing cheek was glad of shade and the grass thought her feet were trembling his eager glistening wavering eyes told of hope with fear behind it and all his life was waiting for a word or look but for the moment neither came she trembled more and more before him and withdrew a little as the silverweed at her feet withdrew from the runnels passion she thought he would yet say moreshe longed for him to say more oh that her heart would be quiet but never another word he said till she turned to him sadly and proudly with her soft eyes full of tears mr nowell you are very eloquent but you do not know what love is she lifted her left hand towards her heart but was too proud to put it there and dropped it hiding the movement i not know what love is and i have been saying things i should have laughed at any fellow for saying though i am fit to cry while i say them oh how coldblooded you are for i cannot make you feel them he looked at her so ardently that her sweet gaze fell like a violet in the may sun no mr clayton nowell i am not coldblooded but at least my blood is pure though not in the eyes of the world so high and refined as your own what has that got to do with it my ownownown he was in a great hurry to embrace her because she looked at him tenderly to palliate the toss of her head wait if you please throughout all your rhapsody here she smiled so that none could be angry you have not said a single word to show whetherthat isi mean to say whether she burst into tears turned from him and clung to the dead arm of the old oak whether what asked clayton sharply in spite of her deep distress for he began to doubt if he truly were loved and to tire of the highstrung suspense whether i have got money enough to support us both respectably isnt that the proper word for it and because i am the younger son he frowned very hard at the bark of the oak and crushed the grey touchwood under his foot though his hand was still seeking for hers then she turned full upon him suddenly too proud to dissemble her tears oh clayton clayton nowell can you think me so mean as that though my father would cast me off perhaps in his gratitude to sir cradock do you think i would care for all the world so long as i only had you what i meant was only that you never said if you meant me to beto beyour wife her long lashes fell on her glistening cheeks like the willowleaves over the avon why whatwell that beats cockfightingwhy what else did you suppose i meant you darling of all born darlings i am sure i dont know clayton only i beg your pardon he gave her no time to beg it twice with those wistful eyes upon him but made her earn it thoroughly with her round arms on his neck and other proceedings wherewithal we have no right to meddle yes you may call me now your ownever so many interruptionsyour own yours only for ever and you would rather have me than my elder brother sooner than a thousand elder brothers all as grave as methusalem clayton was so delighted hereat that he really longed to squeeze her although it is a thing which young ladies nowadays never think of allowing let them hope that he did not do it the probabilities are in their favour oh clayton how can i be such a simpleton what would my father say to me what do i care my gem my jewel my warm delicious pearl for three long months i have been dying to kiss you and now i wont be cheated so surely you are not afraid of me my beautiful wild rose her gardening hat had fallen off her eyes were bright with tears and the glow upon her cheeks had faded to a pellucid gleam so have i seen the rich red aurora weep itself in a pulsethrob to a pearly and waxen pink no clayton i am not afraid of you i know that you are a gentleman well thought clayton she must be a witch or the cleverest girl in the universe as well as the most beautiful she knows the way to manage me as if we had been married fifty years he looked so disconcerted at the implied rebuke that she could have found it in her sweet heart to give him fifty kisses but with all her warmth of passion she was a pure and sensitive maiden full of selfrespect though abashed for the moment and bowing her head to the sunrise of young affection she possessed a fine and very sensible will and way of her own she was just the wife for clayton nowella hot impulsive wayward youth proud to be praised by every one more than proud of deserving it with such a wife he would ripen and stiffen into a fine full character with a weak and volatile spouse he would swing to and fro to his ruin his goodness as yet was in the material only a soft firm hand could fashion it so she kept him at his distance except every now and then when her warm loving nature looked forth from her eyes for fear of hurting his feelings hand in hand they walked along as if they still were children and held much counsel as they went about the difficulties between them but happen what would they made up their minds about one thing and for them henceforth both plural and singular were entirely merged in the dual that sentence is priggish and pedantic but i think young lovers can solve it if not let them put their heads together and unriddle it in labiates nothing ever ever ever in the world of fact or in the reach of imagination should hold apart that faithful pair whose all in all was to each the other this they settled with much satisfaction before discussing anything else except of course you know darling said the more thoughtful maiden if either of us should die clayton shuddered at the idea for it was a dark place of the wood and the rustle of the ivyleaves seemed to whisper die then he insisted upon his amends for such a nasty suggestion and she with the tender thought moving her heart could not refuse strict justice and so you say love i must stay at oxford until i take my degree what a long time it does seem doesnt it never mind dearest how long it is if we are true to one another oh that of course theres no doubt about and you think i must tell my father of course you must clayton we are not very old you know he will think that he can part us and that may make him less angryhere she laughed at her own subtletyand putting that out of the question neither of us could bear to be deceiving him so long after all you are but a younger son and i am a lady i hope i have been thoroughly educated and there is nothing but money against me she looked so proud in the shade of the spruce that he was obliged to stop and admire her at least he thought it his duty to do so and the opinion did not offend her but what will your brother cradock say he is so different from you so odd so determined andupright i dont care that for what he says only he had better be civil he treated me very badly that time about the ireland i have a very great regard for cradock he is a very decent fellow but i must teach him his proper place and you can beat him easily in latin my father says you can what a shame that he would not go in for the hertford that you might turn the tables upon him he would not even have got a proxy or whatever it was he gave you i dont know that said clayton who was truthful in spite of vanity very likely he would have beaten me but i have cut him out in two things for i cant help thinking that he has a hankering after you he looked at her with a keen shrewd glance for he was desperately jealous she saw it and smiled and only saidwould you believe that he could help it but it happens that i know otherwise oh then you would have had him if you could now clayton dont be childish in your heart you know better of course he did a great deal better then there was that to make up again because she looked so hurt and so charming but we cant stop here all day or follow all these little doings even if honour allowed us and another thing not so important though i have cut him out in most decidedly said clayton lifting his head again the governor likes me long chalks better than he does cradock i can tell you no doubt of it i should say dear but i dont think you ought to talk of it no only to you no secrets from ones wife you know but you wont tell your father yet till ive opened upon sir cradock why not i intend to tell him directly i get home and one thing is certain clayton he will be more angry than yours will clayton found it very difficult to change her determination but at last he succeeded in doing so but only for a week mind i will only put it off for a week clayton and i would not do that only as you say he would rush off at once to sir cradock and i must give you time to take your father at the very best opportunity and when will that be my sweet prime minister in your most sage opinion why of course on my dear loves birthday next week when all those rejoicings are to be at his brother becoming of age the young lady meant no mischief at all but her lover did not look gracious my brother oh yes to be sure my brother and i dreamed last night that i was the elder he used to talk about giving me half but i havent heard much of that lately as for my majority as the lawyers are pleased to call it nobody cares two straws for that all my life i shall be a minor yes somebody cares for it darling and more than all the hundreds put together who will shout and hurrah for your brother and she looked at him fondly from her heart what a hot little partisan the whole of that heart was now with clayton and he felt its strength by sympathy so he lifted her hand to his lips as a cavalier does in a picture for the moment all selfish regrets lost their way in the great wide world of love and my fealty shall be to you he cried kneeling half in play before her you are my knightly fee and fortune my castle my lands and my home they had stopped at a point where two forestpaths met and the bushes fell back a little and the last of the autumn sunset glanced through the pales of a mossgrown gate the mark whereby some royalty or right of chase was limited kneeling there clayton nowell looked so courtly and gentle with the bowered light of the west half saddening his happy affectionate countenance that his newlybetrothed must needs stoop graciously and kiss his uncovered forehead while clayton was admiring secretly the velvet of her lips back she leaped as if stung by a snake then proudly stood confronting clayton sprang up to defend her but there was no antagonist all he saw was a man on horseback passing silently over the turf behind a low bank crowned with fern here a narrow track scarce visible saved the traveller some few yards subtending as it did the angle where the two paths met clayton could not see the horse for the thick brakefern eclipsed him but he felt that the nag was rather tired and getting sad about suppertime the rider seemed to be making a face intended to express the most abstract philosophy possible and superlunary contemplation any rabbit skilled in physiognomy would have come out of his hole again quite reassured thereby a short man he was and apparently one meant by his mother for ruddiness and still the brickred of his hair proclaimed some loyalty to her intention but his face was browned and flaked across like a red potato roasting and his little eyes sharp as a glaziers diamond and twinkling now at the zenith belied his absent attitude then as he passed by a shadowy oak which swallowed him up in a moment that oak if it had been duly vocal would have repeated these words well if that aint the parsons daughter grind me under a currystone what a sly minxbut devilish pretty youre a deal too soft john rosedew as he passed on towards nowelhurst the lovers felt that they had been seen and perhaps watched ever so long and then they felt uncomfortable the young lady was the first to recover presence of mind she pressed on her glossy round head the hat which had been so long in her left hand and drawing a long breath looked pointblank at the wondering stare of her sweetheart well clayton we may make up our minds for it now for what i should like to know who cares for that interloping beetrootcoloured muff he is no muff at all i can tell you but an exceedingly clever man do you mean to say you dont know him not i from esau or ishmael and he looks like a mixture of both he is doctor rufus hutton clayton indulged in a very long whistle indrawn and not melodious twas a trick he had learned at oxford it has long been discarded elsewhere but at both universities still subsists as the solace of newlyplucked men the longdrawn sound seems to wind so soothingly down the horns of dilemma then the youth jumped up and gathered a nut cracked it between his white front teeth and offered it husk and all without any thought of hygrometry to his beautiful frightened darling she took it as if his wife already and picked out the thin shell piece by piece anxiously seeking the kernel he all the while with admiration watched the delicate fingers moving the reflex play of the lissome joints the spiral thread and varying impress of the convex tips and the faintly flushing pink beneath the transparency of her nails then she laughed and jumped as it proved to be a magnificent double nuttwo fat kernels close together shaped by one another of course she gave him one and of course we know what they did about it i will only state that they very soon forgot all about dr rufus hutton and could scarcely part where the last branchpath was quite near to the maidens window even there where the walks divided when neither could see the other each stepped aside very proud of loves slyness to steal the last of the others footfall and soon with a blush of intuition each knew that the other was lingering and each felt ashamed of himself or herself and loved the other all the more for it so they broke from the bushes detected and laughing to put a good face upon it and each must go to tell the other how it came about they kissed once more for they felt it was right now that the moon was risen then home ran both with a warmth of remembrance and hope glowing in the heart chapter xi whatever the age or the intellect of the passing age may be even if ever arise again such a galaxy of great minds as dawned upon this country three hundred years ago though all those great minds start upon their glorious career comprising and intensifying all the light engendered by before and since the time of shakespeare bacon newton then though they enhance that light tenfold by their own bright genius till a thousand waking nations gleam like hilltops touched with sunriseto guide men on the human road to lead them heavenward all shall be no more than a benighted river wandering away from the stars of god do what we will and think as we may enlarging the mind in each generation growing contemptuous of contempt casting caste to the winds of heaven and antiquating prejudice nevertheless we shall never outrun or even overtake christianity science learning philosophy may regard it through a telescope they touch it no more than astronomy sets foot upon a star to a thoughtful man who is scandalized at all the littleness felt and done under the holy name until he almost begins to doubt if the good outweigh the evil it is reassurance to remember that we are not christians yet and comfort to confess that on earth we never can be for nothing shows more clearly that our faith is of heaven than the truth that we cannot rise to it until it raise us thither and this reflection is akin to the stately writers sentiment that our minds conceive so much more than our bodies can perform to give us token ay and earnest of a future state of all the creeds which have issued as yet from god or man or the devil there is but one which is far in advance of all human civilization true christianity like hope cheers us to continual effort exalts us to unbounded prospect flies in front of our best success let us call it a wornout garb when we have begun to wear it as yet the mantle is in the skies and we have only the skirt with the name on it such thoughts as these were always stirring in the heart of a man of power a leading character in my story a leading character everywhere whithersoever he went bull garnet was now fortyfive years old and all who met him were surprised at his humble place in the commonwealth a sense of power so pervaded even the air he breathed that strong men rebelled instinctively though he urged no supremacy weak men caught some infection from him and went home and astonished their families strong and weak alike confessed that it was a mysterious thing how a man of such motive strength and selfreliance illimitable could be content with no higher post than that of a common steward but neighbourly interest in this subject met with no encouragement albeit his views of life expanded into universal sympathy his practice now and then admitted some worldlywise restrictions and so while really glad to advise on the doings of all around him he never permitted brotherly interference with his own whoever saw bull garnet once was sure to know him again if you met him in a rush to save the train your eyes would turn and follow him there goes a man remarkable whether for good or evil tall though he was and large of frame with swinging arms and a square expression it was none of this that stopped the bystanders glance into a gaze it was the cubic mass of the forehead the span between the enormous eyes and the depth of the thickset jowl which rolled with the volume of a tigers the rest of the face was in keeping therewith the nose bold broad and patulous the mouth large and well banked up the chin big and heavily rounded no shade of a hair was ever allowed to dim his healthy colouring his head was cropped close as a puritans and when beard grew fast he shaved twice in a day high culture was a necessity to him whether of mind or body or of the world external he would no more endure a moustache on his lip than a frouzy hedgerow upon his farm that man if you came to think about him more and more each time you saw how different he was from other men distinctness is a great merit in roses especially when the french rosarians have so overpiled the catalogue it is pleasant to walk up to a standard and say you are jules margottin and your neighbour the keepsake of malmaison i cannot mistake you for any other however hot the weather may be distinctness is also a merit in apples pears and even peaches but most of all in man and so without knowing the reason perhaps we like a man whom we cannot mistake for any other of our million brethren the same principle tells in love at first sight but lo here again we are wandering mr garnets leading characteristic was not at first sight amiable it was if i may be allowed for once upon the strength of my subject not to mince words into entremetsa furious reckless damnable and thoroughly devilish temper all great qualities lovingkindness yearnings for christian ideals fell like sugarcanes to a hurricane in the outburst and rush of that temper he was always grieved and deeply humbled when the havoc was done and being a man of generous nature would bow his soul in atonement but in the towering of his wrath how grand a sight he afforded as fine as the rush of the wild atlantic upon st davids head for a time perhaps he would chafe and fret within the straits of reason his body surging to and fro and his mind making grasp at boundaries then some little aggravation some trifle which no other man would noticeand out would leap all the pentup fury of his soul his great eyes would gather volume and spring like a mastiff from a kennel his mighty forehead would scarp and chine like the headland when the plough turns and all his aspect grow foursquare with more than hydraulic pressure whoever then could gaze unmoved at the raging fire of his eyes must be either a philosopher or a fooland often the two are synonymous but touch him even then with a single word of softness the thought of some one dear to him a large and genial sentiment or a tender memoryand the lines of his face would relax and quiver the blazing eyes be suffused and subdued to a tremulous glow and the man so far beyond reasons reach be led back like a boy by the feelings all who think they can catch and analyze that composite subtle volatile gasneither body nor spirit yet in fief to the laws of eitherwhich men call human nature these i say will opine at once from even this meagre description that mr bull garnets nature was scant of that playful element humour if thought be as german philosophers have it an electric emanation then wit is the forked flash gone in a moment humour the soft summer lightning that shows us the clouds and the depth the background and night of ourselves no man of large humour can be in a passion without laughing inwardly at himself and wrath which laughs at itself is not of much avail in business mr garnets wrath on the contrary was a fine freeboiling british anger not at all amenable to reason and therefore very valuable by dint of it he could score at night nearly twice as much work done in the day as a peaceable man could have reckoned man or woman boy or girl mr garnet could extract from each all the cubic capacity leaving them just enough of power to crawl home stiff and admire him for the truth of it is as all know to their cost who have had much to do with spade or plough hod or hammer that the british workman admires most the master who makes him sweat most perhaps it ought not to be so theoretically we regard it thus that a man ought to perspire upon principle when he is working for another man but tell us where and oh where to find the model british labourer who takes that view of the subject sith it will na better be let us out and look for him the sky is bright blue and the white clouds flock off it like sheep overlapping each other what man but loves the open air and to walk about and think of it with fancies flitting lazily like fluff of dandelion what man but loves to sit under a tree and let the winds go wandering and the shadows come and play with him to let work be a pleasant memory and hurry a storm of the morning everybody except bull garnet chapter xii all the leaves of the new forest save those of the holly and mistletoe some evergreen spines and the blinder sort that know not a wink from a nodall the leaves i mean that had sense of their position and when to blush and when to retire and how much was due to the roots that taught themall these leaves were beginning to feel that their time in the world was over the trees had begun to stand tier upon tier in an amphitheatrical fashion and to sympathise more with the sunset while the sun every evening was kissing his hands and pretending to think them younger some outspoken trees leaned forward well in front of the forestgalleries with amber sleeves and loops of gold and braids of mellow abandonment like liberal brazilian ladies bowing from the balconies others drew away behind them with their mantles folded leaning back into unprobed depths of semitransparent darkness as the forest of the sky amasses when the moon is rising some had cast off their children in parachutes swirling as the linden berries do throughout september some were holding their treasures grimly and would even when they were naked now the flush of the grand autumnal tide had not risen yet to its glory but was freaking and glancing and morrising round the bays and the juts of the foliage or it ruffled among the ferny knaps and along the winding alleys the sycamores truly were reddening fast and the chestnut palms growing bronzy the limes were yellowing here and there and the sere leaves of the woodbine fluttered the cob of clear red berries but the great beechen hats which towered and darkened atop of the moorland hollows and across the track of the woodmanthese and the oaks along the rise where the turtledove was cooing had only shown their sense of the age by an undertint of olive it was now the fifth day of octobera day to be remembered long by all the folk of nowelhurst mr garnet stood at the end of his garden where a narrow pinewood gate opened to one of the forest rides of course he was doing something and doing it very forcibly his life was a fire that burned very fast having plenty of work to poke it but the little job which he now had in hand was quite a relaxation there was nothing bull garnet enjoyed so much as cutting down a tree he never cared what time of year it was whether the leaves were on or off whether the sap were up or down as we incorrectly express it the sap of a tree is ever moving like our own lifeblood only it feels the change of season more than we who have no roots has a dormouse no circulation when he coils himself up in his elbowed hole is there no evaporation from the frozen waters the two illustrations are wide apart but the principle is the same nature admits no absolute stoppage except as death in her cradle of life and then she sets to and transmutes it why bull garnet so enjoyed the cutting down of a tree none but those who themselves enjoy it may pretend to say of course we will not refer it to the reason assigned in the wellknown epigram which contains such a wholesale condemnation of this arboricidal age in another century london builders will perhaps discover when there are no trees left that a bit of tuckpointing by the gate and a dab of mudplaster beside it do not content the heart of man like the leaves and the drooping shadowy rustle which is the type of himself bull garnet stood there in the october morning with the gate wide open flung back by his strong hand upon its hinges as if it had no right to them the round bolt dropped from the quivering force dropped through the chase of the loop and bedded deep in the soft wet ground with much satisfaction the gate brought up and felt itself anchored safely bull garnet gave the bolt a kick which hurled all the rusty screws out then he scarcely stopped to curse the blacksmith he wanted the time for the woodcutters at a glint from the side of his vast round eyeseyes that took in everything and made all the workmen swear and believe that he could see round a cornerhe descried that the axemen were working the tree askew to the strain of the ropes the result must be that the comely young oak just proud of its first big crop of acorns would swerve on the bias of the wind stagger heavily and fall headlong upon the smart new fence there was no time for wordsin a moment he had kicked the men right and left torn off his coat and caught up an axe and dealt three thundering strokes in the laggard twist of the breach away went the young oak swaying wildly trying once to recover itself then crashing and creaking through the brushwood with a swish from its boughs and leaves and a groan from its snaggy splinters a branch took one of the men in his face and laid him flat in a tussock of grass serve you right you lubber im devilish glad cried bull garnet and i hope you wont move for a week the next moment he went up and raised him felt that his limbs were sound and gave him a dram of brandy all right my fine fellow next time youll know something of the way to fell a tree go home now and ill send you a bottle of wine but the change of his mood the sudden softening the glisten that broke through the flash of his eyes was not caused this time by the inroad of rapid christian feeling it was the approach of his son that stroked the down of his heart the right way bull garnet loved nothing else in this world or in the world to come with a hundredth part of the love wherewith he loved his only son lo the word love thrice in a sentencenevertheless let it stand so for is there a word in our noble tongue or in any other language to be compared for power and beauty with that little word love bob came down the path of the kitchen garden at his utmost speed he was like his father in one or two things and most unlike in others his nature was softer and better by far though not so grand and strikingbull garnet in the young adam again ere ever the devil came all this the father felt but knew not it never occurred to him to inquire why he adored his son the boy leaped the new x fence very cleverly through the fork of the fingers and stood before his father in a flame of indignation mr garnet with that queer expression which the face of a middleaged man wears when he recalls his boyhood ere yet he begins to admire it was looking at his own young life with a contemplative terror he was saying to himself what cheek this boy has got and he was feeling all the while that he loved him the more for having it hurrah bob my boy youre come just in time mr garnet tried very hard to look as if he expected approval well enough all the time he knew that he had no chance of getting it for bob loved nature in any form especially as expressed in the noble eloquence of a tree and now he saw why he had been sent to the village on a trifling errand that morning just in time for what sir bobs indignation waxed yet more that his father should dare to chaff him just in time to tell us all about these wonderful redcombed fungi what do you call themsome long name as wonderful as themselves bob kicked them aside contemptuously he could have told a long story about them and things which men of thrice his age who have neglected their mother would be glad to listen to nature desiring not revenge has it in the credulous itch of the sons who have turned their backs on her oh father said bob with the tears in his eyes father you cant have known that three purple emperors came to this oak and sat upon the top of it every morning for nearly a week in the middle of july and it was the most handsomest thirtyyear oak till you come right to brockenhurst bridge most handsomest bob cried mr garnet glad to lay hold of anything come along with me my son i must see to your education near them stood a young spruce fir not more than five feet high it had thrown up a straight and tapering spire scaled with tender green below were tassels tufts and pointlets all in triple order pluming over one another in a pile of beauty the tips of all were touched with softer and more glaucous tone but all this gentle tint and form was only as a framework now a loom to bear the web of heaven for there had been a white mist that morningautumns breath made visible and the tree with its net of spiders webs had caught the lucid moisture now as the early sunlight opened through the layered vapours that little spruce came boldly forth a dark bay of the forest and met all the spears of the orient looped and traced with threads of gauze the lacework of a fairys thought scarcely daring to breathe upon its veil of tremulous chastity it kept the wings of light on the hover afraid to weigh down the whiteness a maiden with the lovedream nestling under the bridal faldetta a child of genius breathing softly at his own fair visions even an infants angel whispering to the weeping motherwhat image of humanity can be so bright and exquisite as a common trees apparel father can you make that mr garnet checked his rapid stride and for once he admired a tree no my son only god can do such glorious work as that but it dont take god to undo it smash bob dashed his fists through the whole of it and all the draped embroidery all the pearly filigree all the festoons of silver were but as a dream when a yawning man stretches his scraggy arms forth the little tree looked wobegone stale and draggled with drunken tears why bob i am ashamed of you and so am i of you father before the bold speech was well out of his mouth bob took heartily to his heels and for once in his life mr garnet could not make up his mind what to do after all he was not so very angry for he thought that his son had been rather clever in his mode of enforcing the moral and a man who loves ability and loves his boy still more regards with a liberal shrewdness the proof of the one in the other alas it is hard to put mr garnet in a clear bold stereoscope without breach of the third commandment somehow or other as fashion goesand happily it is on the go alwaysa man and threefold thrice a woman may at this especial period in the persons of his or her characters break the sixth commandment lightly and the seventh with great applause indeed no tale is much approved without lsemajest of them both then for what subterranean reason or by what diabolical instrumentality that language is strictly parliamentary because it is words and water is a writer now debarred from reporting what his people said unless they all talked tracts and milk or rubrics and pommelsaddles in a wordfor sometimes any fellow must come to the pointwhy do our judicious and highlyrespected sosii score out all our dns is it not true that our generation swears almost as hard as any and yet it will not allow a writer to hint the truth in the matter of course we should do it sparingly and with due reluctance but unless all tales are written for women and are so to be accepted it is a weak attempt at imposture on our sons and grandsons to suppress entirely in our pictures any presence not indecent however unbecoming mr garnet was a christian of the most advanced intelligence so far as our ideas at the present time extend he felt the beauty and perfection of the type which is set before us he never sneered as some of us do at things which were too large for him neither did he clip them to the shape of his own sophagus only in practice like the rest of us he was sadly centrifugal now with his nostrils widely open and great eyes on the ground he was pacing rapidly up and down his sheltered kitchen garden every square was in perfect order every tree in its proper compass all the edging curt and keen the ground was cropped with that trim luxuriance which we never see except under firstrate management all the coleworts for the winter all the wellearthed celery all the buttoning brussels sprouts salsify just fit to dig turnips lifting whitely forth as some ladies love to show themselves modest savoys just hearting in and saying no to the dewbeads prickly spinach daily widening the clipped arrowheadthey all had room to eat and drink and no man grudged his neighbour yet puck himself could not have skipped through with dry feet during a hoarfrost as for weeds bull garnetwell i must not say what he would have done suddenly a small spare man turned the corner upon him where a hedge of hornbeam trimmed and dressed as if with a pocketcomb broke the southwestern violence most men would have shown their hats above the narrow spine but rufus hutton was very short and seldom carried a chimneypot sir what can i do for you said mr garnet much surprised but never taken aback excuse me sir but i called at your house and came this way to find you you know me well by name i believe as i have the pleasure of knowing you rufus hutton ahem sir delightful occupation i too am a gardener dumelow seedling i flatter myself know them well by the eye sir but what a difference the soil makes ah yes let them hang till the frost comes what a plague we have had with earwigs get into the seat of the fruit now just let me show you ah you beggars there you are never take them by the head sir or theyd nip my fingers take them under the abdomen and they havent room to twist upon you there now what can he do not even thank you sir for killing him and now what can i do for you mr garnet i will come to the point a man learns that in india too hot sir for much talking bless my heart i have known the thermometer at oclock pm sirnot in the barracks mind me nor in a stifling nullah excuse me i have read of all that i have an engagement dr hutton at eight minutes past eleven bless my heart and i have an appointment at and five seconds how singular a coincidence bull garnet looked down at the little doctor and thought him too small to be angry with moreover he was a practical man and scarcely knew what chaff meant so he kept his temper wonderfully while rufus looked up at him gravely with his little eyes shining like glowworms between the brown stripes of his countenance i have heard of you dr hutton as a very skilful gardener perhaps you would like to look round my garden while i go and despatch my business if so i will be with you again in exactly thirtyfive minutes stop stop stop youll be sorry all your life if you dont hear my news so rufus hutton thought but mr garnet was sorry through all the rest of his life that he ever stopped to hear it chapter xiii bull garnet forgot his appointment for eight minutes after eleven indeed it was almost twelve oclock when he came out of the summerhouse made of scarletrunners to which he had led dr hutton when he saw that his tale was of interest as he came forth and the noonday sun fell upon his features any one who knew him would have been surprised at their expression a wellknown artist employed upon a fresco in the neighbourhood had once described mr garnets face in its ordinary aspect as violence in repose epigrammatic descriptions of the infinite human nature are like tweezers to catch a whale with the man who unified so rashly all the garnetian impress had only met mr garnet oncehad never seen him after dinner or playing with his children now rufus hutton however garrulous was a kind and sensible man and loth to make any mischief he ran after mr garnet hotly bull garnet had quite forgotten him and would take no notice the doctor made a short cut through a quarter of brussels sprouts which almost knocked off his wideawake hat and stood in the arch of trimmed yewtree opening at the western side upon the forest lane here he stretched his arms to either upright and mightily barred all exit he knew that the other would not go home because he had told him so presently bull garnet strode up not with his usual swing however not with his wonted selfconfidence he seemed to walk off from a staggering blow which had dulled his brain for the moment he stopped politely before mr hutton who expected to be thrust aside and asked as if with new interest and as if he had not heard the tale out are you quite sure dr hutton that you described the dress correctly as sure as i am of the pattern of my own unmentionables miss rosedew wore as i told you a lavender serge looped at the sides with purplea pretty dress for christmas but it struck me as warm for michaelmas perhaps it was meant for the michaelmas daisies or perhaps she suffers from rheumatism or flying pains in the patella and the cloak and hat as you described themare you sure about them my dear sir i could swear to them both if i saw them on a scarecrow how can i speak of such a thing after that lovely creature such an exquisite fall of the shouldersgood wide shoulders tooand such a delicious waist i assure you my dear sir i have seen fine women in india dr hutton said mr garnet sternly let me hear no more of that you are a newlymarried man a man of my time of life i will have no warm description ofof any young ladies rufus hutton was a peppery man and not very easily cowed nevertheless his mind was under the pressure of a stronger one so he only relieved himself with a little brag why mr garnet you crossexamine me as i did the natives when i acted as judge in churramuttee when the two chuprassies came before me and the watercarrier i tell you sir i see more in a glance than most men do in a long set stare when they are called in to appraise a thing i could tell every plait in your shirtfront and the stuff and cut of your coat before you could say good morning it was only last thursday that mrs hutton who is a most remarkable woman made an admirable observation about my rapid perception i have not the smallest doubt of it and i believe that you fully deserved it you will therefore perceive at once that this matter must go no further did you see myson at the house here no only the maidservant who directed me where to find you then you did not go in at all i suppose no but i admired greatly your mode of training that beautiful tropolum over the porch i must go and look at it again with your kind permission i never neglect the chance of a wrinkle such as that another time dr hutton i shall hope to show it to you though you must have seen it all at a glance for it is simpler than my shirtfronts but my business takes me now to the hall and i shall be glad of your company hospitable fellow with a vengeance thought little rufus and i heard he had some wonderful sherry and its past my time for a snack serves me right for meddling with other peoples business but while he stood hesitating and casting fond glances towards the cottage mr garnet without any more ado passed his powerful long arm through the little wing of rufus and hurried him down the dingle excuse me sir but i have never much time to waste this as you know is a most busy day and all the preparations are under my sole charge i laugh at the fuss as a matter of course but that question is not for me cradock nowell is a noble fellow and i have the highest respect for him well i rather prefer young clayton having brought them both into the world i ought to understand them but i hope he wont make a fool of himself in this matter we have been talking of mr garnet jerked his companions arm and his face went pale as portland stone make a dd rogue more likely and he wont be the first of his family yes as you say replied the doctor to all he could catch of the muttered words which flew over the crown of his hat beyond all doubt the first family in this part of the kingdom and so they must have their jubilee but i trust you will use with the utmost caution what i thought it best to confide to you under the bond of secrecy of course i could not think of telling papa either of lady or gentleman and knowing how you stand with the family you seemed to me the proper person to meet this little difficulty beyond a doubt i am pooh sir a boy and a girl i wonder you think so much about it men never know their own minds in the matter until they arrive at our age and as for the chits on the other sidewhew they blow right and left as the feathers on their hats do that is not the case with my family we make up our minds and stick to them then your family is the exception which only proves my rule and i am glad that it is not concerned in the present question when they came to that part of the lawn in front of the ancient hall where the fireworks stage had been reared on a gentlyrising mound cradock nowell met them with a book in his hand tomorrow he would be twentyone and a more honest openhearted fellow or a better built one never arrived at mans estate whether for wealth or poverty he had not begun to think very deeply indeed who could expect it where trouble had never entered it is pain that deepens the channel of thought and sorrow that sweeps the bar away cradock as yet was nothing more than a clever fine young man an elegant and accurate scholar following thought more than leading it nevertheless he had the material of a grand unselfish characterof a nature which when perfected could feel its imperfections sorrow and trial were needed for him and god knows he soon got enough of them he shoved away his tauchnitz herodotus in his shootingcoat pocket neither of the men he met was a scholar neither would feel any interest in it being driven forth by his fathers grumbling at the little pleasure he showed in the fuss that was making about him he had brought his genial true cosmopolite to show him a thing which his heart would have loved cradock had doubled down the leaf whereon was described the building of the boatbridge over the hellespont neither had he forgotten the interment of the scythian kings it was not that he purposed to instruct the carpenters thence or to shed any light on their doings but that he hoped to learn from them some words to jot down on the margin he had discovered already being helped thereto by the tongue of ytene that hundreds of forcible saxon words still lurk in the crafts to which the beaten race betook itselfwords which are wanted sadly and pieced out very unpleasantly by roundabout foreign fanglements even the gratitude now due to the goodwill of all the neighbourhood had failed to reconcile his mind to the turgid part before him at oxford he had been dubbed already caradoc the philosopher and the more he learned the less he thought of his own importance he had never regarded the poor around him as dogs made for him to whistle to he even knew that he owed them some duties and wondered how to discharge them though bred of high tory lineage and corded into it by the twists of habit and education he never could hang by neck and gullet he never could show basement only as a wellroped onion does encased as he was by strict surroundings he never could grow quite straight and even without a seed inside him as a prize cucumber does in the cylinder of an old chimneyglass some of this dereliction sprang no doubt from his granulation and some from the free trade of his mind with the great heart called john rosedew now he came up and smiled like a boy of fourteen in mr garnets face for he liked bull garnets larger qualities and had no fear of his smaller ones mr garnet never liked he always loved or hated he loved cradock nowell heartily and heartily hated clayton behind my time you see cradock i am glad you are doing my dutyha there i see you my man the man was skulking his work in rigging out with coloured lamps an old oak fifty yards off that ancient oak the pride of the chase was to represent tomorrow night a rainbow reflecting cradock nowell young crad who regarded it all as illtaste if it were not positive sin had lifted his voice especially against that oaks bedizenment it will laugh at us from every acorn he had said to his father but sir cradock was now a man of sixty and threescore resents being budded the incision results in gum only at the sound of that tremendous voice the man ran recklessly out on the branch the creaking of which had alarmed him snap went the branch at a cankered part and the poor fellow dropped from a height of nearly forty feet but the crashing wood caught in the bough beneath which was sound and strong and there hung the man uninjured as yet clinging only by one arm and struggling to throw his feet up in a moment cradock had seized a ladder reared and fixed and mounted it and helped the poor fellow to slide off upon it and stayed him there gasping and quivering bull garnet set foot on the lowest rung and rufus hutton added his weight which was not very considerable a dozen workmen came running up and the man whose nerves had quite failed him was carefully eased to the ground mr garnet said cradock with flashing eyes would you have walked on that branch yourself to be sure i would after i had looked at it but you gave this poor man no time to look is it brave to make another do what you yourself would fear give me your hand my boy i was wrong and you are right i wish every man to hear me jem come to my house this evening you owe your life to mr cradock nature itself is better than the knowledge of human nature mr garnet by generosity quicker than quickest perception had turned to his credit an incident which would have disgraced a tyrant a powerful mans confession of wrong always increases his power while the men were falling to work again every one under the stewards eyes sir cradock nowell and clayton his son came cantering up from the stables the dry leaves crackled or skirred away crisply from their horses feet for the day was fine and breezy the nags were arching their necks and pricking their ears with enjoyment but neither of the riders seemed to be in high spirits the workmen touched their hats to them in a manner very different from that with which they received mr garnet or cradock nowell there was more of distant respect in it and less of real interest sir cradock now was a perfect specimen of the wellbred englishman at threescore years of age part of his life had been touched by sorrow but in the main he had prospered a man of ability and high culture who has not suffered deeply is apt after passing middle age to substitute tact for feeling and common sense for sympathy mellow and blest is the age of the man who soberly can do otherwise sir cradock nowell knew his age and dressed himself accordingly neither stiffness nor laxity neither sporting air nor austerity could be perceived in his garb or manner he respected himself and all whom he met until he had cause to the contrary but his heart instead of expanding had narrowed in the loneliness of his life and he really loved only one in the worldthe son who rode beside him he had loved john rosedew well and truly for many an honest year of late admiration was uppermost and love grown a thing to be thought about the cause of the change was his own behaviour and johns thorough hate of injustice that old friend of the family could not keep silence always at the preference of clayton and the disparagement of cradock the father himself could not have told whence arose this preference year by year it had been growing for a long time unsuspected suspected then and fought with then smothered at once and justified allowed at last to spread and thrive on the right of its own existence and yet any one to look at sir cradock would have thought him justice personified and so he was as chairman of the quarter sessions clear intelligence quick analysis keen perception of motive in others combined with power to dispense when nature so does with reason and used with high sense of honourall these things made him an oracle to every one but himself although he had never been in the army he looked like a veteran soldier and his seat on horseback was stiff and firm rather than easy and graceful tall spare figure and grey moustache roman nose and clear bright eyes thin lips and broad white foreheadthe expression of the whole bespoke an active resolute upright man not easily pleased or displeased as every one was to keep holiday the farmers had challenged the ringwood club to play them a game of cricket and few having seen a bat till now some practice seemed indispensable accordingly while bull garnet was busy among the working men the farmers being up for play were at it in hard earnest labouring with much applause and merriment threshing or churning mowing or ploughing and some making kicks at the ball rufus hutton looked on in a spirited manner and cradock was bowling with all his might at the legs of a petty tyrant when his father and brother rode up between the marquees and awnings the tyrannical farmer received a smart crack on the shin and thought though he feared to say dn hurrah crad more jerk to your elbow cried clayton who also disliked the man blackers you mustnt break the ball its against the laws of cricket grinning sympathy and bad wit deepened the bruise of the tibia till farmer blackers forgot all prudence in the deep jar of the marrow boul awai meester and be honged to you i carries one again you mind to the great surprise of all present there sir cradock did not look at the speaker but turned on his son with anger sir you ought to know better your sense of justice will lead you i hope to apologise to that man he did not wait to see the effect of this public reproof which was heard by a hundred people but struck his mare hastily on the shoulder called clayton and rode away cradock who now had the ball in his hands threw it a hundred feet high catch it who will he said i shall bowl no more today farmer blackers i apologise to you i did not know you were so tender feeling far more tender himself for all that was the youths bravado he went away doubting right and wrong to his own little room on the ground floor there he would smoke his pipe and meditate and condemn himself if the verdict were true that young fellows sense of justice was larger softer more deeply fibred than any sir cradock nowells chapter xiv men of high culture and sensitive justice who have much to do with illtaught workmen lie under a terrible disadvantage they fear to presume upon the mere accident of their own position they dread to extract more dues from another than they in his place would render they shrink from saying what may recall the difference betwixt them they cannot bear to be stiff and dogmatic yet they know that any light word may be taken in heavy earnest true sympathy is the only thing to bring master and man together and sympathy is a subtle vein direct when nature hits it but crooked and ungrammatical to the syntax of education cradock nowell often touched it without knowing how and hence his popularity among the lower classes clayton hit upon it only in the softer sex bull garnet knew how to move it deeply and owed his power to that knowledge even more than to his energy cradock was pondering these things in the pipe of contemplation when a pair of keen eyes twinkled in at the window and a shrewd shrill voice made entry pray let me in mr cradock nowell i want to inquire about the grapes what a wonderful man that is said cradock to himself as he came from his corner reluctantly to open the french window there is nothing he doesnt inquire about erotetic philosopher he has only been here some three or four days and he knows all our polity better than we do i wish his wife would come though i believe he is an honest fellow unconscious of any satirical antithesis he opened the window and admitted the polypragmonic doctor and knowing that homopathic treatment is the wisest for garrulous subjects he began upon him at once nor omitted a spice of domesticity which he thought would be sovereign now dr hutton it is too bad of you to wander about like a bachelor how long before we have the pleasure of seeing mrs hutton my dear boy you know the reason i hope you know the reason your roads are very rough for ladies especially when in delicate health and our fourwheel is being mended so i rode over alone and what a lovely ride it is ah claytonyes i saw clayton somewhere but your father has promised most kindly to send a carriage tomorrow to geopharmacy lodgethe name of our little place sir at the thought of his home the little doctor pulled up both his shirtcollars and looked round the room disparagingly oh i am very glad to hear it meanwhile you would like to see our grapes let me show you the way to the vinery though i cannot take you without misgivings your gardening fame has frightened us our old man snip is quite afraid of your new lights and experience sensible lad muttered rufus hutton who was pleasantly conceiteduncommonly sensible lad i am not at all sure that he isnt a finer fellow than clayton but i must take my opportunity now while he has his stock off there is something wrong i am sure of it excuse me a moment said cradock i am sorry to keep you waiting but i must just put on my neckerchief if i can only find it how very odd i could have declared i put it on that table whats that i see on the floor there by the corner of the bookcase rufus pointed his cane at the tie which lay where himself had thrown it oh thank you i must be getting blind for i am sure i looked there just now while the young man stooped forward the little doctor who had posted himself for the purpose secured a quick glimpse at the back of his neck where the curling hair fell sideways that glance increased his surprise and confirmed his strange suspicions the surprise and suspicion had broken upon him as he stood by the farmers wicket and cradock sprang up to the bowling crease now in his excitement and curiosity he forgot all scruples it was strange that he had felt any for he was not very sensitive but cradock with all his good nature had a certain unconscious dignity from which dr hutton retreated the grapes i came to inquire about said rufus with much solemnity are not those in the vinery which i have seen often enough but those on your neck mr nowell cradock looked rather amazed but more at the inquirers manner than at his seeming impertinence i really cannot see how the grapes as some people call the blue lines on my neck can interest you sir or are important enough to be spoken of then i do cradock nowell do you refuse to let me see them certainly not though i should refuse it to almost any one else not that i am sensitive about such a trifle you as a medical man and an old friend of my father are welcome to your autopsy is not that what you call it sir nevertheless from the tone of his voice rufus hutton knew that he liked it notfor it was a familiarity and seemed to the youth a childish one sit down young man sit down said the doctor very pompously and waiving further discussion i am noti mean to say you are taller than when i firstah yes manipulated you as the doctor warmed to his subject he grew more and more professional and perhaps less gentlemanly until his good feelings came into play for his heart after all was right all the terms which he used shall not be repeated because of their being so medical only this that he said at last after a long inspection sir this confirms to a nicety my metrostigmatic theory dr hutton i know not what you mean neither do i wish to know cradock put on his neckerchief anyhow and walked to his chair by the mantelpiece although no fire was burning the medical man said nothing but gravely looked out of the window presently the young gentleman felt that he was not acting hospitably excuse me sir if i have seemed rude but you do not know how these thingsi mean when i think of my mother let me ring for some sherry and sandwiches you have had no lunch ring for some brandy my boy and give me a cheroot fine property look at the sweep of the landand to think of losing it all instead of ringing cradock went and fetched the cognac himself and took down a glass from a cupboard two glasses my dear boy two no sir i never touch it then take it now for the first time here let me feel your pulse once for all i beg you to tell me what is all this mystery do you think i am a child fill your pipe again while i light a cigar cradock did as he was told although with trembling hands rufus hutton went for a wineglass filled it with brandy and pushed it across then gulped down half a tumblerful but cradock did not taste his now my boy can you bear some very bad news indeed anything better than this suspense i have heard some bad news lately which has seasoned me for anything he referred to amy rosedew it is this you are not your fathers heir you are only the younger son is that all all isnt that enough good god what more would you haveyou dont deserve brandy my father will be glad and so will clayton andperhaps one other but i dont mean to say that i am i should rather fancy not but you take it most philosophically dr hutton gazed at the poor young fellow in surprise and admiration trying vainly to make him out then he reached over to cradocks elbow took his glass of cognac and swallowed it this has upset me my boy more than you how miserable i felt about it but perhaps you place no faith in the assertion i have made indeed it has quite amazed me and i have had no time to think of it my head seems spinning round please to say no more just for a minute or two unless you find it uncomfortable he leaned back in his chair and tried to think but could not rufus hutton said nothing in spite of all his experience the scene was very strange to him and he watched it out with interest which deepened into strong feeling now dr hutton said the youth trying to look as he thought he ought though he could not keep the tears back i beg you to think of me no more let us have the strictest justice i have not known you so longso long as you have known mebut i feel that you would not say what you have said without the strongest evidence confound me for a meddlesome fool my dear boy no one has heard us let us sink the matter entirely least said soonest mended what do you mean do you think for a moment that i would be a blackguard hushdont get so excited why you look as fierce as bull garnet all i mean isyou know the old sayingquieta non movere the motto of fools and dastards have it out is an englishmans rule no sneaking tricks for me sir oh what a fool i am i beg your pardon with all my heart you will make allowances for me instead of being rude i ought to be grateful for kindness which even involves your honour and he held out his hand to the doctor crad my dear boy exclaimed mr hutton with a big tear twinkling in each little eye the finest thing i ever did was showing you to the daylight if i rob you of what has appeared your birthright curse all memorandumbooks and even my metrostigmatic treatise which i fully meant to immortalize me and so i hope it may do i am not so calm as i ought to be somehow a fellow cant be when he is taken off the hooks so i know you will allow for this i beg you to allow for nothing else except a gentlemans delicacy give me your reasons or not as you like the matter will be for my father cradock looked proud and beautiful but the depth of his eyes was troubled a thousand thoughts were moving there like the springs that feed a lake hah ho very hard work said rufus hutton puffing i vote that we adjourn i do love the open air so ever since i took to gardening rufus hutton hated sentiment but he could not always get rid of it chapter xv on the morning of that same day our amy at her fathers side in the pretty porch of the rectory uttered the following wisdom darling papples papelikidionis there any other diminutivicle half good enough for you or stupid enough for memy own father thats best of all you must not ride corbus today amy amata peramata a me aim of my life amicula in the name of sweet sense why not because pa he has had ten great long carrots and my best hat full of new oats and i know he will throw you off scrupulum injecisti i shouldnt like to come off today and it rained the night before last so said the rector proudly contemplating a pair of new kerseymeres which channing the clerk had made upon trial nevertheless i think that i have read enough on the subject to hold on by his mane if he does not kick unreasonably and if he gives me time to soothe himthat horse is fond of greekand after all the ground is soft no dad i dont think it is prudent and you wont have me there you know my own pet that is too true and with all your knowledge of riding why my own seems quite theoretical by the side of yours and yet i have kept my seat under very trying circumstances you remember the time when corbus met the trahea yes pa but he hadnt had any oats and i was there to advise you true my child quite true but i threw my equilibrium just as a hunter does and i think i could do it again i bore in mind what xenophon says pa here he is and he does look so fat i know he will be restive prepare your aunt doxys mind my dear not to scold more than she can help in case of the worsti mean if the legs of my trousers want rubbing how rash of me to be sure to have put them on today prius dementat i trust sincerelyand old channing is so proud of them and he says the cut is so fashionable nevertheless i heard our clayton as he went down the gravelwalk treating with what he himself would have called colores orationis upon uncle johns new bags i suppose he meant as opposed to i was glad that the subject possessed so lively an interest for him notwithstanding which i was very glad mr channing did not hear him the impudence well i am astonished and to see the things he brought back from oxfordquincecoloured with a stripe that wide like one of my fancy gourds ill be sure to have it out with him no i cant though i forgot and amy looked down with a rosy smile remembering the delicacy of the subject but i am quite sure of one thing pa mr cradock would never have done it rbus dont kick up the gravel do you suppose we can roll every day oh you are so fat you darling when the sides are deep said the rector quoting from xenophon and somewhat protuberant at the stomach the horse is generally more easy to ride what a comfort amy stronger moreover and more capable of enjoying food he has enjoyed a rare lot this morning at least i hope you have you sweetest why pa i declare you are whistling it also behoves a horseman to know that it is a timehonoured precept to soothe the steed by whistling and rouse him by a sharp sound made between the tongue and the palate oh father dont do that promise me now dear wont you i will promise you my child because i dont know how to do it i tried very hard last wednesday and only produced a guttural but i think i shall understand it after six or seven visiting days at least if the air is sharp no pa i hope you wont it would be so reckless of you and i know you will get a sore throat sweet of my world cor cordium you have wrapped me with three involucres tighter than any hazelnut they will all go into my pocket the moment i am round the corner no daddy you wont be so cruel and after the rime this morning rbus will tell if you do wont you now my pretty corbus was a handsome pony but not a handsome doer he could go at a rare pace when he liked but he did not often like it his wind was short and so was his temper and he looked at things unpleasantly perhaps he had been disappointed in love in the tenderness of his youth nevertheless he had many good points and next to himself loved amy he would roll his black eyes put his nose to her lips and almost leave oats to look at her his colour varied sensitively according to the season in the height of summer a dappled bay towards the autumnal equinox a tendency to nuttiness then a husky bristle of deepest brown flaked with hairs of ginger after the clips a fine mousecolour with a spirited sense of nakedness fierce whiskers and a love of buck jumps then ere the blessed christmastide nature began to blanket him with a nap the colour of black frost and so through the grizzle of spring he came round to his proper bay once more amy declared she could tell every month by the special hue of corbus but albeit she was the most truthful of girls her heart was many degrees too warm for her lips to be always at dewpoint both in the stable and out of it that pony had a bluff way with his heels which none but himself thought humorous he never meant any harm howeverit was only his mode of expressing himself and he liked to make a point when he felt his new shoes tingling but as for kicking his amy he was not quite so low as that he would not even jump about when she was on his back more than was just the proper thing to display her skill and figure oh you sad corby always brought him to sadness and he expected a pat from her little gloved hand and cocked his tail with dignity the moment he received it nevertheless for her father the rector of the parish he entertained when the oats were plentiful nonconformist sentiments verging almost upon scepticism he liked him indeed as the whole world must he even admired his learning and turned up his eyes at the greek but he was not impressed as he should have been by the sacerdotal office fatal defect of all he knew that the rector could not ride john rosedew was a reasoning man and uncommonly strong in the legs but a great deal too philosophical to fit himself over a horse well he had written a treatise upon the pelethronian lapiths which he could never be brought to read before a learned society he knew all about the olympics and pythics and xenophon gave him a textbook but for all that he never put his feet the right way into the stirrups look at him now said john as the boy led the pony up and down while amy was knotting the mufflers so that they never might come undone again how beautifully xenophon describes him when the horse is excited to assume that artificial air which he adopts when he is proud he then delights in riding becomes magnificent terrific and attracts attention and again persons beholding such a horse pronounce him generous free in his motions fit for military exercise highmettled haughty and both pleasant and terrible to look on pleasant i suppose for other people and terrible for the rider but why our author insists so much upon the horse being taught to rear gracefully i am not horseman enough as yet to understand it has always appeared to me that corbus rears too much already and then the directionbut if after riding and copious perspiration and when he has reared gracefully he be relieved immediately both of the rider and reins there is little doubt that he will spontaneously advance to rear when necessary what does that mean i ask you i never find it necessary except indeed when the little girls jump up and pull my coattails in their inquisition for apples and then i am always afraid that they may suffer some detriment but let us not overtask his patience here he comes again jem my boy lead him up to the chair any jam in your pocket father no my child not any your excellent aunt eudoxia has it all under lock and key now i will mount according to xenophon though i do not find that he anywhere prescribes a windsor chair when he has well prepared himself for the ascent let him support his body with his left hand and stretching forth his right hand let him leap on horseback and when he mounts thus he will not present an uncomely spectacle to those behind there i am up most accurately excellent horse and great writer and now for the next direction we do not approve of the same bearing a man has in a carriage but that an upright posture be observed with the legs apart how could they be otherwise pa when the horse is between them your criticisms are rash my child jem how dare you laugh sir i will buy a pair of spurs i declare the next time i go to ringwood goodbye darling aunt doxy will take you up to the park when the sun comes out to see all the wonderful doings i shall be home in time to dress for the dinner at the hall sweet amy kissed her hand and curtseyedas she loved to do to her father and after two or three wayward sallies repressed by jem with the gardening broom corbus pricked his little ears and shook himself into a fair jogtrot so with his elbows well stuck out and shaking merrily to and fro his right hand ready to grasp the pommel in case of consternation and one leg projected beyond the other after the manner of a fowls sidebone away rode john rosedew in excellent spirits to begin his wednesday parochial tour being duly victualled and thoroughly found for a voyage of long duration and considerable hazard the good ship john rosedew set sail every wednesday for commerce with the neighbourhood this expedition was partly social partly ministerial in a great measure eleemosynary and entirely loving and amicable there was no bombardment of dissenters no firing of redhot shot at papists no up with the helm and run him down if any man launched on the mare magnum or any frail vessel missed stays and yet there was no compromise no grand circle sailing no luffing to a tradewind straight was the course and the chart most clear and the good ship bound with favour of god for a haven beyond the horizon barnacles and vile teredoes alg and desmidious trailersi doubt if there be more sins in our hearts to stop us from loving each other than parasites and leeching weeds to clog a stout ships bottom nevertheless she bears them on beautifies and cleanses them until they come to temperate waters where the harm has failed them so a good man carries with him those who carp and fasten on him content to take their little stings if the utterance purify them the parish of nowelhurst straggles away far into the depths of the forest to the southward indeed it has moorland and heather with ridges and spinneys and views of the sea and firtrees naked and worn to the deal by the chafing of the salt winds but all away to the west north and east the dark woods hold dominion and you seem to step from the parish churchyard into the grave of ages the village and the village warren the chase and the hall above them are scooped from out the forest shadow in the shape of a hunting boot lay the boot on its side with the heel to the east and the top towards the north and we get pretty near the topography the village scattered along the warren forms the foot and instep the chase descending at right angles is the leg and ankle the top will serve to represent the house with its lawns and gardens the back seam may run as the little river which flows under nowelhurst bridge the shank of the spur is the bridge and road the rowel the church and rectory away to the west beyond the toe some quarter of a mile on the ringwoodroad stands the smithy kept by the wellknown roger sweetland who can outswear any man in the parish and fears no one except bull garnet our sketchy boot will leave unshown the whereabouts of the garnet cottage unless we suppose the huntsman to insert just his toe in the stirrup then the top of the iron rung will mark the house of the steward a furlong or so northwest of the village with its back to the lane which leads from the smithy to the hall and this lane is the short cut from nowelhurst hall to ringwood it saves threequarters of a mile and risks a little more than threequarters of the neck large and important as the house is it has no high road to ringwood and gets away with some difficulty even towards lyndhurst or lymington bull garnet was always down upon the barbarity of the approaches but sir cradock never felt sore on the subject save perhaps for a week at christmastide he had never been given to broad indiscriminate hospitality but loved his books and his easychair and his friend of ancient standing the sun came out and touched the trees with every kind of gilding as john rosedew having done the village and learned every gammers alloverishness and every gaffers rheumatics drew the snaffle upon corbus longside of job smiths pigsty and plunged southward into the country he saw how every tree was leaning forth its green with yellowness even proud of the novelty like a child who has lost his grandmother and though he could not see very far he observed a little thing which he had never noticed before it was that while the other trees took their autumn evenly the elm was brushed with a flaw of gold while the rest of the tree was verdure a single branch would stand forth from the others mellow against their freshness like a harvestsheaf set up perhaps on the foreground of a grassplot the rector thought immediately of the golden spray of neas and how the brazilian manga glistens in the tropic moonlight then soothing his pony with novel sounds emulous of equestrianism he struck into a moorland track leading to distant cottages thence he would bear to the eastward arrive at his hostel by one oclock visit the woodmen and home through the forest with the evening shadows falling chapter xvi beside the embowered stream that forms the eastern verge of the chase young cradock nowell sat and gazed every now and then into the water through a break in the trees beyond it he could see one chimneytop and a streak of the thatch of the rectory in vain he hoped that dr hutton would leave him to himself for he did not wish to go into the proofs but to meditate on the consequences some bitterness no doubt there was in the corner of his heart when he thought of all that clayton now had to offer amy rosedew he had lately been told as a mighty secret something which grieved and angered him and the more that he must not speak of it as his straightforward nature urged him the secret was that innocent amy met his brother clayton more than once in the dusk of the forest and met him by appointment it grieved poor cradock because he loved amy with all his unchangeable heart it angered him because he thought it very mean of clayton to take advantage of one so young and ignorant of the world but never until the present moment as he looked at the homely thatch in the distance and the thin smoke curling over it had it occurred to his honest mind that his brother might not be like himselfthat clayton might mean ill by the maiden and now for the moment it seemed more likely as he glanced back at the lordly house commanding the country for miles around and all that country its fief and its thrall and now the whole destined for clayton he thought of the meanness about the ireland and two or three other little things proofs of a little nature then he gazed at the rectory thatch again and the smoke from the kitchen chimney and seemed to see pure playful amy making something nice for her father good god i would shoot him if he did or strike him dead into this water in the hot haste of youth he had spoken aloud with his fist gathered up and his eyes flashing fire rufus hutton saw and heard him and thought of it many times after that day oh you are thinking of caldo because he snapped at me there are no signs of hydrophobia you must not think of shooting him i was not thinking of caldo i hope i did not mean it god knows i am very wicked so we are all my boy i should like to see a fellow that wasnt id pay fifty pounds for his body and dissect him into an angel cradock nowell smiled a little at such a reward for excellence and then renewed his gaze of dreary bewilderment at the water now let me show you my tracings cradock three times i have pulled them out and you wont condescend to glance at them you have made up your mind to abdicate upon my ipse dixi now look at the bend sinister that is yours the bend dexter is for the elder brother dr hutton it may be and is i believe false shame on my part but i wish to hear nothing about it perhaps if my mother were living i might not have been so particular but giving as she did her life for mine i cannot regard it medically the question is now for my father i will not enter into it oh the subjectiveness of the age said rufus hutton rising then walking to and fro on the bank as he held discourse with himself here is a youth who ought to be proud although at the cost of his inheritance of illustrating in the most remarkable manner indeed i may say of originating my metrostigmatic theory he carries upon the cervical column a clear impression of grapes and they say that before the show at romsey the gardener was very cross indeed about his choice black hamburgs his brother carries the identical impress only with the direction inverteddexter in fact and dexter was the mark of the elder son this i can prove by the tracing made at the time not with any view to future identification but from the interest i felt at an early stage of my experience in a question then under controversy if i prove this what happens why that he loses everythingthe importance the house the lands the title and becomes the laughingstock of the county as the sham sir cradock what ought he to do at once then why perhaps to toss me into that hole where i should never get out again by gad i am rash to trust myself with him and no other soul in the secret here dr hutton shuddered to think how little water it would take to drown him and the river so dark and so taciturn at any rate he ought to fall upon me with forceps and probe and scalpel and tear my evidence to atoms for after all what is it without corroboration but instead of that he only says dr hutton no more of this if you please no more of this the question is now for my father and he must know well enough to which side his father will lean in the inquiry confound the boy if he had only coaxed me with those great eyes i would have kept it all snug till doomsday oh what will my rosa say to me she has always loved this boy and admired him so immensely perhaps it was his pretty young wifes high approval of cradock which first had made the testy rufus a partisan of clayton the cause of his having settled at geopharmacy lodge was that upon his return from india he fell in love with a hampshire maiden whom he met above bar at southampton how he contrived to get introduced to her he alone can tell but he was a most persevering fellow and little hampered with diffidence she proved to be the eldest daughter of sir cradocks largest tenant a man of good standing and education who lived near fordingbridge as rufus had brought home tidy pickings from his appointment in india the only thing he had to do was to secure the ladys heart and this he was not long about for many ladies like high colour even more than hairiness first she laughed at his dancing ways incessant mobility and sharp eyes but very soon she began to like him and now she thought him a wonderful man this opinion with proper change of gender was heartily reciprocated and the result was that a happier couple never yet made fools of themselves in the judgment of the world never yet enjoyed themselves in the sterling wisdom of home they suited each other admirably in their very differences they laughed at each other and themselves and any one else who laughed at them well i shall be off said dr hutton at last in feigned disgust you will stare at the water all day mr cradock and take no notice of me i beg your pardon i forgot myself i did not mean to be rude i assure you i know you did not i know you would never be rude to any one goodbye i have business on hand you will be back dr hutton when my father returns from his ride it is very foolish of me but i cannot bear this suspense trust me i will see to it but he will not be back they tell me till nearly four oclock oh what a time to wait dont send for me if you can help it but if he wants me i will come goodbye my lad keep your pecker up there are hundreds of men in the world with harder lines than yours i should rather think so i only wish there were not cradock attempted a lively smile and executed a pleasant one as rufus hutton shook his hand and set off upon his business and his business was to ride at once as far as the jolly foresters that lonely inn on the beaulieuroad at the eastern end of the parish whereat john rosedew baited corbus at the turn of the pastoral tour the little doctor knew well enough though he seldom passed that way how the smart miss penny of former days mrs ogaghans assistant was now the important mrs george cripps hostess of the jolly foresters where the four roads met meanwhile the scaffolds went on merrily under mr garnets care and so did the awnings marquees c and the terraces for the ladies the lamps in the old oak being fixed the boughs were manned like a frigates yards with dexterous fellows hoisting flags devices and transparencies all prepared to express in fire the mighty name of cradock all the men must finish that night lest any one lose his legitimate chance of being ancestrally drunk on the morrow cradock nowell wandering about could not bear to go near them those two hours seemed longer to him than any year of his previous life he went and told caldo all about it and that helped him on a little caldo was a noble setter pure of breed and high of soul and heavily feathered on legs and tail his colour was such a lily white that you grieved for him on a wet fallow and the bright red spots he was endowed with were like the cheeks of helen delicate carmine enriched with scarlet mapped his back with islands and the pink of his cheeks where the whiskers grew made all the young ladies kiss him his nostrils were black as a doublelined tunnel leading into a pencilmine and his gums were starred with violet and his teeth as white as new mushrooms in all the county of hants there was no dog to compare with him for he came of a glorious strain made perfect at kingston in berkshire lift but a finger and down he went in the height of his hottest excitement wave the finger and off he dashed his great eyes looking back for repression for style of ranging all dogs were rats to him anywhere in the new forest so freely he went so buoyant so careful and yet all the while so hilarious only one fault he had and i never knew dog without one he was jealous to the backbone cradock was dreadfully proud of him anything else he had in the world he would have given to clayton but he could not quite give caldo even though clayton had begged instead of backing his wena against him wena was a very nice creature anxious to please and elegant but of a different order entirely from the highminded caldo dogs differ as widely as we do who shall blame either of us cradock now leaned over caldo with the hot tears in his eyes and gently titillating the sensitive part of his ears and looking straight into his heart begged to inform him of the trouble they were both involved in have they taken the shooting from us was caldos first inquiry and his eyes felt rather sore in his head that he should have to ask the question no my boy they havent but we must not go shooting any more until the whole matter is settled i hate putting off things till tomorrow caldo replied impatiently the cockpheasants come almost up to my kennel what the deuce is to come of it caldo please to be frigido you shall come to my room byandby i shall be able then to smoke a pipe and we will talk about it together you know that i have never cared about the title and all that stuff i know that well enough said caldo nevertheless i do it gives me a status as a dog which i thoroughly appreciate am i to come down from goodly paunches to liver and lights and horses heads and hounds food i dont think i could stand it but i would live on a crust a day if you would only come and live with me and he nuzzled up to his master in a way that made his tears come cradock was sent for suddenly old hogstaff trotted across the yard wherein he seldom ventured to say that sir cradock nowell wished to see his son cradock following hastily with all his heart in his mouth wondered at the pennywort the wallrue and the snapdragons which he had never seen before hogstaff tottered along before him picking uneasily over the stones bobbing his chin and muttering sir cradock sat in the long heavy room known as the justicehall where he and his brother magistrates held oyer of many a culprit the great oak table was dabbed with ink and the grey walls with mopshaped blotches where sullen prisoners had thrown their heads back and refused to answer at the lower end was rufus hutton jerky dogmatical keenly important while the old man sat at the head of the table with his back to the pointed window and looked perhaps from local usage more like a magistrate than a father straight up the long room cradock walked as calmly as if he were going to see where his quoit was stuck then he made salutation to his father as his custom was for many bygone fashions were retained in the ancient family sir cradock was proud of his sons selfcommand and dignified manly carriage and if dr hutton had not been there he would have arisen to comfort him as it was he only said with a faint and doubtful smile so sir i find that after all you are but an impostor young cradock was a proud manman from that day forth i shall call him lad no longeray a prouder man pile upon pile than the father who once had spoiled him but his pride was of the right sortselfrespect not selfesteem so he did not appeal by word or look to the sympathy lurking and no doubt working in the pith of his fathers heart but answered calmly and coldly though his soul was hot with sorrow sir i believe it is so his eyes were on his fathers he longed to look him down and felt the power to do it but dropped them as should a good son although the whitehaired man was glad at the promotion of his favourite his heart was yearning towards the child more worthy to succeed him but his notions of filial dutywhich himself had been called upon to practise chiefly in memory having seen very little of his father and having lost him earlywere of the stern cold order now the buckle and buckram style though much relaxed at intervals in master claytons favour finding no compunction no humility in his sons look for a mistake which was wholly of others and receiving no expression of grief at the loss of heirship sir cradock hardened back again into his proper dignity and resumed his air of inquiry i wish john rosedew were here he thought and then it repented him of the wish for he knew how stubborn the parson was and how he would have craddy the foremost rufus hutton all this time was in the agony of holding his tongue he tried to think of his rosa and so to abstract himself airily from the present scene he had ridden over to see her yesterday and now dwelt upon their doings rosa was to come tomorrow and he would go to fetch his wife in a carriage that would amaze her then he met cradock nowells eyes and wondered what he was thinking of now sir cradock nowell this wont do at all how long are we to play fast and loose with a finer fellow than either of us oh that hotheaded rufus what mischief he did then although i have not the honour sir of being in the commission of peace for this little county i have taken magisterial duty in a district rather larger than ireland thrown into great britain and i can grow per acre thrice the amount of corn that any of your farmers can his colour deepened with selfassertion like the central quills of a dahlia we must have you to teach us dr hutton it is a thing to be thought about but at present you are kindly interested inin giving your evidence even then if dr hutton with all his practised acumen had mixed one grain of the knowledge of men he might have done what he liked with sir cradock and reestablished the dynasty unless indeed young cradock were bent upon going through with everything but the only mode rufus hutton knew of meeting the world was antagonism yes sir you may think nothing of it but i have hunted a thing for three hundred leagues and got at it through the biggest liars that ever stole a white mans galligaskins thank you dr hutton said cradock diverting the contest is the word you mean and i fear it applies to me also perhaps young man cried rufus hutton you know more hindustani than i do translate and he poured out a sentence which i dare not try to write down but my good fellow you forget it is we who are stealing yours i think said sir cradock slowly and seriously displeasedgood heavens to joke about the succession to the nowelhurst title and landsi think sir this can hardly be looked upon as evidence i always cut short the depositions sir as chairman of the quarter sessions i always cut short the depositions and so you wish to cut short sir the deposition of your son rufus laughed at his own bad joke and expected the others to laugh with him it made things worse than ever sir cradock was afraid to speak lest he might say anything unseemly to a visitor the young man saw his opportunity and took advantage of it father i beg you to let me go you would not wish me i am sure to be here only you think it my right to be if you please i will waive that right i can wholly trust your decision he bowed to his father with cold respect being hurt at his rapid conviction to rufus hutton with some contempt and a smile at the situation then he marched down the long room placidly and whistled when he was out of it the next moment he bolted away to his bedroom and wept there very heavily glorious fellow cried dr hutton but we dont at all appreciate him requires a man of mind to do that and now for mrs ogaghan leaving sir cradock this speech to digest he arose and rang the bell sharply he felt himself fully invested now with supreme judicial authority and he longed to be at the irishwoman who had called him a red gossoon chapter xvii biddy ogaghan was hard at work boiling down herbs and blessing them drying and bottling cleverly scraping and picking the cloves out she had turned the stillroom of the house into her private laboratory and she saved all the parish and half of the hundred from them pisoners as called theirselves doctors now she was one of those powerful womencommon enough bythebywho can work all the better for talking and between her sniffs at the saucepanlids and her tests upon the dryingpans she had learned that something strange was up and had made fifty guesses about it blowing the scum and the pearly beads from a pot of pellitory of the wall one of her staunch panaceas she received a command most peremptory to present herself in the justiceroom thin was that the way as they said it dick no sinse nor manners but that an every bit of the blessed while they knowed it for my bilinday muckstraw thin is bridget ogaghan no more count than a pisonin doctor hould that handle there dick if iver you stirs it the bridth of one on your carroty whiskers from that smut on the firebar till such time as you sees me agin ill down with it arl in your crooked back bilin and your chilthers shall disinherit it leaving dick rooted in trepidation for she was now considered a witch she hurried into her little bedroom for she had the strongest sense of propriety and would not make herself common then she dashed her apron aside and softened the fireglow from her nose and smoothed the creases of her jetblack hair which curled in bars like crochetwork this last she did with some lubricous staple of her own discovery applying it with the ball of her thumb the hairs of me head as she always called them were thick of number and strong of fibre and went zigzag on their road to her ears like a string of jockeys horses shying or a flight of jacksnipes then a final glance at her fungous lookingglass just to know if she were all right the glass gave her back a fine warmhearted face still young in its rapid expression irish in every line of it glazed with lies for hatred and beaming with truth for love so biddy gave two or three nods thereat and knew herself match for fifty crossexaminers if she could only keep her temper as she marched up to the table with her head thrown back her portly shape made the most of and the front of her strong arms glistening then dropped a crisp curtsey to sir cradock without deigning to notice his visitor the little doctors experience told him that he had caught a thorough tartar all his solemn preparations were thrown away upon her though the biggest testament in the house lay on the table before him and a most impressive desk was covered with pens and paper and sealingwax dr hutton would not yet open his mouth because he wished to begin augustly meanwhile sir cradock kept waiting for him till biddy could wait no longer turning her broad back full upon rufus who appreciated the compliment she made another short scrape to her master and asked with an ogle suppressed to a mince and what wud your honour be pleased to want with the poor widow bridget ogaghan then bridget that gentleman dr hutton has made an extremely important discovery affecting most nearly my honour and that of the family and now i rely upon you bridget as a faithful and valued dependent of ours to answer without reservation or attempt at equivocation all the questions he may put to you quistions your honour and biddy looked stupid in the cleverest way imaginable yes questions bridget ogaghan inquiries interrogationsah that quite explains what i mean is it axing any harm thin any ondacency of a poor lone widder woman your honour wud be afther she took to her brogue as a tower of refuge bilingual races are up to the tactics of rats with a double hole sir cradock nowell said rufus from the bottom of his chest you i believe are a magistrate for this county of hants vicelieutenant colonel of yeomanry the representative of the sovereign i call upon you now in all these capacities to administer the oath to this prevaricating woman the penultimate word rather terrified bridget for she never had heard it before but the last word of all reassured her she turned round suddenly on little rufus who had jumped from his chair in excitement and standing by head and shoulders above him she opened her great eyes down upon him like the portholes of a frigate faix thin and i niver seen this young man at all at all its between the airms of the cheer he were and me niver to look so low for him tis the black measles as heve tuk and ive seen as bad a case brought through with the luck o the blessed saints in glory ive been bilin up for the same if its narse him i can to the toorn of it im intirely at your sairvice sir craduck i likes to narse a base little chap sin theres no call to fear for his beauty this last was uttered gently and quite as a private reflection but it told more than all the rest for ever since dr hutton had married a woman half his age he had grown exceedingly sensitive as to his personal appearance by a very great effort he kept silent but his face was almost black with wrath as he handed the great book to sir cradock the magistrate presented it very solemnly to bridget who took it as patly as if it had been a flat iron a score of times she had sworn according to what was thought good for her years ago in ireland at the right moment of dictation she gave the book a loud smack that required good binding to stand it and then crossed herself very devoutly to take the taste away of a heretic oath she had little fear though she would not have told a big lie to her priest then she dropped her eyes and chastened her aspect as if overcome by the sense of solemn responsibility bridget ogeoghegan began the worthy doctor emphasising slowly every syllable of her name and prepared to write down her replies you are now upon your solemn oath to declare the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and if you fail in this remember you will place your precious soul in the power of the evil one amin to that same thin and more power to yer bridget do you remember the night when your masters children were born sure an i do thin unless it wur the mornin how wud i help remimber it and do you remember the medical gentleman who was suddenly called in and if i wur ten times on my oath i dont remimber no gintleman a bit of a redhaired gossoon there was as wor on the way to be transported do you remember his name remimber it let me see thin it wor hardly worth the throuble of forgittin button or mutton no faix i blieve it wor rubus rotten well never mind his name my faith and i niver did thin nor the little spalpin ayther but to my heart i was sorry for the dear good beautiful ladyglory be to her sowlalong o that ignorant carroty sprawlin bigknuckled omadhawn small chance for her to git over it silence woman how dare you said sir cradock very angrily and i thought it was arl the truth as yer honour said i was to tell here biddy looked hurt and amazed have the little clerk got it all in black and white with a sigh for his incapacity she peered over the desk at his paper now mrs ogaghan no trifling her master spoke sternly and sharply but rufus could not speak at all he was in such a choking passion if so be i have said any harm sir for the best of us is errowneous i axes a humble pardon iver since i lose my good husbandand a better husband there cudnt be barrin only the bellises and i wudnt deny upon my oath but what i desarved the spout now and thin mrs ogaghan said dr hutton trying very hard to look amiable do your best for once i entreat you to prove yourself if there is such a thing a respectable irishwoman from that moment the tables were turned her temper boiled up like a cauldron it is quite of a piece with a thing that is all piecesthe genuine irish naturethat proud as they are of their country they cannot bear to be told of their citizenship irish thin is it irish indade well and i knows im irish and if i aint what do i care who knows i am she flung up her head superbly and great tears ran from her eyes rufus hutton perceived his advantage and though not at all a mean fellow he was smarting far too sharply from the many attacks on his vanity to forego his sweet revenge you remember then when the doctor gave you the firstborn child that he made some odd remark and told you to keep it separate and how can a poor irishwoman remimber anything at all come you know very well that you remember that now can you deny it is it likely youll catch me deny anything as is a lie then irish or not as you plases her bosom still was heaving with the groundswell of her injury well now for the honour of old ireland tell us the truth for once what were the words he said save me if evir a bit of me can tell mayhap i might call to mind if i heerd them words agin were they not theseleft to right over the shoulder and a strapping boy he is bedad thin and they might have been i want to know what they were how can i tell what they were i only know what they was well and what was that thim very same words as youve said she turned towards the door with a sullen air while he looked at sir cradock in triumph nevertheless he still wanted her evidence as to the subsequent mistake he had been as i said to the jolly foresters and seen the miss penny of old who now as the mother of nine or ten children was kindly communicative upon all questions of infancy so then mrs ogaghan with the best intentions in the world you marked the elder child with a rosette as i saw on the following day thrue for you as the gospel and what more wud you have me do nothing only take a needle and thread to it instead of crimping it into the cap poor biddy started from where she stood and pressed one hand to her heart its the divil himself she muttered as turns me inside out so and sure that same is the reason he does be so black red then aloud with a final rally and who say they iver see me take a needle and thread and if i did what odds to them no that was the very thing you omitted to do until it was too late but when you sent to mrs toaster for her large butterscales what was it you put on each side what was it no lining at all fair play for the both of them as i hope to be weighed in purgatory sir cradock was looking on all this while with the deepest amazement and interest he had not received any hint beforehand of this confirmative evidence and pray what was the reason that you wanted to weigh them at all you know that it is considered unlucky among nurses to weigh infants why else wud i weigh them except to see which wur the heaviest and pray bridget which was the heavier asked sir cradock almost smiling mr cradock as is now your honour id swear it on my dying bed did you think then id iver wrong him the innocents as they was and did you weigh them with rosettes on rufus hutton had not finished yet how cud i and only one got it oh then you had fastened it on again do you think they was born with ribbons on this was poor biddys last repartee she lost heart and told everything afterwards how she had heard that there was some difference in the marks of the infants though what it was she knew not justly having like most irishwomen the clearest perception that right and left are only relative terms and come wrong in the lookingglass as they do in heraldry how when she found the rosette adrift she had done the very best she could according to her lights to work evenhanded justice and up to this very day believed that the heft of the scales was the true one then she fell to acrying bitterly that her darling crad should be ousted and then she laughed as heartily that her dear boy clayton was in for it with timid glances at mrs ogaghan like a boys at his schoolmaster jane cripps came in and told all she knew saying please sir at every sentence she had seen at the time dr huttons sketch which was made without biddys knowledge because she never would have allowed it on account of the bad luck to follow and mrs cripps was very clever now everything was known she had felt all along that things went queerly on the third day after the babes were born she had made up her mind to speak at the time only mrs ogaghan was suchexcuse hersuch a disciplinarian thatthatand then lady nowell died and everything was at sixes and sevens and no one cried more violent let them say what they like about it than she jane penny as had been if sir cradock thought further evidence needful there was mrs bowyer a most respectable woman who washed thirty shilling a week mrs cripps first cousin and comate who had heard at the time all about the drawing and had not been easy about the scales and had dreamed of it many times afterwards as indeed her aunt betsy know and her husband was no man or he never would have said to her by this time the shadows came over the room and the trees outside were rustling and you could see them against the amber sunset like a childs scrawling on his hornbook volunteers throughout the household longed to give their evidence their selfrespect for a week would be hostile if it were not accepted but sir cradock kept the door fastened till mrs ogaghan slipped out and put all the wenches down the steps backwards mrs toaster alone she durst not touch but mrs toaster will never forgive her and never believe the case tried on its merits because she was not summoned to depose to the loan of the scales ha so it is in our country and among the niggers also when wealth position title even bastardom from princes even the notoriety which a firstrate murderer stabs forwhen any of these are in question how we crowd into the witnessbox how we feel the reek of the court an aureola on our temples but let any poor fellow noble unknown an upright man now on the bend with trouble let him go in to face his creditors after the uphill fight of years let him gaze around with workworn eyeswhich of his friends will be there to back him who will give him testimony after all what matters it except in the score against us we are bitter with the world we make a fuss and feel it fester we explode in small misanthropy only because we have not in our heartsore the true balm of humanity no longer let our watchword be every man for himself and god for us all but every man for god and so for himself and all so may we do away with all illicit process and return to the primal axiom that the greater contains the less chapter xviii the rays of the level sun were nestling in the brown bosom of the beechclump and the fugitive light went undulating through the greyarched portico like a reedy river when cradock and clayton nowell met in the old hall of their childhood with its deep embrasures and fluted piers highcorniced mantel of oak relieved with alabaster figures and the stern array of pike and steelcap battleaxe and arquebus which kept the stagheads over against them nodding in perpetual fear this old hall was so impressed upon their earliest memories that they looked upon it in some sort as the entrance to their lives as the twins drew near from opposite doors each hung back for a moment knowing all that had passed that day how would his brother receive him but in that moment each perceived how the others heart was cradock cried hurrah all right and claytons arms were round his neck clayton sobbed hystericallyfor he had always been womanheartedwhile cradock coaxed him with his hand as if he were ten years the elder it was as though the days of childhood had returned once more the days when the world came not between them but they were the world to each other crad i wont have a bit of it did you think i would be such a robber crad and i dont believe one syllable of their humbugging nursery stories why every fellow knows that you must be the eldest brother viley my boy i am so glad that it has turned out so you know that i have always longed to fight my way in the world and i am fitter for it than you are and you are more the fellow for a baronet and a big house and all that sort of thing and in the holidays i shall come every year to shoot with you and to break your dogs and all that for you havent got the least idea viley of breaking a dog well no i suppose i havent said clayton very submissively at any other time he would have said oh havent i for it was a moot point between them but craddy you shall have half at any rate i wont touch it unless you take half then the estates must go to the queen or to mr nowell corklemore your especial friend viley clayton was famed for his mimicry of the pompous mr corklemore and he could not resist it now though the tears were still in his eyes haw yes i estimate so sir a mutually agreeable and unobjectionable arrangement sir is that your opinion haw and clayton stroked an imaginary beard and closed one eye at the ceiling cradock laughed from habit and clayton laughed because cradock did oh that somebody had come by to see them thus on the very best terms as loving as when they whipped tops together or practised sir roger de coverley they agreed to slip away that evening from the noise of the guests and the winebibbing and have a quiet jug of ale in cradocks little snuggery there they would smoke their pipes together and consider the laws of inheritance already they were beginning to laugh and joke about the matter what odds about the change of position if they only maintained the brotherhood unluckily no one came near them the servants were gathered in their own hall discussing the great discovery sir cradock was gone to the rectory to meet john rosedew upon his return and counsel how to manage things even the ubiquitous dr hutton had his especial alibi he had rushed away to catch mr garnet and the illumination folk that the necessary changes might be made in the bedizenment of the oaktree suddenly clayton exclaimed oh what a fool i am craddy i forgot a most important thing until it is nearly too late for it what asked cradock eagerly for he saw there was great news coming when i was out with the governor today what do you think i saw what what my boy out with it cant stop to make you guess a woodcock sir a woodcock a woodcock so early nonsense man it must have been a hawk or a nightjar think i dont know a woodcock yet and ill tell you who saw it too glorious old mark stote his eyes are as sharp as ever we marked him down to a t sir just beyond the hoarwitheys at the head of coffin wood and i should have been after him two hours ago if it had not been for this rumpus i meant to have had such a laugh at you for i would not have told you a word of it but now you shall go snacks in him even the governor does not know it fancy killing a woodcock in the first week of october said cradock with equal excitement why theyll put us in the paper viley not unless you look sharp hes sure to be off at dusk hes a traveller as mark stote said sailed on from the wight most likely last night hell be off for dorset this evening run for your gun crad your pet purday ill meet you here with my lancaster in just two minutes time dont say a word to a soul mind well go quite alone yes but you bring your little wena and ill take my caldo and work him as close as possible i promised him a run this afternoon away they ran out of different doors to get their guns and accoutre themselves while the poor tired woodcock sitting on one leg under a holly bush was drawing up the thin quivering coverlet over his great black eyes cradock came back to the main hall first with his gun on his arm and his shotbelt across him his broad chest shown by the shootingjacket and the light of hope and enterprise in his clear strong glance before you could have counted ten clayton was there to meet him and none but a very illnatured man could have helped admiring the pair of them honest affectionate simple fellows true west saxons as could be seen of the same height and figure as nearly as could be each with the pure bright nowell complexion and the straightforward nowell gaze the wide forehead pointed chin arched eyebrows and delicate mouth of each boy resembled the others exactly as two slices cut from one fernroot nevertheless the expressionif i may say it without affectation the mindof the face was different clayton too was beginning to nurse a very short moustache a silky bright brown tasselet while cradock exulted rationally in a narrow fringe of young whiskers and vileys head was borne slightly on one side cradocks almost imperceptibly on the other with a race to get to the door first the twins went out together and their merry laugh rang round the hall and leaped along the passages that hall shall not hear such a laugh nor the passages repeat it for many a winter night i fear unless the dead bear chorus the moment they got to the kennel which they did by a way of their own avoiding all grooms and young lumbermen fourteen dogs of different races and a dozen languages thundered yelled and yelped at the guns some leaping madly and cracking their staples some sitting up and begging dearly with the muscles of their chest all quivering some drawing along on their stomachs as if they were thoroughly callous and yawning for a bit of activity but each in his several way entreating to be the chosen one each protesting that he was truly the best dog for the purposewhatever that might beand swearing stoutly that he would downcharge without a hand being lifted never run in upon any temptation never bolt after a hare all the while caldo sat grimly apart having trust in human nature he knew that merit must make its way and needed no selfassertion as his master came to him he stood upon his hindlegs calmly balanced by the chainstretch and bent his forearms as a mermaid or a kangaroo does then suddenly cradock nowell dropped the butt of his gun on his boot and said with his face quite altered viley i am very sorry but after all i cant go with you not come with me craddy and a woodcock marked to a nicety and you with your vamplets on and all what the deuce do you mean i mean just what i say dont ask me the reason my dear fellow ill tell you byandby when we smoke our pipes together now i beg you as an especial favour dont lose a moment in arguing go direct to the mark yourself and straight powder to you ill come and meet you in an hours time in the spirebed by the covert crad its no good to argue with you that i have known for ages mind the bigwigs dont dine till seven oclock so you have plenty of time to come for me but i am so sorry i shant have you there to wipe my eye as usual nevertheless ill bring home bill woodcock and what will you say to me then my boy ta ta come along wena wont we astonish the natives but i wish you were coming with me crad the brothers went out at the little gate and there cradock stopped and watched the light figure hurrying westward over the chase taking a short cut for the coverts clayton would just carry down the spinney where the head of the spring was because the woodcock might have gone on there and if ever a snipe was come back to his home yet that was the place to meet him thence he would follow the runnel for about a third of a mile down to the spot in the coffin wood where the hollies grew and the hoarwitheys when quit of that coppice the little stream stole away down the valley and so past mr garnets cottage to the nowelhurst water beyond the church bridge now whether this were the selfsame brook on whose marge we observed master clayton last week walking not wholly in solitude is a question of which i will say no more except that it does not matter much there are so many brooks in the new forest and after all if you come to that how can the most consistent of brooks be identical with the special brook which we heard talking yesterday isnt it running running on even as our love does join hands and keep your fingers tight still it will slip through them when clayton was gone but a little way over the heather and hareruns his brother made off with his gun uncharged for the group still at work in the housefront bull garnet was there with rufus hutton sticking like a leech to him no man ever was bored more sharply or more bluntly expressed it the veins of his temples and closecropped head stood out like a beechtrees stay roots he was steaming all over with indignation and could not find a vent for it when cradock came up bull saw in a glimpse that he was expected to say something in fact that he ought as a gentleman to show his interest not his surprise nevertheless he would not do it though he loved and admired cradock and for many reasons was cut to the heart by his paulopostponement so he left craddy to begin and presented no notch in his swearing his swearing was tremendous for he hated change of orders mr garnet said cradock at last i have heard a great deal of bad language especially among the bargees at oxford and the piermen at southampton and i dont pretend to split hairs myself nor am i mealymouthed but i trust you will excuse my observing that up to the present moment i have never heard such blackguardly language as you are now employing bull garnet turned round and looked at him if cradock had shown any sign of fear he would have gone to the earth at once for his unripe strength would have had no chance with garnets prime in its fury the eyes of each felt hot in the others as in reciprocal crucibles then mr garnets rolled away in a perfect blaze of tears he dashed out his hand and shook cradocks mightily quite at the back of the oaktree then he patted him on the shoulders to resume his superiority and said my boy i thank you well thought cradock of all the extraordinary fellows i ever came across you are the most extraordinary and yet it is quite impossible to doubt your perfect sincerity and almost impossible to call in question your sanity these reflections of master cradock were not so lucid as usual at least he made a false antithesis if it had been possible to doubt mr garnets sincerity he would not have been by any means so extraordinary as he was not much trouble after all cried rufus hutton rollicking up like a man of thrice his true cubic capacity ah these things are simple enough for a man with a little i shall explain the whole process to mrs hutton she is so fond of information never saw a firework before sirat least i mean the machinery of themand now i understand it thoroughly much better indeed than the foreman does did not i hear you say so george eh my mon i deed sothe foreman was a shrewd dry scotchmanin your own opeenion mainly but ye havena peyed us yet my mon for the dustin o your shoon rufus hutton began amid some laughter to hunt his french purse for the siller when the foreman leaped up as if he were shot and dashed behind the oaktree awa mon awa if ye value your life dinna ye see the gluepot burstin rufus dropped the purse and fled for his life and threw himself flat fifty yards away that the explosion might pass over him even then when the laugh was out and mr garnet had said to him perhaps sir you will explain that process for the benefit of mrs hutton instead of being disconcerted he was busier than ever and took mr garnet aside some little way down the chase they want to make a job of it i can see that well enough to charge for it sir to charge for it thank you for your advice dr hutton replied bull garnet crustily he was very morose that afternoon and surly betwixt his violence but perhaps you had better leave them to me for fear of the gluepot bursting ah i suppose i shall never hear the last of that most vulgar pleasantry but i tell you they cant see it or else it is they wont they are determined to do it all over again and they need only change four letters and the fixings all come in again for the r they should put an l for the d a ybless my soul mr garnet what is it you see there no wonder rufus hutton asked what mr garnet saw for the stewards eyes were fixed intently wrathfully ferociously upon something not very far from the place where his home lay among the trees his forehead rolled in three heavy furrows deep and red at the bottom his teeth were set hard and the muscles of his shoulders swelled as he clenched his hands fast dr hutton gazing in the same direction could see only trees and heather what is it you see there mr garnet rufus hutton by this time was quivering with curiosity id advise you sir not to ask me then he added in a different tone the most dastardly scoundrel poacher that ever wanted an ounce of lead sir let us go back to the men for i have little time to waste cool fellow thought rufus waste of time to talk to me is it but what eyes the man must have and so he had and ears too bull garnet saw and heard every single thing that passed within the rim of his presence no matter what he was doing or to whom he was talking no matter what was afoot or what temper he was in he saw and heard as clearly as if his whole attention were on it every moving breathing speaking or spoken thing within the range of human antenn so a spider knows if even a midge or a brother spiders gossamer floats in the dewy unwoven air beyond his octagonal subtlety from this extraordinary gift of bull garnet as well as from his appearance and the force of his character the sons of the forest were quite convinced that he was under league to the devil in half an hours time or less when the dusk come down like wool cradock cast loose his favourite caldo and set out for the coffin wood from habit more than forethought and to give his dog some pleasure there by the kennel he loaded his doublebarrelled gun he had made up his mind to shoot no more upon his fathers land until he had express permission from sir cradock nowell this was a whim no doubt and a piece of pride on his part but the scene of that afternoon and his fathers bearing towards him had left some bitter feeling and a sense of alienation this was the reason why he would not go with clayton much as he longed to do so now with some dull uncertainty and vague depression clouding him he loaded his gun in an absent manner putting loose shot no in one barrel and a cartridge in the other hie away boy he cried to caldo who had crouched at his feet the while then he struck off hot foot for the westward with the gun upon his shoulder but just as he started one of the lads who was often employed as a beater ran up and said with his cap in his hand in a manner most insinuating take i long of ee meestur craduck ill be rare and keerful sir no thank you charley not this time i am not even going shooting and i mean to go quite alone poor cradock unlucky to the last almost everything he had done that day had been a great mistake and now there was only one more to come the deadliest error of all whistling a dreamy old tune he hurried over the brown and tufted land sometimes leaping a tussock of bedfurze sometimes following a narrow harerun a soft green thread through the heather the sun had been down for at least half an hour and under the trees there was twilight but here in the open a tempered brightness flowed from some yellow clouds still lingering in the west you might still know a rabbit from a hare at fifty or sixty yards off and in truth both bunnies and hares were about the former hopping and stopping and peeping and pricking their ears as the fern waved and some sitting gravely upon a hillock with their backs like a homemade loaf the hares on the other hand lopping along with their great ears drooping warily and the spring of their haunches gathered up for a dash away any whither but all alike come abroad to look for the great and kind god who feeds them then from either side of the path or the sandy brows of the gravelpit the diphthong cry of the partridge arose the call that tells they are feeding convivial and goodhearted bird who cannot eat without conversation nor without it be duly eaten no marvel that the paphlagonians assign you a brace of hearts the pheasants were flown to the coverts long ago they are fearful of losing the way to bed two or three brown owls were mousing about and a horned fellow came sailing smoothly from the deep settlements of the thicket as cradock nowell leaped up the hedge a hedge overleaning overtwisting stubby and crowded with ash rose and hazel the fence of the coffin wood though caldo had stood picturesquely at least a dozen times and looked back at his master reproachfully turning the white of his eye and champing his under lip and then dropped as if he himself were shot when the game sped away with a whirr cradock true to his resolution had not pulled trigger yet and though the repression was not entirely based upon motives humane our cradock felt a new delight in sparing the lives of those poor things who have no other life to look to at least so we dare to restrict them so merry and harmless to him they seemed so glad that the dangerous day was done so thankful for having been fed and saved by the great unknown but felt feeder father and saviour chapter xix meanwhile sir cradock nowell had found at the peaceful rectory a tumult nearly as bad as that which he had left in his own household in a room which was called by others the bookroom by herself the library miss eudoxia sat half choked in a violent fit of hysterics amy and fat jemima doing their utmost to console her and bring her round sir cradock had little experience of women and did the worst thing he could have donethat is to say he stood gazing amy groaned miss eudoxiaamy if you dont want to kill me get him out of the room my child go go go cried amy in desperation cant you see godpapa that we shall do better without you oh ever ever so much sir cradock nowell felt a longing to box pretty amys ears he had always loved his godchild amy and chastened her accordingly he now loved amy best in the world next to his pet son clayton to tell the truth he had bathed himself in the sunsetglow of matchmaking all the way down the chase clayton proclaimed the heir and all that should marry amy rosedew what could it matter to him about money and where else would he find such a maiden then in the course of a few more yearsso soon as ever there were five or say at the most six childrenhe sir cradock would make over the management of the property that is if he felt tired of it and they were both very steady and what of cradock you planning father what of your other son cradock in faith he must do for a parson sir cradock retired in no small flurry and went to the garden to look for jem miss eudoxia became at once unconscious as she ought to have been long ago and thenceforth she would never acknowledge that she had seen the intruder at all or indeed that there had been one however it cured her for a very long time of those sad attacks of hysteria this present attack was the natural result of a violent conflict with amy who was not going to be trampled upon even by aunt doxy it appears that early in the afternoon the good aunt began to wonder what on earth was become of her niece of course she could not be at the school because wednesday was a halfholiday she was not in the library nor in the backkitchen nor even out at pinchers kennel no nor even in the garden although she had a magnificent lot of bulbs to plant for which she had saved up ever so much of her little pocketmoney well said miss eudoxia who was thirsting for her gossip which she always held after lunchwell i must say this is most inconsiderate of her and i promised john to take her to the park and how am i to get ready girls are not what they used to be though amy is such a good girl they read all sorts of trashy books and then they go eloping that last idea sent the good aunt in hot haste to amys bedroom and who should be there sitting by the window with a small book in her hand but beautiful amy herself well cried miss eudoxia heavily offended indeed i am surprised so this is what you prefer is it to your own aunts conversation and i declare what a colour you have and panting as if you had asthma let me see that book this moment miss to be sure aunt eudoxia said amy rather indignantly but you need not be in a pet you know oh neednt i indeed when you read such books as this oh what will your poor father say and you to have a class in the sundayschool of all the grisly horrors produced to make the travellers hair creep one of the most repulsive and glaring was in amys delicate hand a hideous ape with an open razor was about to cut a young ladys throat chuckling he drew her fair neck to the blade by her dishevelled hair at her feet lay an elderly woman dead while a man with a red cap was gazing complacently in at the window the back of the volume was relieved by a ghost a deaths head and a pair of crossbones well said miss eudoxia her breath was gone for a long while and she could say nothing more i know the cover is ugly aunt but the inside is so beautiful oh and so very wonderful i cant think how any one ever could imagine such splendid horrible things oh so clever aunt doxy and full of things that make me tingle as if my brain were gone to sleep and i want to ask papa particularly about galvanizing the mummy indeed yes galvanizing and pray does your father know of your having this horrible book no but i mean to tell him the moment i have got to the end of it good child and most dutiful when you have swallowed the poison youll tell us poison indeed aunt eudoxia how dare you talk to me like that do you dare to suppose that i would read a thing that was unfit for me no i dont think you would knowingly but you are not the proper judge why did you not ask your father or me before you began this book because i thought you wouldnt let me read it well that does beat everything candid impudence i call that perfectly candid insolence aunt doxys throat began to swell there was weak gorge in the family meanwhile miss amy who all the time had been jerking her shoulders and standing upright in a manner peculiarly her ownamy felt that her last words required some explanation she had her fathers strong sense of justice though often pulled crooked by womanhood you know well enough what i mean aunt though you love to misrepresent me so i mean that you would not let me read it not because it was wrong which it isnt but for fear of making me nervous and upon that subject at least i think i have a right to judge for myself oh i dare say you indeed and pray who lent you that book unless indeed in your selfassertion you went to a railway and bought it that is just the sort of thing i would rather die than tell after all the fuss you have made about it thank you i quite perceive a young gentlemannot to be betrayedscamp whoever he is it was clayton nowell who had lent the book is he indeed i wish you were only half as upright and honourable hereupon miss eudoxia who had dragged her niece down to the bookroom with dialogue all down the stairs muttered something about her will that she had a little to leave though not much but honestly her owngod knewand down she went upon the chair with both hands to her side at the sequel as we have seen sir cradock nowell assisted and took little for his pains after this of course there was a great reconciliation for they loved each other thoroughly and each was sure to be wild with herself for having been harsh to the other they agreed that their eyes were much too red now to go and see the nascent fireworks a gentlemans party tonight my own sweet love how glad i am i ought to know better amy dearest and they have never sent the goulard i ought to know my own lovey pet that we can trust you in everything no aunty dear you oughtnt i am as obstinate as a pig sometimes and i wish you would box my ears aunt i hope my hair wont be right for a month dearest aunt where you pulled it and as for the book i have thrown it into the kitchenfire long ago though i do wish darling aunt you could have read about the descent into the melstrom i declare my head goes round ever since what amazing command of language and he knows a great deal about cooking james pottles groom and gardener who even aspired to the hand or at any rate to the lips of the plump and gaudy jemima was not at all the sort of fellow you would appreciate at the first interview his wits were slow and mild and had never yet been hurried for his parents were unambitious it took him a long time to consider and a long time again to express himself which he did with a roll of his tongue none the less for that jem pottles was quoted all over the village as a sayer of good things no conclusion was thought quite safe at least by the orthodox women until it had been asked with a knowing lookand what do jem pottles say of it feeling thus his responsibility and the gravity of his opinion jem grew slower than ever and had lately contracted a habit of shutting one eye as he cogitated as cause and effect always act and react this added enormously to his repute until mark stote the gamekeeper and reuben cuff the constable ached and itched with jealousy of that cockeyed cockheaded boy sir cradock found jem quite at his leisure sweeping up some of the leaves in the shrubbery and pleasantly cracking the filberts which he discovered among them these he peeled very carefully and put them in the pocket of his stable waistcoat ready for jemima byandby he swished away very hard with the broom the moment he saw the old gentleman and touched his hat in a way that showed he could scarcely spare time to do it what way my lad do you think it likely your master will come home today this was just the sort of question upon which jem might commit himself and lose a deal of prestige so he pretended not to hear it and brushed the very ground up these tactics however availed him not for sir cradock repeated his inquiry in a tone of irritation jem leaned his chin on the broomhandle and closed one eye deliberately well he maight perhaps come the haigher road and again a maight come the lower wai and ive a knowed him crass the chase sir same as might be fram alongside of meester garnets house there never be no telling the wai any more than the time of un but its never no odds to me and which way do you think the most likely now not to say now but bumbai laike if so be a cooms arly a maight come long of the haigher road as goes to the jolly foresters and if a comth middlin arly you maight rackon may be on the town wai but if he cometh unoosial late and a heap of folks be sickenin or hisself hath pulled a book out a maight goo round by westacot and come home by squire garnets wai rich in alternatives jem pottles opened the closed eye and shut the open one what a fool the fellow is said sir cradock to himself ill try the first way at any rate for if john is so late i could not stop for him with all those people coming how i wish we were free from strangers tonight with all these events in the family but perhaps if we manage it well it will carry it off all the better sir cradock nowell was in high spirits as he started leisurely for a saunter along the higher road this was the road which ran eastward both from the hall and the rectory into the depth of the forest in all england there is no lovelier lane if there be one to compare with it many of the forest roads are in fault because they are too open you see too far you see too much and you are not truly embowered in a forest we do not want long views except to rejoice in the amplitude and a few of those just here and there enlarge the great enjoyment what we want as the main thing of all as the staple feeling is the deep mysterious wondering sense of being swallowed up and knowing it swallowed up not as we are in catacombs or winevaults or any railway tunnel but in our own mothers love with god around us everywhere to many of us perhaps to most so placed at fall of evening there is a certain awe a dread which overshades enjoyment if so it springs in part at least from our unnatural nature that is to say the education which teaches us so very little of the things around us how the arches spring overhead and the brown leaves flutter among them in and out and through and through across and across with delicacy veining the very shadows for miles we may wander beneath them and see no two alike how for fear of wearying us after infinite twists and turnsbut none of them contortionsafter playing across the heavens and sweeping away the sunshine now in this evening light they hover and rustle like the skirts of death is there one of them with its lichenmantle copied from its neighbours is there one that has borrowed a line a character even a cast of complexion from its own brother rubbing against it their arms bend over us as we walk we are in their odour and influence we know that like the magi of old they adore only god and his sun and when we come out from under them we never ask why we are sad chapter xx there is a long mysterious thrill a murmur rather felt than heard a shudder of profundity which traverses the woodland hollows at the suns departure in autumn most especially when the glory of trees is saddening and winter storms are in prospect this dark disquietude moves the wood this horror at the nightfall and doubt of the coming hours touched as with a subtle stream the pointlets of the oakleaves rise the crimped fans of the beech are fluttered and lift their glossy ovals the pendulous chains of the sycamore swing while the poplar flickers its silver skirts the tippets and ruffs of the ivy are ruffling and even the threelobed brambleleaf cannot repress a shiver touched with a stream at least as subtle we who are wandering among the dark giants shiver and shrink we know not why and our hearts beat faster to feel how they beat the cause is the same both for tree and for man earthly nature has not learned to count upon immortality therefore all her works unaided loathe to be undone whether it were this or his craving for his dinner that made sir cradock nowell feel chilled as he waited under the shuddering trees for his friend john rosedewfar be it from me to say because it may have been both sir and the other cause to which he always ascribed itafter the eventto wit a divine afflatus of diabolical presentiment is one we have no faith in until we own to nightmare anyhow there he was for upwards of an hour and no john rosedew came up the hill which sir cradock did not feel it at all his duty to descend on the very safe presentiment of the distress revocare gradum meanwhile john rosedew was speeding merrily according to his ideas of speed which were relative to the last degree along a narrow bridleway some two miles to the westward it would be a serious insultso the parson arguedto the understanding of any man who understood a horse and now john rosedew had owned corbus very nearly nine months and though he had never owned a horse before surely by this time he could set papers in the barbara celarent of the most recondite horselogicor was it dialecticsan insult it would be to that hippicus who felt himself fit now to go to a fair and discuss many points with the jockeys if anybody suggested to him that corbus ought to trot trot sir cried john rosedew to an imaginary hippodamas hasnt he been trotting for nearly an hour today sir quite an equus tolutarius and upon my word i only hope he is not so sore as i am then he threw the reins over the ponys neck and let him crop some cytisus corbus have no fear my horse you shall not be overworked or if epirus or mycen be thy home and birthplaceincertus ibidem sudorthrice i have wiped it off and no oaten particles in it urit aven so i suppose oats must dry the skin ad terramque fluit devexo pondere cervix a line not to be rendered in english even by my cradock how fine that whole description but made up from alien sources oh how lucretius would have done it most sad that he was not a christian a believer was what john rosedew meant but by this time he was beginning to look upon all his classical friends as in some sort christians if they only believed in their own gods wherein i fear he was far astray from the text of one of the articles cob corbus by this time knew his master thoroughly and exercising his knowledge cleverly made his shoes last longer if the weather felt muggy and tryingfrom an equine view of probationif the road was rough and against the grain even if the forestfly came abroad upon business corbus used in sporting parlance to shut up immediately this he did not in a defiant tone not in a mode to provoke antagonism he was far too clever a horse for that but with every appearance of a sad conviction that his master had no regard for him at this earnest appeal to his feelings john rosedew would dismount in haste and reflect with admiration upon the weeping steeds of achilles or the mourning horse of mezentius while he condemned with acrimony the moral conveyed by a song he had heard concerning the donkey wot wouldnt go then he would loosen the girths and remonstrating with corbus for his want of selfregard carefully wipe with his yellow silk pockethandkerchief first all the accessible parts of the cob that looked at all uncomfortable and then his own capacious forehead this being done he would search around for a juicy mouthful of grass or dive for an apple or slice of carrotcorbus at the same time diving nasallyinto the depths of his black coat pocket where he usually discovered his lunch which he had altogether forgotten while the horse was discussing this little refreshment john would put his head on one side and look at him very knowingly revolving in his mind a question which very often presented itself whether corbus were descended from corytha or hirpinus however this may have beenand from his staying qualities one would have thought him rather a chip from the old block of troyhe was the first horse good john rosedew had ever called his own and he loved and admired him none the less for certain calumnies spread by the envious about seedytoes splints and spavins of these crimes whatever they might be the parson found no mention in xenophon pliny or virgil and he was more than half inclined to believe them clumsy modern figments as for the incontestable fact that corbus began to whistle when irrationally stimulated beyond his six miles an hour why that john rosedew looked upon as a classical accomplishment and quoted a line from theocritus very swift horses were gifted with this peculiar power for the safety of those who would otherwise be the victims of their velocity even as the express train always whistled past brockenhurst station after contemplating the animal till admiration was exhausted and wondering why some horses have hairy while others have smooth ankles he would refresh himself with a reverie about the numidian cavalry then declaring that jem pottles was impoliti notandus he would pass his arm through the bridle and calling to mind the pon young lady who unduly astonished darius pull an old book from some inner pocket and stroll on with corbus sniffing now and then at his hatbrim to any one who bears in mind what a punctual body time is this account of the rectors doings will make it not incredible that he was often late for dinner but he never lost reckoning altogether in his circumnavigation because his leisure did not begin till he had passed the jolly foresters for there he must be by a certain hour or corbus would feel aggrieved and so would mrs cripps who always looked for him at or about pm for some mighty fine company was to be had by a horse who could behave himself in the stable of the jolly foresters about middleday on a wednesday several highstepping buggymares one or two satirical broughamites even some nags who gave a decided tone to the neighbourhood silverhamed clevelands and champthebit clydesdales even these were not too proudthat they left for vulgarian horsesto snort and blow hard at the foresters oats and then eat them up like winking to this select circle our own corbus had been admitted already and his conversational powers admired when he had produced an affidavit that his master was in no way connected with trade corbus now bade fair to be spoiled by all this grand society every wednesday he came home less natural more coxcombical he turned up his nose at many good horses whom he had once respected fellows who wandered about in the forest and hung down their chins when the rain came and then he became so affected and false with an interesting languor when amy jumped out to caress him verily friend corbus thou shalt pay out for this what call pray hast thou to become a humbug from seeing how men do flourish john rosedew awoke quite suddenly to the laws of time and season as the hazel branches came over his head and he could see to read no longer the grey wood closed about him to the right hand and to the left the thick shoots of the alder the dappled ash and the osier hustled among the taller trees whose tops had seen the sunset tufts of grass and blackberrytangles hipped dogroses leaning over them stubby clumps of buckthorn brakefern waving six feet high where the ground held moisturewho but an absent man would have wandered at dusk into such a labyrinth actum est with my dinner exclaimed the parson aloud when he awoke to the situation and what perhaps is more important to thee at least corbus thine also is pessum datum and there is no room to turn the horse round without scratching his eyes and his tail so nevertheless this is a path or at one time must have been so semita callis tramesthat last word is the one for it if it be derived from traho which however i do not believefor lo there has been a log of wood dragged here even during a postdiluvial period we will follow this track to the uttermost what says the cheerful philosopher surely a gun nay two or more accurately two explosions now for some one to show us the way corbus be of good cheer there is supper yet in thy not advance then thy best foot why notseest thou an come on i say mine horsegreat god and he was silent tired as he was corbus had leaped back from the leading rein then cast up his head and snorted and with a glare of terror stood trembling what john rosedew saw at that moment was stamped on his heart for ever across his narrow homeward path clear in the grey light and seeming to creep was the corpse of clayton nowell laid upon its left side with one hand to the heart the wan face stark and spread on the ground the body stretched by the final throe the pale light wandered over it and showed it only a shadow john rosedews nerves were stout and strong as of a man who has injured none he had buried hundreds of fellowmen after seeing them die but for the moment he was struck with a mortal horror back he fell and drove back his horse he could not look at the dead mans eyes fixed intently upon him one minute he stood shivering and the ashleaves shivered over him he was conscious somehow of another presence which he could not perceive then he ran up like a son of god to what god had left of his brother the glaze as of ground glass in the eyes the smile that has swooned for ever the scarlet of the lips turned out with the chalky rim of death the bulge of the broad breast never again to rise or fall in breathingis there one of these changes we do not know having seen them in our own dearest ones but a worse sight than of any dead mandead and gone home to his fathermet john rosedews quailing eyes as he turned towards the opening it was the sight of cradock nowell clutching his gun with one hand and clinging hard with the other while he hung from the bank which he had been leaping as a windingsheet hangs from a candle the impulse of his leap had failed him smitten back by horror it was not in him to go back nor to come one foot forward the parson called him by his name but he could not answer only a shiver and a moan showed that he knew his baptism the living was more startled and more startling than the dead chapter xxi there was a little dog that crept and moaned by claytons body a little dog that knew no better never having been taught much it was a small black swedish spaniel skilful only in woodcocks and pretty well up to a snipe or two but actually afraid of a pheasant on account of the dreadful noise he made she knew not any more than the others why her name was wena and she was perfectly contented with it though it must have been a corruption the men said it ought to be winifred the maids more romantic rowena but very likely john rosedew was right being so strong in philology when he maintained that the name was a syncopated form of wadstena and indicated her origin however she knew her masters name better than her own you had only to say clayton anywhere or anywhen and she would lift her tangled ears in a moment jerk her little whisk of a tail till you feared for its continuity and trot about with a sprightly air seeking all around for him now she was cuddled close into his bosom moaning and shivering and licking him staring wistfully at his eyes and the wound where the blood was welling she would not let john rosedew touch him but snapped as he leaned over and then she began to whimper softly and nuzzle her head in closer wena he said in a very low voicepretty wena let me and then she understood that he meant well and stood up and watched him intently john knew in a moment that all was over between this world and clayton nowell he had felt it from the first glance indeed but could not keep hope from fluttering afterwards he had no idea what he did or how he did it but the impression left by that short gaze was as stern as the death it noted full in the throat was the ghastly wound and the charge had passed out at the back of the neck through the fatal grapecluster though the bright hair flowed in a pool of blood and the wreck of life was pitiful the face looked calm and unwrung by anguish yet firm and staunch with the courage summoned to ward death rather than meet it john rosedew shy and diffident in so many little matters was not a man to be dismayed when the soul is moving vehemently now he leaped straight to the one conclusion fearful as it was holy god have mercy on those we love so much no accident is this but a savage murder he fell upon his knees one moment and prayed with a dead hand in his own he knew of course that the soul was gone a distance thought can never gaze but prayer flies best in darkness then with the tears all down his cheeks he looked round once as if to mark the things he would have to tell of in front of the corpse lay the favourite gun with the muzzle plunged into the bushes as if the owner had fallen with the piece raised to his shoulder the hammer of one barrel was cocked of the other on halfcock only both the nipples were capped and of course both barrels loaded the line of its fire was not towards cradock but commanded a little bypath leading into the heart of the wood meanwhile cradock had fallen forward from the steep brow of the hedgebank the branch to which he clung in that staggering way had broken slowly he rose from the ground and still intent and horrorstruck unable to come nearer looked more like one of the smitten trees which they call in the forest dead men than a living and breathing body john rosedew not knowing what he did ran to the wretched fellow and tried to take his hand but the offer was quite unnoticed with his eyes still fixed on his twinbrothers corpse the youth began fumbling clumsily in the pocket of his shootingcoat he pulled out a powderflask and rapidly never once looking at it dropped a charge into either barrel john heard the click of the springone two as quick as he could have said it then the young man drew from his waistcoatpocket two thick patent wads and squeezed one into either cylinder all at once it struck poor uncle john what he was going to do preparing to shoot himself cradock my boy is this all the fear of god i have taught you cradock looked at him curiously and nodded his head in acknowledgment it was plain that his wits were wandering the parson immediately seized the gun and sowed the powder broadcast then wrenched the flask away from him with a hand there was no resisting then for the first time he observed caldo in the hedge downcharging the welltrained dog had never moved from the moment his master fired come with me at once come home cradock boy you shall come home with me but the man of threescore was not quick enough for the young despair cradock was out of sight in the thicket and caldo galloped after him wild with himself for his slowness of wit john rosedew ran to poor claytons gun for fear of his brother finding it then he took from the dead boys pocket his new and burnished powderflask though it went to his heart to do it and leaped upon the back of corbus without a thought of xenophon only wena was left to keep her poor master company how the rector got to the hall i know not neither has he any recollection but he must have sat his horse like a nimrod and taken a hedge and two ditches all we know is that he did get there with corbus as frightened as he was and returned to the place of disaster and death with three men of whom dr hutton was one sir cradock was not yet come back to his home and the servants received proper orders as the four men walking in awe and sorrow cast the light of a lamp through the bushes they heard a quick rustle of underwood and crackle of the dead twigs but saw no one moving some one has been here since i left exclaimed john rosedew trembling some one has lain beside the body and put marks of blood on the forehead each of the men knew of course what it wascradock embracing his brother a good job you took the gun away wonder you had the sense though said rufus hutton sharply to pretend he wasnt crying i only know what i should have done if i had shot my brother soblown out the remains of my brains sir hush said john rosedew solemnly and his deep voice made their hearts thrill it is not our own life to will or to do with in the hands of the lord are our life and our death they knelt around the pale corpse tenderly shading the lamp from the eyes of it even rufus could not handle it in a medical manner one of the men who always declared that he had saved claytons life in his childhood fell flat on the ground and sobbed fearfully i cannot dwell on it any more it makes a fellow cry to think of it only thank god that i am not bound to tell how they met his father chapter xxii mark stote the headgamekeeper on the nowelhurst estate was a true and honest specimen of the west saxon peasantslow tenacious and dogged faithful and affectionate with too much deference perhaps to all who seemed his betters he was now about fifty years old but sturdy and active as ever with a weatherbeaten face and eyes always in quest of something his home was a lonely cottage in one of the plantations and there he had a tidy and very intelligent wife and a host of little anxieties his children the sparrowhawks the weasels the young fellows who called theirselves underkeepers and all they kept was theirselves sirwhat with these troubles and worst perhaps of all that nest of charcoalburners by the bustleheaded oak with black will at the head of them sometimes mark stote would assure us his head was gone all wivvery like and he could get no sleep of nighttime a mizzly drizzly rain set in before the poor people got home that evening with the body of clayton nowell long mournful soughs of wind ensued the boughs of the trees went heavily and it blew half a gale before morning but it takes a real storm to penetrate some parts of the forest once however let the storm get in and it makes the most of the opportunity raging with triple fury as a lion does in a compoundthe rage of the imperious blast when it finds no exit in the grey of the morning two men met face to face in the overhanging of the coffin wood which was the more scared of the two neither could have said although each felt a little pleased at the terror of the other the one of strong nerves was superstitious the other though free from much superstition was nervous under the circumstances the tall and big man was mark stote the little fellow who frightened him dr rufus hutton the latter of course was the first to recover presence of mind for mark stotes mental locomotion was of ponderous metal what brings you here mr stote at this time of the morning and what brings you here dr hutton mark might have asked with equal reason he wondered afterwards why he did not the wonder would have been if he had as it was he only said to see the rights o my young meester sir the wrongs you mean said rufus mark stote there is more in this matter than any man yet has guessed at you be down upon the truth of it my word for it but you be sir ive a shot along o both of em since em wor that haigh and seed how they thought of their guns sir meester clayton wor laike enough to shoot meester cradock xidentually but never wicey warse sir as the parson sayeth never wicey warse sir for i niver see no one so cartious laike mark stote do you mean to say that cradock shot his brother on purpose mark stared at rufus for several moments then he thrust forth his broad brown hand and seized him by the collar dr hutton felt that he was nothing in that big mans grasp but he would not play the coward stote let me go this instant ill have you discharged this very day unless you beg my pardon that you moy then if you can meester a leetle chap coom fram ingy an we bin two hunner and feefty year long o the squire and his foregoers nevertheless he let rufus go and looked over his hat indignantly you are an honest fellow cried hutton when he got his breath again an uncommonly honest fellow although in great need of enlightenment it is not in my nature my man here he felt like a patron getting over his shaking so elastic was his spirit i assure you lukeah no your name is matthew upon my word i beg your pardon i am almost sure it is markmr mark i shall do my utmost for your benefit now talk no more but act mark i oodnt a talked nothing but for mating with your honour then resume your taciturnity which i see is habitual with you and perhaps constitutional mark stote felt sore all over dr hutton now was the collarer mark in his early childhood had been to school for a fortnight and ran away with a sense of rawness which any big word renewed mr stote i will thank you to search in that direction while i investigate this way mark stote longed to suggest that possibly dr hutton being as you might say a foreigner was not so well skilled in examining ground as a woodman of thirty years standing and therefore that he old mark should have the new part assigned to him before it was trampled by rufus but the gamekeeper knew not how to express it sure though he was as all of us are when truth hits the heart like a hammer that something evil would come of slurring the matter so feebly but who are we to blame himwe who transport a poor ignorant girl for trying to hide her ignominy while we throttle before she can cry babe truth who should be received in society with a welcome little stranger with the heavy raindrops hanging like leeches or running together as they do at every thorn or scale of the bark seeking provocation to come down the nape of the neck of any man rufus hutton went creeping under trying not to irritate them pretending that he was quite at home and understood them like a jungle nevertheless he repented and did not thoroughly search more than ten square yards the things would knock him so in the face and the stumps would stick in his trousers so and the drops were so bad for his rheumatism and as it was quite impossible for any man to make way there what on earth was there to look for in spite of all this he did find something and stowed it away in his waistcoat pocket to be spoken of or otherwise according to the turn of events and by this he meant no dishonesty at least in his own opinion only he pitied young cradock most deeply and would do all he could in his favour at the side of the narrow bypath leading from that woodmans track by which john rosedew had approached into the far depth of the thicket dr hutton found under a blackberrybush a little empty tube unlike any tube he had seen before it was about two inches and a half in length and threefourths of an inch in diameter sodden as it was with the rain and opened partway along the seam it still retained unmistakably the smell of exploded powder it seemed to be made of millboard or some other form of paper with a glaze upon the outside and some metal foil at the butt of it what puzzled rufus most of all was a little cylinder passing into and across the bottom something like a boottag dr hutton was not at this time skilled in modern gunnery he knew how to load a fowlingpiece and what the difference was between a flintgun and a percussiongun moreover he had been out shooting once or twice in india not from any love of the sport but to oblige his neighbours so he thought himself both acute and learned in arriving at the conclusion that this was a cartridgecase mark does mr cradock nowell generally shoot with cartridges he laiketh mostways to be with a curtreege in his toard barryel sir oh keeps a cartridge in his left barrel does he and fires first the right i suppose leaving mark to continue the search rufus returned to the hall after carefully taking the distances between certain important points he was bound as he felt to lose no time in making the strictest examination of the poor youths body for now in this great calamity the management of everything seemed to fall upon rufus hutton sir cradock of course was overwhelmed john rosedew although so deeply distressed for the boys were like his own to him was ready to do his utmost but as every one knew except himself he was not a man of the world unluckily too mr garnet always the leading spirit wherever he appeared had not yet presented himself in this keen emergency but his son came up in the course of the day to ask how sir cradock nowell was and to say that his father was quite laid up with a violent bilious attack dr hutton worked very hard kept his mind on the stretch continually ordered every one right and left he even contrived to repulse all the kindred to the twentieth collateral who were flocking in that day to rejoice at the manhood of the heir from old hogstaff who knew all the family kith and kin and friends and enemies he learned the names of the guests expected and met them with laconic missives handed through the closed gates at the lodges in many cases it is to be feared indignation overcame sympathy upstart insolence was heard through the clatter of carriagewindows very nearly as often as most sad occurrence however most of them were consoled by the prospect of learning everything at the inquest on the morrow what could be clearer than that cradock must be hanged for claytons murder the disgrace would kill the old baronet and then it would be very painful but my wife would be bound sir for the sake of her poor children to prove her direct descent from that wellknown sir cradock nowell who shot a man in the new forest ah i fear it runs in the family but their wrath was most unphilosophical unworthy of any moralists when they found that rufus had cheated them all as to the time of the inquest in every direction he spread a report that the coroner could not attend until three oclock on friday while he had arranged very quietly to begin the proceedings at noon and he had taken good care to secure the presence of all the chief men in the neighbourhoodthe magistrates the old friends of the family all who were interested in its honour rather than in its possessions as none of the baffled cousins could solace themselves with outcry that the matter had been hushed up they discovered that kind feeling had made the scene too sad for them the coroner sat in the principal room at the nowell arms the jury had been to see the body lying at the hall and now were to hear the evidence six or seven of the county magistrates sat behind the coroner and their clerk was with them of course they did not attend officially their jurisdiction being entirely several from that of the present court but there could be little doubt that their action would depend in a great measure upon what should now transpire the jury was chosen carefully to preclude so far as might be the charge of private influence they were known for the most part as men of independence and probity and two of them as consistent enemies to the influence of the hall as for general spectators only a few of the villagefolk allowed their curiosity to conquer their good feeling or perhaps i should say their discretion for all were tenants under sir cradock and though it was known by this time that bull garnet was ill and in bed prostrated by one of his old attacks everybody felt certain that he would find out who dared to be present and visit them pretty smartly it would be waste of time to recount all the evidence given for we know nearly all that dr hutton and the clergyman would depose another medical man dr gall had also examined poor claytons remains and the healing profession who cure us like bacon after they have killed us are remarkable for agreeing in public and quarrelling sadly in private life so dr gall deposed exactly as mr hutton had done he was very emphatic towards rufus in the use of the proper prefix but we who know the skill displayed presuppose the game certificate one part however of the medical evidence ought to be repeated poor clayton had not died from an ordinary smallshot wound or wounds but from a ghastly hole through his throat cut as if by a bullet as dr gall who knew something of guns very concisely put it the hole was like the hole in a door when boys have fired as they sometimes do a tallowcandle through it and yet it was fluted at the exit in the fleshy part of the neck as no bullet could have marked it that was caused by the shot diverging beginning to radiate perhaps from the opposition encountered in two words said dr gall when they had badgered him in his evidence the deceased was killed either by a balled cartridge or by a charge of loose shot fired within six feet of him very good thought rufus hutton who heard all dr gall said ill keep my cartridgecase to myself poor crad shant have that against him hereupon lest any mist which goddesses abound in vide homer passim descend upon the eyes or mind of any gentle follower of my poor craddys fortunes let me endeavour to explain dr galls obscurities cartridges as used by sportsmen with guns which load at the muzzle are packages of shot compact and rammed down in a body some of them have spiral cases of the finest wire covered round with paper others used for shorter distance have only cylinders of paper to enclose the shot the interstices between the shots are solidified with sawdust the only use of these things isfor they save little time in loadingto kill our brother bipeds or quadrupeds if such we are at a longer distance the shots are prevented from scattering so widely as they love to do when freed from the barrels repression they fly in a closer body their expansive instincts being checked when first they leave the muzzle by the constraint of the case and the tightness of their brotherhood but it sometimes happens mainly with wirecartridges that the shot can never burst its cerements and flies in the compass of a slug until it meets an obstacle when this is so the quarry escapes unless a bullet so aimed would have hit it this nonexpansion is called in good english the balling of the cartridge and those which are used for the longest distance and for wildfowl shootinggreen cartridges as they are called containing larger shotare especially apt to ball dr gall was aware of course that no one beating for a woodcock would think of putting a green cartridge into his gun at all but it seemed very likely indeed that cradock might have used a blue one for a longer shot with his left barrel and the blue ones having wire round them sometimes ball though not so often as their verdant brothers it only remains to be said that when a cartridge balls it flies with the force as well as in the compass of a bullet with three drachms of powder behind it it will cut a hole at forty yards through a twoinch deal whether it were a balled cartridge or a charge of loose shot at six feet distance was the momentous issue in the former case there would be fair reason to set it down as an accident for the place where cradock had first been seen was thirty yards from clayton and he might so have shot him thence in the dusk and through the thick of the covert but if that poor boy had died from a common charge of shot murder was the only verdict true men could return on the evidence set before them for cradock must have fired wilfully at the open throat of his brother then flown to the hedge and acted horror when he saw john rosedew where was cradock the jury trembled and so did rufus hutton the coroner repeated the question although he had no right to do it at that stage of the evidence since it occurred he has not been seen whispered rufus hutton at last knowing how men grow impatient and evil when unanswered let us proceed with the rest of the evidence said his honour grandly if the young man cares for his reputation he will be here byandby but i have ridden far today let us have some refreshment gentlemen justice must not be hurried chapter xxiii it will have been perceived already that the coroner was by no means the right man in the right place the legal firm cole cole and son had been known in southampton for many years as doing a large and very respectable business the present mr cole the coroner who had been the son in the partnership became sole owner suddenly by the death of his father and uncle having brains enough to know that he was far from having too much he took at once into partnership with him an uncommonly wideawake wary fellow who had been headclerk to the old firm ever biding his time for this inevitable result so now the firm was thriving under the style and title of cole chope and co mr chope being known far and wide by the nickname of coles brains mr cole being appointed coroner not many months ago and knowing very little about his duties took good care for a time not to attempt their discharge without having coles brains with him but this had been found to interfere so sadly with private practice that little by little cole plucked up courage as the novelty of the thing wore off and now was accustomed to play the coroner without the assistance of brains nevertheless upon an occasion so important as this he would have come with full cerebrum but that chope was gone for his holiday mr cole however was an honest manwhich could scarcely be said of his partnerand meant to do his duty so far as he could see it in the present inquiry he had less chance of seeing it than usual for he stood in great awe of mr brockwood a man of ability and high standing who as sir cradock nowells solicitor attended to watch the case at the suggestion of rufus hutton both the guns were produced to the coroner in the condition in which they were found except that john rosedew for safetys sake had lowered the right hammer of claytons to the halfcock before he concealed it from cradock cradocks own unlucky piece had been found on the following morning in a rushy pool where he had cast it as he fled so wildly both the barrels had been discharged while both of claytons were loaded it went to the heart of every man there who could not think cradock a murderer when in reply to a jurymans question what was the meaning of certain lines marked with a watchspring file on the triggerplate of his gun it was explained that the twins so registered the number and kind of the seasons game after this mark stote was called and came forward very awkwardly with a deal of wet on his velveteen cuffs which he tried to keep from notice his eyes were fixed upon the coroner with a kind of defiance but even while he was kissing the book he was glad to sniff behind it mr mark stote said the coroner duly prompted you have i believe been employed to examine the scene of this lamentable occurrence mark stote took a minute to understand this and a minute to consider his answer yees my lard i throwed a squoyle at un the representative of the crown looked at mark with amazement equal at least to that with which mark was regarding him gentlemen asked mr cole addressing the court in general what language does this man talk west saxon replied mr brockwood speaking apart to the coroner west saxon of the forest he can talk plain english generally but whenever these people are nervous they fall back unconsciously upon their native idiom you will never be able to understand him shall i act as interpreter with all my heart that is to say with the consent of the jury but whati mean to say how how am i to be checked you mean unless i am put upon oath and how can you enter it as evidence simply thuslet your clerk take down the original answers all the jury will understand them and so perhaps will he the clerk who was a fine young gentleman strongly pronounced in attire nodded a distinct disclaimer it would be so unaristocratic to understand any peasanttongue at any rate most of the magistrates do there are plenty of checks upon me but i am not ambitious of the office appoint any one you please gentlemen of the jury said the coroner glad to shift from himself the smallest responsibility are you content that mr brockwood should do as he has offered certain and most kind of him replied the jury all speaking at once if his honour was unable to understand old english very good said mr brockwood dont let us make a fuss about nothing mr stote says he throwed a squoyle that is to say he looked at it and in what state did you find the ground was the coroners next question twearable twearable dwont e ax ov me vor gude now dwont e and he put up his broad hand before his broad face terrible terrible said the coroner going by the light of nature in his interpretation but i do not mean the exact spot only where the body was found i mean how was the ground as regards dry and wet for the purpose of retaining footmarks thar a bin zome rickrack wather bout a sannit back but most peart on it ave a droud up agin twur starky my lard moor nor stoachy here mark felt that he had described things lucidly and powerfully and looked round the room for approval stiff rather than muddy he means explained mr brockwood smiling at the coroners dismay were there any footprints upon it in the part where the ground could retain them twur dounted and full of stabbles in the pearts whur the mulloch wur but the main of un tuffets and stramots that is to say mr brockwood translated the ground was full of impressions and footmarks where there was any dirt to retain them but most of the ground was hillocky and grassy and so would take no footprints when you were searching did you find anything that seemed to have been overlooked yees my lard i vound thissomproducing crads stubby meerschaumand thissoma burnt feltwadand a whaile vurther ai vound thissom here he slowly drew from his pocket a very fine woodcock though not over fat with its long bill tucked most carefully under its wing he stroked the dead bird softly and set its feathers professionally but did not hand it about as the court seemed to anticipate in what part and from what direction has that bird been shot ramhard of the head my lard as clane athert shat and as vaine a bird as iver i wish to zee but ahs me her be a wosebird a wosebird if iver wur wan mark could scarcely control his tears as he thought of the birds evil omen and yet he could not help admiring him he turned him over and over again and dropped a tear into his tail coverts mr brockwood saw it and gave him time he knew that for many generations the stotes had lived under the nowells oh the bird was shot you say on the right side of the head and clean through the head thank you proceeded the coroner now do you think that he could have moved after he touched the ground nivir a hinch i allow my lard a vell as dead as a stwoun now inform the court as nearly as you can of the precise spot where you found it it took a long time to discover this for mr stote had not been taught the rudiments of topography nevertheless they made out at last that the woodcock had been found dead on his back with his bill up eight or ten yards beyond the place where clayton nowell fell dead and in a direct line over his body from the gap in the hedge where cradock stood dr hutton must have found the bird if he had searched a little further now said the coroner forcibly mr stote i will ask you a question which is perhaps a little beyond the rules of ordinary evidence i mean at least as permitted in a court of recordhere he glanced at the magistrates who could not claim the rank of recordwhich of these two unfortunate brothers caused in your opinion the death ofof that woodcock mr brockwood glanced at the coroner sharply and so did his own clerk even the jury knew by intuition that he had no right to tout for opinions them crinkcrank words is beyand me moy head be awl wivvery wi em zame as if my old ooman was patchy his honour asks you said mr brockwood with a glance not lost on the justicesfor it meant you see how we court inquiry though the question is quite inadmissiblewhich of the brothers in your opinion shot the bird which you found why meester cradock o course meester cleaton ud needs a blowed un awl to hame where a stwooud mr clayton must have blown him to pieces if he shot him from the place where he stood at least from the place where mr clayton fell and poor mr clayton lay directly between his brother and the woodcock mr brockwood in his excitement forgot that he had no right to put this question nor indeed any other except as formally representing some one formally implicated but the coroner did not check him by whur the blude wor a moost have been naigh as cud be atwane the vernpatch and the wosebird very good that fernpatch was the place where mr cradock dropped from the gap in the hedge mr rosedew has proved that now let us have all you know mark stote did you see any other marks stabbles you call them not i mean in the path mr rosedew came along nor yet in the patches of thicket through which poor cradock fled but in some other direction this was the very question the coroner ought to have put long ago thus much he knew when brockwood put it and now he was angry accordingly mr brockwood i will thank youconsider sir this is a court of record then dont let it record stupid humbug mr brockwood was a passionate man and his blood was up i will take the responsibility of anything i do all we want to elicit the truth is a little skill and patience and for want of that the finest young fellow i have ever known may be blasted for life for this world and the other excuse me mr coroner i have spoken precipitately i have much reverence for your court but far more for truth here mr brockwood sat down again and all the magistrates looked at him with nods of approbation human passions and human warmth are sure to have their way even in areopagus at last the question was put by the coroner himself of course it was a proper one yees i zeed wan said mark stote scratching the back of his head where at least the memory ought to be but a wadnt of no count much now tell us where that one was homezide of the rue avore you coams to them hoarwitheys naigh whur the bowerstone stanneth twur zumbawdy yaping about mebbe after nuts as had lanced fro the rue auver the watertabble before this could be translated a great stir was heard in the outerroom a number of people crying dont eenow and a hoarse voice uttering i will the coroner was just dismissing mr stote with deep relief to both of them and each the more respecting because he could not understand the other mark stote you have given your evidence in a most lucid manner there are few people more to be respected than the thorough saxon gamekeeper moy un goo my lard asked the patient mark with his neck quite stiff as he at first had stuck it and one eye cocked at the coroner as along the bridge of a fowlingpiece mr stote you may now depart your evidence does you the greatest credit both as the father of a family and asas a conservator of game and i may sayah yesas a faithful family retainer thank ee my lard and vor my peart i dwoant bleeve now as you manes all the arm as most volks says of ee mark was louting low trying to remember the fashion they taught him forty years since in the sundayschool when the door flew back and the cold wind entered and in walked cradock nowell as regards the outer man one may change in fifty ways in half of fifty horns villainous ague want of sleep violent attacks of bile inferior claret love rejected scarlet fever smallpox any of these may make a man lose memory in the lookingglass but all combined could not have wrought such havoc such appalment such drought in the fountains of the blood as that young face now told of there was not one line of it like the face of cradock nowell it struck the people with dismay as they made room and let him pass it would have struck the roman senate even with cato speaking times there are when we forget even our sense of humour absorbed in the power of passion and the rush of our souls along with it no one in that room could have laughed at the best joke ever was made while he looked at cradock nowell utterly unconscious what any fellow thought of him except perhaps in some undercurrent of electric sympathy whose wires never can be cut up to the drop of the gallows cradock crossed the chairs and benches feeling them no more than the wind feels the hills it crosses yet with the inbred courtesy of natures thorough gentleman though he forgot all the people there as thinking of himself he did not yet forget himself as bound to think of them he touched no man on leg or elbow be he baronet or cobbler without apologizing to him then he stood in the foremost place looking at the coroner saying nothing but ready to be arraigned of anything mr cole had never yet so acutely felt the loss of his brains and yet it is likely that even chope would have doubted how to manage it the time a man of the world might pass in a dozen commonplaces passed over many shrewd heads there and none knew what to say cradocks deep grey eyes grown lighter by the change of health and larger from the misery seemed to take in every one who had any feeling for him here i am and cannot be hurt more than my own soul has hurt me charge me with murder if you please i never can disprove it reputation is a thing my god thinks needless for me and so it is in the despair which he has sent upon me not a word of this he spoke but his eyes said every word of it to those who have looked on men in trouble and heard the labouring heart as usual the shallowest man there was the first to speak mr nowell asked the coroner blandly as of a wealthy client am i to understand sir that you come to tender your evidence yes replied cradock his throat was tight and he could not manage to say much then sir i am bound to administer to you the caution usual on these occasions excuse me in fact i know you will but your present deposition may bei mean it is possible sir i care for nothing now i am here to speak the truth very laudable admirable gentlemen of the jurymr brockwood perhaps you will oblige the court by examining in chief no your honour i cannot do that it would be a confusion of duties i will not be examined said cradock with a low hoarse voice he had been in the woods for a day and two nights and of course had taken coldi dont think i could stand it a woman who gave me some bread this morning told me what you were doing and i came here as fast as i could to tell you all i know let me do it if you please in the best way i can and then do what you like with me the utter despair of those last words went cold to the heart of every one and mark stote burst out crying so loud that a woman lent him her handkerchief but cradocks eyes were hard as flint and the variety of their gaze was gone the coroner hesitated a little and whispered to his clerk then he said with some relief and a look of kindness the court is ready mr nowell to receive your statement only you must make it upon oath cradock being duly sworn told all he knew as follows it had been agreed between us that mymy dear brother should go alone to look for a woodcock which he had seen that day i was to follow in about an hour and meet him in the spirebed just outside the covert for reasons of my own i did not mean to shoot at all only to meet my brother hear how he had got on and come home with him however i took my gun because my dog was going with me and i loaded it from habit things had happened that afternoon which had rather upset me and my thoughts were running upon them when i got to the spirebed there was no one there although it was quite dusk but i thought i heard my brother shooting inside the coffin wood so i climbed the hedge with my gun halfcocked and called him by his name here cradock broke down fairly as the thought came over him that henceforth he might call and call but none would ever answer by what name did you call him mr brockwood looked at the coroner angrily what difference could it make i called viley viley my boy three times at the top of my voice i used to call him so in the nursery and he always liked it i cant make out why he did not answer for he must have been close bythough the bushes were very thick certainly at that instant before i had time to jump down into the covert a woodcock flushed perhaps by the sound of my voice crossed a little clearing not thirty yards in front of me i forgot all about my determination not to shoot that day cocked both barrels in a moment but missed him clean with the first because a branch of the hedge flew back and jerked the muzzle sharply but the bird was flying rather slowly and i got a second shot at him as he crossed a little path in the copse too narrow to be called a ride i felt quite sure that i shot straight at him and i thought i saw him fall but the light was very bad and the trees were very thick and he gave one of those flapping jerks at the moment i pulled the trigger so perhaps i missed him that ee doednt meester craydock aise larned ee a bit too much for thic what do ee call thissom here he held up the woodcock meester craydock my lard be the sprackest shat anywhur round these pearts poor mark knew not that in his anxiety to vindicate his favourites skill he was making the case more black for him mark stote no more interruptions if you please exclaimed the coroner mr nowell pray proceed dwoant ee be haish upon un my lard dwoant ee vaind un guilty a coodnt no how ave doed it a wor that naice and pertiklar a woodnt shat iven toard a gipsy bwoy and his oyes be as sprack as a merlins a cood zee droo a mokpies neestie cradocks face so pale and haggard but a minute before was now of a burning red the jury looked at him with astonishment and each according to his bias put his construction upon the change two of them thought it was conscious guilt the rest believed it to be indignation at the idea of being found guilty it was neither it was hope the flash and flush of sudden hope leaping across the heart like a rocket over the sea of despair he could not speak but gasped in vain then glutched to use a forest word which means gulped down a sob and fell back into john rosedews arms faint and stark and rigid the process of his mind which led him to the shores of lightbut only for a little glimpse a glimpse and then all dark againwas somewhat on this wise only a bullet or balled cartridge at the distance i was from him could have killed my darling viley on the spot as i saw him dead with the hole cut through him i am almost sure that my cartridge was in the left barrel of the gun where i always put it and now it is clear that the left barrel killed that unlucky bird and killed him with shot flying separate so the cartridge must have opened viley too was ten feet under the height the bird was flying i dont believe that i hit him at all i had loose shot in my right barrel the one that sent so random on account of the branch that struck it i am almost sure i had and i fired quite straight with the left barrel god is good the great god is merciful after all i thought of him no wonder that he fainted away in the sudden reaction there is no need to dwell any longer on the misery of that inquest the principal evidence has been given the place where cradock stood in the hedge and the place where clayton fell and died how poor cradock saw him first in the very act of jumping and hung like a nutshuck paralysed how he ran back to his dead twinbrother and could not believe in his death and went through the woods like a madman with nothing warm about him except his brothers bloodall this i think is clear enough as it had long been to the jury and now was to the coroner only cradock awoke from his hopewhat did he care for their verdict he awoke from his hope not in his moralthat there could be no doubt ofbut in his manual innocence when to face all circumstances he had nothing but weak habit he could not swear he could not even feel confident and we want three times three for swearing that barbarous institution that he had rammed the cartridge down the left barrel and the charge of shot down the right all he could say was this that it was a very odd thing if he had not the oddity of a thing is seldom enough to establish its contrary in the teeth of all evidence so the jury found that violet clayton nowell had died from a gunshot wound inflicted accidentally by his brother cradock nowell whom after careful consideration they absolved from all blame chapter xxiv rufus hutton rode home that night to geopharmacy lodge he had worked unusually hard even for a man of his activity during the last three days and he wanted to see his rosa again and talk it all over with her of course he had cancelled her invitation as well as that of all others under the wretched circumstances but before he went he saw cradock nowell safe in the hands of the rector for he could not induce him to go to the hall and did not think it fair towards his wife now in her delicate health to invite him to the lodge and even if he had done so cradock would not have gone with him if we strike the average of mankind we shall find rufus hutton above it he had his many littlenessesand which of us has fewhis oddities of mind and manner even his want of charity and his practical faith in selfishness none the less for all of that there were many people who loved him and those of us who are loved of anysave parents wife or daughterloved i mean as the word is felt and not interpretedwith warmth of heart and moistened eyes when good or ill befalls us any such may have no doubt of being loved by god all this while sir cradock nowell had been alone and as homer has it feeding on his heart ever since that fearful time when going home to his happy dinner with a few choice friends he had overtaken some dark thing which he would not let them hide from himever since that awful moment when he saw what it was the father had not taken food nor comfort of god or man all they didwellmeaning peoplewas of no avail it was not of disgrace he thought of one son being murdered and the other son his murderer he did not count his generations score the number of baronets and weep for the slur upon them rave of his painted scutcheon and howl because this was a dab on it he simply groaned and could not eat because he had lost his sonhis own his sweet his bestbeloved son as for cradock the father hopedfor he had not now the energy to care very much about itthat he might not happen henceforth to meet him for all things now were of luck more than once a month perhaps and then they need not say much he never could care for him any more of that he felt as sure as if his heart were become a tombstone young cradock though they coaxed and petted wept before him at the parsons and still more behind him and felt for him so truly deeply that at last he burst out crying which did him heavens own goodcradock on his part would not go to his father until he should be asked for he felt that he could fall on his knees and crawl along in abasement for having robbed the old grey man of all he loved on earth only his father must ask for him or at least give him leave to come perhaps he was wrong let others say but in the depths of his grief he felt the need of a fathers love and so his agony was embittered because he got no signs of it let us turn to luckier people rufus why my darling rufus how much moreare you going to put on that little piece of ground no bigger than my worktable mrs hutton had been brought up to call a spade a spade and she extended this wise nomenclature to the contents of the spade as well rosa why my darling rosa that bed contains one hundred and twentyfive feet now according to the great justus liebig and his mineral theory one hundred and twentyfive feet rue and i could jump across it i am sure it is not half so long as my silk measure in the shell dear dearest rosa just consider my pet get out your tablets for you are nothing at mental arithmetic indeed well you never used to tell me things like that rufus well perhaps i didnt roe i would have forsworn to any extent when i saw you among the candytuft but now my darling i have got you and from a lofty feeling i am bound to tell the truth consider the interests rosa go along with your nonsense rue you talk below your great understanding because you think it suits me perhaps i do said rufus perhaps i do now and then my dear you always hit the truth so but is it not better to do that than to talk greek to my rosa i am sure i dont know and i am sure i dont care either when have i heard you say anything rufus so wonderful and so out of the way that i poor i couldnt understand it please to tell me that rufus my darling consider you are exciting yourself so fearfully you make me shake all over then you should not say such things to me rufus why rue you are quite palewhat an impossibility she might have boiled him in soda without bringing him to a shrimpcolourcome into the house this moment i insist upon it and have two glasses of sherry and you do say very wonderful things much too clever for me rufus and indeed i believe too clever for any woman in the world even the one that wrote homer rosa hutton ran into the house and sought for the keys high and low then got the decanter at last out of the cellaret and brought out a bumper of wine crafty rufus stopped outside thoroughly absorbed in an autumn rose knowing that she liked to do it for him and glad to have it done for him not a drop unless you drink first dear rosa here under the weeping elm you are not afraid of the girls who are making the bed i hope i should rather hope not indeed rue dear my best love to you do you think id keep a girl in the house i was afraid to see through the window to prove her spirit mrs hutton tossed a glass of wine off although she seldom took it and it was not twelve oclock yet rufus looked on with some dismay till he saw she had got the decanter well done rosa what good it does me to see you take a mere drop of wine you are bound now to obey me roe my love your very best health and that involves my own youre not heavy on my shoulder love no dear i know that you are so very strong but dont you see the boy coming and that hole among the branches and the leaves coming off too oh do let me go in a moment rue confound that boy im blest if he isnt always after me the boy however or man as he called himself was far too important a personage in their domestic economy to be confounded audibly gardener groom page footman knifeboy and coachman all in one a long loose knockkneed bigfooted what they would call in the forest a yaping shammocking gallybagger his name was jonah and he came from buckinghamshire and had a fine drawl of his own quite different from that of ytene which he looked upon as a barbarism plase sir maister reevers ave a zent them traases as us hardered jonahs eyes throughout this speech which occupied him at least a minute were fixed upon the decanter with ineffable admiration at the glow of the wine now the sun was upon it then jonah my boy cried rufus hutton all animation in a moment i have a great mind to give you sixpence rosa give me another glass of sherry heres to the health of the great horticulturist rivers most obliging of him to send my trees so early and before the leaves are off come along roe you love to see trees unpacked and eat the fruit by anticipation i believe youll expect them to blossom and bear by christmas as st anthony made the vines do well darling and so they ought with such a gardener as you to manage themjonah you shall have a glass of wine to drink the health of the trees he has never taken his eyes off the decanter ever since he came up poor boy rosa was very goodnatured and accustomed to farmhouse geniality rufus laughed and whispered my love my indian sherry cant help it said mrs hutton less chance of its disagreeing with him here jonah you wont mind drinking after your master here be vaine health to all on us said jonah scraping the gravel and putting up one finger as he had seen the militia men do in imitation of the regulars and may us nayver know no taime warse than the prasent mawment hear hear cried rufus hutton now come along and cut the cords boy dr hutton set off sharply with rosa on his arm for he did not feel at all sure but what jonahs exalted sentiment might elicit at any rate half a glass more of sherry they found the trees packed beautifully a long cone like a giant lobsterpot weighing nearly two hundredweight thatched with straw and wattled round and corded over that out with your knife and cut the cords boy well rufus you are extravagantrather fine that thought dr hutton after playing such pranks with my sherryjonah i wont have a bit of the string cut i want every atom of it whats the good of your having hands if you cant untie it at last they got the great parcel open and strewed all the lawn with litter there were trees of every sort as tight as sardines in a case with many leaves still hanging on them and the roots tied up in moss half a dozen standard apples half a hundred pyramid pears the prettiest things imaginable furnished all round like a cypress and thick with blossomspurs then young walltrees two years trained tied to crossed sticks and drawn up with bast like the frame of a schoolboys kite around the roots and in among them were little roses in pots no wrapped in moss and webbed with bast and the smell of the whole was glorious hurrah cried rufus dancing no nurseries in the kingdom nor in the world except sawbridgeworth could send out such a lot of trees perfect in shape every one of them and every one of them true to sort what a bore that ive got to go again to nowelhurst today rosa dear every one of these trees ought to be planted today the very essence of early planting which in my opinion saves a twelvemonth is never to let the roots get dry these peachtrees in a fortnight will have got hold of the ground and be thinking of growing again and the leaves if properly treated will never have flagged at all oh i wish you could see to it rosa well dear rufus and so i can to please you i dont mind at all throwing aside my bannerscreen and leaving my letter to cousin magnolia no no i dont mean that i mean how i wish you understood it understood it rue well im sure as if anybody couldnt plant a tree and i who had a pair of gardening gloves when i was only that high roe now listen to me not one in a hundred even of professional gardeners who have been at it all their lives knows how to plant a tree well then rufus if that is the case i think it very absurd of you to expect that i should but jonah will teach me i dare say ill begin to learn this afternoon no indeed you wont at any rate you must not practise on my trees nor in among them either but you may plant the mop dear as often as you like in that empty piece of ground where the cauliflowers were plant the mop indeed well dr hutton you had better ride back to nowelhurst where all the grand people are if you only come home for the purpose of insulting your poor wife it is there no doubt that you learn to despise any one who is not quite so fine as they are and what are they i should like to know what a poor weak thing i am to be sure no wonder no one cares for me i can have no selfrespect i am only fit to plant the mop hereupon the blue founts welled the carmine of the cheeks grew scarlet the cherry lips turned bigarreaux and a very becoming furedged jacket lifted as if with a zephyr stealing it rufus felt immediately that he had been the lowest of all low brutes and almost made up his mind on the spot that it would be decidedly wrong of him to go to nowelhurst that evening we will not enter into the scene of strong selfcondemnation reciprocal collaudation extraordinary admiration because all married people know it and as for those who are single let them get married and learn it only in the last act of it jonah from whom they had retreated came up again looking rather sheepishfor he had begun to keep a sweetheartand spake these winged words plase sir if you be so good it baint no vault o maine nohow get all those trees at once laid in by the heels what is no fault of yours pray are you always at your dinner baint no vault o maine sir but there coom two genelmen chaps as zays they musten zee you must see me indeed whether i choose it or no and with all those trees to plant and the mare to be ready at three oclock zo i tould un sir but they zays as they must zee you in the name of the devil and all his works but ill give them a bitter reception let them come this way jonah oh dear if you are going to be violent you know what you are sometimes rueenough to frighten any man never my darling never you never find rufus hutton formidable to any one who means rightly no no to be sure dear but then perhaps they may not and after all that has occurred today i feel so much upset very foolish of me i know but promise me not to be rash dear have no fear my darling rosa i will never injure any man who does not insult you dear while rufus was looking ten feet high and mrs rufus tripping away after a little sob and a whisper jonah came pelting down the walk with his great feet on either side of it as if he had a barrow between them at the same time a voice came round the corner past the arbutustree now quivering red with strawberries and the words thereof were these perfect paradise my good sir i knew it must be from what i heard of him exactly like my friend the dooks but laid out still more tastefully bless me why his grace must have copied it wont i give him a poke in the ribs when he dines with me next toosday sly bird a sly bird i say though he is such a capital fellow knew where to come im blest if he didnt for taste true science and landscape haw yes i quite agree with you but his grace has nothing so chaste so perfect as this in me opeenion sir haw the cockles of the rufine heart swelled warmly for of course he heard every word of it though of course not intended to do so now rosa ought to have heard all that was passing in his mind when two gentlemen stood before him and were wholly amazed to see him one of them was a short stout man not much taller than rufus but of double his cubic contents the other a tall and portly signor fitted upon spindle shins with a slouch in his back grey eyebrows long heavy eyes and large dewlaps the short gentleman evidently chief spokesman and proud of his elocution waved his hat most gracefully when he recovered from his surprise drew back for a yard or so in his horror at intruding and spoke with a certain flourish and the air of a man above humbug mr nowell corklemore i have the honour of making you known to the gentleman whose scientific fame has roused such a spirit among us dr hutton sir excuse me the temptation was too great for us my excellent friend lord thorley who has i believe the honour of being related to mrs hutton pressed his services upon us when he knew what we desired but sir no my lord said i we prefer to intrude without the commonplace of society we prefer to intrude upon the footing of common tastes my lord and warm though far more rudimental and vague pursuit of science bless me all this time my unworthy self sir i am too prone to forget myself at least my wife declares so bailey kettledrum sir is my name of kettledrum hall in dorset and i have the enlightenment sir to aspire to the honour of your acquaintance rufus hutton bowed rather queerly to mr nowell corklemore and mr bailey kettledrum for he had seen a good deal of the world and had tasted sugarcandy moreover the kettledrum pattern was known to him long ago and he had never found them half such good fellows as they pretend to think other people being however most hospitable as are nearly all men from india he invited them to come in at once and have some lunch after their journey they accepted very warmly and mrs hutton having now appeared and been duly introduced bailey kettledrum set off with her round the curve of the grassplot as if he had known her for fifty years and had not seen her for twentyfive he engrossed her whole attention by the pace at which he talked and by appeals to her opinion praising all things taking notes redhot with admiration impressively confidential about his wife and children and in a word regardless of expense to make himself agreeable notwithstanding all this he did not get on much because he made one great mistake he rattled and flashed along the high road leading to fifty other places but missed the quiet and pleasant path which leads to a womans good gracesthe path i mean which follows the little brook called sympathy a winding but not a shallow brook over the meadow of soft listening mr nowell corklemore walking with rufus hutton was as he was forced to be by a feeble nature enfeebled a dry and pompous man haw i am given to understand you have made all this yourself sir in me umble opeenion it does you the greatest credit sir credit sir no less to your heart than to your head haw here he pointed with his yellow bamboo at nothing at all in particular everything is in its infancy yet wait till the trees grow up a little i have planted nearly all of them all except that and that and the weeping elm over yonder where i sit with my wife sometimes everything is in its infancy excuse me haw if you will allow me i would also say with the exception of something else and he looked profoundly mystic oh the house you mean said rufus no the house is not quite new built some seven years back sir i do not mean the housebut the edifice hawthe tenement of the human being sir i mean except just this he shut one eye like a sleepy owl and tapped the side of his head most sagely and then he said haw and looked for approval and he might have looked a very long time in his stupidly confident manner without a chance of getting it for rufus hutton disliked allusions even to age intellectual when you came to remember that his rosa was more than twenty years younger ah yes now it strikes me continued mr corklemore as they stood in front of the house that little bowwindownay i am given to understand that baywindow is the more correcthaw i mean the more architectural termi think i should have felt inclined to make that nice baywindow give to the little grassplot a mere question perhaps of idiosyncrasy haw give what asked rufus now on the foam that his own pet lawn which he rolled every day his lawn endowed with manifold curves and sweeps of his own inventing with the wellingtonia upon it and the plantain dug out with a cheeseknifethat all this should be called a little grassplot by a fellow who had no two ideas except in his intonation of haw haw it does not signify but the term i am given to understand is now the correct and recognised one i wish you were given to understand anything except your own importance rufus muttered savagely and eyed the yellow bamboo have youhaw excuse my asking for you are a great luminary here have you as yet made trial of the spergula pilifera yes and found it the biggest humbug that ever aped gods grass dr hutton was always very sorry when he had used strong language but being a thinskinned irritable cutthecorner man he could not be expected to stand nowell corklemores haws and mr corklemore had of haw no less than seven intonations first and most common of all the haw of selfapproval second the haw of contemplation third the haw of doubt and inquiry fourth that of admiration fifth that of interlude and hiatus when words or ideas lingered sixth the haw of accident and shortwinded astonishment eg he had once fallen off a hayrick and cried haw at the bottom seventh the haw of indignation and powerful remonstrance in a totally different key from the rest and this last he now adopted hawthenhawi have been given to understand that the spergula pilifera succeeds most admirably with people who havehawhave studied it very likely it does said rufus though he knew much better but now he was on his own doorstep and felt ashamed of his rudeness but come in mr corklemore our ways are rough in these forest outskirts and we are behind you in civilization nevertheless we are heartily glad to welcome our more intelligent neighbours at lunch he gave them homebrewed ale and pale sherry of no especial character but afterwards being a genial soul and feeling still guilty of rudeness he went to the cellar himself and fetched a bottle of the richest indian gold mrs hutton withdrew very prettily and the three gentlemen all good judges of wine began to warm over it luminously more softly indeed than they would have done after a heavy dinner surely noble wine deserves not to be the mere operculum to a stupidly mixed hot meal have another bottle gentlemen now do have another bottle not one drop more for the world exclaimed they both with their hands up none the less for that they did and what was very unwise of them another after that until i can scarcely write straight in trying to follow their doings meanwhile jonah had prigged three glassfuls out of the decanter left under the elmtree now said rufus who alone was almost in a state of sobriety suppose we take a turn in the garden and my little orchardhouse i believe i am indebted to that for the pleasure of your very disagreeableahem most agreeable company today bailey kettledrum sprang up with a flourish no sir no sir permit me to defend myself and this most marketableii mean remarkable gentleman here present mr nowell corklemore from any such disdishsparagus disparagizing imputations sir an orchard sir is very well and the trees in it are very well and the fruit of it is very good sir but an orchard can never appear sir to a man of exalted sentiments and temporali mean sir strictly intemperate judgment in the light of an elephantirrelevantno sir i mean of course an equilevantfor a man sir for a man here mr bailey kettledrum hit himself hard on the bosom and broke the glass of his watch mr kettledrum said rufus rising your sentiments do you honour mine however is not an orchard but an orchardhouse ha ha good again house in an orchard yes i see corklemore hear that my boy our admirable hostno thank you not a single drop more winei always know when i have had enough sir it is the proud priviprilivege of a mancorklemore get up sir dont you see we are waiting for you mr corklemore stared heavily at him his constitution was a sleepy one and he thought he had eaten his dinner his friend nodded gravely at dr hutton and the nod expressed compassion tempering condemnation ah i see how it is ever since that fall from the hayrick the leastest little drop of wine prejprej prejudge the case my lord muttered mr corklemore who had been a barrister prejudicially affects our highly admired friend but sir the fault is mine i should have stretched forth long ago the restraining hand of friendship sir and dashed the sisisilent bottle chirping bottle possibly you mean no sir i do not and i will thank you not to interrupt me who ever heard a bottle chirp i ask you sir as a man of the world and a man of common sense who ever heard a bottle chirp what i mean sir is the sirenthe siren bottle from his lips what is it in the latin grammaror possibly in the greek for i have learned greek sir in the faulchion days of youthis it not sir this improba siren desidia perhaps sir it may have been in your grammar if you ever had one improba chirping desidia as he looked round in the glow and sparkle of lagenic logic rufus caught him by the arm and hurried him out at the garden door where luckily no steps were the pair went straight or in better truth went first to the kitchen garden rufus did not care much for flowers all that he left to his rosa now i will show you a thing sir cried rufus in his glory a thing which has been admired by the leading men of the age nowhere else in this part of the world can you see a piece of ground sir cropped in the manner of that sir and to tell the plain unvinous truth the square to which he pointed was a triumph of high art the style of it was wholly different from that of mr garnets beds bull garnet was fond of novelties but he made them square with his system the result was more strictly practical but less nobly theoretical dr hutton on the other hand travelled the entire porker obstacles of soil and season were as nothing to him and when the shape of the ground was wrong he called in the navvies and made it right a plot of land foursquare and measured to exactly half an acre contained trees cutting either way as truly as the spindles of machinery there was no tree more than five feet high the average height was four feet six inches they were planted just four feet asunder and two feet back from the pathway there was every kind of fruittree there which can be made by british gardeners to ripen fruit in britain without artificial heat pears especially and plums cherries apples walnuts juglans prparturiens figs and medlars quinces filberts even peaches nectarines and apricotsthough only one row in all of those three there was scarcely one of those miniature trees which had not done its duty that year or now was bent upon doing it still the sight was beautiful although far gone with autumn still coxs orangepippin lit the russet leaves with gold or beurr clairgeau and capiaumont enriched the air with scarlet each little tree looked so bright and comely each plumed itself so naturally proud to carry its share of tribute to the beneficent maker that the two men who had been abusing his choice gift the vine felt a little ashamed of themselves or perhaps felt that they ought to be magnificent magnificent cried kettledrum theatrically i must tell the dook of this he will have the same next year will he though said rufus thinking of the many hours he had spent among those trees and of his careful apprenticeship to the works of their originator i can tell you one thing he wont unless he has a better gardener than i ever saw in these parts now let us go to the orchardhouse the orchardhouse was a spanroofed building very light and airy the roof and ends were made of glass the sides of deal with broad falling shutters for the sake of ventilation it was about fifty feet in length twenty in width and fifteen in height there was no ventilation at the ridge and all the lights were fixed the free air of heaven wandered through among peaches plums and apricots some of which still retained their fruit crimson purple and golden the little trees were all in pots and about a yard apart the pots were not even plunged in the ground but each stood as a tub should on its own independent bottom the air of the house was soft and pleasant with a peculiar fragrance the smell of ripening foliage bailey kettledrum saw at oncefor he had plenty of observant power and the fumes of wine were dispersingthat this house must have shown a magnificent sight a month or two ago and having once more his own object in view he tripled his true approval dr hutton this is fine fine is not the word for it this is grand and gorgeous what a triumph of mind what a lot you must pay for wages thirteen shillings a week in summer seven shillings a week in the winter this was one of his pet astonishments what ill never believe it sir you must either be a conjuror the devil oror or a liar said rufus placidly but i am none of the three jonah has twelve shillings a week but half of that goes for housework that leaves six shillings for gardening but i never trust him inside this house for he is only a clumsy dolt who does the heavy digging and besides him i have only a very sharp lad at seven shillings a week who works under my own eye i have in some navvies at times it is true when i make any alterations but that is outlay not working expense now come and see my young trees just arrived from sawbridgeworth stop one moment what is this stuff on the top of the pots here what queer stuff why it goes quite to pieces in my hands oh only a little topdressing just to refresh the trees a bit this way mr kettledrum pardon me sir if i appear impertinent or inquisitive but i have learned so much this afternoon that i am anxious to learn a little more my friend the dook will crossexamine me as to everything i have seen here he knew our intention of coming over i must introduce you to his grace before you are a week older sir he has specially requested it in fact it was only this morning he said to nowell corklemorebut corklemore though a noble fellow a gem of truth and honour sir is not a man of our intelligence in one word he is an ass haw nowell corklemore nowell corklemore is an ass is he in the wise opeenion of mr bailey kettledrum only let me get up good lordand perhaps he told the dook so there its biting me again oh lord nowell corklemore an ass by the door of the orchardhouse grew a fine deodara and behind it lay mr corklemore beyond all hope entangled his snores had been broken summarily by the maid coming for the glasses and he set forth after a dozen haws to look for his two comrades with instinct ampeline he felt that his only chance of advancing in the manner of a biped lay or stood in his bamboo so he went to the stickstand by the backdoor where he muzzily thought it ought to be mrs hutton in the drawingroom was rattling on the piano and that made his head ten times worse his bamboo was not in the stickstand nevertheless he found there a gigumbrella with a yellow handle like the top of his fidus achates relying upon this he made his way out crying haw at every star in the oilcloth he progged away all down the walk with the big umbrella but the button that held the cord was gone and it flapped like a mutinous windmill however he carried on bravely until he confronted a dark weird tree waving its shrouded arms at him this was the deodara so he made a tack to the left and there was hulled between wind and water by an unsuspected enemy this was rufus huttons pet of all pet peartrees a perfect model of symmetry scarce three feet six in height sturdy crisp shortjointed spurred from keel to truck and carrying twenty great pears it had been so stopped and snagged throughout that it was stiffer than fifty hollies and rosa was dreadfully jealous of it because rufus spent so much time there he used to go out in the summer forenoon whenever the sun was brilliant and draw lines down the fruit with a wet camels hairbrush as the french gardeners do he had photographed it once or twice but the wind would move the leaves so now he had the pleasure of seeing nowell corklemore flat on his back with his pet beurr superfin snapped at the stock and the gigumbrella between his legs all a hideous ruin the gigumbrella flapped and flapped and the agonised peartree scratched and scratched till nowell corklemore felt quite sure that he was in the embrace of a dragon the glorious pears were rolling about some crushed under his frantic heels the rest with wet bruises on them appealing from human barbarism well said rufus hutton he was in such a rage it would have choked him to say another word haw i dont call it well at all to be eaten up by a dragon pull him away for mercys sake pull him away and ill tell all about this business at last they got him out for the matter was really serious and rufus was forced to hide his woe at the destruction of the peartree and after all he had no one but himself to thank for it why did he almost force his guests to drink the third bottle of sherry wonderful perfectly wonderful exclaimed mr bailey kettledrum as rufus was showing them out at the gate before having his own horse saddled the triumphs of horticulture in this age are really past belief you beat all of us dr hutton you may depend upon it you beat all of us i never would have believed that trees ought to be planted with their heads down and their roots up in the air stupid of me though for i have often heard of rootpruning and of course you could not prune the roots unless they grew in that way rufus thought he was joking or suffering from vinous inversion of vision remember my good friend huttonexcuse my familiarity i feel as if i had known you for yearsremember my dear friend you have pledged your word for next wednesdayand mrs hutton too mindmrs hutton with you we waive formality you know in these country quarters kettledrum hall next wednesdayhonour bright next wednesday you see i know the motto of your family thank you all right said rufus hutton its a deuced deal more than i know he added going up the drive i didnt know we had a motto well im done for at last no wonder he was done for he saw what kettledrum had taken in the purest faith all those lovely little trees dwarf pyramids c were standing on the apex jonah after all the sherry given to and stolen by him had laid them in by the heels with a vengeance all the pretty heads were a foot under ground and the roots like the locks of a mermaid wooing the buxom air chapter xxv that evening dr hutton started on his long swift mare for the hall at nowelhurst where he had promised to be he kissed his rosa many times and begged her pardon half as often for all the crimes that day committed her brother ralph from fordingbridge who always slept there at short notice because the house was lonely would be sure to come they knew when the little boy bob was sent for him ralph mohornpoor rosa rejoiced in her rather uncommon patronymic though perhaps it means cowhornralph mohorn was only too glad to come and sleep at geopharmacy lodge he was a fine freshhearted fellow only about nineteen years old his father held him hard at home and of course he launched out all the more abroad so he kicked up as he expressed it the devils own dust when he got to the lodge ordered everything in the house for supper with a bottle of whisky afterwardswhich he never touched only he liked the name of the thingand then a cardinal or the biggest meerschaum to be found in any of the cupboards his pipe however was not like his grog a phantom of the imagination for he really smoked it and sat on three chairs while he baited rosa as he called it with all the bogeys in christendom it was so delicious now to be able to throw her into a tremble and turn her cheeks every colour and then recollect that a few years since she had smacked his own cheeks ad libitum however we have little to do with him and now he is a jolly farmer rufus hutton rode through ringwood over the low bridge where the rushes rustle everlastingly and the trout and dace for ever wag their pellucid tails up stream how all that water spreading loosely wading over miles of meadows growing leagues of reed and rush mistress of a world in winter how it all is content to creep through a pair of little bridgesmatter of such mystery let the christchurch salmon solve it dr hutton went gaily overat least his mare went gailybut he was thinking beyond his wont of the business he had in hand he admired the pleasant old town as he passed and the still more pleasant waters but his mare the favourite polly went on at her usual swing until they came to the long steep hill towards the picked post as he walked her up the sharp parts of the rise he began to ponder the mysterious visit of those convivial strangers it was very plain that neither of them knew or cared the turn of a trowel about the frank art of gardening that of course was only a sham then what did they really come for rufus although from childhood upwards he had been hospitable to his own soul that is to say regarded himself with genial approbation was not by any means blindly conceited and could not suppose that his fame for anything except gardening had spread through the regions round about so he felt that his visitors had come not for his sake but their own and it was not long before he suspected that they wished to obtain through him some insight perhaps even some influence into and in the course of events now toward at nowelhurst hall they had altogether avoided the subject which made him the more suspicious for at present it was of course the leading topic of the county however as they were related to the family while he rufus hutton was not it was not his place to speak of the matter but to let his guests do as they liked about it they had made him promise moreover to dine with the kettledrums on the very earliest day he could fixviz the following wednesdayand there he was to meet mr and mrs corklemore was it possible that they intended and perhaps had been instructed to subject the guest on that occasion to more skilful manipulation than that of their rude male fingers ill take rosa with me said rufus to himself a woman sees a womans game best though rosa thank heaven is not very machiavellian how very odd that neither of those men had the decency to carry a bit of crape out of respect for that poor boy and i who am noway connected with him have been indued by my roe with a hatband shrewd as our friend rufus was he could not be charged with low cunning and never guessed that those two men had donned the show of mourning and made the most of it round their neighbourhood to impress people with their kinship to the great nowells of nowelhurst but that their guardian angels had disarrayed them ere they started having no desire to set rufus thinking about their chance of succession as the sharp little doctor began to revolve all he had heard about corklemore his mare came to the burleyroad where they must leave the turnpike good polly struck into it best foot foremost and as she never would bear the curb well her rider had quite enough to do in the gathering darkness and on that crosscountry track to attend to their common safety she broke from the long stride of her trot into a reaching canter as the moon grew bright between the trees and the lane was barred with shadow pricking nervously her ears at every flaw or rustle bending her neck to show her beauty where the light fell clear on the moortop then with a snort of challenge plunging into the black of the hollows yet ready to jump the road and away if her challenge should be answered bounding across the watergulley and looking askance at a fernshadow then saying to herself it is only the moon child and up the ascent half ashamed of herself then shaking her bridle with reassurance to think of that mile of great danger flown by and the mash and the warm stable nearer and the pleasure of telling that great roan horse how brave she had been in the moonlight goodness me whats that she leaped over road and roadside bank and into a heavy gorsebush and stood there quivering from muzzle to tail in the intensity of terror if rufus had not just foreseen her alarm and gripped her with all his power he must have lain senseless upon the road spite of all his roughriding in india whohoa whohoa then polly you little fool you are killing me cant you see its only a lady polly still backed into the bush and her unlucky rider with every prickle running into him could see the whites of her eyes in the moonshine as the great orbs stood out with horror opposite to them and leaning against a stile which led to a footpath there stood a maiden dressed in black with the moonlight sheer upon her face she took no notice of anything she had heard no sort of footfall she did not know of pollys capers or the danger she was causing her face with the hunters moon upon it would have been glorious beauty but for the broad rims under the eyes and the spectral paleness one moment longer she stared at the moon as if questing for some one gone thither then turned away with a heavy sigh and went towards the coffin wood all this time rufus hutton was utterly blind to romance being scarified in the calf and thighs beyond any human endurance polly backed further and further away from the awful vision before herthe wife of the horsefiend at leastand every fresh swerve sent a new lot of furzepricks into the peppery legs of rufus hang it he cried here goes no man with a haporth of flesh in him could stand it any longer thorn for thorn miss polly he dashed his spurs deep into her flanks the spurs he had only worn for show and never dared to touch her with for a moment she trembled and reared upright in wrath worse than any horror then away she went like a storm of wind headlong through trees and bushes it was all pure luck or providence that rufus was not killed he grasped her neck and lay flat upon it he clung with his supple legs around her he called her his polly his darling polly and begged her to consider herself she considered neither herself nor him but dashed through the wild wood wilder herself not knowing light from darkness any low beech branch any scrag holly even a trail of loose ivy and man and horse were done for the lights of more than a million stars flashed before rufus hutton and he made up his mind to die and wondered how rosa would take it perhaps she would marry again and rear up another family who knew not the name of hutton perhaps she would cry her eyes out smack a young branch took him in the face though he had one hand before it go it again he cried with the pluck of a man despairing and then he rolled over and over and dug for himself a rabbithole of sand and dead leaves and moss there he lay on his back and prayed and luckily let go the bridle the mare had fallen and grovelled in the rotten ground where the rabbits lived then she got up and shook herself and the stirrups struck fire beneath her and she spread out all her legs and neighed for some horse to come and help her she could not go any further she had vented her soul and must come to herself like a lady after hysterics presently she sniffed round a bit and the grass smelled crisp and dewy and after the hot corn and musty hay it was fresher than ice upon brandy so she looked through the trees and saw only a squirrel which did not frighten her at all because she was used to rats then she brought her forelegs well under her stomach and stretched her long neck downwards and skimmed the wet blades with her upper lip and found them perfectly wholesome every horse knows what she did then and there to a great extent till she had spoiled her relish for supper after that she felt grateful and good and it repented her of the evil and she whinnied about for the master who had outraged her feelings so deeply she found him still insensible on his back beneath a beechtree with six or seven rabbits and even a hare come to see what the matter was then polly who had got the bit out of her mouth gave him first a poke with it and then nuzzled him under the coatcollar and blew into his whiskers as she did at the chaff in her manger she was beginning to grieve and get very uneasy taking care not to step on him and went round him ever so many times and whinnied into his ear when either that or the dollop of grass half chewed which lay on his countenance revived the great spirit of rufus hutton and he opened his eyes and looked languidly he saw two immense black eyes full upon him tenderly touched by the moonlight and he felt a wet thing like a sponge poking away at his nostrils polly he said oh polly dear how could you serve me so what will your poor mistress say polly could neither recriminate nor defend herself so she only looked at him beseechingly and what she meant was oh do get up so rufus arose and dusted himself and kissed polly for forgiveness and she if she had only learned how would have stooped like a camel before him he mounted with two or three groans for his back and left the mare to her own devices to find the road again it was very pretty to see in the moonlight how carefully she went with him not even leaping the small watercourses but feeling her footing through them and so they got into the foresttrack some half mile from where they had left it they saw the gleam of bull garnets windows and knew the straight road to the hall sir cradock nowell did not appear of course that was not expected but kind john rosedew came up from the parsonage to keep rufus hutton company so the two had all the great dinnertable to themselves entirely john as the old friend sat at the head and the doctor sat by his right hand although there were few men in the world with the depth of mind and variety the dainty turns of thought the lacework infinitely rich of original mind and old reading which made john rosedews company a forest for to wander in and be amazed with pleasure rufus hutton sore and stiff and aching in the back thought he had rarely come across so very dry a parson john was not inclined to talk he was thinking of his cradock and he had a care of still sharper toothwhat had happened to his amy he had come up much against his wishes only as a duty on that dreary saturday night just that mr hutton who had been so very kind might not think himself neglected john had dined four hours ago but that made no difference to him for he seldom knew when he had dined and when he was expected to do it nevertheless he was human for he loved his bit of supper mr rosedew had laboured hard but vainly to persuade sir cradock nowell to send some or any message to his luckless son no he replied he did not wish to see him any more or at any rate not at present it would be too painful to him of course he was sorry for him and only hoped he was half as sorry for himself john rosedew did not dream as yet of the black idea working even now in the lonely fathers mind gaining the more on his better heart because he kept it secret the old man was impatient now even of the old friends company he wanted to sit alone all day weaving and unravelling some dark skein of evidence and as yet he was not so possessed of the devil as to cease to feel ashamed of him coarse language cries some votary of our selfconscious euphemism but show me any plainer work of the father of unbelief than want of faith in our fellowcreatures when we have proved and approved them want of faith in our own flesh and blood with no cause for it but the imputed temptation it shall go hard with poor old sir cradock and none shall gainsay his right to it silence was a state of the air at once uncongenial to dr huttons system and repugnant to all his finest theories of digestion for lo how all nature around us protests against the trappists and the order of st benedict see how the cattle get together when they have dined in the afternoon and had their drink out of the river dont they flip their tails and snuffle and grunt at their own fine sentiments and all the while they are chewing the cud take stock of one another dont they discuss the asilus and strum the last news of the rinderpest and the fly called by some the cowdab and dont they abuse the festuca tribe and the dyspepsia of the sorrel is the thrush mute when he has bolted his worm or the robin over his spiders eggs so rufus looked through his glass of port which he took merely as a corrective to the sherry of the morning cocked one eye first and then the other and loosed the golden bands of speech uncommonly pretty girls mr rosedew all about this neighbourhood very likely dr hutton i see many pleasant faces but i am no judge of beauty he leaned back with an absent air just as if he knew nothing about it and all the while he was saying to himself pretty girls indeed is there one of them like my amy a beautiful girl i saw tonight but i dont wish to see much more beauty in that way nearly cost me my life i know you are up in the classics so what is it we used to read at schoolhelene helenaus helipsomethingteterrima belli causa fuit upon my word i havent talked so much latin and greekhave another glass of port just for company the dry vintage of cant hurt anybody john rosedew took another glass for his spirits were low and the wine was good and the parson felt then that he ought to have more confidence in god then he brought his mind to bear on the matter and listened very attentively while the doctor described with a rush of warm language and plenteous exaggeration the fright of his mare at that mournful vision the vision itself and the consequences sir you must have ridden like a centaur or like alexander what will mrs hutton say but are you sure that she leaped an oaktree perfectly certain said rufus gravely clean through the fork of the branches and the acorns rattled upon my hat like the hail of the himalaya remarkable most remarkable but you have not told me yet continued dr hutton although i am sure that you know who the beautiful young lady is from your description and the place though i have not heard that they are in mourning i think it must have been miss garnet miss garnet what miss garnet not bull garnets daughter i never heard that he had one yes he has and a very nice girl my amy knows a little of her but he does not allow her to visit much and is most repressive to her unwise in my opinion not the way to treat a daughter one should have confidence in her as i have in my dear child oh you have confidence in miss rosedew and she goes out whenever she likes i suppose of course she does said the simple john wondering at the question that is of course whenever it is right for her of which i suppose she herself is the judge why no not altogether her aunt has a voice in the matter always and a very potent one and of course miss rosedew managed upon such enlightened principles never attempts to deceive you amy my amy deceive me the rector turned pale at the very idea but these questions are surely unusual from a gentleman whom i have known for so very short a time i am entitled in turn to ask your reason for putting them mr rosedew never suspecting indignities could look very dignified im in for it now thought rufus hutton what a fool i am i fancied the old fellow had no nous except for latin and greek strange to say the old fellow had nous enough to notice his hesitation john rosedew got up from his chair and stood looking at rufus hutton sir i will thank you to tell me exactly what you mean about my daughter nothing at all mr rosedew what do you suppose i should mean you should mean nothing at all sir but i believe that you do mean something and please god i will have it out of you rufus hutton said afterwards that he had two great frights that evening and he believed the last was the worst the parson never dreamed that any man could be afraid of him except it were a liar and he looked upon rufus contemptuously the man of the world was nothing before the man of truth mr rosedew said rufus recovering himself your conduct is very extraordinary and you will excuse my saying it more violent than becomes a man of your position and character no violence becomes any man whatever his position i am sorry if i have been violent you have indeed said rufus pushing his advantage a generous man would have said no you havent at seeing the parsons distress and so would rufus have said if he had happened to be in the right so violent mr rosedew that i believe you almost frightened me dear me said john reflecting and he has just leaped an oaktree i must have been very bad dont mention it my dear sir i entreat you say no more about it we all know what a father is and rufus hutton who did not yet but expected to know in some three months grew very large and felt himself able to patronise the rector mr rosedew i as well am to blame i am thoughtless sir very thoughtless or rather i should say too thoughtful i am too fond of seeing round a corner which i have always been famous for sir a man who possesses this power this gift thisi dont know the word for it but i have no doubt you dothat man is apt toi mean to knock his head against a wall suggested the parson in all good faith no you mistake me i dont mean that at all i mean that a man with this extraordinary foresight which none can understand except those who are gifted with it is liable sometimes is amenablei mean toto see double ah yes i can quite understand it john rosedew shut his eyes and felt up for a disquisition yet wanted to hear of his daughter no my dear sir no it is something very far from anything so commonplace as that what i mean isonly i cannot express it because you interrupt me sothat a man may have this faculty this insight this perception which saves him from taking offence where none whatever is meant and yet as it were by some obliquity of the vision may seem in some measure to see the wrong individual here rufus felt like the dwarf alypius when he had stodged iamblichus that is an interesting question and reminds me of the state of as described in the life of pyrrho by diogenes laertius whose errors if i may venture to say it have been made too much of by the great isaac casaubon then scarcely mature of judgment it will give me the greatest pleasure to go into that question with you but not just now i am thrown out so sadly and my memory fails mejohn rosedew had fancied this bytheby ever since he was thirty years oldonly tell me one thing dr hutton and i am very sorry for my violence you meant no harm about my daughter here the greyhaired man with the mighty forehead opened his clear blue eyes and looked down upon rufus beseechingly upon my honour as a gentleman i mean no harm whatever i made the greatest mistake and i see the mistake i made will you tell me sir what it was just to ease my mind i am sure that you will no i must not tell you now until i have worked the matter out you will thank me for not doing so but i apologise most heartily i feel extremely uncomfortable no claret sir but the port if you please i was famous in india for my nerve but now it seems to be failing me rufus as we now perceive had fully discovered his mistake and was trying to trace the consequences the beautiful girl whom he saw in the wood that evening with clayton nowell was not our amy at all but mr garnets daughter he knew the face though changed and white when it frightened his mare in the moonlight and little time as he had to think it struck him then as very strange that miss rosedew should be there bull garnets cottage on the other hand was quite handy in the hollow chapter xxvi at this melancholy time john rosedew had quite enough to do without any burden of fresh anxieties about his own pet amy nevertheless that burden was added not by dr huttons vague questions although they helped to impose it but by the fathers own observation of his darlings strange condition can it be he asked himself and often longed to ask her as he saw only lilies where roses had been and little hands trembling at breakfasttime can it be that this child of mine loved the poor boy clayton and is wasting away in sorrow for him is that the reason why she will not meet cradock nor cradock meet her and she trembles at his name and then that book which aunt doxy made her throw on the kitchen firevery cruel i now see it was of my good sister eudoxia though at first i did not think sothat book i know was poor claytons for i have seen it in his hand well if it truly is so there is nothing to be done except to be unusually kind to her and trust to time for the cure and give her plenty of blackcurrant jam these ideas he imparted to the good aunt doxy who delivered some apophthegms which john did not want to listen to but undertook whatever should happen to be down upon amy sharply she knew all about her tonsils and her uvula and all that stuff and she did not want johns advice though she had never had a family and thank god heartily for it on monday when the funeral came to nowelhurst churchyard john rosedew felt his heart give way and could not undertake it at the risk of deeply offending sir cradock whose nerves that day were of iron he passed the surplice to his curate mr pell of rushford and begged him with a sad slow smile to do the duty for him sir cradock nowell frowned and coloured and then bowed low with an icy look when he saw the change which had been made and john rosedew fall in as a mourner people said that from that day the old friendship was dissevered john for his part could not keep his eyes from the nook of the churchyard where among the yewtrees stood in the bitterness of anguish he who had not asked nor been asked to attend as mourner cradock bowed his head and wept for now his tears came freely and prayed the one almighty father who alone has mercy not to take his misery from him but to take him from it when the mould was cast upon the coffin black wena came between peoples legs gave a cry and jumped in after it thinking to retrieve her master like a stick from the water she made such a mournful noise in the grave and whimpered and put her head down and wondered why no one said wena dear that all the schoolgirls burst out sobbinghaving had apples from clayton latelyand octavius pell the great cricketer wanted something soft for his throat that evening when all was over and the grave heaped snugly up and it was time to think of other things and begin to wonder at sorrow john rosedew went to sir cradock nowell not only as a fellowmourner and a friend of ancient days but as a minister of christ it had cost john many struggles and what with his sense of worldly favours schooldayfriendship delicacy he could scarce tell what to make of it till he just went down on his knees and prayed then the learned man learned his duty sir cradock turned his head away as if he did not want him john held out his hand and said nothing mr rosedew i am surprised to see you and yet john this is kind of you john hoped that he only said mr rosedew because the footman was lingering and he tried not to feel the difference cradock you know what i am as well as i know what you are fifty years my dear fellow fifty years of friendship yes john i remember when i was twelve years old and you fought sam cockings for me and cradock i thrashed him fairly you know i thrashed him fairly they said i got his head under the form but you know it was all a lie how i do hate lies i believe it began that day if so the dislike is subjective perhaps i ought to reconsider it john i know nothing in your life which you ought to reconsider except what you are doing now sir cradock nowell began the combat because he felt that it must be waged and perhaps he knew in that beginning that he had the weaker cause cradock i am doing nothing which is not my simple duty when i see those i love in the deepest distress can i help siding with them upon that principle or want of it you might espouse as a duty the cause of any murderer the old man shuddered and his voice shook as he whispered that last word as yet he had not worked himself up nor been worked up by others to the black belief which made the living lost beyond the dead i am sure i dont know what i might do said john rosedew simply but what i am doing now is right and in your heart you know it come cradock as an old man now and one whom god has visited forgive your poor your noble son who never will forgive himself but for one word in that speech john rosedew would perhaps have won his cause and reconciled son and father my noble son indeed john a very noble thing he has done shall i never hear the last of his nobility and who ever called my clayton noble you have been unfair throughout john rosedew most unfair and blind to the merits of my more loving more simplehearted more truly noble boy i tell you mr rosedew at such a time could not of course contest the point could not tell the bereaved old man that it was he himself who had been unfair and when asked sir cradock getting warmer when did you know my poor boy violet stick up for political opinions of his own at the age of twenty want to drain tenants cottages and pretend to be better and wiser than his father and when have you known cradock do at any rate the latter ever since he got that scholarship that scotland thing at oxfordsir cradock knew the name well enough as every oxford man doeshe has been perfectly insufferable such arrogance such conceit such airs and he only got it by a trick poor viley ought to have had it john rosedew tried to control himself but the gross untruth and injustice of that last accusation were a little too much for him perhaps sir cradock nowell you will allow that i am a competent judge of the relative powers of the two boys who knew all they did know from me and from no one else of course i know you are a competent judge only blinded by partiality john allowed even that to go by without any question of preference simply as a lover of literature i say that clayton had no chance with him in a greek examination in latin he would have run him close you know i always said so even before they went to college i was surprised at the time that they mentioned clayton even as second to him and grieved i dare say deeply grieved if the truth were told it is below me to repel mean little accusations come john rosedew said sir cradock magnanimously and liberally i can forgive you for being quarrelsome even at such a time as this it always was so and i suppose it always will be today i am not fit for much though perhaps you do not know it thinking so little of my dead boy you are surprised that i should grieve for him i should be surprised indeed if you did not god knows even i have grieved deeply as for a son of my own shake hands john you are a good fellowthe best fellow in the world forgive me for being petulant you dont know how my heart aches after that it was impossible to return for the moment to cradock nowell but the next day john renewed the subject and at length obtained a request from the father that his son should come to him by this time cradock hardly knew when he was doing anything and when he was doing nothing he seemed to have no regard for any one no concern about anything least of all for himself even his love for amy rosedew had a pall thrown over it and lay upon the trestles the only thing he cared at all for was his fathers forgiveness let him get that and then go away and be seen no more among them he could not think or feel surprise or fear or hope for anything he could only tell himself all day long that if god were kind he would kill him a young life wrecked so utterly wrecked and through no fault of its own unless as some begin to dream we may not slay for luxury unless we have but a limited right to destroy our fathers property sir cradock it has been stated cared a great deal more for his children than he did for his ancestors he had not been wondering through his sorrow what the world would say of him what it would think of the nowells he had a little too much selfrespect to care a fig for foolstongue now he sat in his carved oakchair expecting his only son and he tried to sit upright but the flatness of his back was gone never to return and the shoulderblades showed through his coat like a spoon left under the tablecloth still he appeared a stately man one not easily bowed by fortune or at least not apt to acknowledge it young cradock entered his fathers study with a flush on his cheeks which had been so pale and his mind made up for endurance but his wits going round like a swirl of leaves he could not tell what he might say or do he began to believe he had shot his father and to wonder whether it hurt him much trying in vain to master his thoughts he stood with his quivering hands clasped hard and his chin upon his breast so perhaps adrastus stood adrastus son of gordias before the childless crsus and the simple words are these after this there came the lydians carrying the corpse and behind it followed the slayer and standing there before the corpse he gave himself over to crsus stretching forth his hands commanding to slay him upon the corpse telling both his own former stress and how upon the top of that he had destroyed his cleanser nor was his life now liveable crsus having heard these things though being in so great a trouble of the hearth has compassion on adrastus and says to him but adrastus son of gordias son of midas this man i say who had been the slayer of his wombbrother and slayer of him that cleansed him when there was around the grave a quietude from men feeling that he was of all men whom he had ever seen the most weighed down with trouble kills himself dead upon the tomb but the father now was not like croesus the generoushearted lydian although the man who stood before him was not a runagate from phrygia but the son of his own loins the father did not look at him but kept his eyes fixed on the window as though he knew not any were near him then the son could wait no more but spoke in a hollow trembling voice father i am come as you ordered yes i will not keep you long perhaps you want to go out shooting he was about to say but could not be quite so cruel i only wish so to settle matters that we may meet no more oh fathermy own fatherfor gods sakeif there be a goddont speak to me like that sir i shall take it as a proof that you are still a gentleman which at least you used to be if you will henceforth address me as sir cradock nowell a title which soon will be your own father look me in the face and ask me then i will sir cradock nowell still looked forth the heavilytinted window his son his only his griefworn son was kneeling at his side unable to weep too proud to sob with the sense of deep wrong rising if the father once had looked at him nature must have conquered mr nowell i have only admitted you that we might treat of business allow me to forget the face of a fratricide perhaps murderer cradock nowell fell back heavily for he had risen from his knees the crown of his head crashed the glass of a picture and blood showered down his pale face he never even put his hand up to feel what was the matter he said nothing not a syllable but stood there and let the room go round how his mother must have wept if she was looking down from heaven the old man having all the while a crude dim sense of outrunning his heart gave the youth time to recover himself if it were a thing worth recovering now as to our arrangementsthe subject i wished to speak about i only require your consent to the terms i propose until in the natural course of events you succeed to the family property what family property sir cradocks head was dizzy still the bleeding had done him good why of course the nowelhurst property all these entailed estates to which you are now sole heir i will never touch one shilling nor step upon one acre of it under your mothersthat is to say under my marriagesettlement continued sir cradock in the same tone as if his son were only bantering you are at once entitled to the sum of l invested in three per cent consolswhich would have beeni mean which was meant for younger children this sum the trustees will be prepared do you think i will touch it am i a thief as well as a murderer i shall also make arrangements for securing to you until my death an income of l per annum this you can draw for quarterly and the cheques will be countersigned by my steward mr garnet of course lest i should forge once for all hear me sir cradock nowell so help me the god who has now forsaken me who has turned my life to death and made my own father curse meevery word of yours is a curse i sayso help me that god if there be one to help as well as to smite a man till you crave my pardon upon your knees as i have craved yours this day i will never take one yard of your land i will never call myself nowell or own you again as my father god knows i am very unlucky and little but you have shown yourself less and some day you will know it in the full strength of his righteous pride he walked for the first time like a man since he leaped that deadly hedge from that moment a change came over him there was nothing to add to his happiness but something to rouse his manhood the sense of justice the sense of honourthat flower and crown of justiceforbade him henceforth to sue and be shy and bemoan himself under hedges from that day forth he was as a man visited of god and humbled but facing ever his fellowmen and not ashamed of affliction chapter xxvii with an even step and no frown on his forehead nor glimpse of a tear in his eyes young cradock walked to his own little room his nest as he used to call it where pipes and books and oxford printsno balletgirls however and not so very many huntersand whips and foils and boxingglovescum multis aliis qu nunc describere longum est et cui non dicta long agowere handled more often than dusted all these things except one pet little pipe which he was now come to look for and which viley had given him a year ago when they swopped pipes on their birthday like diomed and the brave lycian all the rest were things of a bygone age to be thought of no more for the present but dreamed of perhaps on a christmaseve when the air is full of luxury caring but little for any of them although he had loved them well until they seemed to injure him cradock proceeded with great equanimity to do a very foolish thing which augured badly for the success of a young man just preparing to start for himself in the world he poured the entire contents of his purse into a little cedar tray then packed all the money in paper rolls with a neatness which rather astonished him and sealed each roll with his amethyst ring then he put them into a little box of some rare and beautiful palmwood which had been his mothers laid his chequebook beside them for he had been allowed a banking account long before he was of age and placed upon that his gold watch and chain and trinkets the amethyst ring itself his diamond studs and other jewellery even a locket which had contained two little sheaves of hair bound together with golden thread but from which he first removed and packed in silver paper the fair hair of his mother this last with the pipe which clayton had given him and the empty purse made by amys fingers were all he meant to carry away besides the clothes he wore after locking the box he rang the bell and begged the man who answered it to send old hogstaff to him that faithful servant from whom he had learned so many lessons of infancy came tottering along the passage with his old eyes dull and heavy for job had gloried in those two brothers and loved them both as the children of his elder days and now one of them was gone for ever in the height of his youth and beauty and a whisper was in the household that the other would not stay of him whom job had always looked upon as his future master for he meant to outlive the present sir cradock as he had done the one before him he had just been scoring upon his fingers all the things he had taught himto whistle spankadillo while he drummed it with his knuckles to come to the pantrydoor and respond to the whos therea grenadier shouldering a broomstick to play on the jewsharp with variations an old friend and a bottle to give him and then to uncork the fictitious bottle with the pop of his forefinger out of his mouth and to decant it carefully with the pat of his gurgling cheeks after all that how could he believe master crad could ever forsake him now mr hogstaffs legs were getting like the ripe pods of a scarletrunner although he did not run much here they stuck in and there they stuck out abnormally in either case his body began to come forward as if warped at the small of the back and his honest face though he drank but his duty was septemberd with many a vintage and yet with the keenness of love and custom he saw at once what the matter was as he looked up at the young master oh master crad dear master crad whatever are you going to do dont for good now dont i beg on you hearken now doee hearken to an old man for a minute and he caught him by both arms to stop him with his tremulous wrinkled hands o hoggy dear kind hoggy you are about the only one left to care about me now no dont you say that master crad dont you say that whatever you do whoever tell you that tell a lie sir it was only last night mrs toaster and cook and mrs ogaghan the irishwoman was round the fire boiling and they cried a deal more than they boiled i do assure you they did sir and mr stote he come in with some rabbits and he went on like mad and the maids so sorry every one of them they cant be content with their mourning sir i do assure you they cant oh dont ee do no harm to yourself dont ee mr cradock sir no hoggy said cradock taking his hands you need not fear that now of me i have had very wicked thoughts but god has helped me over them henceforth i am resolved to bear my trouble like a man it is the part of a dog to run when the hoot begins behind him now take this little box and this key and give them yourself to sir cradock nowell it is the last favour i shall ask of you i am going away my dear old friend dont keep me now for i must go only give me your good wishes and see that they mind poor caldo and whatever they say of me behind my back you wont believe it job hogstaff will you job hogstaff had never been harder put to it in all his seventy years then as he stood at the open door to see the last of his favourite he thought of the tall dark womans words so many years ago a bonnie pair ye have gat but yell ha no luck o them tak the word of threescore year yell never get no luck o em cradock turned aside from his path to say goodbye to caldo it would only take just a minute he thought and of course he should never see him again so he went to that snuggest and sweetest of kennels and in front of it sat the king of dogs the varieties of canine are as manifold and distinct as those of human nature but the dog be he saturnine or facetious sociable or contemplative mercurial or melancholic is quite sure to be one thingtrue and loyal ever can we who are less than the dogs of the infinite say as much of ourselves to him now caldo as has been implied if not expressed before was a setter of large philosophy and rare reflective power i mean of course theoretical more than practical philosophy as any dog would soon have discovered who tried to snatch a bone from him moreover he had some originality and a turn for satire he would sit sometimes by the hour nodding his head impressively and blinking first one eye and then the other watching and considering the doings of his fellowdogs how fashionably they yawned and stretched in a mode they had learned from a pointer who was proud of his teeth and vertebr how they hooked up their tails for a couple of joints and then let them fall at a right angle having noticed that fashion in ladies bustles when they came on a sunday to talk to them how they crawled on their stomachs to get a pat as a provincial mayor does for knighthood how they sniffed at each others door with an eye to the rotten bones under the straw as we all smell about for the wealthy how their courtesy to one another flowed from their own conveniencethese and a thousand other dogtricks caldo dwelling apart observed but did not condemn for he felt that they were his own now he hushed his bark of joy and looked up wistfully at his master for he knew by the expression of that face all things were not as they ought to be why had wena snapped at him so and avoided his society though he had always been so good to her and even thought of an alliance why did his master order him home that dull night in the covert when he was sure he had done no harm above all what meant that moving blackness he had seen through the trees only yesterday when the other dogs muffs as they were expected a regular battue and came out strong at their kennel doors and barked for young clayton to fetch them so he looked up now in his masters face and guessed that it meant a long farewell perhaps a farewell for ever he took a fond look into his eyes and his own pupils told great volumes then he sat up and begged for a minute or two with a most beseeching glance to share his masters fortunes though he might have to steal his livelihood and never get any shooting seeing that this could never be he planted his forepaws on cradocks breast though he felt that it was a liberty and nestled his nose right under his cheek and wanted to keep him ever so long then he howled with a low enduring despair as the footfall he loved grew fainter looking back sadly now and then at the tranquil home of his childhood whose wings and gables and depths of stone were grand in the autumn sunset cradock nowell went his way toward the simple rectory he would say goodbye there to uncle john and the kind aunt doxy miss rosedew the younger of course would avoid him as she had done ever since but suddenly he could not resist the strange desire to see once more that fatal miserable spot the bidental of his destiny so he struck into a sidepath leading to the deep and bosky covert the long shadows fell from the pale birch stems the hollies looked black in the sloping light and the brown leaves fluttered down here and there as the cold wind set the trees shivering only six days ago only half an hour further into the dusk he had slain his own twinbrother he crawled up the hedge through the very same gap for he could not leap it now his back ached with weakness his heart with despair as he stayed himself by the same hazelbranch which had struck his gun at the muzzle then he shivered as the trees did and his hair like the brown leaves rustled as he knelt and prayed that his brothers spirit might appear there and forgive him hoping and fearing to find it there he sidled down into the dark wood and with his heart knocking hard against his ribs forced himself to go forward all at once his heart stood still and every nerve of his body went creepingfor he saw a tall white figure kneeling where his brothers blood waskneeling never moving the hands together as in prayer the face as wan as immortality the black hairif it were hairfalling straight as a pall drawn back from an alabaster coffinhead the power of the entire form was not of earth nor heaven but as of the intermediate state when we know not we are dead yet cradock could not think nor breathe the whole of his existence was frozen up in awe it showed him in the after time when he could think about it the ignorance the insolence of dreaming that any human state is quit of human fear while he gazed in dread to move not knowing his limbs would refuse him with his whole life swallowed up in gazing at the world beyond the grave the tall white figure threw its arms up to the darkening sky rose and vanished instantly what do you think cradock nowell did we all know what he ought to have done he ought to have walked up calmly with measured yet rapid footsteps and his eyes and wits well about him and investigated everything instead of that he cut and ran as hard as he could go and i know i should have done the same and i believe more than half of you would unless you were too much frightened he would never turn back upon living man but our knowledge of hades is limited we pray for angels around our bed if they came we should have nightmare cradock going at a desperate pace with a handsome pair of legs which had recovered their activity kicked up something hard and bright from a little dollop of leaves caught it in his hand like a tennisball and leaped the hedge uno impetu away he went without stopping to think through the splashy sides of the spirebed almost as fast and quite as much frightened as rufus huttons mare when he got well out into the chase he turned and began to laugh at himself but a great white owl flapped over a furzebush and away went cradock again the light had gone out very suddenly as it often does in october and cradock whose wind was uncommonly good felt it his duty to keep good hours at the rectory so with the bright thing whatever it was poked anywhere into his pocket he came up the drive at early teatime and got a glimpse through the window of amy couldnt have been amy at any rate he said to himself in extinction of some very vague ideas i defy her to come at the pace i have done no no it must have been in answer to my desperate prayer amy was gone though her cup was there when cradock entered the drawingroom well he thought how hardhearted she is but it cannot matter now much though i never believed she would be so being allowed by his kind entertainers to do exactly as he pleased poor cradock had led the life of a hermit more than that of a guest among them he had taken what little food he required in the garret he had begged for or carried it with him into the woods where most of his time was spent of course all this was very distressing to the hospitable heart of miss doxy but her brother john would have it so for so he had promised cradock he could understand the reluctance of one who feels himself under a ban to meet his fellowcreatures hourly and know that they all are thinking of him so it came to pass that miss eudoxia who now sat alone in the drawingroom was surprised as well as pleased at the entrance of their refugee as he hesitated a moment in doubt of his reception she ran up at once took both his hands and kissed him on the forehead oh cradock my dear boy this is kind of you most kind indeed to come and tell me at once of your success i need not aski know by your face the first bit of colour i have seen in your poor cheeks this many a day thats because i have been running miss rosedew miss rosedew indeed and now cradock aunt eudoxia if you please or aunt doxy with all my heart now he used to call her so to tease her in the happy days gone by and she loved to be teased by him her pet and idol dear aunt eudoxia tell me truly do you thinki can hardly ask you think what cradock my poor cradock oh dont be like that not that i didi dont mean thatbut that it was possible for me to have done it on purpose done what on purpose cradock why of course that horrible horrible thing on purpose cradock my poor innocent only let me hear any one dream of it and if i dont come down upon them an undignified sentence that of aunt doxys as well as a most absurd one how long has she been in the habit of hearing people dream some one not only dreams it some one actually believes that i did it so the low wretchthe despicablewho my own father i will not repeat what miss rosedew said when she recovered from her gasp because her language was stronger than becomes an elderly lady and the sister of a clergyman not to mention the countess of driddledrum and dromore who must have been wholly forgotten then you dont think dear aunt eudoxia thatthat uncle john would believe it what my brother john surely you know better than that my dear nornorperhaps not even cousin amy amy indeed i do believe that child is perfectly mad i cant make her out at all she is so contradictory she cries half the night i am sure of that and she does not care for her school though she goes there and her flowers she wont look at seeing that cradocks countenance fell more and more at all this miss rosedew who had long suspected where his heart was dwelling told him a thing to cheer him up which she had declared she would never tell darling amy is you know a very odd girl indeed sometimes when something happens very puzzling and perplexing some great visitation of providence amy becomes so dreadfully obstinate i mean she has such delightful faith that we are obliged to listen to her and she is quite sure to be right in the end though at the moment perhaps we laugh at her and yet she is so shy you can never get at her heart except by forgetting what you are about well we got at it somehow this afternoon and you should have heard what she said her beautiful great eyes flashed upon us like the rock that was struck and gushed like it before she ended can we dare to think she cried that our god is asleep like baalthat he knows not when he has chastened his children beyond what they can bear i know that he who is now so trampled and crushed of heaven is not tried thus for nothing he shall rise again more pure and large and fresh from the hand of god and do what lucky men rarely think ofthe will of his creator and when john and i looked at her she fell away and cried terribly cradock was greatly astonished it seemed so unlike young amy to be carried away in that style but her comfort and courage struck root in his heart and her warm faith thawed his despair still he saw very little chance at present of doing anything but starving how wonderfully good you all are to me but i cant talk about it though i shall think of it as long as i live i am going away tonight aunt doxy but i must first see uncle john of course miss rosedew was very angry and proved it to be quite impossible that cradock should leave them so but before very long her good sense prevailed and she saw that it was for the best while he stayed there he must either persist to shut himself up in solitude or wander about in desert places and never look with any comfort on the face of man so she went with him to the door of the bookroom and left him with none but her brother john rosedew sat in his little room with only one candle to light him and the fire gone out as usual his books lay all around him even his bestloved treasures but his heart was not among them the grief of the old though not wild and passionate as a young mans anguish is perhaps more pitiable because more slow and hopeless the young tree rings to the keen pruninghook the old tree groans to the grating saw but one will blossom and bear again while the other gapes with canker none of his people had heard the rector quote any greek or latin for a length of time unprecedented when a sweet and playful mind like his has taken to mope and be earnest the effect is far more sad and touching than a stern mans melancholy ironworks out of blast are dreary but the family hearth mossgrown is woeful uncle john leaped up very lightly from his brooding rather than reading and shook cradock nowell by the hand as if he never would let him go all the time looking into his face by the light of a composite candle it was only to know how he had fared and john read his face too truly then as cradock turned away not wanting to make much of it john came before him with sadness and love and his blue eyes glistened softly my boy my boy was all he could say or think for a very long time then cradock told him without a tear a sigh or even a comment but with his face as pale as could be and his breath coming heavily all that his father had said to him and all that he meant to do through it and so uncle john he concluded rising to start immediately here i go to seek my fortune such as it will and must be goodbye my best and only friend i am ten times the man i was yesterday and shall be grander still tomorrow he tried to pop off like a lively cork but john rosedew would not have it young man dont be in a hurry it strikes me that i want a pipe and it also strikes me that you will smoke one with me cradock was taken aback by the novelty of the situation he had never dreamed that uncle john could under any possible circumstances ask him to smoke a pipe he knew well enough that the rector smoked a sacrificial pipe to morpheus in a room of his own upstairs only one while chewing the cud of all he had read that day but mr rosedew had always discouraged as elderly smokers do any young aspirants to the mystic hierophancy it is not a vow to be taken rashly for the vow is irrevocable except with men of no principle and now he was to smoke therehe a mere bubbleblowing boy to smoke in the middle of deepest books to fumigate a manuscript containing a lifeful of learning which john could no more get on with andoh miss eudoxiato make the hall smell and the drawingroom the oxymoron overcame him and he took his pipe john rosedew had filled it judiciously and quite as a matter of course he filled his own in the selfsame manner with a digital skill worthy of an ancient fox trying on a foxglove all the time john was shyly wondering at his own great force of character now said john rosedew still keeping it up i have a drop of very old schiedamschnapps i think or somethingof which i want your opinion crad my boy i want your opinion before we import any more i am no judge of that sort of thing it is so long since i was at oxford without more ado he went somewhither after lighting cradocks yard of claywhich the young man burnt his fingers about for he wouldnt let the old man do itand came back like a bacchanal with a square blackjack beneath his arm and jenny after him wondering whether they had not prayed that morning enough against the devil it was a good job miss amy was out of the way the old cat was bewitched that was certain as well as her dear good master miss doxy was happy in knowing not that she was called the old cat in the kitchen chapter xxviii now craddy my dear dear boy said uncle john when things had been done with lemon and cold water and all that wherein discussion so utterly beats description you know me too well to suppose that i wish to pass things lightly i know well enough that you will look the hard world full in the face and so should i do in your case all i wish is that you should do it not with spite or bile or narrowness but broadly as a christian it is hard to talk about that now said cradock inhaling charity and puffing away all acrimony uncle john i hope i may come to it as my better spirit returns to me i hope it indeed and believe it crad i dont see how it can be otherwise with a young man of your breadth of mind and solid faith to help you an empty lad who snaps up stuff because he thinks it fine and garbles it into garbage would become an utter infidel under what you have suffered with you i believe it will be otherwise i believe you will be enlarged and purified by sorrowthe night which makes the guidingstar so much the clearer to us john rosedew was drinking no schiedamallow me to explainthough pretending rare enjoyment of it and making cradock drink a little because his heart was down so after they had talked a pipeful longer not great weighty sentiments but a deal of kindly stuff the young fellow got up quietly and said now uncle john i must go my boy i can trust you anywhere after what you have been telling me of human nature i know nothing exceptfor john thought he did know somethingfrom my own little experience i find great thoughts in the greek philosophers but somehow they are too general and too little genial one thing i know we far more often mistrust than trust unwisely and now i can trust you cradock in the main you will stand upright stop my boy you must have a scrip i was saving it for your birthday you dont despise me i hope said cradock you dont think me a coward for running away so after what has happened today i should go mad if i stopped here not that that would matter much only that if it were so i should be sure to do it john rosedew had no need to ask what he meant by the last two words for the hollow voice told him plainly but for him it is likely enough that it would have been done ere this at any rate in the first horror his hand alone had prevented it the parson trembled at the idea but thought best not to dwell upon it reformidare mortem est animi pusillanimi but reformidare vitam is ten times worse because impious therefore in your case my boy it is utterly impossible as well as ignoble towards us who love you so remember that you will break at least two old hearts you owe some duty to if you allow your own to be broken and now for your viaticum see how you have relieved me while you lived beneath hymettian beams in the goods of tyre and cyprus i even i your godfather knew not what to give you the thought has been vexing me for months and now what a simple solution you shall have it in the original dross to pay the toll on the appian road at least the southwestern railway figs to athens i thought it would be or even as eels to copas and now serves iturum csarem i believe it is at the twentyfirst page of my manuscript such as it is upon the sabellian elements after searching in three or four drawersfor he was rather astray at the moment though generally he could put his hand even in the dark upon any particular one of his ten thousand bookshe came upon the sabellian treatise written on backs of letters on posters on puffing circulars even on visitingcards and castaway tradesmens tickets and there at the twentyfirst page or deltis lay a l bank of england note with some very tough roots arranged diamondwise on the back and arrows and hyphens and asterisks flying about thickly between them these he copied off in a moment on a piece of old hatlining and then triumphantly waved the banknote in the air it was not often poor uncle john got hold of so much money too bitterly knew aunt doxy how large was the mesh of his purse while cradock gazed with great admiration john rosedew with his fingers upon his lips and looking half ashamed of himself went to a cupboard whose doors half open gave a glimpse of countless sermons from among them he drew a widemouthed bottle of leeches and set it upon the table then he pulled out the stopper unplugged it and lo from a hole in the cork fell out two sovereigns and a half one as this money rolled on the table john could not help chuckling a little ha good sister eudoxia have i overreached thee again double precaution there you see crad she has a just horror of my sermons and she runs at the sight of a leech non missura cutembe sure not a word about it crad that asylum is inviolable and sempitern i hope i shall put more there next week cradock took the money at once with the deepest gratitude but no great fuss about it for he saw how bitterly that good man would feel it if he were small enough to refuse i shall not dwell upon their goodbye as we have had enough valediction only cradock promised to write from london so soon as he could give an address there then leaving sadness behind him carried a deal of it with him only something must yet be recounted which befell him in nowelhurst and this is the first act of it while he was in his garret packing a little bag of necessaries forced upon him by miss doxy from johns wardrobe and her own almost indiscriminately and while she was pulling and struggling upstairs with john and jemima and jennyfor she would have made cradock if she could carry the entire house with himhe stowing some things in his pocket felt what he had caught up so hastily while flying out of the wood he examined it by the candlelight and became at once intent upon it it had lain beneath a drift of dead leaves backed by a scraggy branch whence anything short of a grand skedaddle would never have dislodged it and yet it was a great deal too pretty to be treated in that way cradock could not help admiring it though he shuddered and felt some wild hopes vanish as he made out the meaning it was a beautiful gold bracelet light and of firstrate workmanship harmonious too with its purpose and of elegant design the lower half was a strong soft chain of the fabric of trichinopoli which bends like the skin of a snake the front and face showed a strong right arm gauntleted yet entirely dependent upon the hand of a lady no bezilling no jewel whatever except that a glorious roseshaped pearl hung as in contest between them cradock wondered for some little time what could be the meaning of it then he knew that it was claytons offering to the beloved amy no doubt could remain any longer when he saw in the hollow of the back the proposed inscription pencilled rosa debita for the dead gold of the ladys palm rosa dedita for the burnished gold of the cavaliers high pressure with ingenious love to help him he made it out in a moment a rose due now a rose true that was what it came to if you took it in punster fashion just one of poor vileys conceits cradock had no time to follow it out for miss eudoxia then came in with a parcel as big as a featherbed of comforters wrappers and eatables but after he had left the house he began to think about it in the little path across the green to the village churchyard he concluded that amy must have been in the wood that fatal evening she must have come to meet clayton there and yet it was not like her facts however are facts as sure as eggs are eggs though our knowledge makes no great advance through either of those aphorisms but a growing sense of injurythough he had no right to feel injured however it might bethis sense had kept him from asking for amy or leaving the flirt a goodbye he entered the quiet churchyard with the moon rising over the tombstones a mass of shadow cast by the great tower and some epitaphs pushing well into the light like the names which get poked into history the wavering glance of the diffident moon uncertain yet what the clouds meant slipped along the buttressed walls and tried to hold on at the angles the damp corner where the tower stood forth and the south porch ran out to look at it drew back like a ghost who was curtseying and declining all further inquiry green slime was about like the sludge of a river and a hundred sacred memories growing weary and rheumatic had stopped their ears with lichen cradock came in at the rickety swingstile and caring no shadow for ghost or ghostess although he had run away so took the straight course to the old black doorway and on to the heart of the churchyard for he must say goodbye to clayton all nowelhurst still admired that path but those who had paved and admired it first were sleeping on either side of it the pavement now was overlapped undertucked and crannied full of holes where lobworms lived and came out after a thunderstorm and threecornered dips that looked glazed in wet weather but scurfy and clammy in drought and some of the flags stole away and gave under as if they too wanted burial while others jerked up and asserted themselves as superior to some of the tombstones there in the dark no mortal with any respect for his grandfather nor even a ghost with unbevilled soles could go many steps without tripping who will be astonished then when i say that the lightest and loveliest foot that ever tripped in the new forest not only tripped but stumbled there at the very corner where the side walk comes in and the shade of the tower was deepest smack from behind a hideous sarcophagus fell into cradocks arms the most beautiful thing ever seen if he had not caught her she must have cut the very sweetest face in the world into great holes like the pavement stunned for a moment and then so abroad that she could not think nor even speakspeak nor think i would have said if amy had been masculineshe lay in cradocks trembling arms and never wondered where she was cradock forgot all despair for the moment and felt uncommonly lively it was the sweetest piece of comfort sent to him yet from heaven afterwards he always thought that his luck turned from that moment perhaps it did although most people would laugh who knew him afterwards presently amy recovered and was wroth with herself and everybody ruddier than a boursalt rose she fell back against the tombstone oh amy said cradock retiring i have known it long even you are turned against me i turned against you mr nowell what right have you to say that of me no right to say anything amy and scarcely a right to think anything only i have felt it then i wouldnt give much for your feelings i meani beg your pardonyou know i can never express myself of course i know that said cradock oh cant i indeed said amy i dare say you think so mr nowell you have always thought so meanly of me but if i cant express my meaning i am sure my father can perhaps you think you know more than he does amy said cradock for all this was so unlike herself that loving that self more than his own he scarce knew what to do with it amy dear i see what it is i suspected it all along what if you please mr nowell i am not accustomed to be suspected suspected indeed miss rosedew dont be angry with me i know very well how good you are it is the last time i shall ever see you or i would not restore you this the moon being on her way towards the southeast looked over the counterlike gravestone and cradock placed on the level surface the bracelet found in the wood amy knew it in a moment and she burst out crying oh poor clayton how proud he was of it mr nowell i never could have thought this of you never never never thought what of me amy darling amy what on earth have i done to offend you oh nothing i suppose it is nothing to remind me how cruel i have been to him oh no nothing at all and all this from you in a storm of sobs she fell upon jeremy wattles tombstone and cradock put one arm around her to prevent her being hurt amy you drive me wild i have brought it to you only because it is yours and because i am going away cradock it never was mine i refused it months ago and i believe he gave ityou know what he was poor deari believe he transferred it and something elseoh no i cant express myselftojust to somebody else oh you darling and who was that other what a fool he must have been confound it i never meant that i dont know cradock oh please keep away but i think it was pearl garnet oh cradock dear cradock how dare you no i wont yes i will crad considering all your misery she put up her pure lips in the moonlightfor cradock had got her in both arms by this time and was listening to no reasonher sweet lips pledged once pledged for ever she put them up in her love and pity and let him do what he liked with them and the moon attesting a thousand seals hourly never witnessed one more binding after all cradock nowell so tried of heaven so scourged with the bitterest rods of despair your black web of life is inwoven now with one bright thread of gold the purest the sweetest the loveliest girl that ever spun happiness out of sorrow or smiled through the veil of affliction the truest and dearest of all gods children loving all things hating none pours into your heart for ever all that fount of love freed henceforth from doubt and wonder except at her own happiness enfranchised of another world enriched beyond commercial thoughts ennobled beyond self she blushed as she spoke and grew pale as she thought and who shall say which was more beautiful cradock could tell perhaps if any one can but he only knew that he worshipped her and to see the way she cried with joy and how her young bosom panted it was enough to warm old jeremy wattle dead and buried nigh fourscore years cradock all abroad himself full of her existence tasting feeling thinking nothing except of her deliciousness drew his own love round to the light to photograph her for ever poor clayton was dead else crad would have thought that he deserved to be so for going away to pearl garnet but then the grapes were sour how he revelled in that reflection and yet it was very wrong of him amy stood up in the moonlight not ashamed to show herself she felt that cradock was poring upon her to stereotype every inch of her and yet she was not one atom afraid she knew that no man ever depreciates his own property except in the joke which is brag it is a most wonderful thing what girls know and what they wont know but who cares now for reflections her thick hair had all fallen out of her hat because she had been crying so her delicate form still so light and girlish leaned forward in trust of the future and the long dark lashes she raised for her lover glistened with the deep light under them shame was nestling in her cheeks the shame of growing womanhood the down on the yet ungathered fruit of love then she crept in closer to him to stop him from looking so much at her darling cradock my own dear cradock dont you know me now you see i only love you so because you are so unlucky and i am so dreadfully obstinate of course i know all that my pet my beauty inexpressible and remember that i only love you so because you are such a darling then amy told him how sorry she was for having been so fractious lately and that she would never be so again only it was all his fault because she wanted to comfort him and he would not come and let herhere the softest gleam fluttered through her tears like the mazarine blue among dewdropsand that only for the veriest chance and the saucer she had brokenbut what of that she would like to know it was the surest sign of good luck to them although it was the best serviceonly for that her crad would have gonegone away for ever and never known how she loved him yes with all her heart every single atom of it every delicious one if he must know and she would keep it for him for ever for ever and be thinking of him always let him recollect that poor darling and think of his troubles no more then he told her how uncle john had behavedhow nobly how magnanimously and had given every bit of money he possessed in the world for cradock to start in life with john rosedews only child began to cry again at hearing it and put her little hand into her pocket in the simplest way imaginable yes you will dear no i wont went on for several minutes till amy nestled quite into his bosom and put her sweet lips to his ear if you dont i will never believe that you love me truly i am your little wife you know and all that i have is yours the marriageportion in debate was no more than five and sixpence for amy could never keep money long so cradock accepted the sweet little purse only he must have a bit of her hair in it she pulled out her little sewingcase which she always took to the dayschool and the small bright scissors flashed in the moonlight and they made a great fuss over them two great snips were heard i know for exchange after all is no robbery then hand in hand they went together to see poor claytons grave and cradock started as they approached for something black was moving there little dear said amy as the doggie looked mournfully up at them she would starve if it were not for me and i could not coax her to eat a morsel until i said clayton poor clayton and then she licked my hand and whined and took a bit to please me she has had a very nice tea tonight i told you i broke the saucer but that was all my own clumsiness and what has she got there oh god i cant stand it it is too melancholy black wena when it was dark that evening and clayton must have done dinner had stolen away to his dressingroom and fetched as she had been taught to do his smokingjacket and slippers it took her a long time to carry the jacket for fear it should be wet for him then she came with a very important air and put them down upon his grave and wagged her tail for approval she was lying there now and wondering how much longer till he would be ready cradock sobbed hysterically and amy led him softly away to the place where his travellingbag was now wait here one moment my poor dear and i will bring you your future companion presently amy came back with wena following the coat and the slippers darling cradock take her with you she is so true and faithful she will die if she is left here and she will be such a comfort to you take her cradock for my sake the last entreaty settled it cradock took the coat and slippers and carried wena a little way while she looked back wistfully at the churchyard and amy coaxed and patted her they agreed on the road that amy rosedew should call upon miss garnet to restore the bracelet and should mark how she received it for amy had now a strong suspicion especially after what cradock had seen which now became intelligible that pearl knew more of poor claytons death than had been confessed to any one my own cradock only think said amy i have felt the strongest conviction throughout that you had nothing to do with it sweetest one he replied with a desperate longing to clasp her but for wena and the carpetbag that is only because you love me never say it again dear suspense or even doubt about it would kill me like slow poison amy shuddered at his tone and thought how different men were for a woman would live on the hope of it but she remembered those words when the question arose and rejoiced that he knew not the whole of it and now with the great drops in her eyes she stood at her fathers gate to say goodbye to her love she would not let him know that she cried but wena was welcome to know it and wena licked some tears off and then quite felt for amy goodbye my own my only said cradock for the twentieth time even the latch of the gate was trembling god loves us after all amy or at any rate he loves you and you and you oh cradock if he loves one he must love both of us i believe he does said cradock since i have seen you i am sure of it now i care not for the world except my world in you dearest darling life of my life promise me not to fret again fret indeed with you to love me give me just one more cradock with a braver heart than he ever thought to own again and yet with a hole and a string in it for after all he did not own it being begged away at last by the one who then went down on her knees only to beg him back againthat hapless yet most blessed fellow strode away as hard as he could for fear of running back again and the dusky trees closed round him and he knew and loved every one of them then the latch of the gate for the last time clicked when he was out of sight and the laurustinus by the pier beginning to bud for the winter glistened in the moonlight with a silent storm of tears end of vol
