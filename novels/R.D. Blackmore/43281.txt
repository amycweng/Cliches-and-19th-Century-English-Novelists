lvi fatal accident to the carrier cripps the carrier chapter i the head of the family the little village of beckley lies or rather lay many years ago in the quiet embrace of old stow wood well known to every oxford man who loves the horn or fusil this wood or forest now broken up into many straggling copses spread in the olden time across the main breadth of the highland to the north of headington between the valley of the cherwell and the bogs of otmoor beckley itself though once approached by the roman road from alchester must for many a century have nursed its rural quietude withdrawn as it was from the stagewaggon track from high wycombe to chipping norton through wheatley islip and bletchingdon and lying in a tangle of narrow lanes leading only to one another so beckley took that cheerful view of life which enabled the fox to disdain the blandishments of the vintage and prided itself on its happy seclusion and untutored honesty but as all sons of adam must have something or other to say to the rest and especially to his daughters this little village carried on some commerce with the outer world and did it through a carrier the name of this excellent man was cripps and the carriers mantle or woolsey coat had descended on this particular cripps from many generations all the cripps family had a habit of adding largely to their number in every generation in this they resembled most other families which have to fight the world and therefore recruit their forces zealously but in one great point they were very distinctthey agreed among one another and ever since roads were made or rather lanes began trying to make themselves one great tradition had confirmed the dynasty of crippses this was that the eldest son should take the carrying business the second son upon first avoidance should have the bakers shop in oxford over against old balliol college the third should have the queer old swinefarm in the heart of stow forest the fourth should be the butcher of beckley and the fifth its shoemaker if ever it pleased the lord to proceed with the masculine fork of the family as had happened several times the sixth boy and the rest were expected to start on their travels when big enough as for the girls the carrier being the head of the family and holding the house and the stable and cart was bound to take the maids one by one to and fro under his tilt twice a week till the public fell in love with them now so many things come cross and across in the countless ins and outs of life that even the laws of the crippses failed sometimes in some jot or tittle still there they stuck and strong cause was needed ere they could be departed from of course the sideshoots of the family shoemakers sons and so on were not to be bound by this great code however ambitious to be so to deal with such rovers is not our duty our privilege is to trace the strict succession of the crippses the deeds of the carrier now on the throne and his second best brother the baker with a little sidepeep at the man on the farm and a shy desire to be very delicate to the last unmarried female the present head of the family zacchary cripps the beckley carrier under the laws of time which are even stricter than the cripps code was crossing the ridge of manhood towards the western side of forty without providing the due successor to the ancestral drivingboard public opinion was already beginning to exclaim at him and the man who kept the chandlers shop with a large small family to maintain was threatening to make the most of this and set up his own eldest son on the road though dot and carry one was all he knew about the business zacchary was not a likely man to be at all upset by this but rather one of a tarrying order as his name might indicate truly intelligent families living round about the city of oxford had and even to this day have a habit of naming their male babies after the books of the bible in their just canonical sequence while infants of the better sex are baptized into the apocrypha or even the epistles so that zacchary should have been genesis only his father had suffered such pangs of mind at being cut down by the everstrengthening curtness of british diction into jenny cripps that he laid his thumb to the new testament when his first manchild was born to him and finding a father in like case quite relieved of responsibility took it for a good sign and applied his name triumphantly but though the eldest born was thus transferred into the new testament the second son reverted to the proper dispensation and the one who went into the bakers shop was exodus as he ought to be the children of the former exodus were turned out testamentarily save those who were needed to carry the bread out till their cousins boys should be big enough all of these doings were right enough and everybody approved of them leviticus cripps was the lord of the swine and numbers bore the cleaver while deuteronomy stuck to his last when the publichouse could spare him there was only one more brother of the dominant generation whose name was pentachook for thus they pronounced the collective eponym and he had been compendiously kicked abroad to seek his own fortune right early but as for the daughters who took their names from the best women of the apocrypha and sat up successively under the tilt until they were disposed of for the moment it is enough to say that all except one were now forth and settled some married farmers some married tradesmen one took a millers eldest son one had a gentleman more or less but all with expectations only the youngest was still in the tilt a very pretty girl called esther all beckley declared that esthers heart had been touched by a college lad who came some five years since to lodge with zacchary for the long vacation and was waited on by this young girl supposed to be then unripe for dreaming of the tender sentiment that a girl of only fifteen summers should allow her thoughts to stray contrary to all common sense and her duty to her betters for no other reason to anybodys knowledge than that a young man ate and drank with less noise than the crippses and went on about the moonlight and the stars and the rubbishy things in the hedgesthat a child like that should know no better than to mix what a gentleman said with his inner meaningput it right or left it showed that something was amiss with her however the women would say no more until it was pulled out of them to mix or meddle with the crippses was like putting ones fingers into a steel trap with female opinion in this condition and eager to catch at anything mrs exodus cripps in oxford was confined rather suddenly she had kneaded a batch of two sacks of flour to put it to rise for the morning and her husband who should not have let her do it was smoking a pipe and exciting her nevertheless it would not have harmed her as both the doctor and the midwife said if only she had kept herself from arguing while about it but somehow or other her husband said a thing she could not agree with and the strength of her reason went the other way and it served him right that he had to rush off in his slippers to the nightbell on the next day although things were quite brought round and the world was the richer by the addition of another rational animal mr exodus sent up the crumpetboy all the way from broad street in oxford to beckley to beg and implore miss esther cripps to come down and attend to the caudle and the crumpetboy being short of breath became so full of power that the carrier scarcely knew what to do in the teeth of so urgent a message for he had made quite a pet of his youngest sister and the twenty years of age betwixt them stopped the gap of rivalry it was getting quite late in the afternoon when the crumpetboy knocked at the carriers door because he had met upon magdalen bridge a boy who owed him twopence and eager as he was to fulfil his duty a sense of justice to himself compelled him to do his best to get it his knowledge of the world was increased by the failure of this utopian vision for the other boy offered to toss him double or quits and having no specie borrowed poor crumpys last penny to do it then being defeated in the issue he cast the young bakers cap over the bridge and made off at fine speed with his coin of the realm what other thing could crumpy do than attempt to outvie his activity in a word he chased him as far as carfax with wellwinged feet and sad labour of lungs but mercury laughed at astraea and crumpy had a very distant view of fivepence recording a highly vindictive vow he scratched his bare head and set forth again being further from beckley than at his first start it certainly was an unlucky thing that the day of the week should be tuesdaytuesday the th of december for zacchary always had to make his rounds on a wednesday and a saturday and if he were to drive his poor old dobbin into oxford on a tuesday evening how could he get through his business tomorrow for dobbin insisted on a day in stable whenever he had been in oxford he was full of the air of the laziest place and perhaps the most delightful in the world he despised all the horses of low agriculture after that inspiration and he sighed out sweet grunts at the colour of his straw instead of getting up the next morning zacchary cripps was a thoughtful man as well as a very kindhearted one in the crown of his hat he always carried a monthly calendar gummed on cardboard and opposite almost every day he had dots or round os or crosses each of these to his very steady mind meant something not to be neglected and being as time went a pretty fair scholarere school boards destroyed true scholarshipwith the help of his horse he could make out nearly every place he had to call at so now he looked at the crumpetboy to receive and absorb his excitement and then he turned to young esther and let her speak first as she always liked to do oh please to go back quite as fast as you can said esther to the crumpy and say that i shall be there before you or at any rate as soon as you are and crumpy there ought to be something for you dear zak have you got twopence not i said the carrier and if i had it would do him a deal more harm than good run away down the hill my lad and you come to me at the golden cross perhaps as soon as saturday and ill look in my bag for a halfpenny run away boy run away or the bogies will be after you chapter ii the swing of the pickaxe the bakers boy felt that his luck was askew upon this day of his existence for carrier cripps was vexed so much at this sudden demand for his sister that he never even thought of asking the boy to have a glass of homebrewed ale zak what made you send the boy away esther asked when she came downstairs with her bonnet and short cloak on of course i am very foolish but he would have been some little company there now i never thought of it i am doiled a do believe sometimes tramp with you to the bar mysell i wull sarve me right for adoin of it indeed then you wont she answered firmly theres a hard days work for you zak tomorrow with all the christmas parcels and your touch of rheumatics so bad last week why bless the cheeld i be as hearty as ever of course you are zak of course you are and think nought of a sack of potatoes but if you declare to come with me one step backward is the only step i take well well said the carrier glad on the whole to escape a long walk and keep conscience clear when you say a thing etty what good is it round these here parts none would harm ee and none of they furriners be about just now goodnight zak goodnight dear cried esther to shorten departure for cripps was a man of a slow turn of mind and might go on for an hour or two i shall sleep there tonight of course and meet you at the golden cross tomorrow when had i best be there well you know better than i do it might be one oclock or it might be two or it might be halfpast three amost all you have to do is thisto leave word at the bar with sally brown i shall do nothing of the sort she answered i dont like bars and i dont like miss brown i shall look in the yard for the cart brother youll do pretty much as you like that much a may be cocksure of but before he could finish his exposition of his sisters character she was out of sight and he dropped his grumble and doubted his mind about letting her go nor that any one at all of the neighbourhood would hurt her but that there had been much talk about a camp of darkskinned people in cowley marsh not long ago therefore he laid his palm flat from his eyebrows to follow the distance further and seeing no more than the hedges of the lane now growing in the cold wind naked and the track of the lane from wet mud slaking into lightcoloured crustiness without any figures or sound or shadow or sense of life moving anywherehe made for the best side of his cottagedoor and brightened up the firelight the weather had been for some few weeks in a good constitutional english state that is to say it had no settled tendency towards anything or at any rate so it seemed to people who took little heed of it there had been a little rain and then a little snow and a touch of frost and then a sample of fog and so on trying all varieties to suit the british public true britons however had grumbled duly at each successive overture so that the winter was now resolving henceforth only to please itself and this determined will was in the wind the air and the earth itself just when night began to fall on this dark day of december as esther turned the corner from the beckley lane into the road the broad coach road to oxford she met a wind that knew its mind coming over the crest of shotover a stern east wind that whistled sadly over the brown and barren fields and bitterly piped in the roadway to the chill of this blast the sere oakleaves shivered in the dusk and rattled the grey ash saplings bent their naked length to get away from it and the surly stubs of the hedge went to and fro to one another the slimy dips of the path began to rib themselves like the fronds of fern and to shrink into wrinkles and sinewy knobs while the broader puddles though skirred by the breeze found the network of ice veiling over them this as it crusted began to be capable of a consistent quivering with a frail infinitude of spikelets crossing and yet carrying into one another and the cold work marred every now and then by the hurry of the wind that urged it in the main was going on so fast that the face of the water ceased to glisten and instead of ruffling lifted and instead of waving wavered so that as the surface trembled any level eye might see little splinters held as are the ribs and harl of feathers spreading and rising like stems of lace and then with a smooth crisp jostle sinking as the wind flew over them into the quavering consistence of a coverlet of ice esther cripps took little heed of these things or of any other in the matter of weather except to say to herself now and then how bitter cold the wind was and that she feared it would turn to snow and how she longed to be sitting with a cup of aunt exies caudle in the snug room next to the bakehouse or how glad she would be to get only as far as the first house of st clements to see the lamps and the lights in the shops and be quit of this dreary loneliness for now it must be three market days since fearful rumours began to stir in several neighbouring villages which made even strong men discontent with solitude towards nightfall and as for the womenjust now poor esther would rather not think of what they declared it was all very well to pretend to doubt it while hanging the clothes out or turning the mangle but as for laughing out here in the dark and a mile away from the nearest housegood lord how that white owl frightened her being a sensible and brave girl she forced her mind as well as she could into another channel and lifted the cover of the basket in which she had some nice things for aunt exie and then she set off for a bold little run until she was out of breath and trembling at the sound of her own light feet for though all the crippses were known to be of a firm and resolute fibre who could expect a young maid like this to tramp on like a roman sentinel and a lucky thing for her it was that she tried nothing of the sort but glided along with her heart in her mouth and her short skirt tucked up round her lucky also for her that the ground which she so little heeded and so wanted to get over was in that early stage of freezing or of drying to forestall frost in which it deadens sound as much as the later stage enlivens it otherwise it is doubtful whether she would have seen the christmasdressing of the shops in oxford for a little further on she came without so much as a cow in the road or a sheep in a field for company to a dark narrow place where the way hung over the verge of a stony hollow an ancient pit which had once been worked as part of the quarries of headington this had long been of bad repute as a haunted and illomened place and even the carrier himself strong and resolute as he was felt no shame in whispering when he passed by in the moonlight and the name of the place was the gipsys grave therefore as esther cripps approached it she was half inclined to wait and hide herself in a bush or gap until a cart or waggon should come down the hill behind her or an honest dairyman whistling softly to reassure his shadow or even a woman no braver than herself but neither any cart came near nor any other kind of company only the violence of the wind and the keen increase of the frostbite so that the girl made up her mind to put the best foot foremost and run through her terrors at such a pace that none of them could lay hold of her through yards of darkness she skimmed the ground in haste only to be rid of it without looking forward or over her shoulders or anywhere when she could help it and now she was ready to laugh at herself and her stupid fears as she caught through the trees a glimpse of the lights of oxford down in the low land scarcely more than a mile and a half away from her in the joy of relief she was ready to jump and pant without fear of the echoes when suddenly something caught her ears this was not a thing at first to be at all afraid of but only just enough to rouse a little curiosity it seemed to be nothing more nor less than the steady stroke of a pickaxe the sound came from the further corner of the deserted quarry where a crest of soft and shingly rock overhung a briary thicket any person working there would be quite out of sight from the road by reason of the bend of the hollow the blow of the tool came dull and heavy on the dark and frosty wind and esther almost made up her mind to run on and take no heed of it and so she would have done no doubt if she had not been a cripps girl but in this family firm and settled opinions had been handed down concerning the rights of propertythe rights that overcome all wrongs and outlive death the brother leviticus of stow wood had sown a piece of waste at the corner of the clevice with winter carrots for his herd of swine the land being none of his thus far his right so to treat it was not established and therefore likely to be attacked by any rapacious encroacher esther felt all such things keenly and resolved to find out what was going on to this intent she gathered in the skirt of her frock and the fulling of her cloak and fending the twigs from her eyes and bonnet quietly slipped through a gap in the hedge for she knew that a steep track trodden by children in the blackberry season led from this gap to the deep and tangled bottom of the quarry with care and fear she went softly down and followed the curve of the hollow the heavy sound of the pickaxe ceased as she came near and nearer and the muttering of rough voices made her shrink into a nook and listen tell ee i did see zummat moving said a man whom she could dimly make out on the beetling ridge above her by the light of the clearing eastern sky a zummat moving down yonner i tell ee no patience i hant no patience with ee answered a taller man coming forward and speaking with a guttural twang as if the roof of his mouth were imperfect skeary jem is your name and nature give me the pick if thee beest aveared is this job to be finished tonight or not the answer was only a growl or an oath and the swing of the tool began again while esthers fright grew hot and thumped in her heart and made her throat swell it was all she could do to keep quiet breath and prevent herself from screaming for something told her that she was watching a darker crime than theft of roots or robbery of a sheepfold in a short or a long timeshe knew not whichas she still lay hid and dared not show her face above the gorsetuft a sound of sliding and falling shale heavily shook her refuge she drew herself closer and prayed to the lord and clasped her hands before her eyes and cowered expecting to be killed at least and then she peeped forth to know what it was about she never had harmed any mortal body why should she be frightened so in the catch of the breath which comes when sudden courage makes gulp at uncertainty she lifted herself by a stiff old root to know the very worst of it better almost to be killed and be done with than bear the heartpang of this terrible fear and there she saw a thing that struck her so aback with amazement that every timid sense was mute whether the sky began to shed a hovering light or the girls own eyes spread and bred a power of vision from their nervous dilationat any rate she saw in the darkness what she had not seen till now it was the body of a young woman such a body as herself might be lying only with white things round it in the black corner with gravel and earth and pieces of rock rolling down on it there was nothing to frighten a sensible person now that the worst was known perhaps everybody must be buried at some time why should she be frightened so however esther cripps fell faint and lay in that state long enough for tons of burying rock to fall and secret buryers to depart chapter iii oakleaf potatoes of all slow people in this slow place i am quite certain that there is none so slow as cripps the carrier this hot spache as the patient zacchary would perhaps have called it passed the lips of no less a person than old squire oglander he on the th day of december the day after that we began with was hurrying up and down the long straight walk of his kitchen garden and running every now and then to a post of vantage from which he could look over the top of his beloved holly hedge and make out some of the zigzags of the narrow lane from beckley a bitter black frost had now set in and the squire knew that if he wanted anything more fetched out of his ground or anything new put into it it might be weeks before he got another chance of doing it so he made a good bustle and stamped and ran and did all he could to arouse his men who knew him too well to concern themselves about any of his menaces i tell you we are all caught napping thomas i tell you we ought to be ashamed of ourselves the frost is an inch in the ground already artichokes carrots parsnips beetroot even horseradish for our christmas beefand upon my soul a row of potatoes never even dug yet unless i am after you at every cornerwell i am blessed if i dont see our keeping onions now measter ee no call to be so grum none of they thingsll be a haporth the worse the frostll ony swaten em you zany i know all your talk hold your tongue not a glass of beer will i send out if this is all i get for it sweeten them indeed and when we want them are we to dig them with mattocks pray or do you thickheads expect it to thaw to order when the pot is bubbling stir your lazy legs or ill throw every one of you on the workhouse the moment the first snow falls the three men grinned at one another and proceeded leisurely they knew much better than the squire himself what his gentle nature was and that he always expiated a scolding with a jug of beer man and boy said the eldest of them speaking below his breath as if this tyranny had extinguished him in this here gearden have i worked man and boy for threescore year and always gien satisfaction workuss what would his father a said to hear tell in this gearden of workuss workuss well let un coom if a will cant be harder work god knoweth tummuss tummuss you may say that said another lazy rascal shaking his head with his heel on his spade and then wiping his forehead laboriously tis the sweat of our brow tummuss none of em thinks onbut there they was born to be driving of us squire oglander made as if he heard them not and then he hurried to the hedge again and stood on the wall of the leafmould pit and peered over the beard of hollies and this time he spied in the distance cripps or at any rate the tilt of the crippsian cart jogging sedately to the rhythm of the feet of dobbin hurrah cried the squire who was still as young in mind as if he had no body by george we shall be just in time never mind what i said my lads i was a little bit cross i know take out the crumbs from the bottom of your trenches and go two inches deeper our new potatoes are come at last mary come out with a gallon of ale squire oglander having retired now from the army and all warfare was warmly devoted to the arts of peace farming planting gardening breeding training of dogs and so onall of these quiet delights fell softly on a very active mind when the vigour of the body began to fail he loved his farm and he loved his garden and all his attempts at improvement and nothing better than to point out his own mistakes to rash admirers but where is the pleasure of showing things to strangers who know nothing the old mans grand delight of all was to astonish his own daughter his only child grace oglander this it was that made him work so hard at the present moment he was determined to have his kitchen garden in firstrate winter order by the time his daughter should come home from a visit to her aunt at cowley now this sister mrs fermitage had promised to bring home their joint pet gracie in time for the dinner at five oclock that very day and to dine there with them so that it was needful to look alive and to make quick step of everything moreover this good squire had some little insight as behoves a farmer and a sportsman into the ways and meaning of the weather of the neighbourhood he knew as well as a shorttailed fieldmouse that a long frost was coming the sharp dry rustle of the upturned leaves of holly and of ivy the heavy stoop of the sullen sky the patches of spaded mould already browning with powdery crispness the upward shivering look of the grass and the loss of all gloss upon everything and the shuddering rattle in the teeth of a man who opened his mouth to the wind at allmany other things than these as well as all of them were here that any man not blind or deaf or choked in citied ignorance might fall to at once and dig every root of his potatoes but the strange thing in this present matter was that squire oglander was bent not only on digging potatoes but also on planting them this very day forsooth it was one of his fixed dates in the chronicles of the garden that happen what might or be the season whatsoever it chose to be new potatoes and peas he would have by the last day of may at the latest and this without any ignoble resort to forcingpit hotbed or even cold frame under the pure gaze of the sky by that time they must be ready now this may be easy at ventnor or penzance or even bournemouth but in the highlands of oxfordshire it requires some skill and management in the first place both pea and potato must be of a kind that is ready to awake right early and then they must be humoured with a very choice place and after that they must be shielded from the winters rages if all these musts can be complied with and several ifs are solved aright the gardener eager as well as patient may hope to get pleasure from his early work of all men there was none perhaps more capable of hoping than this good squire oglander in his garden and his household or among his friends and neighbours or the world at large he not only tried to see but saw the very best side of everything when things fell out amiss he always looked very wise and shook his head and declared that he had predicted them and before very long he began to find out that they were not so bad as they might have been his ruddy face and blue eyes and sometimes decidedly waggish nose as well as his crisp white hair and way of standing to be looked at let everybody know that here was a man of no great pretension yet true and of kind and happy heart and fit to be relied upon ten thousand such may be found in england and they cannot be too many inside and outside all look alive cried this gentleman running to and fro gracie will be home miss grace i mean and not a bit of fire in the drawingroom grate no christmasboxes for any of you sluts now i did not mean that mary as you might know inside the women and outside the mennow what is this paper for my dear that there cripps sir have a sent un in he be gettin so pertikular quite right quite right business is business no man can be too particular let him sit down and have a pint of ale he wants me to sign this paper does he very well tell him to come next week my fingers are cramped with the wind tell crippsnow dont you be in such a hurry mary cripps is not a marrying man as if i would touch him with a pair of tongs sir a hookham to have a cripps sira man who always smells as if he had been acombing of a horse ah poor mary the grapes are sour tell bachelor cripps to send in the bag and bring me the little truckbasket mary i dare say that will hold them just in time they are only just in time tomorrow would have been a day too late the squire was to pay a guinea for this bushel of early oakleaf potatoes a sort that was warranted to beat the ashleaf by a fortnight and to crop tenfold as much the bag had been sent by the henley coach from a nursery near maidenhead and left at the black horse in st clements to be called for by the beckley carrier stay now cried the squire now i think of it we will unpack the bag in the brewery mary they have had a fire there all the morning and it will save making any mess in here miss grace is coming bless her heart and shell give it to me if she finds any dirt but sir if you please master cripps now just is beginning of his pint of ale and he never hurrieth over that well we dont want cripps we only want the bag jem will bring it into the brewery if you want to sit with cripps cripps is tired i dare say these young mens legs are not fit for much stopcall old thomas hes the best after all if i want a thing done i come back to the old folk after all well sir i dont think you have any reason to say that howsomever here cometh mr kale mr kale if you please you be wanted presently thomas kale the man who had worked so long in the garden there followed his master across the court with the bag of potatoes on his back the weight was a trifle of course being scarcely over half a hundredweight but thomas was too old a hand to make too light of anything ive knowed the time he said setting down the sack on the head of an empty barrel when that there weight would have failed you might say to crook my little finger now make so bolddo you know the raison why thomas we cannot expect to be always so young as we were once you know nout to do wi itless nor nout the raison lie all in the vittels maister the vittels is fallen from what they was thomas you give me no peace with your victuals you must groan to the cook not to me about them now cut the cord why what has cripps been about the bag was made of a stout grey canvas not so thick as sacking and as the creases of the neck began to open under the slackening cord three or four red stripes were shown such as are sometimes to be found in the neck of a leather mailbag when the postmaster has been in a hurry and dropped his wax too plenteously but the stripes in these creases were not dry and brittle as of run sealingwax but clammy and damp as if some thick fluid had oozed from dripping fingers i dont like the look of it cried the old squire cripps should be more careful he has left the bag down at his brother the butchers i am sure they never sent it out like this not that i am of a squeamish order but stillgood god what is this that i see with scarcely time for his cheeks to blanch or his firm old hands to tremble squire oglander took from the mouth of the sack a coil of long bright golden hair the brown shade of the potatoes beneath it set off its glistening beauty he knew it at a glance there was no such hair in all oxfordshire but his gracies a piece of paper was roughly twisted in and out the shining wreath this he spread in the hollow of his palm and then put on his spectacles and read by the waning light these words all you will ever see of her chapter iv cripps in a quandary worth oglander now in his seventieth year although he might be a trifle fat was a truly hale and active man his limbs were as sound as his conscience and he was well content with his life and age he had seen a good deal of the world and of enemies in the stirring times of war but no wrong lay in the bottom of his heart no harm ever done to any one except that he had killed a few frenchmen perhaps as all englishmen used to be forced to do moreover he had what most folk now of the very best kind have almost outlived a staunch and steadfast faith in the management of the world by its maker we are too clever now for all this of course but it must be allowed that this fine old faith bred courage truth and comfort whoever has played this trick with me said the squire as soon as he recovered himself is to say the least of it a blackguard even for a christmas joke it is carrying things a great deal too far i have played and been played many practical jokes when there was nothing else to do in winterquarters and such like but this is beyond thomas run and fetch cripps i will get to the bottom of this i am resolved in a minute or two master cripps came in his face was a little flushed from the power of the compliments paid to mary but his eyes were quite firm and his breeches and gaiters strictly under discipline of the legs inside them servant sir he said touching his forelock nearly of the colour of clover hay all correct i hope squire safe and sound and in good condition thats how i deliver all goods barring the will of the amighty tell me the meaning of this as he spoke mr oglander held up the bright wreath of hair and pointed to the red stains on the sack cripps as behoved a slowminded man stared at the hair and the bag and the squire the roof of the brewery and all the tubs and then began feeling in his hat for orders cripps are you dumb are you tipsy or what or are you too much ashamed of yourself i aint done nort for to be ashamed ofme nor my father avoore me then will you tell me what this means are you going to keep me all night for gods sake squire i never i never seed un i know no more than a stoun i know no more than the dead i do where did you get the bag was it like this who gave it to you have you let it out of sight did you see anybody come near it squire i cant tell ee such a many things they heft up the barg to me at the black horse where the bargs is alwas left for you i took no heed of un out of common and no one have a titched him since but me there was nothing more to be learned from cripps except that he passed the black horse that day a little earlier than usual and had not brought his sister esther who was to have met him at the golden cross he had come home by way of elsfield having something to deliver there and had given a lift to old shepherd wakeling but that could have naught to do with it it was now getting dark and the squire every moment grew more and more uneasy keep all this nonsense to yourself now cripps he said as he stowed the bag under a tub and carefully covered his daughters hair and the piece of paper with a straining sieve it might annoy me very much if this joke went any further you know i can trust thomas to hold his tongue and i hope i can trust you neighbour cripps your honour knoweth what i be answered the loyal carrier ever since i were a boybut there they all knows what i be master cripps with his brain a good piece doiled as he afterwards said of it made his way back to the cart and mounted in his special manner although he was only twoscore years of age he had so much rheumatism in his right kneewhether it sprang from the mud or the ruts or as he believed from the turnpike gatesthat he was bound to get up in this way first he looked well up and down the lane to be sure there was no other cart in sight then he said whoahoa to dobbin who was always quite ready to receive that advice and then he put his left foot on the little step and made sure that it was quite steady throwing his weight on that foot he laid hold of the crupper with his right hand and placed his stiff knee on the flat of the shaft never without a groan or two at this stage he rested to collect his powers and then with decisive action flung his left foot upon the footboard and casting the weight of his body thither came down on the seat with a thump and rattle he was now all right and dobbin felt it and acknowledged the fact with a grateful grunt then carrier cripps took up the reins and made a little flourish with his brassbound whip and dobbin put up his head and started with his most convenient foot i dunno what to make of this here start said cripps to himself and his horse and cart as soon as he had smitten his broad chest long enough to arouse circulation seemeth to me a queer thing truly but i never were a hand at a riddle wugg then dobbin wunnot go home tonight chapter v a ride through the snow meanwhile the old squire with a troubled mind kept talking and walking about and listening for the rumble of his sisters carriage the clank of horses hoofs and the ring of wheels upon the frozen road he could not believe that any one in the world would hurt his darling gracie everybody loved her so and the whole parish was so fond of her and she had such a way of easing every ones perplexities that if any villain durst even think of touching a hair of her blessed headyet whose hair was itwhose hair was it and such a quantity as never could have been cut with her consent this is too much i cannot bear it he said to himself after many a turn and anxious search of the distance joans carriage should have been here long ago my darling would have made them keep their time i cannot stop here i must go to meet them but i need not startle any one to provide for this he just looked in at the kitchen door and told the old cook to keep the dinner back awhile for the roads were so bad that the ladies were almost sure to be behind their time and then he went quietly to the stable where the horses were bedded down and by the light of an old horn lantern saddled and bridled his favourite hack heavy snowclouds had been gathering all the afternoon and now as he passed through a sidegate into the lane and turned his mares head eastward the forward flakes were borne by the sharp wind into his white whiskers we shall have a coarse night of it i doubt he said to himself as he buttoned his coat at every turn of the lane he hoped to meet his sisters chariot labouring up the slippery track with the coalblack horses gray with snow and somebody well wrapped up inside to make him laugh at his childish fears but corner after corner he turned and met no carriage no cart no horse nor even so much as a man afoot only the snow getting thicker and sharper and the wind beginning to wail to it the ruts of the lane grew more distinct as their combs of frozen mud attracted and held the driving whiteness and the frogs of heavy carthorses might be traced by the hoary increment then in three or four minutes a silvery greyness cast by the brown face of the roadway underlying the skin of snow glistened between steep hedgerows wherein the depth of darkness rested soon even these showed traitor members and began to hang the white feather forth where drooping spray or jutting thicket stopped the course of the laden air every hoof of the horse fell softer than it had fallen the step before and the old man stooped to heed his reins as his hoary eyebrows crusted fear struck colder to his heart than frost as he turned the last corner of his way without meeting presence or token of his sister or darling daughter in the deepening snow he drew his horse up under the two great yewtrees that overhung his sisters gate and fumbled in the dark for the handle the close heavy gates were locked and barred and nothing had lately passed through them then he hoped that the weather might have stopped the carriage and he tugged out the heavy bronze lionshead in the pillar which was the bellpull the bell in the porch of the house clanged deeply and the mastiff heavily bayed at him but he had to make the bell clang thrice before any servant answered it who be you there at last a gruff voice asked without stretch of courtesy this sort of weather come ringing like that if ee say much more ill let the big dog loose open the gate you young oaf cried the squire i suppose you are one of the new lot eh not to know me worth oglander why couldnt you have said so then the surly fellow answered as he slowly opened one leaf of the gate sweeping a fringe of snow back such a fellow wouldnt be with me half a day are you too big for your work sir run on before me you piecrust in pumps or you shall taste my whip sir the footman for once in his life took his feet up and ran in a bluster of rage and terror to the front door which he had left wide open to secure a retreat from violence mr oglander struck his mare and she started so that he scarcely pulled her head up under the coigne of his sisters porch what is all this i would beg to know if you think to frighten me you are mistaken oh worth is it worth whatever do you mean by making such a commotion three or four frightened maids were peeping safe in the gloom of the entrancehall while the lady of the house came forward bravely in the lamplight i will speak to you presently joan said the squire as he vainly searched with a falling heart for some dear face behind her here bob i know you at any rate take the old mare to the stable then with a sign to his sister he followed her softly into the diningroom at a glance he saw that she had dined alone and he fell into a chair and could not speak have you brought back the stockings why how ill you look the cold has been too much for you brother you should not have come out what was grace doing to let where is my daughter grace your daughter grace my niece grace why at home in her fathers house to be sure worth are your wits wandering when did grace leave you at three oclock yesterday how can you ask when you sent in such hot haste for her you might be quite sure that she would not linger i thought it ratherlet me tell you i never sent for grace i have not seen her mrs fermitage looked at her brother steadily with one hand fencing her forehead she knew that he was of no drunken kindyet once in a way a man might take too muchespecially in such weather but he answered her gaze with such eyes that she came up to him and began to tremble i tell you joan i never sent for grace if you dont know where she isnone but god knows i have told you all his sister answered catching her breath at every word almosta letter came from you overruling the whole of our arrangementyou were not ill but you wanted her for some particular purpose she was to walk and you would meet her and walk she did poor darling and i was so hurt that i would not send you let her go joan you let her go it was a piece of your proud temper her death lies at your door and so will mine mr oglander was very sorry as soon as he had spoken thus unjustly but the deep pang of the heart devoured any qualms of conscience are you sure that you let her go are you sure that she is not in this house now he cried coming up to his sister and taking both hands to be sure of her she must be here and you are joking with me worth she left this house at two oclock by that timepiece yesterday instead of today as we meant to do she would not let any one go with her because you were coming down the hill to meet her not expecting to go home that day she had a pair of my silk stockings on becausewell i need not go into thatand knowing what a darling little fidget she is i thought she had sent you back with them and to make your peace for so flurrying me have you nothing more to tell me joan i shall go mad while you dwell on your stockings who brought that letter what is become of it did you see it can you think of anything oh joan you women are so quickwitted surely you can think of something mrs fermitage knew what her brother meant but no sign would she show of it the squire was thinking of a little touch of something that might have grown up into love if grace had not been so shy about it and so full of doubts as to what she ought to do her aunt had been anxious to help this forward but not for the world to speak of it concerning the letter i only just saw it i was upwell well i mean i happened to have something to do in my own room then the dear creature knocked at my door and i could not let her in at the moment you were doing your wigwell well go on i was doing nothing of the kindyour anxiety need not make you rude worth however she put the letter under the door and i saw that it was your handwriting and so urgent that i was quite flurried and she was off in two minutes without my even kissing her oh poor dear my little dear she said goodbye through the keyhole and could not wait for me even to kiss her at this thought the elderly lady broke down and could for the moment do nothing but sob dear heart dear heart cried the squire who was deeply attached to his sister dont take on so my dear good joan we know of no harm as yetthat isfor he thought of the coil of hair but with strong effort forbore to speak of itnothing i mean in any way positive or disastrous she may have you knowshe may have taken it into her head toto leave us for awhile joan to run away to elope not she she is the last girl in the world to do it whatever may have happened she has not done that you ought to know better than that worth perhaps i do i have no more time to talk of that or any other thing i shall hurry into oxford and see john smith and let everybody know of it what do i care what people think send a man on horseback to beckley at once have you any man worth a pinch of salt you are always changing so i cannot keep cripples or sots dear brother take any one you please of them any one who will deign to come you should say deep snow tries the mettle of newcomers chapter vi the public of the public meanwhile esther cripps who perhaps could have thrown some light on this strange affair was very uneasy in her mind she had not heard of course as yet that grace oglander was missing but she could not get rid of the fright she had felt and the dread of some dark secret her sisterinlaw was in such a condition that she must not be told of it and as for her brother exodus it would be worse than useless to speak to him he had taken it into his head ever since that business with the college gent that his sister was not rightmindedthat she dreamed things and imagined things and that anything she liked to say should be listened to and thought no more of and baker cripps was one of those men from whose minds no hydraulic power can lift an idealaid once laid for ever esther had no one to tell her tale to she longed to be home at beckley but there had been such symptoms with the bakers wife that a woman of the largest experience to be found in oxford declared that there was another coming this was not so but still as all the women said it might have been and where was the man to lay down the law to them that had been through it the whole of this was made quite right in the end and everybody satisfied but it prevented poor esther from going to the golden cross as she should have done and the carrier having a little tiff with his brother about a sack of meal as long ago as michaelmas left him to bake his own bread and would rather drive over his dinner than dine with him the days of the week are hard to follow as everybody must have long found out but still from tuesday to saturday is a considerable time to think of master cripps had two carrying days two great days of long voyaging not that he refrained from coasting here and there about the parish or up and down a lane or two on days of briefer enterprise or refused to take some washings round for he was not the man to be ashamed of earning sixpence honourably but now such weather had set in that even cripps with his active turn and pride in his honest calling was forced to stay at home and boil the bones the butcher sent him and nurse his stiff knee and smoke his pipe and go no further than his bed of hardy kail or dobbins stable except that when the sun went downif it ever got up for aught he knewhis social instincts so awoke that he managed to go to the corner of the lane where the blacksmith kept the publichouse this was a most respectable house frequented very quietly master cripps from his intercourse with the world and leading position in beckley as well as his pleasant way of letting other people talk and nodding when their words were wisdomcripps had long been accepted as the oracle and he liked it even therein his brightest moments when he smoked his pipe and thought leaving emptier folk to waste the income of their brain in words and even when he had been roused up to settle some vast question by a brief emphatic utterancehis satisfaction was now alloyed not from any threat of rival wisdomthat was hopelessbut from the universal call for a guiding judgment from him the whole of beckley village now was more upset than had been known for thirty years and upward ever since napoleon had been expected to encamp at carfax and all the university went into white gaiters against him there had been no such stir of parochial mind as now was heaving cripps could remember the former movement and how his father had lost wisdom by saying that nothing would come of itwhereas the greatest things came of it the tailor was bankrupt by making breeches which the government would not pay for the publican bought a horse and defied his brewer on the strength of it and the parishclerk limped for the rest of his life through the loss of two toes when tipsytherefore zacchary cripps was now determined to hide his opinion when the mind is in this uncertain state it fails of receiving that consideration which it is slowly exerting if cripps had stood up and rashly spoken he must have carried all before him whereas now he felt and was grieved to feel that shallow fellows were taking his place by dint of decisive ignorance this friday evening everybody who had teeth to face the arrowy wind came into the dusty anvil well laden with enormous rumours phil hiss the blacksmith had a daughter who served him as a barmaid amelia or mealy hiss a year or two older than miss oglander and in the simple country fashion setting birth and rank aside a true ally and favourite now some old woman in beckley had said as long ago as yesterday that she could not believe but what mealy hiss who dressed herself so outrageous knew a deal more than she dared speak out concerning that wonderful unkid thing about the squires daughter for her part this old woman was sure that a young man lay at the bottom of it them good young ladies that went to the school and made up soup and suchlike was not a bit better than the rest of us and if butter wouldnt melt in their mouths pitchforks wouldnt choke them she would say no more it was no concern of hers and everybody knew what she was but as sure as her copper burst that morning something would come out ere long and mealy would be at the bottom of it miss amelia hiss before she lit her two tallowcandleswhich never was allowed to be done till a quart of beer had been called forknew right well that all her wits must be brought into use that evening a young man who had a liking for her which she was beginning to think about came in before his time to tell her all that gammer gurdon said wherefore she put on her new neckribbon believed to have come express from london and her agate brooch and other most imposing properties with the confidence of all these she drew the ale and kept her distance for an hour or so these tactics answered young men old men and good women who came of course for their husbands sakes soberly took their little drop of beer nodded to one another and said little pressure lay on heart and mind and natures safetyvalve the tongue was sat upon by prudence but this of course could not last long little jerkings of short questions broke the crust of silence lips from blowing froth of beer began to relax their grimness eyelids that had drooped went up and winks grew into friendly gaze and everybody began to beg everybodys pardon less the genial power of good ale and the presence of old friends were working on the solid english hearts and every man was ready for his neighbour to say something hiss the blacksmith and the landlord felt that on his heavy shoulders lay the duty of promoting warmth and cordiality he sat without a coat as usual and his woolsey sleeves rolled back displayed the proper might of arm in one grimy hand he held a pipe at which he had given the final puff and in the other a broadrimmed penny ready to drop it into the balance of the brass tobaccobox and open it for a fresh supply first he glanced at the door to be sure that his daughter mealy could not hear for ever since her mothers death he had stood in some awe of mealy and then receiving from zacchary cripps a nod of grave encouragement he fixed his eyes on him through the smoke and uttered what all were inditing of i call this a very rum start i do about poor squires daughter the public of the public gazed with admiring approval at him the sentiment was their own and he had put it well and briefly in different ways according to the state and manner of each of them they let him know that he was right and might hold on by what he said then master hiss grew proud of this and left it for some other body to bear the weight of thinking out but even before his broad forefinger had quite finished with his pipe and pressed the crown of fuel flat a man of no particular wisdom and without much money could not check a weak desire to say something striking his name was batts and he kept a shop and many things in it which he could not sell before he spoke he took precautions to secure an audience by standing up and rapping the table with the heel of his halfpint mug hear hear cried some young fellow and batts was afraid that he had gone too far gentlemen said grocer batts the very same man who had threatened to put his son into the carrying line i bows in course to superior wisdom and them as is always to and fro but every man must think his thoughts right or wrong and speak them out and not be afeared of no one and my mind is that in this here business we be all of us going to work the wrong way altogether as no one had any sense as yet of having gone to work at all in this or any other matter and several men had made up their minds to be thrown out of work on the saturday night if the bitter weather lasted this great speech of grocer batts created some confusion let un go to work hisself what do he know about work altogether wrong give me the sawdust for to clear my throat these and stronger exclamations showed poor batts that it would have been better for trade if he had held his tongue he hid his discomfiture in his mug and made believe to drink although it had ever so long been empty but carrier cripps had a generous soul he did not owe so much as a halfpenny piece to master batts neither did he expect to make a single halfpenny out of himquite the contrary in fact and yet he came to his rescue touching what neighbour batts have said he began in his slow and steadfast voice it may be neither here nor there and all of us be liable in our best of times to error but i do believe as he means well and hath a good deal inside him and a large family to put up with he may be right and all us in the wrong time will show with patience i have knowed so many things as looked at first unlikely come true as gospel in the end and so many things i were sure of turn out quite contrairy that whenever a man hath aught to say i likes to hearken to him there now i hant no more to say and i leave you to make the best of it zacchary rose for his time was up he saw that hot words might ensue and he detested brawling moreover although he did not always keep strict time with his horse and cart no man among the living could be more punctual to his pillow with kind goodnights from all he passed and left the smoky scene behind as he stopped at the bar to say goodbye and to pay his score to amelia for whom he had a liking a short quick rosy man came in shaking snow from his boots and seeming to have lost his way that night by the light from the bar the carrier knew him and was about to speak to him but received a sign to hold his tongue and pass on without notice clumsily enough he did as he was bidden and went forth puzzled in his homely pate by this new piece of mystery for the man who passed him was john smith not as yet wellknown but held by all who had experience of him to be the shrewdest man in oxford this man quietly went into the sanded parlour and took his glass and showed good manners to the company they set him down as a wayfarer but a pleasant one and well to do and as words began to kindle with the friction of opinions he listened to all that was said but did not presume to side with any one chapter vii the best foot foremost the arrows of the snowy wind came shooting over shotover it was saturday now of that same week with which we began on tuesday the mercury during those four days had not risen once above deg of fahrenheit and now it stood about deg and lower than that in the river meadows trusty and resolute dobbin never had a harder job than now some parts of headington hill give pretty smart collarwork in the best of times and now with deep snow scarred by hoofs and ridged by wheels but not worn down hard it seemed for a horse however sagacious to judge what to do dobbin had seen snow ere now and gone through a good deal of it but that was before the snow had fallen so thickly on his own mane and tail and even his wise eyebrows that was in the golden days when youth and quick impatience moved him and the biggest flint before his wheel was crushed with a snort at the roadsurveyor but now he was come to a different state of body and therefore of spirit too at his time of life it would not do to be extravagant of strength it was not comely to kick up the heels neither was it wise to cherish indignation at the whip so now on the homeward road with a heavy christmasladen cart to drag this fine old horse took good care of himself and having only a choice of evils chose the least that he could find alas the smallest that he could find were great and very heavy ills scarcely any man stops to think of the many weary cares that weigh upon the back of an honest horse men are eloquent on the trouble that sits behind the horseman but the silent horse may bear all that and the troublesome man in the saddle to boot without any poet to pity him dobbin knew all this but was too much of a horse to dwell on it he kept his tongue well under bit and his eyes in sagacious blinkers and sturdily up the hill he stepped while cripps his master trudged beside him every talented man must think whenever he walks beside a horse of the superior talents of the horsethe bounty of nature in four curved legs the pleasure there must be in timing them the pride of the hard and goutless feet the glory of the mane to which the human beard is no more than seaweed in a billow the power of blowing which no man has in a comely and decorous form and last not least the final blessing of terminating usefully in a tail zacchary cripps was a man of five talents and traded with them wisely but often as he walked beside his horse and smelled his superiority he became quite humble and wiped his head and put his whip back in the cart again the horse on the other hand looked up to zacchary with soft faith and love he knew that his master could not be expected quite to understand the ways a horse is bound to have of getting on in harnessthe hundreds of things that must needs be doneand done in proper order toothe duty of going always like a piece of the finest music with chains and shafts and buckles and hard leather to be harmonized and the load which men are not born to drag until they make it for themselves dobbin felt the difference but he never grumbled as men do he made the best of the situation and it was a hard one the hill was strong against the collar and by reason of the snow zigzag and the corkscrew tactics could not be resorted to at all of these he was a dab by dint of steep experience but now the long hill must be breasted and both shoulders set to it the ruts were as slippery as glass and did not altogether fit the wheels he had behind him and in spite of the spikes which the blacksmith gave him the snow balled on his hairy feet so he stopped and shook himself and panted with large resolutions and cripps from his capacious pockets fetched the two oak wedges and pushed one under either wheel while esther who was coming home at last jumped from her seat to help the load and patted dobbins kind nose and said a word or two to cheer him the best harse as ever looked through a bridle zacchary declared across his mane but he must be hoomered with his own way now same as the rest on us when us grows old etty my dear no call for you to come down and catch chilblains zak i am going to push behind i am not big enough to do much good but i would rather be alongside of you through this here bend of the road i would for now the dusk was gathering in as they toiled up the lonesome and snowy road where it overhung the gipsys grave this here bend be as good as any other said cripps though himself afraid of it what ails you girl what hath ailed you ever since out of oxford town you come is it a jail thou be coming home to oxford turns the head of thee now zak you know better than that i would liefer be at beckley any day but i have been that frightened since i passed this road on tuesday night that scarce a morsel could i eat or drink and never sleep for dreaming frightened child lord bless my heart you make me creep by talking so there wait till we be in our own lanecant spare the time now to speak of it oh but zak if you please you must i have had it on my mind so long and i kept it for you till we got to the place that you might go and see to it etty now this is childish stuff no time to hearken to any such tellup enough to do the lord knows there be without no foolish stories it is not a foolish story zak it is what i saw with my own eyes we are close to the place it was in a dark hollow just below the road on here i will show you and then i will stand by the cart while you go and seek into it i wunt leave the haigh road for any one i tell ee all these goods is committed to my charge and my dooty is to stick to them a likely thing as id leave the cart to be robbed in that there sort of way ah ha theyd soon find out i reckon what zacchary cripps is made of ah we all know how brave you are dear zak and perhaps you wouldnt like to leave me brother no no of course not how could i do it all by yourself and the weather getting dark hup hup dobbin there best foot foremost kills the hill but esther was even more strongly set to tell the story and relieve her mind than zacchary was to relieve his mind by turning a deaf ear to all of it nevertheless she might have failed if it had not been for a lucky chance dobbin after a very fine rush and spirited bodily tug at the shafts was suddenly forced to pull up and pant and spread his legs to keep where he was until his wind should come back again and he stopped with the offwheel of the cart within a few yards of the gap in the hedge where esther began her search that night she knew the place at a glance although in the snow it looked so different and she ran to the gap and peeped as if she expected to see it all again in all the beauty of fair earth few things are more beautiful than snow on clustering ivyleaves wednesdays fall had been shaken off for even in the coldest weather jealous winds and evaporation soon clear foliage of snow but a little powdery shed of flakes had come at noon that very day like the flitting of a fairy and every delicate star shone crisply in its cupped or pillowed rest the girl was afraid to shake a leaf because she had her best bonnet on therefore she drew back and called the reluctant zacchary to gaze nort but a sight of snow said he it hath almost filled old quarry up harse have rested and so have we shant be home by candlelight wugg then dobbinwugg then wilt a stop brother stop dont be in such a hurry something i must tell you now that i have been feared to tell anybody else it was so dreadfully terrible do you see anything in the snow down there as i am a sinner there be something moving jump up into the cart girl i shall never get round with my things tonight there is something there zak that will never move again there is the dead body of a woman there no romantics no romantics the carrier answered as he turned away but his cheeks beneath a weeks growth of beard turned as white as the snow in the buckthorn no living man might scare himbut a woman and a dead one come zak cried esther having seen much worse than she was likely now to see you cannot be afraid of romantics zak come here and i will show thee driven by shame and curiosity the valiant cripps came back to her and even allowed himself to be led a little way through the gap into the deep untrodden and drifted snow she took him as far as a corner whence the nook of the quarry was visible and there with trembling fingers pointed to a vast billow of pure white piled by the driving east wind over the grave as she thought of the murdered one enough he said having heard her tale and becoming at once a man again in the face of something real my dear what a fright thou must have had how couldst thou have kept it all this time i would not tell thee our news at home for fear of tarrifying thee in the cold hath no one to oxford told thee told me what oh zak dear zak i am so frightened i can hardly stand then run girl run we must go home fast as ever we can for constable he took her to the cart and reckless of dobbins indignation lashed him up the hill and made him trot the whole length of beckley lane then threw a sack over his loins and left his christmas parcels in the frost and snow while he hurried to squire oglander chapter viii balderdash worth oglander sat in his old oak chair weary and very low of heart but not altogether broken down he had not been in bed since last monday night and had slept if at all in the saddle or on the roof of the henley and maidenhead coach for miles he had scoured the country round until his three horses quite broke down with the weather so much against them and all the bran to be got in the villages was made away with in mashes one of these horses got the pipes and had to be tickled before he could eat the squire cared not a button for this the most particular of mankind concerning what is grossly and contemptuously if not carnivorously spoken of as horseflesh forgets his tender feelings towards the noblest of all animals when his own flesh and blood come into competition with them but ride and lash and spur as he might the old squire made no discovery his daughter his only child in whom all the rest of his old life lived and loved was gone and lost not even leaving knowledge of where she lay or surety of a better meeting his faith in god was true and firm for on the whole he was a pious man although no great professor and if it had pleased the lord to take his only joy from his old age he could have tried to bear it but thus to lose her without goodbye without even knowing how the loss befell and with the deep misery of doubting what she might herself have doneonly a chilly stoic or a remarkably warm christian could have borne it with resignation the squire was neither of these but only a simple kind and lovinghearted gentleman with many faults and among them a habit of expecting the lord to favour him perpetually and of this he could not quit himself in the deepest tribulation but still expected all things to be tempered to his happiness according to his own ideas of what happiness should be the clergyman of the parish a good and zealous man had called upon him and with many words had proved how thankful he was bound to be for this kindlyordered chastisement the squire however could not see it he listened with his old politeness but a sad and weary face and quietly said that the words were good but he could not yet enter into them hereat the parson withdrew to wait for a softer and wiser season and now in the dusk of this cold dark day squire oglander sat gazing from the window of his diningroom with his head fallen back and his white chin up and hardworn hands clasped languidly his heavy eyes dwelled on the dreary snow that buried his daughters handiworkthe dwarf plants not to be traced and the tall ones only as soft hillocks like the tufts in a great white counterpane and more and more as the twilight deepened and the curves of white grew dim he kept repeating below his voice her windingsheet her windingsheet and her pretty eyes wide open perhaps now sir if you please you mustyou must cried mary hookham his best maid trotting in with her thumbs turned back from a right hot dish and her lips up as if she were longing to kiss him to let out her feelings here be a duster by way of a cloth not to scorch the table against miss grace comes home again sir if you please you must ate a bit not a bit have you aten sin toosday and it is enough to kill a carriers horse take on as my mother have often said take on as you must if your heart is right when the hand of the lord is upon you but never take off with your victuals and a hearty good woman my mother is and have seen much tribulation you never would repent sir of hearkening to me and of trying of her till such time as poor miss grace comes back and not a penny would she charge you let her come if she will he answered without thinking twice about it for he paid no heed to household matters in his present trouble let her come if you wish it mary at any rate she can do no harm she will do a mort of good sir but now do try to ate a bit my mother will make you if you have her sir the old man did his best to eat for he knew that he must keep his strength up to abide the end of it and mary without asking leave lit four good candles and drew the curtains and made the fire cheerful all of us has our troubles said mary but these here pickles is wonderful you are a good girl answered the squire and you deserve a good husband now if either the man from oxford or young mr overshute should come show them in directly but i can see no other person no more thank you take all away mary oh my what a precious little bit youve had but as sure as my name is mary hookham you shall have three glasses of port sir you dont keep no butler because you knows better and no housekeeper because you dont know mother likewise miss grace is so cleverbut there now if she stay long for her honeymoon a housekeeper you must have sir the master was tempted to ask what she meant but he scarcely thought it worth while perhaps by pressure of advice from all the womankind within his doors whenever they could get hold of him he had been sped on many bootless errands as was natural for without any ground except that of their hearts all the gentler bosoms of the place were filled with large belief that this was only a lovely love affair russel overshute the heir of the overshutes of shotover was a young man who could speak for himself and did it sometimes too strongly he had long been taken prisoner by the sweet spell of grace oglander and being of a bold and fearless order he had so avowed himself but her father had always been against him not from personal dislike but simply because he could not bear his wild political sentiments worth oglander was as staunch an old tory as ever stood in buckram although in social and domestic matters perhaps almost too gentle radical and rascal were upon his tongue the selfsame word and he passed the salt with the back of his hand to even a mild reformer and now as he drank his glass of port by dint of marys management and did his best to think about it as he always used to do the door of the room was thrown open strongly and in strode russel overshute will you kindly leave the room he said to the sedulous mary i wish to say a few words to the squire of a private nature this young gentleman was a favourite with maidservants everywhere because he always spoke to them just the same as if they was ladies every housemaid now demands this in our advanced intelligence and doubtless she is right but forty years ago it was otherwise and polly my dear and a chuck of the chin were not as yet vile antiquity mary made a bob of the order still taught at the villageschool and set a glass for the gentleman and simpered and departed shake hands with me squire said overshute as mr oglander arose with cold dignity and bowed to him you have sent for me i rode over at once the moment that i heard of it i returned from london this afternoon having been there for a fortnight when i heard the news i was thunderstruck what can i do to help you i will not shake hands with you answered the squire until you have solemnly pledged your honour that you know nothing of thisof thisthere i have no word for it mr oglander trembled though his eyes were stern his last hope of his daughters life lay in the young man before him and bitterly as he would have felt the treachery of his only child and deeply as he despised himself for harbouring such a suspicionyet even that disgrace and blow would be better than the alternative the only alternativeher death i should have thought it quite needless young overshute answered with some disdain until he observed the fathers face so broken down with misery from any one but you sir it would have been an insult if you do not know the overshutes you ought to know your own daughter but against her willagainst her will say that you took her against her will you have been from home for what else was it tell me the truth russel overshuteonly the truth and i will forgive you you have nothing to forgive sir upon the word of an englishman i hadnt even heard of it the old man watched his clear keen eyes with deep tears gathering in his own then russel took his hand and led him tenderly to his hard oak chair for a minute or two not a word was said the young man doubting what to say and the old one really not caring whether he ever spoke again at last he looked up and spread both hands as if he groped forth from a heavy dream and the rheumatism from so much nightwork caught him in both shoulderblades what is itwhat is it he cried i have lived a long time in this wicked world and i have not found it painful my dear sir his visitor answered pitying him sincerely and hiding like a man his own deep heartburn of anxiety may i say without your being in the least degree offended what i fancyor at least i mean a thing that has occurred to me you will take it for its worth most likely you will laugh at it but taking my chance of that may i say it will you promise not to be angry i wish i could be angry russel what have i to be angry for a terrible wrong if i am right but not a purely hopeless one i have not had time to think it out because i have been hurried so but right or wrong what i think is thisthe whole is a foul scheme of luke sharps luke sharp my own solicitor the most respectable man in oxford overshute you have made me hope and then you dash me with balderdash well sir i have no evidence at all but i go by something i heard in london which supplies the strongest motive and i know from my own family affairs what luke sharp will do when he has strong motive i beg you to keep my guess quite secret not that i fear a score of such fellows but that he would be ten times craftier if he thought we suspected him and he is crafty enough without that as his principal client the devil knows i will not speak of it the squire answered such a crotchet is not worth speaking of and it might get you into great trouble with one thing and another now i am so knocked about that i cannot put two and two together but one thing really comforts me my dear sir i am so glad what is it that a man of your old family russel and at the same time of such new ways is still enabled by the grace of god to retain his faith in the devil while luke sharp lives i cannot lose it he answered with a bitter smile that man is too deep and consummate a villain to be uninspired but now sir we have no time to lose you tell me what you have done and then i will tell you what i have been thinking of unless you are too exhausted for the old man in spite of fierce anxiety long suspense and keen excitement began to be so overpowered with downright bodily weariness that now he could scarcely keep his head from nodding and his eyes from closing the hope which had roused him when overshute entered was gone and despair took the place of it tired body and sad mind had but a very low heart to work them russel with a strong mans pity and the love which must arise between one man and another whenever small vanity vanishes watched the creeping shades of slumber soften the lines of the harrowed face as evening steals along a hillside where the sun has tyrannised and spreads the withering and the wearying of the day with gentleness and brings relief to rugged points and breadth of calm to everything so the squires fine old face relaxed in slumbers halo and tranquil ease began to settle on each yielding lineament when open flew the door of the room and mary at the top of her voice exclaimed plaize sir maister cripps be here chapter ix cripps in affliction confound that cripps young overshute cried with irritation getting the better of his larger elements while the squire slowly awoke and stared and rubbed his gray eyelashes and said that he really was almost falling off and he ought to be quite ashamed of himself then he begged his visitors pardon for bad manners and asked what the matter was sir it is only that fool cripps said the young man still in vexation and signing to mary to go and to shut the door some trumpery parcel of course they might have let you rest for a minute or two no sir no if you plaize sir no cried mary advancing with her hands up maister cripps have seen something terrible and he hath come straight to his worship he be that out of breath that he was aforced to lay hold of me before he could stand amost he must have met them sheepstealers sheepstealing again said mr oglander who was an active magistrate well let him come in i have troubles of my own but i must attend to my duty let me attend to it interposed the other being also one of the great unpaid you must not be pestered with such things now try to get some little rest while i attend to this cripps affair i am much obliged to you answered the squire rising and looking wideawake but i will hear what he has to say myself of course i shall be too glad of your aid if you are not in a hurry mr overshute knew that this fine old justice although so good in the main was not entirely free from foibles of which there was none more conspicuous than a keen and resolute jealousy if any brother magistrate dared to meddle with beckley matters therefore russel for the time withdrew but promised to return in half an hour not only for the sake of consulting with the squire but also because he suspected that cripps might be come on an errand different from what mary had imagined meanwhile the carrier could hardly be kept from bursting in headforemost betty the cook laid hold of him in the passage while he was short of breath but he pushed at even her although he ought to have known better manners betty was also in a state of mind at having cooked no dinner worth speaking of since tuesday and cripps if his wits had been about him must have yielded space and bowed betty however was nearly as wide and a great deal thicker than he was and she spread forth two great arms that might have stopped even dobbin with a load downhill at last the signal was passed that cripps might now come on and tell his tale and he felt as if he should have served them right by refusing to say anything but when he saw the squires jovial face drawn thin with misery and his sturdy form unlike itself and the soft puzzled manner in lieu of the old distinct demand to know everything zacchary cripps came forward gently and thought of what he had to tell with fear what is it my good fellow asked the squire perceiving his hesitation nothing amiss with your household i sincerely hope my friend you are a fortunate man in one thingyou have had no children yet ay ay your worship is right enough there the lord lends they and he takes them away and the taking be worse than the giving was good now master cripps we must not talk so all is meant for the best i doubt her may be her may be cripps replied the lord is the one to pronounce upon that knowing his own maning best but he do give very hard measure some time to them as have never desarved it now there be your poor miss grace for instance as nice a young lady as ever lived the purtiest ever come out of a bed that humble too and gracious always that cripps she would saynay master crippsshe always give me my proper title even on a dirty linen daymaster cripps her always said let me mark it off in your hat for youno matter whether it was my best hat or the one with the grease come throughmaster cripps she always say let me mark it out for you very well cripps i know all that it is nothing to what my grace was and i hope with gods blessing she will do it again but what is it you are so full of cripps the carrier felt in the crown of his hat and then inside the lining as if he had something entered there to help him in this predicament and then he turned away to wipeas if the weather was very wetthe drops of the hedge from the daze of his eyes and after that he could not help himself but out with everything i knows where miss gracie be he began with a little defiance as if after all it was nothing to him but a thing that he might have a bet about i knows where our miss gracie liesdead and colddead and coldwithout no coffin nor a windingsheetthe purty crature the purty craturethere what a fool i be good lord master cripps at the picture himself had drawn was taken with a short fit of sobs and turned away partly to hunt for his kercher and partly to shun the poor squires eyes mr oglander slowly laid down the pen which he had taken for notes of a case and standing as firm as his own great oaktree famous in that neighbourhood gave no sign of the shock except in the colour of his face and the brightness of his gaze go on cripps as soon as you can he said in a calm and gentle voice try not to keep me waiting cripps i be trying i be trying all i knows the blessed angel be dead and buried close to tickusss tatie crop in the corner of bramble quarry at least i mean tickusss taties was there but he dug them a fortnight come monday he did the corner of the gipsys grave as they call it who found it how do you know it esther was there she seed the whole of it before the snow comelast tuesday night tuesday night ah tuesday nightfor the moment the old man had lost his clearness it cant have been tuesday nightit was wednesday when i rode down to my sisters cripps your sister must have dreamed it my darling was then at her aunts quite safe you have frightened me for nothing cripps i am glad with all my heart cried zacchary i am quite sure it were tuesday night because of mrs exie and your worship knows best of the days no doubt thank the lord for all his mercies well seeing now it were somebody else in no ways particular and perhaps one of them gipsy girls as took the fever to cowley if your worship will take your pen again i will tell you all as esther seedtwo men with a pickaxe working where the stone overhangeth so and the corpse of a nice young woman laid for the stone to bury it natural no harm at all in the world when you come to think being nought of a christian body and they let go the rock and it come down over to save all infection lord what a turn that etty gived me all about a trifle the carrier wiped his forehead and smiled and wont i give it well to her poor girl it is no trifle cripps whoever it may have been but stopi am all abroad it was tuesday afternoon when my poor darling left mrs fermitage and to the quarry across the fields from the way she would come is not half a milehalf a mile of fields and hedgerows oh cripps it was my daughter her maight a been sure enough said cripps in whom the reflective vein for the moment had crossed the sentimentalsure enough her maight a been a pasture meadow and a field of rape and gibbss turnips and then a fallow and then into tickusss tatieshalf an hour maight a done the carryingand consarning of the restyour worship now when did she leave the lady can you count the time of it zacchary now the will of the lord be done without calculation my grave is all i care to count on if my grace lies buried so but before i go to it please god i will find out who has done it chapter x all dead against him now do ee put on a muffler sir cried mary running out with her arms full as mr oglander set forth in the bitter air without overcoat but ready to meet everything at the door was his old whitechapel cart with a fresh young colt between the shafts pawing the snow and snorting the only one of his little stud not lamed by rugged travelling the floor of the cart was jingling with iron tools as the young horse shook himself and the squires groom and two gardeners were ready to jump in when called for they stamped a little and flapped their bodies as if they would like a cordial but their master was too busy with his own heart to remember it if we be goin to dig some hours in such weather as this be mr kale managed to whisperbest way put in a good brandy flask mary my dear with masters leave poor soul a cant heed everything go along answered mary you have had enough shamed i be of you to think of such things and to look at that poor hangel so plaize your worship let me drive said cripps who was going to sit in front a young horse and you at your time of life and all this trouble over you give me the reins my friend cried his worship and cripps in some dread for his neck obeyed the men jumped in and the young horse started at a rather dangerous pace many a time had miss grace fed him and he used to follow her like a lamb he will take us safe enough said the squire he seems to know what he is going for not another word was spoken until they came to the gap at the verge of the quarry where the frosty moon shone through it tie him here said the master shortly as the groom produced his ringrope and throw the big cloth over him now all of you come and cripps go first scared as they were they could not in shame decline the old mans orders and the sturdy cripps with a spade on his shoulders led through the drifted thicket behind him plodded the squire with an unlit lantern in one hand and a stout oak staff in the other the moonlight glistening in his long white hair and sparkling frost in his hoary beard the snow before them showed no print larger than the pad of an old dogfox pursuing the spluttering track of a pheasants spurs and it crunched beneath their boots with the crusty impact of crisp severance all around was white and waste with depth of unknown loneliness and master cripps said for the rest of his life that he could not tell what he was about to do it after many flounderings in and out of hollow places they came to the corner of the quarrydingle and found it entirely choked with snow the driving of the northeast wind had gathered as into a funnel there and had stacked the snow of many acres in a hollow of less than half a rood the men stopped short where the gaunt brown fern and then the furze and then the hazels in rising tier waded out of sight and behind them even some ashsaplings scarcely had a knuckled joint to lift from out their burial over the whole the cold moon shone and made the depth look deeper the men stopped short and looked at their shovels and looked at one another they may not have been very bright of mind or accustomed to hurried conclusions and doubtless they were as true englishmen are of a tough unelastic fibre all powers of evil were banded against them and they saw no turn to take still it was not their own wish to go back without having struck a blow for it you can do nothing said the squire with perhaps the first bitter feeling he had yet displayed all things are dead against me i must grin as you say and bear it it would take a whole corps of sappers and miners a week to clear this place out we cannot even be sure of the spot we cannot tell where the corner is all is smothered up so ill luck always rides ill luck this proves beyond doubt that my child lies here the men were good men as men go and they all felt love and pity for the lost young lady and the poor old master still their fingers were so blue and their frozen feet so hard to feel and the deep white gulf before them surged so palpably invincible that they could not repine at a dispensation which sent them home to their suppers nort to be done till change of weather said cripps as they sat in the cart again i reckon they villains knew what was coming better nor i who have kept the road man and boy for thirty year the lord knoweth best as he always do but to my mind he maneth to kape on snowing and freezing for a month at laste moon have changed last night i blieve and a bitter moon we shall have of it and so they did the bitterest moon save one of the present century and old men said that there had not been such a winter and such a sight of snow since the one which the lord had sent on purpose to discomfit bony mr oglander in his lonely home strove bravely to make the best of it he had none of that grand religious consolation which some people have especially for others and he grounded his happiness perhaps too much upon his own hearthstone his mind was not an extraordinary one and his soul was too oldfashioned to demand periods of purging moreover his sister joan came upa truly pious and devoted woman the widow of an oxford winemerchant mrs fermitage loved her niece so deeply that she had no patience with any selfish pinings after her she is gone to the better land she said the shores of bliss unspeakableunless russel overshute knows about her a great deal more than he will tell i have far less confidence in that young man since he took to wear indiarubber but to wish her back is a very sinful and unchristian act i fear now joan you know that you wish her back every time that you sit down or get up or go to tea without her yes i know i know i do and most of all when i pour it outshe used to do it for me but worth you can wrestle more than i can the lord expects so much more of a man being exhorted thus the squire did his best to wrestle not that any words of hers could carry now their former weight for if he had no daughter left what good was money left to her the squire did not want his sisters money for himself at all indeed he would rather be without it dirty money won by tradebut still it had been his duty always to try to get it for his daughter and this is worth a word or two at the oxford bank and among the lawyers and the leading tradesmen it had been a wellknown thing that old fermitage had not died with less than l behind him even in oxford there never had been a man so illustrious for port wine fortiter occupa portum was the motto over the door to his vaults and he fortified port impregnably therefore he supplied all the commonroom cellars which cannot have too much geropiga and among the undergraduates his name was surety for another glass and there really was a port wine basis so that nobody died of him all these things are beside the mark mr fermitage however went on and hit his mark continually and his mark was that bulls eye of this golden age a yellow imprint of a dragon so many of these came pouring in that he kept them in bottles without any kicks sealed and left to mature and acquire the genuine bottle flavour when he had bottled half a pipe of these and was thinking of beginning now to store them in the wood a man coming down with a tap found him dead and was too much scared to steal anything this man reproached himself ever afterwards for his irresolute conscience and the two executors gave him nothing but blame for his behaviour people in holiwell said that these two took a dozen bottles of guineas between them to toast their testators memory but holiwell never has been famous for the holy thing lying at the bottom of the well enough that he was dead and every man seeing his funeral praised him chapter xi knocker versus bellpull there is or was a street in oxford near the ruins of the ancient castle and behind the new county jail where one of the many offsets of the isis filters its artificial way beneath low arches and betwixt dead walls and this street partly destroyed since then was known to the elder generation by the name of cross duck lane of course what remains of it now exults in an infinitely grander title though smelling thereby no sweeter with that we have nothing to do the street was cross duck lane in our time here in a highly respectable house a truly respectable man was living with his business and his family luke sharp gentleman was his name description style and title and he was not by any means a bad man so as to be an attorney this man possessed a great deal of influence having much houseproperty and he never in the least disguised his sentiments or played fast and loose with them being of a commanding figure and fine straightforward aspect he left an impression wherever he went of honesty vigour and manliness and he went into very good society as often as he cared to do so for although not a native of oxford but of unknown though clearly large origin he now was the head and indeed the entirety of a longestablished legal firm he had married the daughter of the senior partner and bought or ousted away the rest and although the legend on his plate was still piper pepper sharp and co every one knew that the learning wealth and honour of the whole concern were now embodied in mr luke sharp such a man was under no necessity ever to blow his own trumpet his wife a fat and goodly person miranda piper of former days happened to be the first cousin and nearest relative of a famous manportwine fermitage himself and his death had affected her very sadly for she found that he had provided for himself a most precarious future by unjust disposal of his worldly goods which he could not come back to rectify to his godson her only child and her idol christopher fermitage sharp he had left a copy of dr doddridges expositor and nothing else a golden work no doubtbut still golden precepts fill no purse but rather tend to empty it mrs luke sharp though a very good christian repacked and sent back the expositor if mr sharp had been at home he would not have let her do so he was full at all times of large generous impulse but never yet guilty of impulsive acts it had always been said that his son was to have the bottled halfpipe of gold or the chief body of it after the widows lifeinterest whereas now mrs fermitage if she liked might roll all the bottles down the high street she however was a careful woman and it was manifest where the whole of this cote dor vintage would be binned awayto wit in the cellars of beckley barton with the key at grace oglanders very pretty waist mr sharp at the moment could descry no cure but still to show temper was a vulgar thing now upon the new years day of the bitter weather continuing still and doing its best to grow more bitter mr sharp being of a festive turn had closed his office early the demand for universal closing and perpetual holiday had not yet risen to its present height and the clerks though familiar with the kindness of their principal scarcely expected such a premature relief but this only added to the satisfaction with which they went home to their new year dinners but mr sharp though of early habits and hungry at proper seasons was not preparing for his dinner now he had ordered his turkey to be kept back and begged his wife to see to it until he could make out and settle the import of a letter which reached him about one oclock it had been delivered by a groom on horseback who had suffered some inward struggle before he had stooped to ring the attorneys bell for cross duck house though a comfortable place was not of an aristocratic cast the letter was short and expounded little siri shall do myself the honour of calling upon you at four oclock this afternoon upon some important business obediently yours russel overshute it is not altogether an agreeable thing even for a man with the finest conscience such as mr sharp was blest with to receive a challenge upon an unknown point curtly worded in this wise and the pleasure does not increase when the strong correspondent is partly suspected of holding unfavourable views towards one and the gaze of selfinspection needs a little more time to compose itself luke sharp had led an unblemished life since the follies of his youth subsided he subscribed to inevitable charities and he waited for his rents when sure of them still he did not like that letter now he took off the coat which he wore at his desk and his waistcoat of the morning and washed his nice white hands and clothed himself in expensive dignity then he opened his book of daily entries and folded blottingpaper and prepared to receive instructions or give advice or be wise abstractedly but he thought it a sound precaution to have his son christopher within earshot for young overshute was reputed to be of a rather excitable nature therefore kit sharp was commanded to finish the cleaning of his gunwhich was his chief delightin his fathers closet adjoining the office and to keep the door shut unless called for the lawyer was not kept waiting long as the clock of st thomas struck four the shoes of a horse rang sharply on the icy road and the officebell kicked up its tongue with a jerk showing great extramural energy let him ring again said mr sharp i defy him to ring much harder the defiance was soon proved to be unsound for in less than ten seconds the bell which had stood many years of strong emotion was visited with such a violent spasm that nothing short of the meltingpot restored its constitution a piece clinked on the passage floor and the lawyer was filled with unfeigned wrath that bell had been ringing for three generations and was the palladium of the firm what clumsy clodhopper cried mr sharp rushing out as if he saw nobodywhat beggarly bumpkin has broken my bell mr overshuteoh i beg pardon i am sure we must make allowance said russel calmly for fidgety animals mr sharp and for thick gloves in this frosty weather john take my horse on the sevenbridges road and be back in exactly fifteen minutes how kind of you to be at home mr sharp with the words the young man bestowed on the lawyer a short sharp glance which entirely failed to penetrate the latter shut out this cold wind for heavens sake he exclaimed as he shut in his visitor you young folk never seem to feel the cold but you carry it a little too far sometimes ah i must have been about your age when we had such another hard winter as this four and twenty years ago scarcely so bitter but a deal more snow snow snow six feet everywhere i was six and twenty thenabout your age i take it sir my age to a tittle said overshute but i am generally taken for thirtytwo how can you have guessed it so early thought sir juvenile thought and advanced intelligence make young people look far in front of their age when you come to my time of life young sir your thoughts and your looks will be younger now take this chair never mind your boots let them hiss as they will on the fender i like to hear ita genial sounda touch of emery paper in the morning and there we are ready for other boots i have had men here come fifty miles across country as the crow flies to see me when the floods were out and go away with minds comforted i have heard of your skill in all legal points but i am not come on that account quibbles and shuffles i detest well mr overshute i have met with a good deal of rudeness in my early days before i was known as i am now it was worth my while to disarm it then it is not so now in your case you belong to a very good county family and although you are committed to inferior hands if you had come in a friendly spirit i would have been glad to serve you as it is i can only request you to say what your purpose is and to settle it russel overshute with his large and powerful eyes gazed straight at sharp and mr sharp who had steely eyesthe best of all for getting on withnot very large but as keen as need be therewith answered complacently and as if he saw hope of amusement you puzzle me sharp said overshuteabout the worst thing he could have said and he knew it before the words had passed i am called for the most part mister sharp except by gentlemen of my own age or friends who entirely trust me mr russel overshute explain how i have puzzled you never mind that you would never understand have you any idea what has brought me here yes to be plain with you i have one of your least but very oldest tenants has been caught out in poaching you hate the gamelaws you are a radical ranter and reformer you know that your lawyer is good and active but too well known as a liberal it requires a man of settled principles to contest with the gamelaws you could not be more wide astray cried young overshute triumphantly taking in every word the other had said as a piece of his victory no no thank goodness we are not come so low that we cannot get off our tenants in spite of any evidence you must indeed think that our family is quite reduced to the dirt if we can no longer do even that much not at all sir you are much too hot i only supposed for the moment that your principles might have stopped you oh dear no my mother could not take it at all in that way now where have you put grace oglander impetuous russel with his nostrils quivering and his eyes fixed on the lawyers and his right hand clenching his heavy whip purposely fired his question thus like a thunderbolt out of pure heaven he felt sure of producing a grand effect and so he did but not the right one you threaten me do you said mr sharp i think that you make a mistake young man violence is objectionable in every way though natural with fools who believe they are the stronger i am sorry to have spoiled your whip but you will acknowledge that the fault was yours now i am ready for reasonif you are with a grave bow luke sharp offered russel the fragments of his pet huntingcrop which he had caught from his hand and snapped like a stick of peppermint as he spoke overshute thought himself a fine strong fellow and with very good reason but the quickness of his antagonist left him gasping i want no apologies mr sharp continued going to his desk while the young man looked sadly at his brazenknockered butt for he had been at that admirable college and cherished his chief reminiscence of it thus apologies are always waste of time you have threatened me and you have found your mistake such a formidable antagonist makes ones hand shake still i think that i can hit my keyhole you can always make your keys fit i dare say but you never could do that to me again very likely not i shall never care to try it physical force is always low but as a gentleman you must own that you first offered violence mr sharp i confess that i did not in word or deed but still my manner fairly imported it and the first respect i ever felt for you i feel now for your quickness and pluck i am pleased with any respect from you because you have little for anything now repeat your question moderately where have you put grace oglander let me offer you a chair again striding about with frozen feet is almost the worst thing a man can do however you seem to be a little excited have you brought me a letter from my client to authorize this inquiry from mr oglander oh no he has no idea of my being here we will get over that you are a friend of his and a neighbour he has asked you in a general way to help him in this sad great trouble not at all he would rather not have my interference he does not like its motive and the motive is that like many other people you were attached to this young lady certainly i am i would give my life at any moment for her well well i will not speak quite so strongly as you do life grows dearer as it gets more short but still i would give my best year remaining to get to the bottom of this problem you would cried young overshute looking at him with admiration of his strength and truth give me your hand sir i have wronged you i see that i am but a hasty fool you should never own that said the lawyer chapter xii mr john smith meanwhile all beckley and villages around were seething with a ferment of excitement and contradiction esther cripps had been strictly ordered by the authorities to hold her tongue and so far as in her lay she did so but there were othersthe squires three men and even the carrier himself who had so many things to think that they were pretty sure to say some of them one or two of them had wives and though these women could not be called by their very worst friends inquisitive it was not right and lawful that they should be debarred of everything they did all they could not to know any more than they were really bound to know and whatever was forced upon them had no chance of going any further this made several women look at one another slyly each knowing more than the other and nodding while sounding the others ignorance until with one accord they grew provoked at being treated so and truth being multiplied to its cube became of course infinite error now mrs fermitage having been obliged to return to cowley mary hookhams mother had established her power by this time and being as her daughter had pronounced a conspicuous member of the females she exerted herself about all that was said and saw the other side of everything she never went to no publichousenobody could say that of her but perhaps she could put two and two together every bit as well as them that did it had been her fortune to acquire exceptional experienceor as she put it more plainly she had a seed a many things and the impressions left thereby upon her idiosyncrasy or in her own words what she come to think was and were that nothing could be true that she had not known the like of this was the secret of her success in lifewhich however as yet bore no proportion to her merits she frankly scouted as a pack of stuff everything to which her history afforded no vivid parallel in a word she believed only what she had seen now incredulity is a grand power to be able to say oh dont tell me or none of your stuff when the rest of the audience stricken with awe is gaping confers at once the esteem of superior intellect and vigour and when there are good high people who derive comfort from the denial the chances are that the active sceptic does not get the worst of it mrs hookham plainly declared that esthers tale was neither more nor less than a trumpery cockandbull story she would not call it a parcel of lies because the poor girl might have dreamed it walking in the snow was no more than walking in ones sleep she knew that from her own experience and if there had been no snow as yet that made her all the more sure to be right the air was full of it and of course it would have more power overhead depend upon it she had seen a bush if indeed she did see anything and being so dazed by the weather she had gone and dreamed the rest of it beckley on the other hand having known esther ever since she toddled out of her cradle and knowing her brothers the carrier the baker and the butcher and having no experience yet of mother hookhams wisdom as good as told the latter lady not to be so bounceable she must not come into this parish and pretend to know more about things that belonged to it than those who were bred and born there but mrs hookhams opinion was in one way very important however little weight it carried at the dusty anvil mr oglander himself had to depend for his food entirely on mrs hookhams efforts for betty the cook went purely off her head after all she had gone through and they put her in bed with a little barleywater and much malt liquor in a nobler form and though mrs hookham at her time of life was reluctant so to demean herself she found all the rest such a noahs compass that she roused up the fires of departed youth and flourished with the bastingladle a clever wellconditioned dame with a will of her own is somebody now sir she cried rushing in to the squire with a basin of firstrate oxtail soup upon that melancholy new years day you have been out in the snow again no use denying of it sir i can see it by the chattering of your teeth i call it a bad wicked thing to go on so flying in the face of the lord like that you are a most kind and good soul mrs hookham but surely you would not have me sit with my hands crossed doing nothing no no surely not take the spoon in one hand and the basin in the other you owe it to yourself to keep up your strength and to some one else as well good sir i have no one else now to owe it to the old man answered sadly tucking his napkin into his waistcoat pockets yes you have you have your miss gracie alive and kicking as sure as i be and with a deal more of life in front of her though scarce a week passes but what i takes my regular dose of calumny ah if it had not been for that i never could have been twenty year a widow dont cry mrs hookham i beg you not to cry you have many good children to look after and there still is abundance of calomel but why do you talk so about my darling because sir please god i means to see you spend many a happy year together lord have mercy if i had took for granted every trouble as come upon me who could a tried for to cheat me this day my goodness dont go for to swallow the bones sir to be sure not no i was not thinking of course there are bones in every tail and a heap of bones in them crippses tale sir as wont go down with me nohow have faith in the mercy of the lord sir and in your own experience that is exactly what i try to do there cannot be any one in the world so bad as to hurt my gracie mrs hookham you never can have seen anybody like her she was so full of life and kindness that everybody who knew her seemed to have her in their own family she never made pretence to be above herself or any one and she entered into everybodys trouble quite as if she had brought it on she never asked them any questions whether it might have been their own fault and she gave away all her own money first before she came to me for more she was so simple and so pleasant and so full of playful waysbut there when i think of that it makes me almost as bad as you women are take out the dish i am very much obliged to you not a bit sir not a bit as yet the brisk dame answered with tears on her cheeks but before very long you will own that you was when you find every word i say come true oh my how that startled me somebody coming the short way from the fields that wonderful man as is always prowling about unbeknown to any one they dont like me in the village much civil as i am to all of them but as sure as six is half a dozen that smith is the one they ought to hate if he is there show him in at once said the squire without further argument and let no one come interrupting us this was very hard upon mrs hookham and she could not help showing it in her answer oh to be sure sir oh to be sure not what is my poor opinion compared to his ah well it is a fine thing to be a man the man for whose sake she was thus cast out seemed to be of the same opinion he walked and looked and spoke as if it was indeed a fine thing to be a man but the finest of all things to be the man inside his own cloth and leather short and thick of form he was and likely to be at close quarters a dangerous antagonist and the set of his jaws and the glance of his eyes showed that no want of manhood would at the critical moment disable him his face was of a strong red colour equally spread all over it as if he lived much in the open air and fed well and enjoyed his food john smith your worshipjohn smith he said without troubling mrs hookham i hope i see your worship better dont rise i beg of you may i shut the door oh mary your tea is waiting mary indeed cried widow hookham ungraciously departing young man address my darter thus now what have you done smith what have you done the old gentleman asked stooping over him or have you done nothing at all as usual you tell me to have patience every day and every day i have less and less the elements are against us sir if the weather had been anything but what it is i must have known everything long ago stop sir stop it is no idle excuse as you seem to fancy it is not the snow that i speak of it is the intense and deadly cold that keeps all but the very strong people indoors how can any man talk when his beard is frozen look sir from his short brown beard he took lumps of ice beginning to thaw in the warmth of the room and cast them into the fire to hiss mr oglander gazed as if he thought that his visitor took a liberty but one that could not matter much go on sir with your report he said well sir in this chain of crime mr smith replied in a sprightly manner we have found one very important link what is it smith dont keep me waiting dont fear me i am now prepared to stand anything whatever well sir we have discovered at last the body of your worships daughter the squire bowed and hid his face by the aid of faith he had been hoping against hope till it came to this then he looked up with his bright old eyes for the moment very steady and said with a firm though hollow voice the will of the lord be done the will of the lord be done smith the will of the lord shall not be done cried mr smith emphatically and striking his thick knees with his fist until the man who has done it shall be swung squire swung make up your mind to that your worship you may safely make up your mind to that what good will it do me the father asked talking with himself alone will it ever bring back my girlmy child bereaved i am but it cannot be long i shall meet her in a better world smith to be sure your worship will with the angels and archangels but to my mind that will be no satisfaction till the man has swung for it excuse me for a moment will you mr smith excuse me i have no right to be overcome and i thought i had got beyond all that ring the bell and they will bring you cold sirloin and a jug of ale help yourself and dont mind me i will come back directly no thank you i can walk alone how many have had much worse to bear you will find the undercut the best chapter xiii mr smith is active mr john smith was a little upset at seeing the squire so put out but he said to himself it is naturalafter all it is natural poor old chap he has taken it as well as could be expected however we must all live and i feel uncommonly peckish just now i declare i would rather have had something hot this weather but in such a case one must put up with things i wonder if they have got any horseradish all frozen hard in the ground i fearno harm at any rate in asking with this selfcommune he rang the bell and mary by her mothers order answered ill not go nigh the baste cried widow hookham still indignant mary like a good maid laid the cloth without a syllable and like a good young woman took the keenest heed of mr smith without letting him dream that she peeped at him thank you mary said mr smith to open conversation my mothers name is mary she answered and perhaps you would like some pickles by all means as there is no horseradish bring onions gherkins and walnuts mary but above all things walnuts you must have what you can get said mary i will go and tell master what you require on no account mary on no account he is gone away to pray i believe on no account disturb him poor dear i should hope not perhaps you can manage with what i have set before you i will do my best he answered the scum of the earth said mary to herself good servants being the most intensely aristocratic of all the world he never dined at a gentlemans table before and his head is turned with it our kitchen is too good for him but poor master never heeds nothing now as soon however as mr smith had appeased the rage of hunger and having called for a glass of hot brandy and water was clinking the spoon in it the squire showed that he did heed something by coming back calmly to talk with him mr oglander had passed the bitterest hour of his long life yet filled at every turn of thought with yearning to break down and weep sometimes his mind was so confused that he did not know how old he was but seemed to be in the long past days with his loving wife upon his arm and their gracie toddling in front of them he spoke to them both as he used to do and speaking cleared his thoughts again and he shook away the dreamy joy in the blank forlorn of facts at last he washed his face and brushed his silver hair and untended beard and half in the lookingglass expected to see his daughter scolding him because he knew that he had neglected many things she insisted on and his conscience caught him when he seemed to be taking a low advantage i hope you have been treated well he said with his fine oldfashioned bow to smith as he came back again i do not often leave my guests to attend to themselves in this way dont apologize squire i beg you i have done first chop i assure you sir i have not tasted real mustard ground at home as yours is since i was up in durham county where they never grow it well mr smith said the squire trying to smile at his facetiousness i am very glad that you have done well in weather like this a young man like you must want a good deal of nourishment but now will youwill you tell me yes your worship everything of course you are anxious and i thoroughly enter into your feelings there are none of the women at the door i hope such things do not happen in my house i will not interrupt you very well sir then sit down here you must be aware in the first place then that i was not likely to be content with your way of regarding things the lord is the lord of the weather of course and does it without consulting us nevertheless he allows us also to do our best against it so i took the bull by the horns as john bull by his name has a right to do i just resolved to beat the weather and have it out with everything so i communicated with the authorities in london you know we are in a transition statea transition state at present sirbetween the old system and the new yes yes of course i know all that very well your worship we are obliged of course to be doubly careful in london we are quite established but down here we must feel our way the magistrates saving your worships presence look upon us with dislike as if we were superseding them that will wear off your worship and the new system will work wonders yes so you all say but now be quick what wonders have you wrought john smith well i was going to tell your worship when you interrupted me you know that story of cripps the carrier and his sisterwhats her name well some folk believed it and some bereaved it i did neither of the two but resolved to get to the bottom of it your worship was afraid you rememberwell then let us say daunted siror if you will not have that we may say that you trusted in providence it was not quite that but still mr smith your worship will excuse me things of that sort happen always and the people are always wrong that do it i trusted in providence once myself but now i trust twice in my own self first and leave providence to come after me ha ha i speak my mind no offence your worship well then this was what i did a brave regiment of soldiers having newly returned from india was ordered to march from london to the lands end for change of temperature they had not been supplied of course with any change of clothes for climate and they felt it a little but were exhorted not to be too particular two companies were to be billeted at abingdon last evening and having of course received notice of that i procured authority to use them they shivered so that they wanted work and there is nothing your worship like discipline of course i know that from my early days will you tell your story speedily sir that is just what i am doing i brought them without many words to the quarry where ten times the number of our clodhoppers would only have shovelled at one another bless my heart they did work and with order and arrangement being clothed all in cotton they had no time to lose unless they meant to get frozen and it was a fine sight i assure your worship to see how they showed their shoulderblades being skinny from that hot climate and their brownfreckled arms in the white of the drift and the indian steam coming out of them in about two hours all the ground was clear and the trees put away like basketwork and then we could see what had happened exactly and even the mark of the pickaxes every word of that girl was proved true to a tittle i never heard finer evidence we can even see that two men had been at work and the stroke of their tools was different you may trust me for getting up a case but i see that you have no patience squire we shovelled away all the fallen rock and mould and stumps and furzeroots and at last we came to the poor poor innocent body as fresh as the daylight i can hear no more you have lost no childif you have perhaps you could spare it tell me nothingnothing more but prove that it was my child lord a mercy your worship why you are only fit to go to bed here mary mary mother hookham curse the belli have broken it your master is taken very queer look alive woman stir your stumps a pot of hot water and a foottub dont get scaredhe will be all right i always carry a fleam with me i can bleed him as well as any doctor hold his head up let me feel oh he is not going to die just yet stop your caterwauling there i have relieved his veins he will know us all in a minute again he ought to have had a deal more spirit i never could have expected this i smoothed off everything so nicelyjust as if it was a lady did you indeed i have heard every word said widow hookham sternly you locked the door or i would have had my ten nails in you long ago poor dear what is a scum like you and after all what have you done john smith chapter xiv so is mr sharp on the very next day it was known throughout the parish and the neighbourhood that the ancient squire had broken down at last under the weight of anxieties nobody blamed him much for this except his own sister and mr smith mrs fermitage said that he ought to have shown more faith and resignation and john smith declared that all his plans were thrown out by this stupidity what proper inquiry could be held when the universal desire was to spare the feelings and respect the affliction of a poor old man mr smith was right an inquest truly must be held upon the body which had been found by the soldiers but the coroner being a good old friend and admirer of the oglanders contrived that the matter should be a mere form and the verdict an open nullity mr luke sharp appeared and in a dignified reserve was ready to represent the family he said a few words in the very best taste and scarcely dared to hint at things which must be painful to everybody left alive to think of them how the crush of tons of rock upon an unprotected female form had made it impossible to sayand how all the hair which more than any other human gift survived the sad sad change having been cut off was there no longerand how there was really nothing except a pair of not over new silk stockings belonging to a lady of lofty position in the county and the widow of an eminent gentleman but not required he might hope to present herself so painfully mr sharp could say no more and the jury felt that he now must come or failing him his son kit sharp into the l of portwine fermitage therefore they returned the verdict carried in his pocket by them death by misadventure of a young lady name unknown their object was to satisfy the squire and their consciences and they found it wise as it generally is not to be too particular and the coroner was the last man to make any fuss about anything are you satisfied now mr overshute asked lawyer sharp as russel met him in the passage of the quarry arms where the inquest had been taken the jury have done their best at once to meet the facts of the case and respect the feelings of the family satisfied how can i be such a hocuspocus i never knew it is not for me to interfere while things are in this wretched state everybody knows what an inquest is no doubt you have done your duty and acted according to your instructions come in here where we can speak privately mr sharp did not look quite as if he desired a private interview however he followed the young man with the best grace he could muster i am going to speak quite calmly and have no whip now for you to snap said russel sitting down as soon as he had set a chair for mr sharp but may i ask you why you have done your utmost to prevent what seemed to an ordinary mind the first and most essential thing the identification yes of course will you come and satisfy yourself the key of the room is in my pocket i cannot do it i cannot do it answered the young man shuddering my last recollection must not be young sir i respect your feelings and need i ask you after that whether i have done amiss in sparing the feelings of the family and there is something more important than even that at stake just now you know the poor squires sad condition the poor old gentleman is pretty well broken down at last i fear what else could we expect of him and the doctor his sister had brought from london says that his life hangs positively upon a thread of hope therefore we are telling him sad stories or rather i ought to say happy stories and though he is too sharp to swallow them all they do him good sirthey do him good i can quite understand it but how does that beari mean you could have misled him surely about the result of this inquest by no means he would have insisted on seeing a copy of the herald in fact if the jury could not have been managed i had arranged with the editor to print a special copy giving the verdict as we wanted it a pious fraud of course and so it is better to dispense with it this verdict will set him up again upon his poor old legs i hope he seemed to dread the final blow so and the bandying to and fro of his unfortunate daughters name i scarcely see why it should be so but so it is mr overshute of course it is how can you doubt it how can it be otherwise you can have no good blood in youi beg your pardon i speak rashly but i did not mean to speak rudely all i mean to say is that you need no more explain yourself i seem to be always doubting you and it always shows what a fool i am now dont say that mr luke sharp answered with a fine and genial smile you are acknowledged to be the most rising member of the county bench but still sir still there is such a thing as going too far with acuteness sir you may not perceive it yet but when you come to my age you will own it truly but who can be too suspicious when such things are done as these i tell you sharp that i would give my head off my shoulders this very instant to know who has done this damned villainythis infernalunnatural wrong to my darlingto my darling mr overshute how can we tell that any wrong has been done to her no wrong to take her life no wrong to cut off all her lovely hair and to send it to her father no wrong to leave us as we are with nothing now to care for you spoke like a sensible man just nowoh dont think that i am excitable well how can i think otherwise but do me the justice to remember that i do not for one moment assert what everybody takes for granted it seems too probable and it cannot for the present at least be disproved that here we have the sad finale of the poor young lady but it must be borne in mind that on the other hand the body the thing could be settled in two minutessharp i have no patience with you so it appears and making due allowance i am not vexed with you you mean of course the interior garments the nether clothing and so on there is not a clue afforded there we have found no name on anything the features and form as i need not tell you i cannot bear to hear of that has any old servant of the family has the family doctor all those measures were taken of course we had the two oldest servants but the one was flurried out of her wits and the other threequarters frozen and you know what a fellow old splinters is the crustiest of the crusty he took it in bitter dudgeon that sir anthony had been sent for to see the poor old squire and all he would say was yes yes yes you had better send for sir anthony perhaps he could bringoh of course he could bringmy poor little pet to life again then we tried her aunt mrs fermitage one of the last who had seen her living but bless you my dear sir a team of horses would not have lugged her into the room she cried and shrieked and fainted away barbarous creatures she said you will have to hold another inquest if you are so unmanly i could not even see my dear husband and then she fell into hysterics and we had to send two miles for brandy now sir have we anything more to do shall we send a litter or a coffin for the squire himself you are inclined to be sarcastic but you have taken a great deal upon yourself you seem to have ordered everything mr luke sharp everywhere will you tell me who else there was to do it it has not been a very pleasant task and certainly not a profitable one i shall reap the usual rewardto be called a busybody by every one but that is a trifle now if there is anything you can suggest mr overshute it shall be done at once take time to think i feel a little tired and in need of rest there has been so much to think of you should have come to help us sooner but no doubt you felt a sort of delicacy about it the worthy jurymens feet at last have ceased to rattle in the passage my horse will not be here just yet you will not think me rude if i snatch a little rest while you consider for three nights i have had no sleep have i your good permission sir here is the key of that room meanwhile russel overshute was surprised to see mr sharp draw forth a large silk handkerchief with spots of white upon a yellow ground and spread it carefully over the crown of his long deep head and around his temples down to the fine grey eyebrows then lifting gaitered heels upon the flat wide bar of the iron fenderthe weather being as cold as everin less than a minute mr luke sharp was asleep beyond all contradiction he slept the sleep of the just with that gentle whisper of a snore which aristotle hints at to prove that virtue being as she must be in the mean doth in the neutral third of life maintain a middle course between loud snore and silent slumber if mr sharp had striven hard to produce a powerful effect young overshute might have suspected him but this calm good sleep and pure sense of rest laid him open for all the world to take a larger view of him no bad man could sleep like that no narrowminded man could be so wide to natures noblest power only a fine and genial soul could sweetly thus resign itself the soft content of wellearned repose spoke volumes in calm silence here was a good man if ever there was one at peace with his conscience the world and heaven overshute was enabled thus to look at things more loftilyto judge a man as he should be judged when he challenges no verdictto see that there are large points of view which we lose by worldly wisdom and by little peeps through selfish holes too oneeyed and ungenerous overshute could not bear the idea of any illiberality he hated suspicion in anybody unless it were just as his own should be in this condition of mind he pondered while the honest lawyer slept and he could not think of anything neglected or mismanaged much in the present helpless state of things chapter xv a spotted dog when at last the frost broke up and streams began to run again and everywhere the earth was glad that men should see her face once more and foresttrees and roadside pollards and bushes of the common hedgerow straightened their unburdened backs and stood for spring to look at them a beautiful young maiden came as far as she could come and sighed as if the beauty of the land awaking was a grief to her this pretty lady in the young mossbud and slendernecked chalice of innocence was laden with dews of sorrow such as nature in her outer dealings with the more material world defers until autumnal night and russet hours are waiting scarcely in full bloom of youth but ripe for blush or dreaminess she felt the power of early spring and the budding hope around her am i to be a prisoner always ever more a prisoner she said as she touched a willow catkin the earliest of all the silver one she stroked the delicate silken tassel doubtful of its prudence yet and she looked for leaves but none there were and nothing to hold commune the feeble sun seemed well content to have a mere glimpse of the earth again and spread his glances diffidently as if he expected shadow nevertheless there he was at last and the world received him tenderly it has been such a long long time it seems to grow longer as the days draw out and nobody comes to talk to me my place it is to obey of coursebut still but stillthere he is again the girl drew back for a fine young man in a grand new velvet shootingcoat wearing also a long shawl waistcoat and good buckskin breeches which combined with calfskin gaiters set off his legs to the uttermostin all this picturesque apparel and swinging a gun right gallantly there he was and no mistake he was quietly trying through the covert without any beaters but with a brace of clever spaniels for woodcock snipe or rabbit perhaps the season for game being over a tall wellmade and rather nice young man so far as a bashful girl might guess he seemed at this third view of him and of course it would be an exceedingly rude and pointed thing to run away needless also and indeed absurd because she was sure that when last they met he was frightened much more than she was it was nothing less than a duty now to find out whether he had recovered himself if he had done so it would be as well to frighten him even more this time and if he had not it would only be fair to see what could be done for him one of his dogsa cocking spannel as the great mr looker warranteda good young bitch with livercoloured spots and drop ears torn by brambles and eyes full of brownish yellow light ran up to the girl confidentially and wagged a brief tail and sniffed a little and with sound discretion gazed each black nostril was like a mark of panting interrogation and one ear was tucked up like a small tunnel and the eye that belonged to it blinked with acumen you pretty dear come and let me pat you the young lady cried looking down at the dog as if there were nobody else in the world oh i am so fond of dogswhat is your name come and tell me darling her name is grace said the master advancing in a bashful but not clumsy way the most beautiful name in the world i think oh do you think so mr but i beg your pardon you have not told me what your own name is i think i hope you are quite well he answered turning his gun away carefully quite well this fine afternoon how beautiful it is to see the sun and all the things coming back again so oh yes and the lovely willowtrees i never noticed them so before i had no idea that they did all this she was stroking the flossiness as she spoke neither had i said the young man trying to be most agreeable and glancing shyly at the haze of silver in lily fingers glistening but do not you think that they do it becausebecause they can scarcely help themselves no how can you be so stupid excuse mei did not mean that i am sure but they do it because it is their nature and they like to do it you know them no doubt and you understand them because you are like them he was frightened as soon as he had said this which he thought while he uttered it rather good i am really astonished the fair maid said with the gleam of a smile in her lively eyes but her bright lips very steadfast to be compared to a willowtree i thought that a willow meantbut never mind i am glad to be like a willow oh no oh no you are not one biti am sure you will never be like a willow what could i have been thinking of no harm whatever i am sure of that she answered with so sweet a look that he stopped from scraping the toe of his boot on a clump of moss and in his heart was wholly taken up with heri am sure that you meant to be very polite more than thata great deal more than thatoh ever so much more than that she let him look at her for a moment because he had something that he wanted to express and she from pure natural curiosity would have been glad to know what it was and so their eyes dwelt upon one another just long enough for each to be almost ashamed of leaving off and in that short time they seemed to be pleased with one anothers nature the youth was the first to look away because he feared that he might be rude whereas a maiden cannot be rude with the speed of a glance she knew all that and she blushed at the colour these things were taking i am sure that i ought to go she said and so ought i long and long ago i am sure i cannot tell why i stop if you were to get into any trouble you are very kind you need not be anxious if you do not know why you stopthe sooner you run away at full speed the better oh i hope you wont say that he replied being gifted by nature with powers of courting which only wanted practice i really think that you scarcely ought to say so unkind a thing as that very well then may i say this that you have important things to attend to and that it looksindeed it doesas if it was coming on to rain i assure you there is no fear of thatalthough if it did there is plenty of shelter but look at the sunhow it shines in your hair oh why do you keep your hair so short it looks as if it ought to be ten feet long well suppose that it wasnot quite ten feet for that would be rather hard to managebut say only half that length and then for a very good reason was all cut offbut that is altogether another thing and in no way can concern you i give you a very good day sir no no you will give me a very bad day if you hurry away so suddenly i am anxious to know a great deal more about you why do you live in this lonely place quite as if you were imprisoned here and what makes you look so unhappy sometimes although your nature is so bright there what a brute i am i have made you cry i ought to shoot myself you must not talk of such wicked things i am not crying i am very happyat least i mean quite happy enough goodbye or i never shall bear you again as she turned away without looking at him he saw that her pure young breast was filled with a grief he must not intrude upon and at the same moment he caught a glimpse through the trees of some one coming so he lifted his smart glengarry cap and in sad perplexity strode away but over his shoulder he softly saidi shall come againyou must let me do thati am sure that i can help you the young lady made no answer but turned as soon as she thought he was out of sight and wistfully looked after him here comes that miss patch of course she said i wonder whether she has spied him out her eyes are always everywhere oh my darling child cried miss patch an elderly lady of great dignity i had no idea you were gone so far come in i beg of you come this moment what has excited you like this nothing at all at least i mean i am not in the least excited oh look at the beautiful sunset miss patch with deep gravity took out her spectacles placed them on her fine roman nose and gazed eastward to watch the sunset oh dear no not there cried her charge in a hurry here it is all in this direction i thought that i saw a spotted dog the lady answered still gazing steadily down the side of the forest by which the youth had made his exit a spotted dog grace i am almost sure yes i dare say i believe that there is a dog with some spots in the neighbourhood chapter xvi a grand smockfrock upon the saturday after this being marketday at oxford zacchary cripps was in and out with the places and the people as busy as the best of them the number of things that he had to do used to set his poor brain buzzing until he went into the barnot the grand one but the hostlers bar at the golden crossand left dry froth at the bottom of a pewter quart measure of find old ale at this flitting trace of exhaustion he always gazed for a moment as if he longed to behold just such another and then with a sigh of selfdedication to all the great duties before him out he pulled his leather bag and counted fourpence four times over without any multiplication thereof but a desire to have less subtraction and then he generally shook his head in penitence at his own love of good ale and the fugitive fate of the passion the last step was to deposit his fourpence firmly upon the metal counter challenging all the bad pence and halfpence pilloried there as a warning and then with a glance at the barmaid sally to encourage her still to hope for him away went cripps to the duties of the day these always took him to the market first a crowded and very narrow quarter then where he always had a great host of commissions at very small figures to execute his honesty was so broadly known that it was become quite an onerous gift as happens in much higher grades of life folk all along both his roads of travel naturally took great advantage of it being certain that he would spend their money quite as gingerly as his own and charge them no more than he was compelled by honesty towards himself to charge farmers butchers poulterers hucksters chandlers and grocersblack yellow and greenall knew zacchary cripps and paid him the compliment of asking fifty per cent above what they meant or even hoped to take of this the carrier was well aware and upon the whole it pleased him the triumph each time of rubbing down by friction of tongue and chafe of spirit eighteenpence into a shilling although it might be but a matter of course never lost any of its charms for him his brisk eyes sparkled as he pulled off his hat and made the most learned annotations thereif learning is as generally happens the knowledge of what nobody else can read but now before he had filled the great leathern apron of his capacitieswhich being full his hat had no room for any further entriesa thing came to pass which startled him so far at least as the road and the world had left him the power of starting he saw his own brother leviticus standing in friendly talk with a rabbitman a man whose reputation was not at a hopeless distance beyond reproach a man who had been three times in prisonwhether he ought or ought not to have been this is a difficult point to debate his friends contended that he ought notif so he of course was wrong to go there his enemies vowed that he ought to be thereif so he could rightly be nowhere else the man got the benefit of both opinions in a powerfully negative condition of confidence on the part of the human brotherhood but for all that there were bigger rogues to be found in oxford cripps however as the head of the family having seigneurial rights by birthas well as in his own opinion force of superior intellectsaw and at once discharged his duty no taint of poached rabbits must lie for a moment on the straightforward path of the crippses zacchary therefore held up one hand as a warning to tickuss to say no more until he could get at himfor just at this moment a dead lock arose through a fight of four women about a rotten eggbut when that had lapsed into hysterics the carrier struggled to his brothers elbow leviticus cripps was a large ruddy man half a head taller than the heir of the house but not so well built for carrying boxes his frame was at the broadest and thickest of itself at that very important part of the human system which has to do with aliment but inasmuch as all parts do that more or less directly accuracy would specify if allowable his stomach here he was well developed but narrowed or sloped towards less essential points whereas the carrier was at his greatest across and around the shoulders a keen physiologist would refer this palpable distinction to their respective occupations the one fed pigs and fed upon them and therefore required this local enlargement for sympathy and for assimilation the other bore the burden of good things for the benefit of others which is anything but fattening be that as it will they differed thus and they differed still more in countenance zacchary had a bright open face with a short nose of brave and comely cock a mouth large pleasant and mild as a cows a strong square forehead and blue eyes of great vivacity and some humour he had true cripps hair like a hornbeam hedge in the month of january and a thick curly beard of good hay colour shaven into three scollops like a clover leaf his manner of standing and speaking and looking was sturdy and plain and resolute and he stuck out his elbows and set his knuckles on his hips whenever both hands were empty on the contrary tickuss his brother looked at every one and at all times rather as if he were being suspected wrongly suspected of course and puzzled to tell at all why it should be so and as a general rule a little surly at such injustice the expression of his face was heavy slowwitted and shyly inquisitive his hair was black and his eyes of a muddy brown with small slippery pupils and he kept his legs in a fidgety state as if prone to be wanted for running away in stature however and weight this man was certainly above the average and he would rather do a good than a bad thing whenever the motives were equivalent but if his soul could not always walk in spotless raiment his body at least was clad in the garb of innocence no man in oxford market wore a smock that could be compared with his for on such great occasions leviticus came in a noble shepherds smock long and flowing around him well a triumph of mind in design and construction and a marvel of hand in fine stitching and plaiting goffering crimping and ironing the broad turnedover collar was like a snowdrift tattooed by fairies the sleeves were gathered in as religiously as a bishops gossamer and the front was foursquare with cunning work a span was the length and a span the breadth like the breastplate over the ephod as for tickuss himself he cared no more than the wool of a pig for such trifles beyond this that he liked to have his neighbours looking up to and the women looking after him even in the new unsullied sanctity of this chasuble he would grasp by the tail an irish pig if sore occasion befell them both it was mrs leviticus who adorned him after a sea of soapsuds and many irons tested ejectively with this magnificent vesture suggested to feminine capacity perhaps in the days of the tabernacle leviticus said zacchary sternly leading him down a wet red alley peopled only with cooped chicks and paved with unsaleable giblets leviticus what be thou doing this day many queer things have i seed of theebut to beat this herenever nothing i dunno what dost mean tickuss answered unsteadily now i call that a lie said the carrier firmly but mildly as if well used thereto as a dog is to fleas in the summer time a might be and yet again a might not tickuss replied with keen sense of logic but none of impeached ethics do ee know or do ee notthe ruthless carrier pressed himthat there hosebird have a been in jail now i do believe let me call to mindsaid tickuss with his duller eyes at baythat i did hear summat as come nigh that but lord bless you the best of men goes to jail sometimes do you call to mind old squire dempster naught to do wi it naught to do wi it zacchary cried with a crack of his thumb that were an old gentlemans misfortune the same as saint paul and saint peter did once but that hosebird i see you talking along of have been in jail three timesthree times i tell eeand no miracle and if ever i sees you dealing with him he closed his sentence emphatically by shaking his fist in the immediate neighbourhood of his brothers retiring nose well well no need to take on so zak cried the bigger man at safe distance you might bear in mind that i has my troubles and no covered cart at the tail of me and a family zak as wears out more boots than a tanyard a week could make good to em but there i never finds anybody gifted with no consideration why if i was to talk till tomorrow night if you was to talk to next leapyears day you could not fetch right out of wrong tickuss and you know pretty well what i be now what was you doing of with that black george mind no lies wont go down with me best way go and get him to tell ee the younger brother answered sulkily it will do ee good like to get it out of he no harm to try answered cripps with alacrity no fear for me to be seen along of un only for the likes of you tickuss the carrier set off to stake his higher repute against lowest communications but his brother with no heed of smock or of crock took three long strides and stopped him hearken me hearken me zak he cried with a start at a cock that crowed at him and his face like the wattles of chanticleerzak for the sake of the lord in heaven and of my seven little onesstop a bit i baint in no hurry that i know on replied the cripps of pure conscience you told me to ask of him and i were agoin on the wag to do so come out into the turl zak come out into the turl a minute there is nobody there now they young collegeboys be all at their lessons or hunting there is no place to come near the turl for a talk when they noisy college chaps are gone by a narrow back lane they got into the turl at that time of day little harassed by any unless it were the children of the porter of lincoln or exeter now what is it thou hast got to say asked zacchary but this was the very thing the younger brother was vainly seeking for nort nort zak nort of any count he stammered after casting in his slow imagination for a good fat wellseasoned lie now spake out the truth man whatever it be said the carrier trying to encourage him tickuss thou art always getting into scrapes by manes of crooked dealing but ill not turn my back on thee if for once canst spake the truth like a man brother leviticus struggled with his nature while his little eyes rolled slowly and his plaited breastplate rose and fell he stole some irresolute glances at his brothers clear straightforward face and he might have saved himself by doing what he was halfinclined to do but circumstances aided nature to defeat his better star the wife of the porter of lincoln college had sent forth one of her little girls to buy a bunch of turnips she knew that turnips would be very scarce after so much hard weather but her stew would be no good without them and among many other fine emotions anxiety was now foremost so she thrust forth her head from the venerable porch and at the top of her voice exclaimedturmots turmots turmots at that loud cry leviticus cripps turned palefor his conscience smote him she meaneth me she meaneth me she meaneth my turmotfield he whispered with his long legs bent for departure tis a thousand pound they have offered zak come away come away down ship street there is a pump and i want some water but tell me what thou wast agoing to say cried his brother laying hold of him dash it i will tell thee the truth then zak i just went and cut up a maisly sowas fine a bit of pork as you ever clapped eyes on but for they little beauty spots and the clerk of the market bought some for his dinner and he have got a bad cook a cantankerous woman and now i be in a pretty mess not a word of all that do i believe said cripps chapter xvii installed at brasenose master cripps was accustomed mainly to daylight roads and open ways it was true that he had a good many corners to turn between beckley and oxford whether his course were through elsfield and marston or the broader track from headington but for all sharp turns he had two great maximskeep on the proper side and go slowly by virtue of these he had never been damaged himself or forced to pay damages and when he was in a pleasant vein at the dusty anvil or anywhere else it was useless to tell him that any mischance need happen to a man who heeded thisthat is to say if he drove a good horse and saw to the shoeing of the nag himself of course there was also the will of the lord but that was quite sure to go right if you watched it if he has any good substance in him a man who spends most of his daylight time in the company of an honest horse is sure to improve so much that none of his bad companions know himsupposing that he ever had any the simplicity and the good will of the horse his faith in mankind and his earnest desire to earn his oats and have plenty of them also the knowledge that his time is short and his longest worn shoes will outlast him and that when he is dead quite another must be bought who will cost twice as much as he didthese things if any sense can be made of them operate on the human mind in a measure for the most part favourable allowance therefore must be made for master leviticus cripps and his character as often as it is borne in mind that he from society of good horses was by mere mischance of birth fetched down to communion with low hogs not that hogs are in any way low from a properly elevated gazingpoint and taking perhaps the loftiest of human considerations they are as yet fondly believed to be much better on a dish than horses but thatas cripps would plainly put itis neither here nor there just now and it is ever so much better to let a man make his own excuses which he can generally do pretty well cripps well met cried russel overshute seizing him by the apron as zacchary stood at the corner of ship street to shake his head after his brother who had made off down the corn market you are the very man i want to see lor a mercy now be i your worship well there are not many gentlemen as it does me more good to look at without any flattery he might say that it was good after dealing with a crooked man to set eyes upon young overshute in his face there was no possibility of lie hidden thought or subterfuge whatever he meant was there expressed in quick bold features and frank bright eyes his tall straight figure firm neck and broad shoulders helped to make people respect what he meant moreover he walked as if he had always something in view before him he never turned round to look after a pretty girl as weak young fellows do he admired a pretty girl very much but had too much respect for her to show it he had made his choice once for all in life and his choice was sweet grace oglander i made sure of meeting you master cripps if not in the market at any rate where you put up your fine old horse i like a man who likes his horse i want to speak to you quietly cripps i am your man sir goo where you plaiseth without no beckoning i be after you there is nothing to make any fuss about cripps and the whole world is welcome to what i say whenever there is no one else concerned at present there are other people concernedand get out of the way you jackanapes in symmetry with his advanced ideas he should not have spoken thusbut he spake it and the eavesdropper touched his hat and made off very hastily russel was not at all certain of having quite acted up to his better lights and longed to square up all the wrong with a shilling but with higher philosophy suppressed that foolish yearning now cripps just follow me he said the carrier grumbled to himself a little because of all his parcels and the change he was to call for somewhere and a woman who could not make up her mind about a bullocks livernot to think of more important things in every other direction no one thought nothing of the value of his time every bit the same as if he was a lean old horse turned out to grass in spite of all that master cripps did his best to keep time with the long legs before him thus was he led through wellknown ways to the modest gate of brasenose which being passed he went up a staircase near the unpretentious hall of that very good society why am i here thought cripps but with his usual resignation added i have aseed finer places nor this this in the range of his great experience doubtless was an established truth but even his view of the breadth of the world received a little twist of wonder when over a narrow dark doorway which mr overshute passed in silence he readfor read he couldthese words rev thomas hardenow may i be danged said cripps if i ever come across such a queer thing as this here be however he quelled his emotions and followed the lengthystriding overshute into a long low room containing uncommonly little furniture there was no one there except overshute and a scout who flitted away in ripe haste with an order upon the buttery now cripps didst thou ever taste college ale mr overshute asked as he took a chair like the dead bones of ezekiel master carrier here thou hast the tokens of a new and important movement in my time chairs were comfortable but they make them now only to mortify the flesh did your worship mean me to sit down asked cripps touching the forelock which he kept combed for that purpose certainly cripps be not critical but sit i thank your worship kindly he answered with little cause for gratitude i have adruv many thousand mile on a seat no worse nor this perhaps your reservation is wise my friend your drivingboard must have been velvet to this but the new lights are not in our brewery yet if they get there they will have the worst of it here comes the tankard well done old hooper score a gallon to me for my family with pleasure sir answered hooper truly while he set on the table a tray filled with solid luncheon ah i see you remember the good old times when there was those in this college sir that never thought twice about keeping down the flesh and better flesh sir they had ever so much than these as are always adoctoring of it ah when i comes to recall to my mind what my father said to me when fust he led me in under king solomons nosebob my boy he says to me now hooper i know that his advice was good the fruit thereof is in yourself you shall tell me all about it the very next time i come to see you ah they never cares now to hearken said hooper to himself as with the resignation of an ancient scout he coughed and bowed and stroked the cloth and contemplated cripps with mild surprise and then made a quiet exit as for listening at the door a good scout scorns such benefit he likes to help himself to something more solid than the words behind him if i may make so bold said the carrier after waiting as long as he could with overshute clearly forgetting him what was it your worship was going to tell me time is going by sir and our horse will miss his feeding attend to your own cripps attend to your own i beg your pardon for not helping you but that you can do for yourself i dare say i am trying to think out something i used to be quick i am very slow now cripps made a little face at this to show that the ways of his betters had good right to be beyond him and then he stood upon his sturdy bowed legs and turned a quick corner of eye at the door in fear of any fasting influence and seeing nothing of the kind with pleasure laid hold of a large knife and fork lay about you cripps my friend lay about you to your utmost so said mr overshute himself refusing everything railly now i dunno your worship how to get on all aating by myself some folk can and some breaks down at it i must have somebody to ate with meso be it was only now a babby or a dog i thank you for the frank comparison cripps well help me if you mustah i see you can carve i am better at the raw mate sir but i can make shift when roasted butcher numbers my brother your worshipbut perhaps you never heered on him oh yes i know cripps a highly respectable thriving man he is too all your family thrive and everybody speaks so well of them why look at leviticus they tell me he has three hundred pigs like most men who have the great gift of gaining good will and popularity russel overshute loved a bit of gossip about his neighbours your worship said cripps disappointing him of any new information pigs is out of my way altogether when i was a young man of tender years counteracted i was for to carry a pig three pounds twelve shillings and four pence he cost me in less than threequarters of a mile of road and squeak squeak all the way as if i was akilling of him and not he me seemeth he smelled some apples somewhere and he went through a chaney clock and a violin and a set of firstborn babbylinen for squire corsers daughter grown up now she is your worship must a met her riding and that was not the worst of it nother well cripps you must tell me another time it was terribly hard upon you but my friend the gentleman who lives here will be back for his hat when the clock strikes two cap and gown off when the clock strikes two from two until five he walks fifteen miles whatever the state of the weather is lord bless me your worship i could not travel that with an empty cart and all downhill never mind cripps will you try to listen and offer no observation to say nortdoes your worship mean well all our family be esteemed for that then prove the justice of that esteem for i have a long story to tell you cripps and no long time to do it in chapter xviii a flash of light the carrier with a decisive gesture ceased from both solid and liquid food and settled his face and whole body and members into a grim and yet flexible aspect as if he were driving a halfbroken horse and must be prepared for any sort of start and yet with all this he reconciled a duly receptive deference and a pleasant readiness as if he were his own dobbin just fresh from stable i need not tell you master cripps said russel how i have picked up the many little things which have been coming to my knowledge lately and i will not be too positive about any of them because i made such a mistake in the beginning of this inquiry all my suspicions at first were set on a man who was purely innocenta legal gentleman of fair repute to whom i have now made all honourable amends in the most candid manner he has forgiven me and desires no better than to act in the best faith with us asking your pardon for interruptingdid the gentleman happen to have a sharp name yes cripps he did but no more of that i was over sharp myself no doubt he is thoroughly blameless and more than that his behaviour has been most generous most unwearying most i never can do justice to him well your worship noperhaps not a would take a rare sharp un to do so you hold by the vulgar prejudicewell i should be the last to blame you that however has nothing to do with what i want to ask you but first i must tell you my reason cripps you know i have no faith whatever in that man john smith at first i thought him a tool of mrnever mind whosince i was so wrong i am now convinced that john smith is art and part in the whole affair himself he has thrown dust in our eyes throughout he has stopped us from taking the proper track do you remember what discredit he threw on your sisters story he didnt believe a word of un had a good mind i had to a knocked un down to be sure cripps i wonder that you forbore though violent measures must not be encouraged and i myself thought that your sister might have made some mistakes through her scare in the dark poor thing her hair can have wanted no bandoline ever since i should fancy what a brave girl too not to shriek or faint well her did goo zummut queer sir and lie down in the quarrypit perhaps twas the wisest thing the poor young wench could do no doubt it wasthe very wisest however before she lost her wits she noticed as i understand her to sayor rather she was particularly struck with the harsh cackling voice of the taller man who also had a pointed hat she thinks it was not exactly a cackling voice nor a clacking voice nor a guttural voice but something compounded of all three your sister of course could not quite so describe it but she imitated it which was better her hath had great advantages her can imitate amost anything her waited for months on a collegechap the very same in whose house we be sitting now cripps that is strange but to come back again your sister who is a very nice girl indeed and a good member of a good family ay your worship that her be wish a could come across the man as would dare to say the contrairy now cripps we never shall get on while you are so horribly warlike are you ready to listen to me or not every blessed word your worship every blessed word goeth down unto such time as you begins to spake of things at home to me such dangerous topics i will avoid and now for the man with this villainous voice you knew or at any rate now you know that i never was satisfied with that wretched affair that was called an inquest inquest a non inquirendobut i beg your pardon my good cripps enough that the whole was pompous childs play guided by crafty hands beneath as happens with most inquests i only doubted the more friend cripps i only doubted the more from having a wrong way taken to extinguish doubts to be sure your worship a lie on the back of another lie makes un go heavier well never mind only this i did for a few days perhaps i was overcome and the illness of my dear old friend the squire and the trouble of managing so that he should not hear anything to kill him and my own slowness at the back of it all for i never as you know am hastythese things one and another kept me from going on horseback anywhere to be sure your worship to be sure you ought to be always ahorseback ive aseed you many times on the bench but you looks a very poor stick there compared to what ee be ahorseback now cripps where is your reverence you call me your worship and in the same breath contemn my judicial functions i must commit you for a weeks hard labour at getting in and out of your own cart if you will not allow me to speak cripps at last i have frightened you have i then let me secure the result in silence well after the weather began to change from that tremendous frost and snow and the poor squire fell into the quiet state that he has been in ever since i found that nothing would do for me my health not being quite as usual oh your worship was wonderfully kind they told me you was as good as any old woman in the room almost except to take long rides cripps nothing at all would do for me and not to speak of myself too much i believe that saved me from falling into a weak and spooney and godless state i assure you there were timeshowever never mind that i am all right now and thank the lord you ought to say sir but you great squires upon the bench thank the lord i do say cripps i thank him every day for it but if i may edge in a word in your unusually eloquent state i will tell you just what happened to me i never believed and never will that poor miss oglander is dead the coroner and the jury believed that they had her remains before them although for the squires sake they forbore to identify her in the verdict your sister no doubt believed the same and so did almost every one i could not go i could not gono doubt i was a fool but i could not face the chance of what i might see after what i had heard of it well i began to ride about saying nothing of course to any one and the more i rode the more my spirit and faith in good things came back to me and i think i have been rewarded cripps at last i have been rewarded it is not very much but still it is like a flash of light to me i have found out the man with the horrible voice lord have mercy upon me your worshipthe man as laid hold of the pickaxe i have found him cripps i do believe but rather by pure luck than skill there be no such thing as luck your worship if you will excoose me the lord in heaven is the master of us upon my word it looks almost like it though i never took that view of things however this was the way of it today is saturday well it was last wednesday night i was coming home from a long and wet and muddy ride to maidenhead that little town always pleases me and i like the landlord and the hostler and i am sure that my horse is fed your worship must never think such a thing without you see it mixed and feel it and watch him amunching until he hath done more than that i have always fancied ever since that story was about the bag of potatoes you brought without knowing any more of itever since i heard of that it has seemed to me that more inquiries ought to be made at maidenhead i need not say why but i know that the squires opinion had been the same as long asi mean whilehis health permitted on wednesday i went to the foreman of the nursery whence the potatoes came it was raining hard and he was in a shed with a green baize apron on seeing to some potting work i got him away from the other men and i found him a very sharp fellow indeed he remembered all about those potatoes especially as squire oglander had ridden from oxford in the snowy weather to ask many questions about them but the squire could not put the questions i did the poor old gentleman could not bear of course to expose his trouble but i threw away all little scruples as truly i should have done long ago and i told the good foreman every word so far as we know it yet at least he was shocked beyond expressionpeople take things in such different waysnot at the poor squires loss and anguish but that anybody should have dared to meddle with his own pet oakleafs and above all his new pet seal i sealed them myself he said sealed them myself sir with the new coat of arms that we paid for that month because of the tricks of the trade sir has anybody dared to imitate no mr foreman i said they simply cut away your seal altogether and tied it again without any seal oh then he replied that quite alters the case if they had only meddled with our new arms while the money was hot that we paid for them what a case we might have had but to knock them offno action lies cripps it took me a very long time to warm him up to the matter again after that great disappointment he was burning for some great suit at law against some rival nursery which always pays the upstart one but i led him round and by patient words and simple truth brought him back to reason the packing of the bag he remembered well and the pouring of a lot of buckwheat husks around and among the potato sets to keep them from bruising and to keep out frost which seemed even then to be in the air and he sent his best man to the oxford coach the first down coach from london which passed by their gate about ten oclock and would be in oxford about two with the weather and the roads as usual in that case the bag could scarcely have been at the black horse more than half an hour before you came and laid hold of it and being put into the bar as the squires parcels always are it was very unlikely to be tampered with lord a mercy your worship it was witchcraft then the same as i said all along it were witches craft and nothing else stop cripps dont you be in such a hurry but wait till you hear what i have next to tell but oh here comes my friend hardenow as punctual as the clock strikes two well old fellow how are you getting on chapter xix a stormy night the rev thomas hardenow fellow and tutor of brasenose strode into his own room at full speed and stopped abruptly at sight of the carrier of all men most i have avoided thee was in his mind but he spoke it not though being a strongly outspoken man not that he ever had done any wrong to make him be shy of the cripps race but that he felt in his heart a desire for commune which must be dangerous he knew that in him lurked a foolish tendency towards esther and which was worse he knew that she had done her best to overcome a still more foolish turn towards him cripps however who would have fed the doves of venus on black peas looked upon any little bygone coorting as a social and congenial topic enabling a quiet man to get on if he only had a good memory with almost any woman like a sensible man he had always acquitted hardenow of any blame in the matter knowing that young girls fancies may be caught without any angling if her chose to be a fool how were he to blame for it and the carrier never forgot the stages of social distinction servant sir he therefore said with his usual salaam hope i see you well sir thank you zacchary said mr hardenow taking the carriers horny palm which always smelled of straps and buckles and trying to squeeze it with a passive result i am pretty well zacchary thank you then you dont look it sir that you doesnt we heerd you was getting on wonderful well but the proof of the puddin aint in you sir thats right cripps cried overshute give it to him cripps why he starves himself ever since he took his first and second and got his fellowship and took orders he hasnt known what a good dinner is he keeps all the fasts in the calendar and the vigils of the festivals and he ought to have an appetite for the feasts but he overstays his time and cant keep anything on his stomach now russel as usual hardenow answered with a true and pleasant smile what a fine fellow you would be if you only had moderation but i see that you want to talk to cripps and i have several men waiting in the quad where is my beaver oh here to be sure will you come with us no of course you cant will you dine in hall with me of course i wont but come you and dine with me on sundaythe only day you dare eat a bitand my mother will do her best to strengthen you build you up establish you for a fortnight of macaroni will you come yes yes tomorrowto be surei have many things i want to say to you goodbye for the present goodbye master cripps there goes one of the finest fellows of all the fine fellows yet ruined by rubbish with these words russel overshute ran to the window and looked out a dozen or more of young men were waiting the best undergraduates of the college for mr hardenow to lead them for fifteen miles without a word well every man to his liking said russel but that would be about the last of mine now cripps most patient of carriers are you ready for me to go on or not i hath a been thinking about my horse how greedy o me to be ating like thisfor the thought of so much fasting had made him set to again while he got the chancedrinking likewise of college alebetter i have tasted but not oftenand all this time as you might say old dobbin easing of his dainty foot with no more nor a wisp of hay to drag through his waterif he hath any an excruciating picture cripps drawn by too vivid a conscience dobbin is as happy as he can be with twentyfive horses to talk to him at this very moment i behold him munching choicest of white oats and chaff your worship can see through a stonewall they say but they only keeps black oats at the cross just now along of a contract the landlord have madeand a blind sort of bargain to my thinking never mind thatlet him have black oats then or irish oats or no oats at all but do you wish to hear my story out or will you leave it till next saturday sir you might a seen as i was waiting until such time as you plaze to go on wi un very well cripps that satisfies the most exacting historian i will go on where i left off if that point can be established well i left the foreman of the nursery telling me about the man he sent with the bag of potatoes to the oxford coach he told me he was one of his sharpest hands who had been off work for a week or two then and had only returned that morning joe smith was his name and when they could get him to work he would do as much work as any two other men on the place he might be trusted with anything if he only undertook it but the worst of him was that he never could be got to stick long to anything here today and gone tomorrow had always been his character and they thought that he must be of gipsy race and perhaps had a wandering family this made me a little curious about the man and i asked to see him but the foreman said that for some days now he had not been near the nursery and they thought that he was on the oxford road in the neighbourhood of nettlebed and another thingif i did see him i could not make out more than half he said for the man had such a defect in his voice that only those who were used to him could be certain of his meaning suddenly i thought of your sisters tale and i said to the foreman does he speak like this imitating as well as i could your sisters imitation of him you know the man sir the foreman answered you have got him so exactly that you must have heard him many times i told him no more but asked him to describe joe smiths appearance he answered that he was a tall dark man loosely built but powerful with a stoop in his neck and a long sharp nose and he generally wore a brown pointed hat cripps you may well suppose that my suspicions were strong by this time here was your sisters descriptionso far as the poor girl could see in the dusk and the frightconfirmed to the very letter and here was the clear opportunity offered for slipping the wreath of hair into the bag your worship now your worship you be a bit too sharp if that there man were at headington quarry at nightfall of the tuesday how could he possible a been to maidenhead next morning no no your worship are too sharp too thick you mean cripps and not sharp enough but listen to me for a moment those longlegged gipsies think very little of going thirty miles in a night though they never travel by day so and then there is the up mailcoach of course he would not pay his fare but he might hang on beneath the guards bugle with or without his knowledge and slip away at the changinghouses of that objection i think nothing it serves to my mind as a confirmation very well sir said cripps discreetly who be i for to argify no cripps of course not but still i wish to allow you to think of everything you may not be right but still i like you to speak when you think of anything that is what i have always said and contended for continuallylet every man speakwhen sensible your worship hath hit the mark again the old squire saith let no man speak as st paul sayeth of the women but your worship saith let all men speak all women likewise as hath a tongueand then you stoppeth us both the more by restirrecting all on us women or men whichever a may happen till such time as all turns up sensible now there never could ever be such a time carrier you are satirical keep from the dusty anvil cripps marry a wife and you will have a surfeit of argument at home but still you have been very good on the whole and you never will get home tonight at any rate i was so convinced in spite of all smaller difficulties that i bound the foreman to let me know by a man on horseback at any expense the moment he saw joe smith again and his parting words to me were thesewell sir dont you think harm of joe without sure proof against him he is a random chap i know but i never saw a better man to earn his wages well i went back to the inn at once and rode leisurely to henley it was raining hard and the river in flood with all the melted snow and so on when i crossed that pretty bridge i had been trying in vain to think what was the best thing i could do not liking to go home and leave my new discovery so vague but being soaked and chilly now i resolved to have a glass of something hot for fear of taking a violent cold and losing perhaps a week by it so i went into the entrance of that good inn by the waterside and called for some brandy and water hot the landlord was good enough to come out and knowing me from old boating days he got into a talk with me i had helped him at the sessions about a house of his at dorchester and nothing could exceed his good will remembering how the gipsies hang about the boats and the waterside i asked him quite as a random shot whether any of them happened to be in the neighbourhood just now he thought perhaps that i was timid about my dark ride homeward and he told me all he knew of them there was one lot as usual in the open ground about nuneham and another large camp near chalgrove and another quite a small pitch that on the edge of the firs above nettlebed this last was the lot for me and i pressed him so about them that he looked at me with a peculiar grin what do you mean by that i asked now squire overshute as if you did not know he answered doth your worship happen to remember cinnamintas name cripps i assure you i was astonished of course you knew cinnamintawell i dont want to be interrupted no one could say any harm of her and a lovelier girl was never seen the landlord had heard some bygone gossip about cinnaminta and myself i did admire her i am not ashamed to say that i greatly admired her and so did every young fellow here who had got a bit of pluck in him i will not go into that question but you know what cinnaminta was cripps nodded with a thick mixture of feelings his poetical self had been smitten more with cinnaminta than he cared to tell and his practical self was getting into a terrible hubbub about his horse to be sure your worship was all he said very well now you understand me to hear of cinnaminta being in that camp at nettlebed made me so determined that i laid hold of the landlord by the collar without thinking he begged me not to ride off with him or his business would be ruined and feeling that he weighed about eighteen stone i left him on his threshold i could not bear to ask him now another word of anything knowing looks and winks and reeking jokes so irritate me when i know that a woman is pure and good you remember how we all lost cinnaminta three or four score of undergraduates reckless of parental will had offered her matrimony and three or four newlyelected fellows were asking whether they would vacate if they happened to jump the broomstick all that were too fine to last muttered cripps most sensibly but her ought to a had a sound man on the roada man with a horse well seasoned and a substantial carther ought oh then cripps you were smitten too a nice connection for light parcels well never mind the whole thing is over we all are sadder and wiser men but we like to know who the chief sufferer iswhat man has won the beauty and with this in my mind i rode up the hill and resolved to go through with my seeking when i got to the end of the fairmile the night came down in earnest you know my young horse cantelupe freckled like a melon he knows me as well as my old dog and a child can ride him but in the dark he gets often nervous and jumps across the road if he sees what he does not consider sociable so that one must watch his ears whatever the weather may be and now the weather was as bad as man or horse could be out in all day there had been spits of rain with sudden puffs of wind and streaks of green upon the sky and racing clouds with ragged edges you remember the weather of course wednesday is one of your oxford days well i hope you were home before it began to pelt as it did that evening for myself i did not care one fig i would rather be drenched than slowly sodden but i did care for my horse because he had whistled a little in the afternoon and his throat is slightly delicate and the whirr of the wind in the hedge and the way it struck the naked branches back like the clashing of clubs against the sky were enough to make even a steady old horse uneasy at the things before him moreover the road began to flash with that peculiar light which comes upward or downwardwho can tellin reckless tumults of the air and earth the road was running like a river come here and go there like glass it shone with the furious blows of the wind striking a pale gleam out of it i stooped upon cantelupes neck or the wind would have dashed me back over his crupper suddenly in this swirl and roar my horse stood steadfast he spread his fore legs and stooped his head to throw his balance forward and his mane which had been lashing my beard swished down in a waterfall of hair i was startled as much as he was and in the strange light stared about you have better eyes than i have i said or else you are a fool canty i thought that he was a fool until i followed the turn of his head and there i saw a white thing in the ditch something white or rather of a whitybrown colour was in the trough with something dark leaning over it who are you there i shouted and the wind blew my voice back between my teeth nort to you master nort to you go on and look to your own consarns this rough reply was in a harsh high cackle rather than a human voice but it came through the roar of the tempest clearly as no common voice could come for a moment i had a great mind to do exactly as i was ordered but curiosity and perhaps some pity for the fellow stopped me i will not leave you my friend i said until i am sure that i can do no good the man was in such trouble that he made no answer which i could hear so i jumped from my horse who would come no nearer and holding the bridle i went up to see in as sheltered a spot as could be found but still in a dripping and weltering place lay or rather rolled and kicked a poor child in a most violent fit dont ee now my little tom dont ee thats a deary dont the man kept coaxing and moaning and trying to smooth down little legs and arms let it have its way i said only keep the head well up and try to put something between the teeth without any answer he did as i bade and what he put betwixt the teeth must have been his own great thumb of course he mistook me for a doctor none but a doctor was likely to be out riding on so rough a night ah how i do pity they poor chaps cried carrier cripps who really could not wait one minute longer many a naight i mates em a starting for ten or twenty maile of it just when i be in the smell o my supper and nort but nightcap arterward leastways i mean arter pipe and hot summat your worshipll scoose me abreakin in but theres half my arrands to do yet and the sun gone flat on the radcliffe the lord knows if i shall get home tonight but if i doosmight i make so boldyour worship be coming to see poor squire your worship is not like some worships beand i has got a rare drop of fine old stuff your worship is not the man to take me crooked i means no liberty mind you of that i am certain mr overshute answered cripps your suggestion just hits the mark i particularly want to see your sister that was my object in seeking you and i did not like to see her until you should have had time to prepare her i have several things to see to here and then i will ride to beckley mrs hookham will give me a bit of dinner when i have seen my dear friend the squire at night i will come down and smoke a pipe and finish my story with you as soon as i am sure you have had your supper never you pay no heed at all said master cripps with solemnity to no thought of my zupper sir that be entire what you worships call a zecondary consideration however i will have un if so be i can and you mustnt goo for to think sir that goo i would now if stay i could i goes with that there story the same as the jog of a cart to the trot of the nag my wits kapes on agoin up and down but business is a piece of the body sir but no slape for me nor no church tomorrow wiout i hears the last of that there tale chapter xx cripps draws the cork any kind goodnatured person loving bright simplicity would have thought it a little treat to look round the carriers dwellingroom upon that saturday evening when he expected mr overshute not that cripps himself was overtidy or too particular he was so kindly familiar now with hay and straw and bits of string and chaff and chips and promiscuous parcels that on the whole he preferred a litter to any exertions of broom or brush but esther who ruled the house at home was the essence of quick neatness and scorned all comfort unless it lookedas well as wasright comfortable and now expecting so grand a guest she had tucked up her sleeves and stirred her pretty arms to no small purpose the room was still a kitchen and she had made no attempt to disguise that much but what can look better than a kitchen clean and bright and well supplied with the cheery tools of appetite it was a goodsized room and very picturesque with snugness little corners in and out gave play for light and shadow the fireplace retired far enough to well express itself and the dresser had brasshandled drawers that seemed quietly nursing tablecloths well above these upon lofty hooks the chronicles of the present generation might be read on cups zacchary headed the line of course and thenas genesis is ignored by grander generationsexodus and leviticus the fount of much fine movement and numbers and a great many more showed that the carriers father and mother had gladly baptized every one in front of the fire sat the carrier with nearly all of his best clothes on and gazing at a warmingpan he had been forbidden to eat his supper for fear of making a smell of it and he had a great mind to go to bed and have some hot coals under him for nearly five miles of uphill work and laying his shoulder against the spokes he had been promising himself a rare good supper and a pipe to follow and now where were they in the far background he had no idea of rebellion still that saucepan on the simmer made the most provoking movements therefore he put up his feet upon a stump of oak which had for generations cooled down pots and he turned with a shake of his head toward the fire and sniffed the sniff of tantalus and mutteredah well the lord knoweth best and thought to himself that if ever again he invited the quality to his house he would wait till he had his own quantity first esther was quite in a flutter although she was ready to deny it stoutly and to blush a bright red in doing so to her of course justice overshute was simply a great man who must have the chair of state and the talk of restraint and a clean dry hearth and the curtsy and the best white apron of deference to her it could make not one jot of difference that mr overshute happened to be the most intimate friend of some other gentleman who never came near her except in dreams tush she had the very greatest mind when the house was clean and tidy to go and spend the evening with her dear friend mealy at the anvil but zacchary would not hear of this and how could she go against zacchary so she brought the grand chair the armchair of yewtreethe tree that used to shade the graves of unrecorded crippsesa chair of deepest red complexion countenanced with a cushion the cushion was but a little pad in the dark capacious hollow suggesting to an innocent mind that a lean man had left his hat there and a fat man had sat down on it but the mind of every cripps yet known was strictly reverential and this was the curule chair and even the olympian throne of crippses russel overshute knocked at the door in his usual quick and impetuous way in the main he was a gentleman and he would have knocked at a noblemans door exactly as he did at the carriers but all radical theories fine as they are detract from gentle practice and the toolargeminded man while young takes a flying leap over small niceties he does not remember that poor men need more deference than rich men because they are not used to it to put it more plainlyovershute knocked hard and meant no harm by it come in sir and kindly welcome cripps began as he showed him in plaize to take this chair your worship never mind your boots lor bless us the mud of three counties cometh here then it goes away again very quickly miss cripps how are you may i shake hands esther who had been shrinking into the shade of the clock and the dresser came forward with a brave bright blush and offered her hand as a lady might russel overshute took it kindly and bowed to her curtsy and smiled at her in an honest manly way he admired pretty esther master cripps you are too bad and your sister in the conspiracy too i do believe that your mind is set to make me as tipsy as a king tonight they little things said the carrier pointing to the old oak table where a bottle of grand old whiskey shone with the reflected gleam of lemons and glasses danced in the firelightthey little things sir was never set for so good a gentleman afore nor a one to do such honour to un but they might be worse sir they might be worse to spake their simple due of un and how is poor squire tonight your worship well he is about as usual nothing seems to move him much he sits in his old chair and listens for a step that never comes but his patience is wonderful it ought to be a lesson to us and i hope it has been one to me he trusts in the lord cripps as strongly as ever i fear i should have given up that long ago if i were laid on my back as he is young folk answered cripps as he drew the corkmeaning no disrespect to you sirwhen they encounters trouble is like a young horse acoming to the foot of a hill for the fust time wi a heavy load he feeleth the collar beginning to press and he tosseth his head and that maketh un worse he beginneth to get into fret and fume and he shaketh his legs with anger and he turneth his head and foameth a bit and champeth to ax the maning o it and then you can judge what the stuff of him is if he be bad stuff he throweth them back and tilteth up his loins and spraddleth but if he hath good stuff he throweth out his chest and putteth the fire into his eyes and closeth his nostrils and gathereth his legs and straineth his muscles like a bowstring but be he as good as a wool he longeth to see over the top of that there hill afore he be halfway up it well cripps i have done that i confess i have longed to see over the top of the hill and heaven only knows where that top is but as sure as we sit here and drink this glass of punch to your sisters health and to yours good carrier so surely shall our dear old friend receive the reward of his faith and courage whether in this world or the next thank ee kindly sir etty is that the best sort of curtsy they teaches now now dont blush child but make a betterer but as to what your worship was asaying of i virtually hopes a may come to pass in this world we be living in otherwise maybe us never may know on it the kingdom of heaven being such a size cripps i believe it will be in this world and i hope that i am on the straight road now towards making out some part of it you have told your sister all i told you at brasenose this morning according to my directions very well then i may begin again at the point where i left off with you where did i break it i almost forget with the mans big thumb in the mouth of the cheeld while you was alooking at him sir and the wind and the rain blowing furious ah yes i remember and so they were i thought that the crest of the hedge would fall over and bury the whole of us out of the way and when the poor boy had kicked out his convulsions and fallen into a senseless sleep the rough man turned on me savagely as if i could have prevented it a pretty doctor you be he exclaimed but i took the upper hand of him stand back there i said and i lifted the child expecting him to strike me all the while and placed the poor little fellow on my horse and managed to get up into my saddle before the wind blew him off again now lead the way to your home i said and muttering something he set off he strode along at such a pace that having to manage both child and horse it was all i could do to keep up with him but i kept him in sight till he came to a common and there he struck sharply away to the right by the light of the wind and the rain and a star that twinkled where the storm was lifting i followed him perhaps for half a mile through a narrow track in and out furze and bramble at last he turned suddenly round a corner and a shadow fell behind himhis own shadow thrown by a gusty gleam of fire cantelupethat is my horse miss estherhas not learned to stand fire yet and he shied at the light and set off through the furze as if with the hounds in full cry before him we were very lucky not to break our necks going headlong in the dark among rabbitholes i thought that i must have dropped the child as the best thing to be done for him but the shaking revived him and he clung to me i got my horse under command at last but we must have gone half a mile anywhere and to find the way back seemed a hopeless task but the quickwitted people who knew what had happened and what was likely to come of it saved me miles of roundabout by a very simple expedient they hoisted from time to time a torch of dry furze blazing upon a pole and though the light flared and went out on the wind by the quick repetition they guided me in the cold and the wet it rejoiced my heart to think of a good fire somewhere etty stir the fire up the hospitable cripps interrupted his worship hath shivers to think of it when a man or beg pardon a gentleman feeleth the small of his back go creeping he needeth good fire to come up his legs and a hot summat to go down him etty be quick with the water now cripps cripps carrier cripps do you want to have me spilled on the road tonight i am trying to tell things in proper order but how can i do it if you go on so however as i was beginning to say cantelupe and the child and i fetched back to the place at last where the flash of light had started us and we saw not a flash but a glow this time a steadfast body of cheerful fire with pots and cauldrons over it so well had the spot been chosen in the lee of ground and growth that the ash of the fire lay round the embers as still as the beard of an oyster while thicket and tree but a few yards off were threshing in the wind and wailing behind this fire and under a rickcloth sloping from a sandstone crest women and children and one or two men sat as happy and snug as could be dry and warm and ready for supper and pleased with the wind and the rain outside which improved their comfort and appetite and now and then the children seemed to be pulling at an important woman to hurry her perhaps in her cookery but while i was watching them keeping my horse on the verge of light and shadow a woman quite different from the rest came out of the darkness after me heedless of weather and reckless of self she had been seeking for me or rather for my little burden her hair was steeped with the drenching rain for she wore no hat or bonnet and her dark clothes hung on the lines of her figure as women hate to let them do her eyes and face i could not see because of the way the light fell but i seemed to know her none the less while i gazed in doubt my little fellow slipped like an eel from my clasp and the saddle and almost before i could tell where he wasthere he was in the arms of his mother wonders of love now began to go on and it struck me that i was one too many in a scene of that sort and i turned my good horse to be off and away but the woman called out and a man laid hold of my bridle and took his hat off when with the usual impulse of a stopped briton i was going to strike at him i saw that it was my good friend of the ditch and i came to parley with him what with his scarcity of manners and of polished language and worst of all his want of palate i found it hard with so much wind blowing out here all around us to understand his meaning this was rude of me to the last degree for the queerlyvoiced man was doing no less than inviting me with all his heart to an uncommonly good dinner chapter xxi cinnaminta now that said cripps is what i call the proper way of doing things arter all they hathens knows a dale more than we credit em well miss esther asked russel turning to his other listener what do you think about it now sir she replied with her round cheeks coloured by the excitement of his tale and shining in the firelight i do not know what the manners may be among the gentry in such things but if it had been one of us we never could have supped with him you are right answered overshute so i felt starving as i was i could not break bread with a man like that until he should have cleared himself he did not seem to be conscious of any dark mistrust on my part and that was natural enough as he did not even know me but when i said that i must ride home as fast as i could he asked me first to come and have a look at the poor little child this i could not well refuse so i gave my horse to a boy to hold and followed him into the warm dry place and into his own corner as i passed and the people made way for me i saw that they were genuine gipsies not mere english vagabonds there was no mistaking the clearlycut features and the olive complexions and the dark eyes lashed both above and below my gruff companion raised a screen and showed me into his snuggery it was dimly lit by a queer old lamp of red earthenware and of roman shape couches of heather and a few low stools and some vessels were the only furniture but the place was beautifully clean and fragrant with dry fern and herbs in the furthest corner lay little tom with a woman bending over him at the sound of our entry she turned to meet us and i saw cinnaminta her hair and eyes and graceful carriage were as grand as ever and her forehead as clear and noble but her face had lost the bright puzzle of youth and the flush of damask beauty in a word that rich mysterious look which used to thrill so many hearts was changed into the glance of fear and the restless gaze of anxiety she knew me at once and asked with a very poor attempt at gaietyare you come to have your fortune told sir before i could answer her husband spoke some words in her own language and the princess as we used to call her took my hand in both of hers and kissed it and poured forth her thanks she had been so engrossed with her poor sick child that she had not known me on horseback having done so little to deserve her thanks i was quite surprised at such gratitude and it made me fear that she must be now unaccustomed to kind treatment i asked how her grandmother was who used to sit up so proudly at cowley as well as her sister the little thing that used to run in and out so as i spoke of them she shook her head and gazed at some long distance to tell me that they were no more i could not remember the rest of her people except her uncle kershoe as fine a fellow as ever stole a horse when i spoke of him she laughed as if he were going on as well as ever and i hoped that it might be no son of his to whom i had trusted cantelupe but of course i knew that gipsy honour would hold him sacred for the time even if he were bay middleton then i asked her about her own children and again she shook her head and saidthree all three in one are now and that is the one you saved with that while her husband left the tent cinnaminta led me to look at the poor little fellow in his deep warm sleep a beautiful little boy it was a real princess might yearn in vain for such a lovely offspring if only the stamp of health had been on him but the glow of airy health and breezy vigour was not on him neither will it ever be so far as one may judge by skin clear transparent pearly skin all whose colour seems to come from under instead of over it the more the wind or the sun strikes on it the more its colour evaporates i fear that poor cinnamintas child will go the way of the younger ones poor dear poor dear exclaimed the carrier rubbing his nose in a sad slow way i can guess what her would be to them if her loseth that little un mindwell then you will see if her dothnt go arter un i believe that she will replied overshute i never saw any one so wrapped up in another being as she is as for joe smith her husband and the way she treats him i couldntno i never could put up with it even if it were but miss esther why do you look with such a curious smile at me of such matters what can you know however there goes your clock again cripps i shall never get home tonight and my mother will think i was poaching because i will not send the poachers to prison she believes that i must be a poacher myself now verily your worship that bates all i have ever heerd of how could a justice go apoaching howsomever he tried his best cripps he might i believe he might if he really did his best for it however let that question pass although it is highly interesting i will try at my leisure to solve it but how can i think of such little things in the middle of great sad ones it really made me feel as if i never should laugh again almost when i saw this fine unselfish woman controlling herself and commanding herself in the depth of her misery about her child and when i thought how she might have got on if she only had liked education and that and to marry a fellow of oriel i assure you miss esther i began to feel how women throw away their chances of course i could not hint at things disloyalor what shall i call them unconjugal perhaps is what i mean unuxorial or what it may be but although i am slow at seeing things because i used to think myself too quick and have made false charges through it i really could not help feeling sure that poor cinnaminta had made an awkward tally with her husband however that was no concern of mine she had made her own choice and must stick to it but to think of it made me uncomfortable and i could not speak then of what i wished to speak of but took short leave and rode away first however i got permission to come over again on the fridayyesterday i mean and now i will tell you exactly what happened then your worship do tell a tale said cripps that wonderful that us be almost there they women takes a man whether or no he wool and when they gets tired of un they puts all the fault on he they do there was a woman as did the washing over to squire pembertons nothing to look atunless you hadnt seen doneup hair for a twelvemonth the same as happens to the sailors and in her goroundings of no account for to catch the notice of a man much but that very woman im danged if her didnt zacchary hush said esther and the carrier muttered of course of course no chance of fair play wi un well go on your worship i have very little more to tell you as yet overshute answered with a smile at both you have listened with wonderful patience to me and i am surprised at remembering half of what happened to me in a hurry so i shall make more allowance for witnesses now when they get confused and hesitate but as i was going to say i rode over to nettlebed common or whatever it is called in good time yesterday so as to have a long quiet talk with cinnaminta knowing that if she would not tell me the truth she would tell no falsehood as i rode along in that fine spring sun my mind was unusually clear and bright i saw to a nicety what questions i ought to put and how to put them and nothing of all the ins and outs of this matter could escape me when the sun threw my shadow as sharp as a die i could not help laughing to the open road and the clear long breadth of prospect at the narrow stupid thoughts we had been thinking throughout the winter in a word i was sure as i am of my life of finding sweet grace oglander and restoring her father to his fine old health and spreading great happiness everywhere and thus i rode up to the gipsycampand there was not a shadow or a trace of it chapter xxii a delicate subject the log had burned down and the fire was low when russel thus ended his story cripps was indignant because he had made up his mind for summat of a zettlement and esther was full of young womanly thoughts about cinnaminta and her poor child but even before they could consult one another or crossexamine a loud sharp knock at the door was heard and in ran mary hookham oh if you please siroh if you please sir she exclaimed with both hands up and making the most of her shawl fringe such a thing have turned upi never them stockings oh them silk stockings sir your worshipoh them silk stockings sir my dear said cripps in a fatherly tone and with less contemporary feeling than mary might wish to inspire him withmy dear good maid you be that upset that to spake without sloping the spout of the kettle might lade to amost anything etty you aint had a drap of nortand all the better for ee give over your glass girl now miss mary the laste little drap and then you spakes and then you has another drap scoose me your worship to make so bold but a young man cant see them things in the right light oh master cripps now cried mary hookham what but a young man be you yourself and none of they young men can point their tongues to compare with you to my mind but i beg your pardon sir mr russelyour name come so familiar to me through our dear young lady i forgot what i was adoing your worship to be sitting down in your presence so mary if you get up i shall get up also and go away we are both enjoying the hospitality of our good friend master cripps now mary by no means hurry yourself but tell me at your leisure why you came and what your news is silk stockings forsooth cried master cripps being vexed at this break of the evening why my grandmother had a whole pair of they i belave i could find em now i do silk stockings to break up ones comfort for not but what i be glad to see you mary my dear i drink your good health touching spoons in lack of lips oh mr cripps you are so funny and you do make me fell things in such a way bless me if i havent dropped my comb oh i am so shocked to trouble you natteral hair are so provoking compared to what most people wears nowadays but about what i come foroh your worship stockings is not what i ought to speak of except in the ear of females stockings are a very good subject mary particularly if they are silk ones lor sir now i never thought of that to be sure that makes all the difference well then your worship must know all and master cripps and miss esther too it seemeth that mrs fermitage masters own sister you know sir have never been comfortable in her mind about her behaviour when the quest was held things lay on her nerves at that time so that off and on she hardly seemed to know where she was or how dooty lay to her not that she is at all selfish if you please to understand meno more selfish than i myself be or any one of us here present but ladies requires allowance and it makes me have a pain to think of it you could not expect hercould you nowto go through it as if she was a man or rather i should say a gentleman of course we could not answered overshute and the carrier began to think why not however she did go through it said mary as well as the very best man could have done she covered her feelings as you might say with a pint pot or with less than that with a wineglass of brandy i did hear tell said master cripps inquiringly no no that was a shocking story it makes me ashamed of the place as we live in whenever i heer such scandalies miss mary my dear i beg your pardon lord knows i only say what i heers take a little drop miss and go on it makes one afeared to touch a drop of most hinnocent mixture as ever was continued poor mary after one good gulp and at the same time most respectable waterswhen people as never had opportunity of forming no judgment about thempeople as only can spit out their tongues at them as have some good taste in theirn when such folkfor people they are notdareth to go forth to say but i see you are laughing at me your worship and perhaps i well deserve it sir it is no place of mine to convarse of such subjectsme who never deals with em but one way or other that good lady as barring her way with her servants she is which our good master have many a time up and given it to her about well this very day sir in she come when i was adoing of my morning doosevery bit as partiklar sir as if i had a mistress over me and she say to me mary hookham and i says yes maam at your service and she ask me without any more to dothe just words i cannot now call to mindfor to send at once without troubling poor master to fetch they stockings as was put by to the period of the coroners quest poor master have never been allowed to see them no more has none of us sir for fear of setting on foot some allowance of vulgar curiosity and all of us is not above it i know but that is a natteral error in places where few has had much eddication i dont hold much with that there eddication cried the carrier rather gloomily a may suit some people but not many they puts it on em all alike wiout trial of constitootion some goes better for it but most volk worse well you know best mr cripps of course up and down the road as you be every door give you a hinstance his worship is all for eddication and no one need swaller it unless they likes but pretty well schooled as i have been sir i looks down on no one and now when masters sister made that sudden call upon me i assure you sir and master cripps and miss esther in the corner there the very first thing as i longed for was more knowledge of the ways of the kingdom more sense i mean of where the powers puts the things that have been called up and laid at the feet of the lawcourts they stockings was more lost to me than gone to be washed by the gipsies it never would have done for me to say that much to mrs fermitage she would have been out in a wrath at once for she is not sweet like master so i gave her all yes instead of why or how as we do to quicktempered gentlefolk and then i ran away to ask my mother and she no more than laughed at me you silly child says mother quite as if there had never been a fool till now when the law getteth hold of a thing there be only two places for to find it in two places mother what two places said i without construction why the righthand or the lefthand pocket of a lawyers breeches mother answered just as if she had served all her time with a tailor now dont laugh mr overshute it is true every word as i tell you ay that her be cried cripps with a smack of one hand on the other your mother is a wonderful woman for truth and sense my deary well well replied mary with a broad knowing smile as much as to say you had better try her at her time of life her ought to be if ever they seek to attain it so i acted according to mothers directions letting her always speak foremost and between us we got master kale to go on his legs all the way to oxford with the hope of a lift back with you master cripps but late as you was he were later he carried a letter from mrs fermitage couched in the thirtieth person to mrs luke sharp of crossduck house the very one as sent that good book back masters sister have felt below contempt towards her since that time and in dignity could do no otherwise and now she put it short and sharp as no less could be expectedand word for word can i say of it mrs fermitage has the honour of presenting her compliments to mrs sharp and begs to express her surprise at the strange retention by mrs s of a pair of valuable silk stockings which are the property of mrs f if they are not in use it is begged that they may be returned by the bearerpostscript mrs f takes this opportunity of acknowledging the return of a book which being filled only with the word of god was perhaps of less practical value to mrs s than silk stockings appear to be that will fetch them said my mother if they be in the house that will fetch them maam no lady could stand against them inawindows and sure enough back they come by mr kale about an hour after you left our house sir it seems that mr luke sharp was gone to dine with the corporation or likely they never would have come at all and they never would have come at all because mrs sharp could not have found them if it hadnt been that master sharp the boy they think such wonders of just happened to come in from shooting where the whole of his time he spends he found his mother in the hystrikes of a heart too full for tears as she expressed it bootifully to both cook and housemaid and they pointed to the letter and he read it and he were that put out that master kale seeing the two big barrels of his gun were touched in his conscience and ran away and got under the mangle what happened then he were afeard to be sure of but the cook and the housemaid brought him out and they locked him in to eat a bit which he did with trembles of thankfulness and almost afore he had licked his knife as clean as he like to leave it that wicked young man he kicked open the door and flung a parcel at him tell your dd missus he saysyour worship i hopes no offence to the statuestell her he says that her rubbish is there and add without no compliments that a lady of her birth should a known better than to insult another lady so well done kit sharp exclaimed overshute i rather admire him for that not that he ought to have sworn so of course but i like a young fellow to get in a rage when he thinks that his mother is trampled on then you might a been satisfied with him sir in a rage he were and no mistake so much so that our mr kale made off by the quickest door out of the premises but the cook she ran after him out to the steps when there was the corners between them and she begged him not to give a bad account but to put a christian turn to it and she told poor tummuss that she had a manner of doing veal fit to surprise him and if he could drop in on sunday week he might go home the wiser the lord knows how she hit so quick upon his bad propensities for he do pay attention to his victuals whatever his other feelings be however away he come at last and i doubt if he goeth in a hurry again of course he knowed better than give the broken handles of his message it is only the boys and the girls does that for the pleasure of vexing their betters master kale sent his parcel in by me together with mrs sharps compliments leaving the truth in the kitchen to strengthen and follow to the parlour as the cat comes in and so masters sister she put out her hand all covered with rings and no shaking and i makes my best entry just like this excusing your presence mr russel sir and she nod to me pleasantly and take it mary you may go she said and for sure i am not one of those who linger there happened however to be a new candle full of thieves and guttering and being opposite a lookingglass made it more reproachful so back i turned by the corner of a screen for to right it without disturbance i had no more idea bless you master cripps of cooriosity than might have happened to yourself sir but i pulled a pair of scissors out of my pocket no snuffers being handy and then i heerd a most sad groan to my heart it went like a clap of thunder having almost expected it which made it worse and back i ran to do my dooty if afforded rightly and sure enough there was poor mrs fermitage afell back well into the longbacked chair with her legs out straight and her hands to her forehead and a pair of grey stockings laid naked on her lap is it they things maam is it they i asked and she put up her chin to acknowledge it by the way they were lying upon her lap i was sure that she was vexed with them oh mary she cried out oh mary hookham i am both as foolish and a wicked woman if ever in the world there was one so deeply was i shocked by this masters own sister and a mint of money going the wrong way to kingdom comethat i give her both ends of the smellingbottle open and running on her velvet gown as innocent as possible oh you wicked wicked girl she says coming round before i could stop do you know what it cost a yard you minx this gave me good hopes of her being so natteral twice the price comes always into ladies minds when damage is if anybody can be made to pay but it did not become me to speak one word as you see mr russel and master cripps and there was my reward at once i must have a magistrate she cries a independent justice of the peace not my poor brothertoo much of him already where is that boy overshute she says saving of course your worships presence i heered he were gone to that low carriers mary run and fetch him my brother to be called a low carrier young esther exclaimed with her hand on her heart what carrier is to compare with him never you mind cheel answered cripps with a smile that shone like a warmingpan the womens may say what they pleases on me so long as i does my dooty by em squaze the lemon for his worship afore un goeth chapter xxiii quite another pair of socks mr overshute had always been on good terms with mrs fermitage his advanced ideas marching well with her political sentiments so far as she had any and upon a still more tender subject peace and goodwill throve between them the lady desired no better suitor for her niece than russel overshute and had laboured both by word and deed to afford him fair opportunity moreover it was one of her great delights when time went heavily with her to foster a quiet little fight between young russel and his mother those two though filled with the deepest affection and admiration for each other could scarcely sit half an hour together without a warm argument rising the late mr overshute had been for years a knight of the shire and for some few months a member of the tory government and this conferred on his widow of course authority paramount throughout the county upon every political question how great then was her indignation to find subversive and radically erroneous principles coming up where none but the best seed had been sown three generations ago there had been a very hasty overshute but he had been meted with his own measure and his balance struck upon the block this had a wholesome influence on the family while they remembered it and child after child had been brought up with the most correct opinions but here was the young head of the house with a stiff neck such as used to be adjusted in a nick upon towerhill mrs overshute therefore spent much of her time in lamenting and the rest in arguing for none of these things mrs fermitage cared with her the idea of change was free she had long rebelled against her brothers dictation of the constitution and believed they were rogues all the lot of them as her dear good husband used to say portwine fermitage went too far when he laid down this law for the females without a particle of illmeaning he did a great deal of mischief now mrs fermitage sat well up in a chair that had been newly stuffed she was very uncomfortable and it made her cross because she was a goodsized woman she kept on turning but all for the worse and her mind was uneasy at her brothers house the room was gone dark and the lights going down while miss mary hookham was revelling in the mansion of the carrier nobody cared to hurry for the sake of anybody else of course and mrs fermitage could not see what the good of all her money was the lady was all the more vexed with others because her own conscience was vexed with her and as overshute came with his quick firm step she spoke to him rather sharply well russel overshute there was a time when you would not have left me to sit in this sad way by myself all the evening but that was when i had pretty faces near me i must not expect such attentions now my dear mrs fermitage i had no idea that you were even in the house the good squire sent me a very nice dinner but you did not grace it with your presence and for a very good reason russel i have on my mind an anxiety which precludes all idea of eating oh mrs fermitage never say that you have been brought up too delicately russel i believe that is too true the world has conspired to spoil me i seem to be quite in a sad position entirely for the sake of others now look at me russel and just tell me what you think overshute always obeyed a lady in little things of this kind he looked at mrs fermitage which really was a pleasant thing to do and he thought to himself that he never had seen a lady of her time of life more comfortable nicely fat and thoroughly well dressed and fed my opinion is he proceeded with a very pretty salaam and smile that you never looked better in your life maam and that is a very great deal to say well russel well she answered rising in good old fashion and curtsying your opinions have not spoiled your manners whatever your dear mother may say you always were a very upright boy and you always say exactly what you think this makes your opinion so valuable i shall shake off ten years of my life but i really was quite lowspirited and down at heart when you came in i fear that i have not quite acted for the best entirely as i meant to do so you remember that horrible state of things nearly two months ago and my great distress at the time of that wretched inquest yes you were timid as well you might be it was not only that but the weather was so cold that i scarcely knew what i was doing at all hard weather is to me as it is to a plant a delicate fern or something my circulation no longer is correct even if it goes on at all i scarcely can answer for what i am doing when they put me into cold rooms and bitter draughts i feel that the organs of my face are red and that every one is looking at me and then such a tingle begins to dawn through the whole of my constitution that to judge me by ordinary rules is barbarous and iniquitous to be sure to be sure answered overshute laying one finger on his expressive nose and wondering what was next to come yes and that is the manner in which justice is now administered the canal was frozen and the people of the inn grudged a quarter of a hundredweight of coal the people at the yards had put it up so that it would have been wrong to encourage them i had ordered my own stumps to be burned up and the flowerbaskets and so on anything rather than order coals till the swindling dealers came down again and the coroner sided with the price of coals because he had three topcoats on the jury however with their teeth all chattering wanted only to be done and go they were only too glad when any witness failed to answer when called upon and having all made up their minds outside they were shivering to declare them i speak now from what i heard afterwards you speak the bare truth mrs fermitage you have the best authority the foreman is your chimneysweep yes and that made him feel the cold the more but you should see him on a sunday russel he is so respectable and his nails so white i will not listen to a word against him and he valued my custom on his oath he did what verdict does missus desire he asked and he made all the rest go accordingly nobody knows what they might have sworn without a clever man to guide them of course what can you expect but still you have something new to tell me well russel new or old here it is and you must bear in mind how i felt and what everybody was saying in the first place then you must remember that there was a great deal said about a pair of my silk stockings now i shrank particularly from having an intimate matter of that sort made the subject of public gossip it was neither becoming nor ladylike to drag little questions of my wardrobe into the eye of the nation so already it was too much to know that a pair of such articles had been found bearing my initials most decidedly i refused and i am sure any lady would do the same to go into a hard cold witnessbox and under the eyes of some scores of males proclaim my complicity with such things if i had seen it my duty i would have endeavoured to conquer my feelings but of course i took it all for granted that everything was too clear already and my dear brother i thought of him and thought of every one except myself could i do more russel overshute indeed my dear madam i do not see how you would have come forward if necessary but you did not see any necessity much more than that there was much more than that there was my duty to my brother stronger than even to my niece he is getting elderly and for me to be printed as proving anything against his daughter would surely have been too much for him he looked to me so for consolation and some one to say kind words to him that to find me in evidence against him might have been his deathblow no consideration for myself or my own feelings had the weight of a roseleaf with me in the breach i would have stood if i had followed my own wishes but my duty was to curb myself you are following me russel carefully word for word as you say it madam so far as my poor wits allow very well then i have made it quite clear that is the beauty of having to explain to clever people i thank you for the compliment replied overshute with a puzzled look but i have not earned it for i cannot see that you have told me anything that i did not know some weeks ago it may be my stupidity of course but i thought that something had occurred quite lately oh yes to be sure it was only today i meant to have told you that first of all i was grossly insulted but i am so forgiving that i had forgotten itquite forgotten it until you happened to speak of it a peculiarly insolent proceeding on the part of poor mrs sharp it appearsor perhaps some one for her for everybody says that she really now has no mind of her own she did not write me one single line although i had written politely to her and she sent me a messagei am sure of ittoo bad to be repeated no one would tell me what it was which aggravates it to the last degree i assure you i have not been so upset for years or at any rate not since poor grace was lost and about that unless i am much mistaken that very low selfish and plotting person knows a great deal more than we have ever dreamed it would not surprise me in the least especially after what happened today to find mrs sharp at the bottom of all of it at any rate she has aroused my suspicion by her contemptible insolence and i am not a person to drop a thing why what has she done asked overshute once more while in spite of impatience he could scarcely help smiling at poor mrs fermitages petty wrath and frequent selfcontradiction what she did was this she sent me back not even packed in nice white paper not even sprinkled with eau de cologne not even washedwhat do you think of thatbut rolled up anyhow in brown paper the same as a drayman would use for his tapsoh russel would you ever believe it certainly it seems very unpolite but what was it she sent back to you not even the article i expected not even that ingredient of costume which i had lent poor gracie very nice and pretty onesbut an old grey pair of silkenhose disgraceful even to look at it is true that they bear my initials but i had discarded them long ago what a strange thing cried overshute flushed with quick excitement how reckless we were at the inquest we had made up our minds without evidence on the mere faith of coincidence and youyou have never taken the trouble to look into this point until nowand now perhaps quite by accident we were told that you had recognised the stockings and it turns out that you never even saw them it is strange and almost wicked negligence i have told you my motives i can say no more exclaimed mrs fermitage with her fine fresh colour heightened by shame or anger of course i felt surewho could fail to do sothat the stockings found with my name on them must be the pair i had lent my niece it seemed most absurd that i should have to see them it was more than my nerves could bear and the coroner was not so unmanly as to force me pray did you go and see everything sir mrs fermitage i am the very last person who has any right to reproach you i failed in my duty far more than you in yours in a man of course it was a thousand times worse there is no excuse for me i yielded to a poor unmanly weakness i wished to keep my memory of the poor dear as i had seen her last i should have considered that the poor frail body is not our true identity quite so of course and therefore what was the use of your going to see it no no you behaved very well russel overshute and so did i if it comes to that nobody can be quite blameless of course and we are told in the bible not to hope for it if we all do our duty according to our inner lights and so on the apostle can say no great harm of us in his rudest moment to the ladies let us settle that we both have done our best said russel very sadly knowing how far from the truth it was but seeing the folly of arguing and now will you tell me what made you send for those silk ingredients of costume so suddenly and then show them to me with pleasure dear russel you understand me when no one else has any sympathy i sent for them or at least for what i fully expected to be the ones because an impertinent young woman foolishly trusted with very good keys gave me notice to go last evening of course she will fly before i have a chance of finding how much she has stolenthey all take very good care to do that and knowing what the spirit of the age isdress dress fallals ribbons heels in the air and so oni made up my mind to have a turn out today and see how much they had left me no man can imagine and scarcely any woman all the vexations i had to go through five pair and a half of silkhose were missing as well as a thousand more important things and they all backed up one another they stood me out to my face that i never had more than eight pair of the christchurchtom stockingsexcuse me for being so coarse my dear whereas i had got the receipt for twelve pair from the man that sold them with the big tom bells on immediately above the instep i happened to remember that i had lent my darling gracie pair no numbered as all of them were downright and so to confound those falsetongued hussies i came over here in search of them finding that they were not herefor the lawyers of course steal everythingi was not going to be beaten so i sent as polite a letter as after her shameful rudeness any lady could write to mrs luke sharpa poor woman who expected every halfpenny of my dear husbands savings how far she deserves them you have seen today and sooner would i burn myself like a sooty widow with all my goods evaporating than ever leave sixpence for her to clutch after such behaviour russel you will remember this you are my executor my dear mrs fermitage i pray you in no way to be excited we have not heard all of the story and we know that servants who are of a faithful kind exaggerate slights to their masters it was one of the squires old servants who went your own would perhaps have known better but now may i see the things mrs sharp sent you you may and you may take them if you like or rather i should say that i beg you to take them they ought to be in your custody will you oblige me by taking them russel and carefully inspecting them for that of course you must have daylight take them in the paper just as they came and keep them until i ask for them they can be of no importance because they are not what i lent to gracie except for my name on them i am sure that i never could have remembered them they were darned in the days when i was poor how often i wish that i still were poor then nobody wanted to plot against me and even to steal my stockings oh russel do you think they have murdered my darling because she was to have my money no i think nothing of the kind i believe that our darling grace is alive and i believe it tenfold since i saw these things i am not very old in the ways of the world and my judgment has always been wrong throughout but my faith is the same as the grand old squires though forty years of life behind him i firmly believe that blindly as we ourselves have managed everything all will be guided aright for us and happiness even in this world come because though we have done no great good we have done harm to no one and the lord in heaven knows it also he knows that we trust in him so far as the trouble allows us very well i will take these stockings home you shall hear from me on monday i believe that our grace is alive and god will enable me to deliver her please him i will never leave off till then the young man looked so grand and strong in his faith and truth and righteousness that the elderly lady said no word but let her eyes flow and kissed him he placed the stockings in an inner pocket carelessly wrapped in their paper and he rode home apace to please his mother and having a cold on him from all his wettings he perspired freely and at every stretch of his galloping horse he was absorbing typhus fever chapter xxiv suo sibi baculo in april when the sunny buds were showing forth their little frills and birds that love to hop sideways and try the toleration of the sprays that they are picking at were almost too busy to chirp and hung as happily as possible upside down shaking the flutter of young green lace while at the same time for it is a season of great coincidence pigs reared aloft little corkscrew tails and scorning their noserings employed them as thimbles for making a punch in the broidery of turf also whenif the above is not enoughducks and geese and cocks and hens and even the dogs who regard green grass as an emetic mainly were all without knowing it beginning to wag themselves as they walked or waddled and to shine in the sun and to look very large in their own eyes and those of their consorts neither was there any man who could ride a horse without knowing howunless he first had starved himat this young jump of the year and of life grace oglander wanted to go for a walk she had not by any means been buried in the haunted quarry neither had she as yet required burial in any place on the contrary here she walked more blooming and lovely than even her custom was and the spring sun glistening upon the gold letters of her tombstone at beckley ordered by her good aunt fermitagethe same sun without any strain of his eyes at all likely to turn him to a strabo was pleasantly making and taking light in the fluctuations of her growing hair her bright hair which had been so cruelly cropped instead of being the worse for the process was waving and glowing again in vast multiplicity of vigour like a specimen golden geranium shorn to double the number of its facets and the blue in the spring of her eyes was enough to dissatisfy the sun with his own sky however he showed no discontent but filled the young wood with cheerful rays and the open glades with merriment and even the sombre heart of labouring man with streaks of liveliness for here were comforts that come in without the eye considering them and pleasures which when thought of fly and delicate delights that have no idea of being delightful hereupon the proper thing is for something very harsh to break in and discomfit all the wandering vision of earthly happiness but the proper thing in the present instance showed its propriety by absence nothing broke the flow of sunshine and the eddy of soft shade unless it were a little ruffle of the south wind seeking leaves before they were quite ready or the rustle of a rabbit anxious about his family or the flutter of a bird uncertain where to stand and sing his best grace without a thought of what her own thoughts were or whether she had any mind for thinking rambled on as a schoolgirl does when the hours of school are over every single fall or rise of natures work was kind to her and led her into various veins of inductive unphilosophy the packing and storing of last years leaves as if exceeding precious gathered together by the wind and land in some rich rustling corner the fitting of these into one another for fear of losing one of them wonderfully compact as if with the hammer of a goldbeater or the unknown implement wherewith a hen packs up her hatched eggshells the stiff upstanding of fine young stuff hazel ash and so on tapering straight as a fishingrod and knobbing out on either side with scarcely controllable bulges over and above and throughout all and sensible of their largeness the spreading quietude of great trees just breathing their buds on the air again but not in a hurry as in young days to rush into perils of leafinesspleased with all these proofs of soft revival and tender movement the fair maid almost forgot her own depression and perplexities when howling winter was put to the rout and banished underground and the weather perhaps might be hoped to behave as decently as an english spring most skittish of seasons should order it and the blue ray of growth which predominates then according to the spectroscopists was pouring encouragement on things green how was a girl in her own spring yet to strive against all such influence at any rate grace made no attempt to do anything of the kind but wandered at her own sweet will within the limits of her own parole she knew that she was in seclusion here by her fathers command for her own good and much as she yearned from time to time to be at home with all the many things she was so fond of she was such a dutiful child and so loving that she put her own wishes by and smiled and sighed instead of pouting it could not be very long now she was sure until her father should come home and call for her as he had promised and take her once more to beloved beckley after this mournful exile full as she was of all these thoughts and heeding her own ways but little so long as she kept within the outer ring of fence allowed to her she fell into a little stupid fright as she called it afterwards for which there was no one but herself to blame only yesterday that good miss patch her governess and sweet guardian had particularly begged her to be careful because the times were now so bad that lawless people went everywhere miss patch herself had heard several noises she could not at all account for and while she considered it quite a duty to trace up everything to its proper source and absolutely confide in providence whose instrumentality is to be traced by all the poor instruments seeking it still there are times when it cannot be done and then the right thing is to keep within sight or call of a highly respectable man this was exactly what grace might have done and would have done but for the tempting day for a truly respectable man had been near her when first she began her little walk a man whom she had beheld more than once but always at a little distance a tall stout man according to her distant ideas of him always busy in a quiet way and almost grudging the time to touch his broadflapped hat without lifting his head when he saw her in the woodland grace had never asked him who he was nor been within talking distance of him at which she was almost surprised when she thought how glad as a rule are all oxfordshire workmen to have a good excuse for leaving off however she was far beyond him now when she met another man who frightened her this was a fellow of dark complexion dressed in a dirty fustian suit and bearing on his shoulder a thick hedgestake from which hung a number of rabbitskins his character might be excellent but his appearance did not recommend him to the confidence of the public grace shrank aside but his quick eyes had spied her and indeed she almost feared from his manner that he had been on the watch for her so she put the best face on it and tried to pass him without showing any misgivings but the rabbitman was not to be thus defrauded of his right to good society with a quick sharp turn he cast off the skins from his staff and stretched that slimy implement across the way with one hand while he held forth the other caressingly and performed a pretty little caper allow me to pass if you please said grace attempting to look very resolute these are our grounds you are trespassing now my purty young lady said the rabbitman coming so close that she could not fly you wouldnt be too hard would you now i sees a great many young maids aboutbut lor there what be they to compare with you i am sure that you do not mean any harm replied grace though with much inward doubt nobody ever does any harm to me but every one is so kind to me my father is so good to all who get into any trouble i am not worth robbing mr rabbitman honest as you are no doubt but i think that i can find a shilling for you to take home to your family now missy sweet missy when once i seen you how could i think of a shillingor two you was coming out herefor to kiss me i know the same as i dreamed about last night lor bless them bootiful eyes and lips the most massionary man as ever was amost would sooner have a kiss than a crown of em you insolent fellow how dare you speak to me in this manner do you know who i am do you know who my father is no missy but i dessay a thunderin beak as have sent me to prison and now i have got you in prison too no comin out wiout paying of your fine my dear the dirty scamp with an appreciative grin laid hold of poor graces trembling hand and drew her towards him while she tried vainly to shriek for her voice had forsaken herwhen bodily down went the rabbitman felled by a most inconsiderate blow he dropped so suddenly that he fetched poor grace to her knees by his violent grasp of her and when he let go she could not get up for a moment because her head went round then two strong hands were put into hers and she rose and faced a young gentleman in her confusion and sense of vile indignity she did the natural thing she staggered away to a tree and spread both hands before her eyes and burst forth sobbing as if her heart would break instead of approaching to comfort her the young man applied himself first to revenge he espied on the path the stick of the prostrate rabbitman and laid hold of it then striving to keep his conscience clear and by no means hit a man on the ground he seized the poor dealer in fur by the neck and propped him well up in a sapling fork having him thus well situated for penal operations without any question of jurisdiction or even of the merits of the case he proceeded to exhaust the utility of the stick by breaking it over its owners back the calm wood echoed with the sound of wooden thumps and the young buds trembled at the activity of a stick lor a mussy a mussy cried the rabbitman you be gooin outside of the bargain sir oh dontoh please dont grace exclaimed running forth from her retirement i dare say he did not know any better he may have had a little too much beer poor fellow he has had quite enough oh stop do stop for my sake for nothing elsein the worldwould i stop said the youth who was breathless with hitting so hard and still looking yearningly at the stick now splintered by so much exercise but if you beg him off he gets off of coursethough he has not had half enough of it you vile black rascal will you ever look at a young lady in your life again oh no sooh no sirso help me cried the rabbitman rubbing himself all over do ee let me whisper a word to you if i see your filthy sneaking face two seconds more ill take a new stick to you and a much tougher one out of my sight with your carrion black george with amazement and fury gazed at the stern and threatening countenance then seeing the elbow beginning to lift he hobbled as fast as his bruises allowed to his bundle of skins in the brushwood then with a whimper and snivel he passed the broken staff now thrown at him through his savoury burden and with exaggerated limps departed see if i dont show this to your governor he muttered as he turned back and scowled when out of sight and hearing i never were took in so over a job in all my life afore were i one bull for a hiding like that he grumbled as he pulled out a sovereign and looked at it five bull would hardly cover it why the young cove cant a been told nort about it a scurvy jokea very scurvy joke i aint got a bone in me as dont ache leaving him thus to pursue his departure young christopher sharp with great selfcontent at the good luck of this exploit turned towards grace who was trembling and blushing and he trembled and blushed in his turn at her i am so sorry i have frightened you he said in the most submissive way i have done you more harm than good i fear i should have known better but for the moment i really could not command myself i hope you will not despise me for it despise you can i ever thank you but i am not fit to do anything now i think i had better go home if you please i am not likely to be annoyed again and there is a good man in a field halfway to be sure you know best the young man answered cooling into disappointment still i may follow at a distance maynt i the weather looks quite as if it would be dark and at this time of year scarcely anybody knows there seem to be tramps almost everywhere but i am sure i do not wish to press myself i can go on with the business that brought me here i am searching for the true old windflower oh are you said grace how exceedingly lucky i can show you exactly where to find it if only you could manage to come tomorrow tomorrow let me seetomorrow yes i believe i have no engagements but will you not be afraidi meanafter that blackguards behaviour today not of course that he should be thought of twicebut stilloh i never can express myself i understand every word you would say the young lady answered decisively and i never mean to wander so far again still when i know that you are botanising or rather i mean when a gentleman is nearbut i also can never express myself you never must comeoh i meangoodbye but i feel that you ought to be careful because that bad man may lie in wait for you chapter xxv miss patch that evening grace made one more trial to procure a little comfort in her own affairs in the dark low parlour of the cottage where she had lived for the last three months with only miss patch and a deaf old woman for company and comfort she sat by the fire and stitched hard to abide her opportunity at the corner of the table sat the good miss patch with her spectacles on and occasionally nodding over her favourite author ezekiel it was impossible for anybody to look at miss patch and believe in anything against her high integrity that lofty nose and hardset mouth and the fine abstracted yet benevolent gaze of those hollow grey eyes were enough to show that here was a lady of strict moral principle and high sense of duty incorruptible and grandly honest but prickly as a hedgehog with prejudice she could not be driven into any evil course and required no leading into what she thought the right one and the right course to her was always the simplest of all things to discover because it was that which led most directly to the glory of god at the expense of man anything that would smite down pride and overthrow earthly schemes and abase the creature before the creatorthat to her mind was the thing commanded and if it combined therewith a cut at papal arrogance and priestly influence then the command was as delightful as it was imperative this tall and very clearminded lady was by an in and out sort of way related to squire oglander she called him her brother and the squire once to comfort her in a vile toothache had gone so far as to call her his sister still that to his mind was a piece of flattery not to be remembered when the tooth was stoppedfrom no pride on his part but because of his everabiding execration of her fatherthe wellknown captain patch captain patch was the man who married the last squire oglanders second wife that is to say our good squires stepmother after the lady had despatched her first husband by uneasy stages to a better world captain patch took her for her lifeinterest under the oglander settlement and sterling friends of his declared him much too cheap at the money but the oglanders took quite the contrary view and hated his name while he drew their cash yet the captain proceeded to have a large family of whom this hannah patch was the eldest a godly father as a general rule has godless children and happily the converse of that rule holds true the children of a godless father scared by the misery they have seen being acquitted of the fifth commandment frequently go back to the first and so it befell with almost all of that impious fellows family nevertheless the squire believing in the commandment with promise as well as the denunciation at the end of the second kept himself clear of the patches so far as good manners and kindness permitted him miss patch knowing how good she was had keenly resented this prejudice after vainly endeavouring to beat it down also she feltnot illwillbut still a melancholy forgiveness and uneasiness about the present position of graces poor mother who had died in her sins without any apology to miss patch however put all these things as one may according to constitution this lady was very good in her way and desired to make all others good there was not one faulty point about her so far as she could discover it and her rule of conduct was to judge her own doings by a higher standard than was to be hoped for of any other person therefore of course for other persons she could judge what was right and godly infinitely better than they could oh aunty said grace by way of coaxing having found this of good service ere now aunty dont you wish it was teatime now all meals come in their proper season we should be grateful for them but not greedy oh but aunty you would not call it greedy to be hungry i should hope and you would be so hungry if you only knew ah but you wont get me to tell you though i have always been celebrated for making them and this time i have quite surpassed myself now how much will you offer me to tell you what it is grace you are frivolous miss patch answered yet with a slight inclination of her nose towards the brown kitchen where the woodfire burned if our food is wholesome and vouchsafed in proportion to our daily wants we should lift up our hearts and be thankful to let our minds dwell upon that which is a bodily question only tends to degrade them and leads us to confound the true endthe glory of our makerwith the means to that end which are vulgarly called victuals very well aunty we will do with bread and butter i only made my sally lunns for you and if they degrade your mind i will give them to margery daw or the cottage with ten children down at the bottom of the wood what a treat they will have to be sure with them not so my dear if you made them for me i should fail in my duty if i refused them we are ordered to be kind and courteous and longsuffering towards one another and i know that you make them particularly well they are quite unfit for people in that lower sphere of life it would be quite sinful to tempt them so they would puff them up with vanity and worldliness and pride but if you insist upon my tasting them my dear in justice to your work i think that you should see to the toasting poor mrs daw smokes everything of course she does but i never meant to let her do them aunty only i wanted to be quite sure first that you would oblige me by tasting them my dear i will do so as soon as you please the good lady shut up ezekiel and waited in a few minutes back came grace with all things done to a nicety each against each contending hotly whether the first human duty were to drink choice tea or to eat sally lunns miss patch always saw her course marked out by special guidance and devoutly thus was enabled to act simultaneously grace took a little bit now and again to criticise her own handiwork while with her bright eyes she watched the relaxing of the rigid countenance my dear said miss patch they are excellent and they do the greatest credit to your gifts to let any talent lie idle is sinful you might make a few every day my dear to be sure i will aunty with the greatest pleasure i do love to do anything that reminds me of my dear father oh aunty will you tell me something yes grace anything you ask aright young girls of course must submit to those whose duty it is to guide them undue curiosity must be checked as leading to perverse naughtiness the principle or want of principle inculcated now by bad education can lead to nothing else but ruin and disgrace how different all was when i was young my gallant and spirited father well known as a brave defender of his country would never have dreamed of allowing us to be inquisitive as to his whereabouts but all things are subverted now filial duty is a thing unknown oh but aunty of course we never pretend to be half as good as you were still i dont think that you can conclude that i do not love my dear father because i am not one bit afraid of him dont cry child it is foolish and weak and rebellious against divine wisdom all things are ordered for our good then crying must be ordered for our good or we should be able to help it maam but you cant call it crying when i do just what i do it is such a long and lonely time and i never have been away more than a week at a time from my darling father until now and now it is fifteen weeks and five days since i saw him oh it is dreadful to think of very well my dear it may be fifty weeks or fifty years if the lord so wills selfcommand is one of the very first lessons that all human beings must learn yes i know all that and i do command myself to the very utmost you know that you praised mequite praised meyesterday which is a rare thing for you to do what did you say then please not to retract and spoil the whole beauty of your good word no my dear child you need not be afraid whenever you deserve praise you shall have it you saw an old sack with the name of beckley on it and although you were silly enough to set to and kiss it as if it were your father you positively did not shed one tear for which i deserve a gold medal at least i should like to have it for my counterpane but you sent it away most ruthlessly now i want to know aunty how it came to be heremiles leagues longitudes away from darling beckley miss patch looked a little stern again at this she perceived that her duty was to tell some stories in a case of this kind wherein the end justified the means so paramountly still every new story which she had to tell seemed to make her more cross than the one before whether from accumulated adverse score or from the increased chances of detection sacks arrive and sacks depart she answered as if laying down a dogma according to the decrees of providence ever since the time of joseph sacks have had their special mission our limited intelligence cannot follow the mundane pilgrimage of sacks no aunty of course they get stolen so but this particular sack i saw had on it the name of a good honest man one of the very best men in beckley zacchary cripps the carrier his name did bring things to my mind soall the parcels and good nice things that he carries as if they were made of glass and the way my father looks over the hedge to watch for his cart at the turn of the lane and his pretty sister etty sitting up as if she didnt want to be looked at and old dobbin splashing along plod plod and our mary setting her cap at him vainly and the way he goes rubbing his boots as if he would have every one of the nails out and then dearest father calling out have you brought us her majestys new crown cripps and cripps putting up his hand like that and grinning as if it was a grand idea and then slyly peeping round where the beerjug hangsoh aunty shall i ever see it all again well grace you will lose very little if you dont it is one of my brothers worst failings that he gives away fermented liquor to the lower orders inconsiderately it encourages them in the bad habits to which they are only too prone even when discouraged oh no aunty cripps is the soberest of men and he does take his beer with such a relish it is quite a treat to see him oh if i could only see his old cart now jogging along like a man with one prong grace miss oglander your metaphor is of an excessively vulgar description is it aunty then i am very sorry i am sure i didnt mean any harm at all only i was thinking of the way a certain onelegged fiddler walksbut aunty all this is so frivolous with all the solemn duties around us aunty yes my dear i do wish you would think a little more of them every day i do my best your nature is not more corrupt than must be with all who have the sad phronema sarkos but unhappily you always exhibit both in word and action something soi will not use at all a harsh word for itsomething so sadly unsolemn what can i do aunt it really is not my fault i try for five minutes together to be solemn and then there comes something or otherhow can i tell howthat proves too much for me my father used to love to see me laugh he said it was quite the proper thing to do and he was so funny when he had no trouble that without putting anything into anybodys head he set them all off laughing aunty you would have been amused to hear him quite in the quiet time almost in the evening i have known my father make such beautiful jokes without thinking of them that i often longed for the old horn lanthorn to see all the people laughing even you would laugh dear aunty if you only heard him the laughter of fools is the crackling of thorns grace you are nothing but a very green goose even a stray lamb would afford me better hopes but knock at the wall with the poker my dear that margery daw may come in to prayers chapter xxvi ruts there are few things more interesting than ruts regarded at the proper time and in the proper manner the artists who show us so many things unheeded by our duller selves have dwelled on this subject minutely and shown their appreciation of a few good ruts but they are a little inclined sometimes to mark them too distinctly scarcely making due allowance for the vast diversity of wheels as well as their many caprices of wagging according to the state of their washers the tug of the horse and their own wearing and a host of other things each rut moreover has a voice of its own not only in its first formation but at every period of depression in the muggy weather or rough rebellion in a fine black frost and above all other times in the loose insurrection of a thaw there always is a bit of something hard and something soft in it jags that contradict all things with a jerk and deep subsidence soft as flattery there scarcely could be a finer sample of ruts than was afforded by a narrow lane or timbertrack at the extreme northwestern outskirt of stow forest everything here was favourable to the very finest growth of ruts the road had once been made which is a necessary foundation for any masterpiece of rutwork it then had been left to maintain itself which encourages wholesome development another great advantage was that the hard uniformity of straight lines had no chance here of prevailing for though the course was not so crooked as in some lanes it may have been neither was there hedge or rail or other mean constriction yet some fine old trees insisted now and then from either side upon their own grand right of way and stretched great arms that would sweep any driver or horseman backward from his seat unless he steered so as to double them now therefore to one of these corners came from out the thicket of underwood a stout man with a crafty slouch and a wary and suspicious glance he had thrown a sack over his long white smock whether to save it from brambles or to cover its glare in the shady wood for his general aspect was that of a man who likes to see all things but not to be seen and now as he stooped to examine the ruts at a point where they clearly defined themselves either from habit or for special reason he kept as far back by the briary ditch as he could without loss of near insight this man being a member of the great cripps racewhether worthy or not of that staunch lineal excellencehad an hereditary perception of the right way to examine a rut it would have been easy enough perhaps in a lane of little traffic to judge whether anything lately had passed with the weather and ground as usual but todaythe day after what has been told ofboth weather and ground had just taken a turn as abrupt as if both were feminine the smile of soft spring was changed into a frown and the glad young buoyancy of the earth into a stiff sort of feeling not frozen or crisp but as happens to a man when a shiver of ague vibrates through a genial perspiration to put it more clearly the wind had chopped round to the east and was blowing keenlya masterful strongly pronounced and busily energetic east wind as superior to hypocrisy as it was to all claims of mercy at the sound and the feel of its vehement sweep surprise and alarm ran through the wood and the nestlingplaces of the sun ruffled up like a hen that calls her chicks to her the foremost of the buds of the tall trees shook not as they shake to a west wind but with a sense of standing naked the twigs that carried them flattened upwards having lost all pleasure the branches instead of bowing kindly as they do to any other wind also went upward with a stiff cold back and a hatred at being treated so many and many a little leaf still snug in its own overcoat shrunk back and preferred to defer all the joys of the sky if this were a sample of them and many and many a big leaf thrust without any voice of its own on the world had no chance of sighing yet but whistled on the wind and felt it piping through its fluted heart and knowing what a livercoloured selvage must come round its green bewailed the hour that coaxed it forth from the notched and tattered and castoff frizzle dancing by this time the wind knows where because the east wind does what no other wind of the welkin ever does it does not come from the good sky downward bringing higher breath to us nor even on the level of the ancient things spreading average movement this alone of all winds strikes from the face of the good earth upward sweeping the blush from the skin of the land and wrinkling all who live thereon that is the time when the very best man finds little to rejoice in unless it be a fire of seasoned logs or his own contrariety the fur of all animals being their temper moves away and crawls on them and even bland dogs and sweet horses feel each several hair at issue with their wellbrushed conscience all of that may be true and yet there may be so many exceptions at any rate master leviticus cripps looked none the worse for the whole of it his cheeks were of richly varied fibre like a newshelled kidneybean his mouth of a very considerable size looked comfortable and not hungry and all around him there was an influence tending to intimate that he had dined for that he did not care as he should he was not a man who allowed his dinner to modify his character the best streaky bacon and three newlaid eggs had nurtured and manured his outer man but failed to improve him inwardly even the expression of his face was very slightly mollified by a firstrate meal though some of the corners looked lubricated hath a been by again or hath a not whispered tickuss to himself as he stared at a tangled web of ruts and blessed the east wind for confounding of them so that a wheel could not swear to its own the east wind answered with a scolding dash that cast his sack over his head and shook out his white smock scattering over the view like a jacktowel on the washingline acknowledging this salutation with a curse leviticus gathered his sack more tightly and bending one long leg before him stealthily peered awry at the wheeltracks this was the way to discover whatever had happened last among them instead of looking across or along them where the nicer shades would fail at first he could make but little of it the east wind whirling last years leaves from the couches where the west had piled them and parching the flakes of the mud as if exposed upon a scraper had made it a hard thing to settle the date of the transit even of a timber dray one of these had passed not long ago with a great trunk swinging and swagging on the road and slurring the scollops of the horsetrack therefore tickuss for some time looked less wise than usual and scratched his head the brain replied as it generally does to this soft local stimulant so briskly in fact that the master soon was able to clap both his hands into their natural homethe pockets of his breechesand thus to survey the scene and grin did ee think to do me then old brother zak now did ee did ee did ee ah i were aborn afore you zak or if i were not it were mothers mistake go along wi ee zak go along wi ee go home to thy cat and thy little kitten etty he knew by the track that his brother had passed a good while ago or he would not have dared to speak in this rebellious vein and what he said next was even more disloyal danged if i aint a gude mind to hornstring that old hosebird of a dobbin ay and i wull too if zak cometh prowling round my place like this if a didnt mane no trachery why dothnt a come in and call for a horn of ale and a bite of cold bakkon ho ho weve a pretty well stopped him of that though no master zak now go thine own ways keep thyzell to thyzells the law of the land to my thinking now a year or even six months ago leviticus cripps would sooner have lost a score of pigs than make such a speech inhospitable unnatural unbrotherly and violently uncrippsian nothing but his own bad conscience as he fell more and more away from honour and due esteem for beckley could have suggested to him such a low and crooked view of zacchary the carrier was not in any measure spying or prowling or even watching such courses were out of his track altogether rather would he have come with a fist if the family honour demanded it and therewith have converted his brothers olfactory organ into something loftier as the medium of a sense of honesty in bare point of fact the family honour demanded this vindication but the need had not as yet been conveyed to the knowledge of the executive power zacchary had no suspicion at present of his brothers fearful lapse and the only thing that brought him down that lane was another stroke of business in the washing line squire corser had married a new sort of wife with a tendency towards the nobility wherefore a monthly wash was out of keeping with her loftier views though she had a fine kitchengarden and she cried till the squire put the whole of it out and sent it every week to beckley hence a new duty for dobbin arose which he faced with his usual patience simply reserving his right to travel at the pace he considered expedient and to have a stronger and deeper bottom stitched to his old nosebag the first time the carrier traversed that road fraternal duty impelled him to make all proper inquiries concerning the health of his brother and the character of his tap but though the reply upon both these points was favourable and pleasing zacchary met with so queer a reception that dignity and selfrespect compelled him to vow that for many a journey he would pass with a dry mouth rather than turn in of all the nephews and nieces who loved to make him their own carrier by sitting astride perhaps two on each leg and one on each oolitic vamp and shouting gee gee till he panted worse than dobbin obese with young saintfoinlikewise who always jumped up in his cart and laid hold of the reins and the whip even and wore out the patience of any other horse except the horse before themof all these delightful young pests not one was now permitted to come near him and not only that which alone was very strange but even susannah the wife of leviticus and sisterinlaw of zacchary evidently had upon her tongue laid a dumb weight of responsibility quite as if zak were an interloper or an inquisitive stranger thrusting a keen but unjustified nose into things that were better without it susannah was always a very good woman and used to look up to zacchary because her father was a basketmaker and even now she said no harm but still there was something about her when she muttered that she must go and wash the potatoes timid and cold and unheartylike the carrier made up his mind that they all were in trouble about their mortgage again just as they were about six months back when the land was likely to be lost to them and finding it not a desirable thing to be called upon to contribute he jogged well away from all such tactics with his pockets buttoned not that he would have grudged any good turn to any one of his family but that his strong common sense allowed him no faith in a liar and for many years he had known that tickuss was the liar of the family leviticus took quite a different view of the whole of this proceeding he was under no terror about his mortgage for reasons as yet quite private and his thick shallow cunning like an underground gutter was full of its own rats only he was certain that zak had suspected him in spite of the care he had taken to keep his wife and children away from him and believing this he was certain also that zak was playing the spy on him while he was meditating thus in his slow and turbid mind and turning away from the corner of the road towards his beloved piglairs the rattle of the sharp east wind was laden with a softer and heavier soundthe hoofs of a horse upon sod and mud tickuss with two or three long strides got behind a crooked tree so as to hide or exhibit himself according to what should come to pass what came to pass was a horse in the first place of good family and good feed and on his back a man who shared in at least the latter excellence these two were not coming by the forest lane but along a quiet narrow track which cut off many of its corners to judge of the two which looked the more honest would have required another horse in council with another man at sight of this arrival tickuss came forth and scraped humbly dont stand there like a monkey at a fair cried mr sharpfor he it was and no mistake about him am i to come through the brambles to you cant you come up like a man with his wits where this beastly wind doesnt blow so hard who can hear chawbacon talk off there leviticus cripps made a vast lot of gestures commending the value of caution and pointing to the lane half a hundred yards off as if it contained a whole band of brigands mr sharp was not a patient man and he knew that there was no danger therefore he swore pretty freely until the abject lord of swine restored him to a pleasant humour by a pitiful tale of black georges trouble on the previous afternoon catching it ay and no mistake tickuss cripps repeated the dust from his jacketoh lor oh lor i had followed on softly to see the fun without missy knowing i were near of course and may i neverif i didnt think a would amost have killed un ho ho itll be a good round week i reckon afore jarge stitcheth up a ferrets mouth again he took me in terrible that very morning he were worse took in hiszell afore the arternoon was out praise the lard for all his goodness sir well well it shall be made up to him but of course you did not let him or any one else get any idea who the lady is governor no man hath any sense of that leviticus answered with one finger on his nose save and excep the old lady to the cottage and you and i and you knows whether there be any other leviticus cripps no lies to me of course your own wife has got the whole thing out of you her replied tickuss with a high contempt for which he should have had his ears boxed no no master a would have been all over hoxford months ago if her had knowed ort of it her knoweth of course there be zumbody up to cottage with old lady but her hath zucked in the american story the same as everybody else have who would ever drame of our old squires daughter when the whole world hath killed and buried her but none the less for that i kep her and the children out of the way of our zak i did um might go talking on the volk up to cottage and zak would be for goin up with one of his cards parraventur lor how old zaks eyes would come out of his head the old batfowla would crack my zides to see un you had better keep your fat sides sound and quiet mr sharp answered sternly for the slow wits of tickuss being tickled by that rare thing an imagination the result was of course a guffaw whose breadth was exceeded only by its length oh lor oh lorto see the old batfowl with the eyes comin out of the head of un ill be danged if i shouldnt chokeoh lor mr sharp saw that tickuss being once set off might be trusted to go on for at least half an hour with minuteguns of cackling loutish selfglorifying cachinnation as amenable to reason as a hiccough is the lawyers time was too precious to waste thus so having learned all that he cared to learn and hearing wheels in the forest lane he turned back along the narrow covertride and he thought within himself for he never mused aloudmy bold stroke bids fair to be a great success nobody dreams that the girl is here she herself believes every word that she is told kit is over head and ears and she will be the same with him after that fine rescue our only marplot has been laid by the heels at the very nick of time we have only to manage kit himselfwho is a most confounded sort the luck is with me the luck is with me and none shall be the wiser only give me one month more chapter xxvii rats meanwhile at shotover grange as well as at poor old beckley barton trouble was prevailing and the usual style of things upset russel overshute though not beloved by everybody because of his strong will and words was at any rate thought much of and would be sadly missed by all all the women of the household made an idol of him he spoke so kindly and said thank you when many men would have grunted and he did not seem to be aware of any padlocked bar of humanity betwixt him and his inferiors at the same time he took no liberty any more than he invited it and his fine appearance and strength of readiness made him look the master the men on the other hand were not sure of their sorrow to see less of him he had always kept a keen eye upon them as the master of a large house ought to do and he always bore in mind the great truth that men on the whole are much lazier than women still even the worst man about the place while he freely took advantage of the present sweet immunity would have been sorry to hear of a thing which might drive him to seek for another place but what were all these even all put together in the weight of their feelings to compare with the mother of young overshute many might cry but none would mourn nobody could have any right to mourn except herself his mother this was her son and her only hope if it pleased the lord to rob her of him he might as well take her soon afterwards without any more to do this middleaged lady was not pious and made no pretence to be so her opinion was that the lord awarded things according to what people do and left them at liberty to carry on without any great interference she knew that she always had been superfluously able to manage her own affairs and to hear weak ladies going on and on about the will of the lord and so forth sometimes was a trial to her manners and hospitality in this terrible illness of her son she had plenty of selfcommand but very little resignation with stern activity and selfdevotion she watched him by day and by night so jealously that the nurses took offence and fearing contagion kept their distance though they drew their wages this was the time to show what stuff both men and women were made of fairweather visitors and delightful gossips and the most devoted friends stood far aloof from the tainted gale and fumigated their letters the best of them sent their grooms to the lodge with orders to be very careful and to be sure to use tobacco during the moment of colloquy others had so much faith that everything would be ordered for the best that they went to the seaside at once to be delivered from presumption many saw a visitation for some secret sin that otherwise might have festered inwardly and destroyed the immortal part of course they would not even hint that he could have murdered grace oglander nothing was further from their thoughts the idea was much too terrible still there were many things that long had called for explanationand none had been afforded leaving these to go their way a few kind souls came fluttering to the house of pestilence and death two housemaids and the boy who cleaned the servants shoes had been struck down and never rose again except with very cautious liftings into their last narrow cells the disease had spread from their master and their constitutions were not like his also the senior footman and the undercook were in their beds but the people who had their work to do believed them to be only shamming the master however still fought on without any knowledge of the conflict his mind was beyond all the guidance of will and afar from its wonted subjects it roved among clouds that had long blown away nebules of logic dialectic fogs and thunderstorms of enthymeme the pelting of soritic hail and all the other perturbed condition of undergraduate weather in these things unlike his friend hardenow he had never taken delight and now they rose up to avenge themselves at other times the poor fellow lay in depths of deepest lethargy voiceless motionless and almost breathless none but his mother would believe sometimes that he was not downright dead and gone of course mrs overshute had called in the best advice to be had from the whole of the great profession of medicine the roughness of the abernethy school was still in vogue with country doctors as even now some of it may be found in a craft which ought to be gentle in proportion to its helplessness with timid people this roughness goes a long way towards creating faith and makes them try to get better for fear of being insulted about it in london however this centauric school of medicine had not thriven when the rude nessus could not heal himself a soft and soothing and genial race of aesculapians arose the vis medicatrix naturae was exalted and fed with calves feet and the hand of velvet and the tongue of silver commended and sweetened the pill of bread at the head of this pleasing and amiable band who seldom either killed or cured was the famous sir anthony thistledown this was the great physician who had been invoked from londonto the strong disgust of splinters then the foremost light at oxfordwhen squire oglander was seized with his very serious illness and now sir anthony did his best with the aid of the reconciled splinters to soothe away death from the weary couch of the last of the race of overshute a pretty story ive aheerd in oxford today make me shamed it doth said zacchary cripps to his sister etty while he smoked his contemplative pipe by the fire of stow logs one cold and windy april evening what do you think theyve abeen and doed who and where zak how can i tell esther was busy trimming three rashers before she put them into the fryingpan i really do believe you expect me to know everybody that comes to your thoughts quite as if it was my own mind well so you ought said the carrier the women nowadays are so sharp no man can have his own mind to his self but anyhow you ought to know that i mean up to poor worship overshutes ah a fine young gentleman as ever lived seemeth to be no more than last night as he sat in that there chair and said the queerest thing as ever were said by a justice of the county bench what do you mean zak i never heard him say anything but was kind and proper and a credit to him might be proper or might not but anyhow twere impossible did a tell me or did a not he would try to go apoaching when folk begins to talk like that tis a sign of the ill come over them ahs me tis little hell ever do of poaching or shutting or riding to hounds or tasting again of my best bottle bad enough job it be about old squire but he be an old man in a way of speaking well the lord he knoweth best and us be all in the hollow of his hand but he were a fine young fellow as fine a young fellow as ever i see and not a bit of pride about un sadly reflecting the carrier stopped his pipe with a twig from the fireplace and gazed at the soot because his eyes were bright but what were you going to tell me asked etty bringing her brother back to his subject as she often was obliged to do railly i be almost ashamed to tell ee for such a thing to come to pass in our own county and amost the same parish and only two turnpike gates atween what do ee think of every soul in that there house running right away wiout no notice nor so much as goodbye one and all on em one and all so i were told by a truthful man and the poor old leddy with her dying son and not a single blessed woman for to make the pap i never can believe that they would be such cowards esther answered as she left her work and came to look at zacchary men might but women never i should hope and such a kind good house it is oh zak it must be a wicked story it is true enough etty and too true as i was acoming home i seed five on em standing all together under the elms by magdalen college their friends would not take them in i was told and nobody wouldnt go nigh em perhaps they were sorry they had doed it then the wretches they ought to sleep out in the rain without even a pigsty for shelter now zak i never do anything without you but to shotover grange i go tonight unless you bar the door on me and if you do i will get out of window esther i never heerd tell of such a thing if you was under a duty well and good but to fly into the face of the lord like that without no call upon you there is a call upon me she answered flushing with calm resolution it is the lord that calls me zak and he will send me back again now you shall have your supper while you think it over quietly i will not go without your leave brother but i am sure you will give it when you come to think the carrier while he munched his bacon and drank his quart of homebrewed ale was in his quiet mind more troubled than he had ever been before or at any rate since he used to pass the tent of young cinnaminta that was the one great romance of his life and since he had quelled it with his sturdy strength and looked round the world as usual scarcely any trouble worse than pence and halfpence had been on him from week to week and year to year he had worked a cheerful road of life breathing the fine air looking at the sights feeling as little as need be felt the influence of nature making new friends all along his beat even quicker than the old ones went their way carrying on a very decent trade highly respecting the powers that be and highly respected by them but now he found suddenly brought before him a matter for consideration which in his ordinary state of mind would have circulated for a fortnight precipitance of mind to him was worse than driving down a quarry his practice had always been and now it was become his habit to turn every question inside out and upside down and across and across and finger every seam of it as if he were buying a secondhand sack ere ever he began to trust his weight to any side of it to do all this required some hours with a mind so unelectric and even after that he liked to have a good nights sleep and find the core of his resolve set hard in the morning for this due process there was now no time he dared not even to begin it knowing that it could not be wrought out therefore he betook himself to a plan which once before had served him well after groping in the bottom of a sacred pocket where samplebeans and scarlet runners got into the loops of keys and bits of whipcord were wound tightly round old turnpike tickets and a little shoemakers awl in a cork kept company with a shoepick master cripps with his bluntheaded fingers got hold of a crooked sixpence the bend alone would have only conferred a simple charm upon it but when to the bend there was added a hole that sixpence became delphic cripps had consulted it once before when a quicktempered farmer hurried him concerning the purchase of a rick of hay the carrier had no superstition but he greatly abounded with gratitude and having made a great hit about that rick the least he could do to the sixpence was to consult it again under similar hurry he said to himself now the lord send me right if you comes out heads little etty shall go if you comes out tails i shall take it for a sign that we ought to turn tails in this here job he said no more but with great extrication worked his oracular sixpence up through a rattle of obstructions like the lots cast in a steepheaded mans helmet up came the sixpence reluctantly i have a got ee now what dost thou say cried cripps with the triumph of an obstinate man never a lie hast thou told me yet spake up little fellow being thus adjured the crooked sixpence in gratitude for much friction gleamed softly in the firelight but even the carrier keen as his eyes were could not make out head or tail vetch me a canle and the lookingglass he called out to esther the lookingglass being a large old lens which had been left behind by hardenow esther brought both in about half a minute and cripps with the little coin sternly sitting as flatly in his palm as its form allowed began to examine it carefully with one eye shut as if firing a gun he tried the lens at every distance from a foot to half an inch shifting the candle about until some of his frizzly hair took fire and with this assistance he exclaimed at last heads childheads it is thou shalt go the will of the lord ordaineth it plaize the lord to send thee back safe and sound as now thou goest none on us to my knowledge has done aught to deserve to be punished for chapter xxviii boots on when a very active man is suddenly laid by the heels sad as the dispensation is there are sure to be some who rejoice in it even if it be only a zealous clerk sausagemaker or gravedigger thus upset in his activities there are one or two compeers who rejoice in the heart while they deeply lament with the lip not that they have the very smallest atom of illwill about them they are thoroughly goodhearted fellows as are nine men out of every ten and within as well as without they would grieve to hear that their valued friend was dead still for the moment and while we believe as everybody does about everybody else that he is sure as a top to come round again it is a relief to have this busy fellow just out of the way a bit and there is an inward hugging of the lazier spirit at the thought that the restless one will have received a lesson and be pulled back to a milder state be this view of the matter either true or false in a general way at least in this particular instance the illness of russel overshute some of it seemed to apply right well there was no one who wished him positive death not even of those whom he had most justly visited with the treadmill but there were several who were not sorry to hear of this check to his energies and foremost among them might be counted mr luke sharp and the great john smith mr john smith had surprised his friends and disappointed the entire public by finding out nothing at all about anything after his one great discovery made with the help of the british army for some cause or other best known to himself he had dropped his indefatigability and taken to very grave shakes of his head instead of nimble footings he feigned to be very busy still with this leading case of the neighbourhood but though his superiors might believe it his underlings were not to be misled all of these knew whether mr john was launching thunderbolts or throwing dust and were well aware that he had quite taken up with the latter process in the beckley case why or even exactly when this change had occurred they did not know only they were sure that the reason lay deep in the pocket of mr smith which conclusion as we shall see did no more honour to their heads than to their hearts but still whatever his feelings were or his desires in the matter the resolute face and active step of this intelligent officer were often to be seen and heard at beckley and to several persons in the village they were becoming welcome numbers cripps the butcher was moved with gentle goodwill towards him having heard what a fine knife and fork he played and finding it true in the squires bill also phil hiss of the dusty anvil found the fame of this gentleman telling on his average receipts and several old women who had some time back made up their accounts for a better world and were taking the interest in scandal hailed with delight this unexpected bonus and true premium to mention young spinsters would be immoral for none of them had any certainty whether there was or was not any mrs john smith rustic modesty forbade that the carrier should be asked to settle this great point directly still there were methods of letting him know how desirable any information was at all these symptoms of renown when brought to his knowledge mr smith only smiled and shook his head he had several good reasons of his own for haunting the village as he did one of them being that he thus obeyed the general orders he had received also he really liked the squire his victuals and his domestics among these latter he had quite outlived any little prejudice created by his early manner and even mary hookham was now inclined to use him as an irritant or stimulant for the lukewarm cripps but being a sharp and quick young woman mary took care not to go too far how is the fine old gentleman now mary my love how is he mr smith asked as he pulled off his cloak in the lobby just after churchtime and just before early dinnertime on the morrow of that saturday night when esther set off for shotover although it was spring she had not gone alone but had taken a son of the butcher with her the effect of that quarryscene on her nerves would last as long as she did mary was bound not to answer mr smith whenever he spoke in that festive way that much had been settled betwixt her and her mother remembering what a place beckley was but she did all her duty as a good maid should in the way of receiving a visitor she took his cloak from him and she hung it on a hookmost men wore a cloak just then for walking whether it were wet or dry and part of the coming tractarian movement was to cast away that cloakand then mary saw on the feathery collar a leafbud that threatened to become a moth according to her entomology this she picked out with a shoo and a shish as she trod it underfoot and mr john smith having terror of insects and being a very clean man recoiled just when he was thinking of stealing a kiss this little piece of business placed them on their proper terms again how is your master miss hookham i hope you find him getting better everything now is looking up again no mr smith he is very sadly thanking you sir for inquiring of him he do seem a little better one day and we all begins to hope and hope and then there come something all over him again the same as might be this here cloak sir thrown on the head of that there stick but come in and see him mr smith if you please i thought it was the rector when you rang but master will be glad to see you every bit the same as if you was no doubt john smith who was never to be put down by any small comparisons followed quick mary with a stedfast march over the quiet matting potters with their broken shards had not yet made it a trial to walk and a still greater trial to look downward on the road to dinner in the long oldfashioned diningroom sat the squire at the head of his table for many years it had been his wont to have an early dinner on sunday with a knife and fork always ready for the clergyman who was a bachelor of middle age the clergyman came or did not come according to his own convenience without ceremony or apology i beg you to excuse said the squire rising as smith was shown into the room my absence from church this morning mr warbelow i had quite made up my mind to go and everything was quite ready when i did not feel quite so well as usual and was ordered to stay at home squire oglander made his fine oldfashioned bow when he had spoken and held out his hand for the parson to take it as the parson always did with eyes that gave a look of grief and then fell and kind lips that murmured that all things were ordered for the best but instead of the parsons gentle clasp the squire whose sight was beginning to fail together with his other faculties was saluted with a strong rough grasp and a gaze from entirely unclerical eyes how is your worship well nicely i hope charming you look sir as ever i see sir i thank you i am in good health but i have not the honour of remembering your name smith your worshipjohn smith at your service as he was the day before yesterday out of sight out of mind the old saying is i suppose you find it so sir with this homethrust delivered quite unwittingly mr smith sat down his opinion was that her majestys service levelled all distinctions mr oglander gave him one glance like the keen look of his better days and then turned away and gazed round the room for something out of sight but never likely to be out of mind the old man was weak and knew his weakness in the presence of a gentleman he might have broken down and wept and been much better for it but before a man of this sort not a sign would he let out of the sorrow that was killing him it had been settled by all doctors when the squire was in his first illness that nothing should be said by smith or any one else without great cause about the trouble which was ever in the heart of all the house nothing at least to the squire himself for fear of exciting him fatally little rumours might be filtered through the servants towards him especially through mother hookham who put hopeful grains of paradise into the heavy beer of fact such things did the old man good his faith in the lord when beginning to flag was renewed by fibs of this good old woman and each confirmed the other in former days he would have resented and nipped in the budkindhearted as he wasjohn smiths familiarity but now he had no heart to care about any of such trifles he begged mr smith to take a chair quite as if he were waiting to be invited then weak as he was he tottered to the bellpull rather than ask his guest to ring john smith jumped up to help but felt uncertain what good manners were mary said the squire when mary came you always look out of the window i think to see the people come out of church never sir never except whenever i feels wicked not to a been there myself such time it seemeth to do me good like smelling of the good words over there yes that is very right all i want to know is whether mr warbelow is coming up here no sir not this time i believe he seemed to have got a young lady with un as wore a blue cloak with three slashes to the sleeve and a bonnet with yellow french roses in it and a striped skirt made of the very same stuff as i seed in to cavellsno not cavellstother shop over the way round the corner likewise her had then mary bring in the dinner if you please this gentleman will dine with me instead of mr warbelow well now if i ever did miss hookham exclaimed to herself in the passage why a must be a sort of a gentleman master wouldnt dine along of master cripps but to my mind zak be the gentleman afore he the squires oblique little sarcasmif sarcasm at all it werefailed to hit mr smith altogether he cordially accepted plate and spoon and fell to at the soup which was excellent the soup was followed by a fine sirloin whereupon mr oglander through some association of ideas could not suppress a little sigh never sigh at your meat sir cried mr smith give me the carvingknife sir if you are unequal to the situation to sigh at such a sirloinoh fie oh fie i was thinking of some one who always used to like the brown the old man said in the simplest manner as if an apology were needed well sir i like the brown very much i will put it by for myself sir and help you to an inner slice here mary a plate for your master quick everything will be cold my goodness and who sliced this horseradish pray for slicing it is not scraping mary was obliged to bite her tongue to keep it in any way mannersome when the door was thrown open and in came her mother with her face quite white and both hands stretched on high oh my oh my a sin i call ita wicked cruel sinful sin widow hookham exclaimed as soon as she could speak all over the village all over the parish in two days time at the latest it will be oh how could your worship allow of it give your mamma a glass of wine my dear said mr john smith as the widow fell back with violent menace of fainting or worse while the poor squire expecting some new blow folded his tremulous hands to receive it take a good drink maam and then relieve your system that cripps oh that cripps exclaimed mrs hookham as soon as the wine which first went the wrong way had taken the right direction if ever a darter of mine hath cripps in spite of two stockings of money they say what is it about cripps asked the squire in a voice that required an immediate answer the first news of his trouble had come through cripps and now in his helpless condition he always connected the name of the carrier with the solution if one there should be he hath done a thing he ought to be ashamed on screamed mrs hookham with such excitement that they were forced to give her another glass of wine he hath brought into this parish and the buzzum of his family pestilence and death he hath and who be he to do such a thing a roadfaring twopenny carrier cripps charges a good deal more than twopence said mr oglander quietly for his hopes and fears were once more postponed he hath brought the worst load ever were brought cried the widow growing eloquent black death and the plague and the murrain of egypt hath come in through cripps the carrier how much will he charge beckley your worship how much shall beckley pay him when she mourneth for her children when she spreadeth forth her hands and seeketh north and south and cannot find them because they are not what is it good woman cried smith impatiently what is all this uproar do tell us and have done with it good man replied widow hookham tartly my words are addressed to your betters sir your worship knoweth well that master kale hath leave and license for his sunday dinner ever since his poor wife died he sitteth with a knife and fork to the right side of our cookmaid he were that genteel i do assure you although his appearance bespeaketh it not and city gents may look down on him he had such a sense of propriety not a word did he say all the time of dinner to raise an objection to the weakest stomach but as soon as he see that all were done and the parlour dinner forward he layeth his finger on his lips and looketh to me as the prime authority and when i ask him to speak out no secrets being among good friends what he said were a deal too much for me or any other christian person well well maam if your own dinner was respected you might have showed some respect for ours mr smith exclaimed very sadly beholding the gravy in the channelled dish margined with grease and the noble sirloin weeping with lost opportunity but mr oglander took no notice to such things he was indifferent now to keep the mind dwelling upon earthly victuals the widow replied severely on the lords day and with the day of the lord ahanging special over ussuch things is beyond me to deal with and calls for mr warbelow carrier cripps hath sent his sister over to nurse squire overshute john smith pretended to be busy with his beef but mary who made a point of watching whatever he did without well knowing why startled as she was by her mothers words this girl had her quick eyes upon his face and was sure that it lost colour as the carved sirloin of beef had done from the trickling of the gravy overshute nurse mr overshute cried the squire with great astonishment why what ails mr overshute it is a long time since i have seen him and i thought that he had perhaps forgotten me he used to come very often whenbut who am i to tempt him when my darling was here in the time of my darling everybody came to visit me now nobody comes and of course it is right there is nobody for them to look at now and no one to make them laugh a little ah she used to make them laugh till i was quite jealous i do believe not of myself bless your heart but of her because i never liked her to have too much to say to anybody unless it was one who could understand her and nobody ever turned up that was able in any way to understand her except her poor old father sir the squire at the end of this long speech which had been a great deal too much for him stood up and flourished his fork which should have been better employed in feeding him and looked from face to face in fear that he had made himself ridiculous nobody laughed at him or even smiled and he was pleased with this and resolved never to give such occasion again because it would have shamed him so and after all it was his own business none of these people could have any idea and he hoped they never might have by this time his mind was dropping softly into some confusion and feeling it so he sat down again and drank the glass of wine which mary hookham kindly held for him for a few minutes mr john smith had his flourish to let both the women be sure who he was all about the queen and the law of the land and the jurisdiction of the bench and he threatened the absent cripps with three months imprisonment and perhaps the treadmill he knew that he was talking unswept rubbish but his audience was female they listened to him without leaving off their work and their courage increased as his did but presently mr oglander who had seemed to be taking a nap arose and said as clearly as ever he had said anything in his clearest days mary go and tell charles to put the saddle on the mare at once oh lor sir whatever are you thinking of lor a massy sir i couldnt do it i couldnt you aint abeen ahorseback for nigh four months and your orders is to keep quiet in your chair and not even look out o winder sir do ee plaize to go into your slippers sir i will not go into my slippers mary i will go into my boots i hear that mr overshute is ill and i gather from what you have all been saying that his illness is of such a kind that nobody will go near him i have wronged the young gentleman bitterly and i will do my best to right myself if i never do another thing i will ride to shotover this day order the mare as i tell you and the air will do me good please god chapter xxix a spiders dinnerparty now was the happy time when oxford ever old yet ever fresh with the gay triennial crown of youth was preparing itself for that sweet leisure for which it is seldom ill prepared being the paramount castle and strongest feudal hold of stout idlesse this fair city has not much to do to get itself into prime condition for the noblest efforts and most arduous feats of invincible laziness the first and most essential step is to summon all her students and send them to chapel to pay their vows after this there need be no misgiving or fear of industry with one accord they issue forth all pledged to do nothing for the day week or month each intellectual brow is stamped with the strongest resolve not to open a book and games are the spur which the clear spirit doth raise to scorn the dons and live luxurious days this being so whether winter shatters the isid wave against folly bridge or springs arrival rustles in the wavering leaves of magdalen or autumn strews the chastened fragrance of many brewers on ripe airhow much more when beauteous summer fosters the coy down on the lip of the junior sophist like thistleseed and casts the freshmans shadow hotly on the flags of high streetnow or never is the proper period not to overwork ones self and the hour for taking it easy but against each sacred rite and hallowed custom of the place against each good oldfashioned smoothness and finefed sequacity a rapid stir was now arising and a strong desire to give a shove there were some few people who really thought that the little world in which they lay was one they ought to move in that perfect life was not to be had without some attempt at breathing and that a fire though beautifully laid gives little warmth till kindled however these were young fellows mostly clever in their way but not quite sound and the heads of houses generally speaking abode on the housetop and did not come down still they kept their sagacious eyes on the movement gathering down below and made up their minds to crush it as soon as they could be quite certain of being too late but these things ride not upon the cart of crippsthough cripps is a theologian when you beat his charges down after the easter vacation was over with too few fattening festivals the most popular tutor in brasenose being the only one who ever tried to teach came back to his rooms and his college work with a very fine appetite for doing goodaccording at least to his own ideas of good and duty and usefulness all of which were fundamentally wrong in the opinion of the other tutors but hardenow while he avoided carefully all disputes with his colleagues strictly kept to his own course and doing more work than the other five all put together attempted was permitted to have his own way because of the trouble there might be in stopping him the college met for the idle term on saturday morning as usual on saturday afternoon hardenow led off his old squad with two new recruits for their fifteen miles of hard walking athletics and training were as yet unknown except with the eight for henley and this tractarian movement may have earned its name ere the birth of no from the tract of road traversed in a toeandheel track by the fine young fellows who were up to it at any rate that was what the country people said and these are more often right than wrong and the same opinion still abides with them hardenow only took this long tramp for the sake of collecting his forces saturday was not their proper day for this very admirable coattail chase neither did they swallow hill and plain in this manner on a sunday lectures were needful to fetch them up to the proper pitch for striding so wherefore on the morrow mr hardenow was free for a cruise on his own account after morning sermon at st marys and not having heard of his old friend russel for several weeks he resolved to go and hunt him up in his own home it was not a possible thing for this very active and sparebodied man to lounge upon his road whatever it was that he undertook he carried on the action with such a swing and emphasis that he seemed to be doing nothing else he wore a short spencer and a longtailed coat typicalto use the pet word of that ageboth of his curt brevity and his anklereaching gravity his jacket stuck into him and his coat struck away with the power of an adverse wind while the boys turned back and stared at him but he was so accustomed to that sort of thing that he never thought of looking round he might have been tailpiped for seven leagues without troubling his head about it this was a man of great power of mind and led up to a lofty standard pure unselfish good and grand so far as any grandeur can be in the human compound watchful over himself at almost every corner of his ways kind of heart and fond of children loving all simplicity quick to catch and glance the meaning of minds very different from his own subtle also and deep to reason but never much inclined to argue he had a shy and very peculiar manner of turning his eyes away from even an undergraduate when his words did not command assent as sometimes happened with freshmen full of conceit from some great public school the manner of his mind was never to assert itself or enter into controversy he felt that no arguments would stir himself when he had solidly cast his thoughts and he had of all courtesies the rarest at any rate with englishmen the courtesy of hoping that another could reason as well as himself in this honest and strenuous nature there was one deficiency the rev thomas hardenow copious of mind and active clear of memory and keen at every knot of scholarship patient and candid too and not at all intolerant yet never could reach the highest rank through want of native humour his view of things was nearly always anxious and earnest his standingpoint was so fixed and stable that every subject might be said to revolve on its own axis during its revolution round him and the side that never presented itself was the ludicrous or lightsome one as he strode up the hill with the back of his legline concave at the calf instead of convex whenever his fluttering skirt allowed a glimpse of what he never thought about it was brought home suddenly to his ranging mind that he might be within view of beckley at a bend of the rising road he turned and endwise down a plait of hills and between soft pillowy folds of trees the simple old church of beckley stood for his thoughts to make the most of it and to guide them the chime of the gentle bells foretelling of the service at three oclock came on the tremulous conveyance of the wind murmuring the burden he knew so wellold men and ancient dames married folk and children bachelors and maidens all come to church hardenow thought of the months he had spent some few years back in that quiet place of the long laborious lonesome days the solid hours divided well the space allotted for each hard drill then when the pages grew dim and dark and the bat flitted over the lattice or the white owl sailed to the rickyard the glory of sallying into the air inhaling grander volumes than ever from mortal breath proceeded and plunging into leaves that speak of one great author only and well he remembered in all that toil the pure delight of the sunday the precious balm of kicking out both legs and turning on the pillow until eight oclock the leisurely breakfast with the saturday papers instead of aristotle the instructive and amusing walk to church where everybody admired him and he set the fashion for at least ten years the dread of the parson that a man who was known as the best of his year at oxford should pick out the fallacies of his old logic and then the culminating triumph of sabbatic jubileethe dinner the dinner wherewith the whole week had been privily gestating up to that crowning moment when cripps in a coat of no mean broadcloth entered with a dish of crippsic size with the trimmings coming after him in a tray and lifting the cover with a pant and flourish said well sir now what do ee plaize to think of that nor in this pleasant retrospect of kindness and simplicity was the element of rustic grace and beauty wholly absentthe slight young figure that flitted in and out with quick desire to please him the soft pretty smile with which his improvements of beckley dialect were received and the sweet gray eyes that filled with tears so the day before his college met hardenow had feared humbleminded as he was that the young girl might be falling into liking him too well and he knew that there might be on his own part too much reciprocity therefore much as he loved cripps and fully as he allowed for all that was to be said upon every side he had felt himself bound to take no more than a distant view of beckley even now after three years and a half there was some resolve in him to that effect or the residue of a resolution he turned from the gentle invitation of the distant bells and went on with his face set towards the house of his old friend overshute when he came to the lodge which was like a great beehive stuck at the end of a row of trees it caused him a little surprise to find the gate wide open and nobody there but he thought that as it was sunday perhaps the lodgepeople were gone for a holiday and so he trudged onward and met no one to throw any light upon anything in this way he came to the door at last with the fine old porch of purbeck stone heavily overhanging it and the long wings of the house stretched out with empty windows either way hardenow rang and knocked and then set to and knocked and rang again and then sat down on a stone balustrade and then jumped up with just vigour renewed and pushed and pulled and in every way worked to the utmost degree of capacity everything that had ever been gifted with any power of conducting sound nobody answered the sound of his energy went into places far away and echoed there and then from stony corners came back to him he traced the whole range of the windows and caught no sign of any life inside them at last he pushed the great door and lo there was nothing to resist his thrust except its sullen weight when hardenow stood in the oldfashioned hall which was not at all baronial he found himself getting into such a fright that he had a great mind to go away again if there had only been anybody with himhowever inferior in mental powerhe might have been able to refresh himself by demonstrating something and then have marched on to the practical proof but now he was all by himself in strange and unaccountable loneliness the sense of his condition perhaps induced him to set to and shout the silence was so oppressive that the sound of his own voice almost alarmed him by its audacity so after shouting russel thrice he stopped and listened and heard nothing except that cold and shuddering ring as of hardware in frosty weather which stone and plaster and timber give when deserted by their lordsmankind knowing pretty well all the chief rooms of the house hardenow resolved to go and see if they were locked and grasping his black hollystick for selfdefence he made for the diningroom the door was wide open the cloth on the table with knives and forks and glasses placed as if for a small dinnerparty but the only guest visible was a longlegged spider with a sound and healthy appetite who had come down to dine from the oak beams overhead and was sitting in his web between a claret bottle and a cruetstand ready to receive with a cordial clasp any eligible visitor hardenow tasted the water in a jug and found it quite stale and nasty then he opened a napkin and the bread inside it was dry and hard as biscuit then he saw with still further surprise that the windows were open to their utmost extent and the basket of plate was on the sideboard my old friend russel my dear old fellow he cried with his hand on his heart where lurked disease as yet unsuspected what strange misfortune has befallen you no wonder my letter was left unanswered perhaps the dear fellow is now being buried and every one gone to his funeral but no if it were so these things would not be thus the funeral feast is a grand institution everything would be fresh and lively and five leaves put into the dinnertable with this true reflection he left the room to seek the solution elsewhere he failed however to find it in any of the downstair sittingrooms then he went even into the kitchen thinking the liberty allowable under such conditions the grate was cold and the table bare on the one lay a drift of soot on the other a level deposit of dust with a few grimy implements to distribute it hardenow made up his mind for the worst he was not addicted to fiction as haply was indicated by his good degree but he could not help recalling certain eastern and even classic tales and if he had come upon all the household sitting in native marble or from the waistband downward turned into fish or logs or dragons he might have been partly surprised but must have been wholly thankful for the explanation failing however to discover this and being resolved to go through with the matter the tutor of brasenose mounted the black oak staircase of this enchanted house at the head of the stairs was a wide low passage leading right and left from a balustraded gallery the young man chose first the passage to the right and tightening his grip of the stick strode on chapter xxx the firebell the doors of the rooms on either side were not only open but fastened back the sashes of the windows were all thrown up and the rain which had followed when the east wind fell had entered and made puddles on the sills inside such a draught of air rushed down the passage that hardenows lengthy skirts flickered out in the orthodox fashion behind him at the end of this passage he came to a small alcove fenced off with a loose white curtain shaking and jerking itself in the wind he put this aside with his stick and two doorways leading into separate rooms but with no doors in them faced him something told him that both these rooms held human life or human death first he looked in at the one on the left he expected to see lonely death perhaps corruption or he knew not what his nerves were strung or unstrung whichever is the medical way of putting it to such a degree that he wholly forgot or entirely put by everything except his own absorbing sense of his duty as a man in holy orders this duty had never been practised yet in any serious way because he had never been able to afford it it costs so much more money than it brings in however in the midst of more lucrative work he had felt that he was sacred to itrich or poorand he often had a special hankering after it this leaning towards the cure of souls had a good chance now of being gratified in the room on the left hand he saw a little bed laid at the foot of a fat fourposter which with carved mouths grinned at it and on this little bed of white without curtain or trimming or tester lay a lady or a ladys body cast down recklessly in sleep or death with the face entirely covered by a silvery cloud of hair from the manner in which one arm was bent hardenow thought that the lady lived there was nothing else to show it being a young man a gentleman also he hung back and trembled back from entering that room without any power to revolve things well as he always directed his pupils to do hardenow stepped to the other doorway and silently settled his gaze inside his eyes were so worried that he could not trust them until he had time to consider what they told they told him a tale even stranger than that which had grown upon him for an hour now and passed from a void alarm into a terror they showed him the loveliest girlaccording to their renderingthat ever they had rested on till now a maiden sitting in a low chair reading silently sometimes and sometimes in a whisper according to some signal perhaps of which he saw no sign there was no other person in the room so far as he could see and he strained his eyes with extreme anxiety to make out that the rev thomas hardenow knew as clearly as his keen perception ever had brought any knowledge home that he was not discharging the functions nowunless they were too catholicof the sacerdotal office in watching a young woman through a doorway without either leave or notice but though he must have been aware of this it scarcely seemed now to occur to him or whether it did or did not he went on in the same manner gazing the girl could not see him it was not fair play the width of great windows for instance kept up such a rattling of blinds and such flapping of cords and even the floor was so strewn with herbs for the sake of their aroma that anybody might quite come close to anybody who had cast away fear in the vast despair of prostration without any sense of approach until perhaps hand was laid upon shoulder hardenow took no more advantage of these things than about half a minute in that halfminute however his outward faculties being all alive with fear rendered to his inward and endiathetic organs a picture a schema or a plasmthe proper word may be left to himsuch as would remain inside at least while the mind abode there the sound of low laborious breath pervaded the sick room now and then between the creaking noises and the sighing of the wind in spite of all draughts the air was heavy with the scent of herbs strewn broadcast to prevent infectiontansy wormwood rue and sage burnt lavender and rosemary the use of acids in malignant fevers was at that time much in vogue and saucers of vinegar and verjuice steeped lemonpeel and such like as well as dozens of medicine bottles stood upon little tables still hardenow could not see the patient only by following the glance of the reader could he discover the direction it was the girl herself however on whom his wondering eyes were bent at first he seemed to know her face and then he was sure that he must have been wrong the sense of doing good and the wonderful influence of pity had changed the face of a pretty girl into that of a beautiful woman hardenow banished his first idea and wondered what strange young lady this could be although she was reading aloud and doing it not so very badly it was plain enough that she expected no one to listen to her the sound of her voice perhaps was soothing to some one who understood no words as people in some of the many unknown conditions of brain have been soothed and recovered by a thread of waterfall broken with a walkingstick at any rate she read on and her reading fell like decent poetry hardenow scarcely knew what he ought to do he did not like to go forward and it was a mean thing to go backward rendering no help when help seemed wanted so extremely he peeped back into the other room and there was the lady with the fine white hair sleeping as soundly as a weary top driven into dreaming by extreme activity of blows nothing less than a fine idea could have delivered hardenow from this bad situation it was suddenly borne in upon his mind that the house had a rare old firebell a relic of nobler ages hanging from a bar in a little open cot scarcely big enough for a henroost and russel had shown him one day with a laugh the corner in which the rope hung there certainly could be but very little chance of doing harm by ringing it what could be worse than the present state of things some good samaritan might come no levite was left to be driven away for hardenow understood the situation now the meaning of a very short paragraph in the oxford paper of saturday which he had glanced at and cast by came distinctly home to him the careful editor had omitted name of person and of place but had made his report quite clear to those who held a key to the reference how very dullwitted now i must be cried the poor young fellow in his lonely trouble i ought to have known it but we never know the clearest things until too late it was not only for the sake of acquitting himself of an awkward matter but also in the hope of doing good to the few left desolate that hardenow moved forth his legs from the windy white curtain away again he went down the passage at a very great pace as nearly akin to a run as the practice of long steady walks permitted and then at the head of the staircase he turned and remembered a quiet little corner here in an outoftheway recess the rope of the alarmbell hung and he saw it even in that niche moving to and fro with the universal draught hardenow seized it and rang such a peal as the old bell had never given tongue to before the bell was a large one sound and clear and the call must have startled the neighbourhood for a mile if it could be startled really i do believe i have roused somebody at last exclaimed the ringer as he looked through a window commanding the road to the house and saw a man on horseback coming but surely unless he sprang out of the ground he must have been coming before i began in this strange loneliness almost any visitor would be welcome and hardenow ran towards the top of the stairs to see who it was and to meet him but here as he turned the corner of the balustraded gallery a scared and hurrying young woman almost ran into his arms oh what is it she cried drawing back and blushing to a deeper colour than wellextracted blood can show there is no funeral yet he is not dead who is ringing the bell so it has startled even him and will either kill or save him kill him it will kill him i am almost sure esthermiss crippswhat a fool i am i never thought of thati did not knowhow could i tell i am all in the dark is it russel overshute yes mr hardenow everybody knows it every one has taken good care to run away even the doctors will come no more they say it is hopeless and they might only infect their other patients i fear that his mother must die too she has taken the fever in a milder form but walk she will while walk she can and at her time of life it is such a chance but i cannot stop one moment and at your time of life is it nothing esther you seem to think of everybody but yourself is this fair to your own hearth and home while he was speaking he looked at her eyes and her eyes were filling with deep tearsa dangerous process to contemplate oh no there is no fear of that she answered misunderstanding him i shall take good care not to go home until i am quite sure that there is no risk that is not what i mean i mean supposing you yourself should catch it if i do they will let me stay here i am sure but i have no fear of it the hand that led me here will lead me back again but you ought not to be here i am quite forgetting you hardenow looked at her with admiration warmer than he could put into words she had been thinking of him throughout she thought of every one except herself even in the moment of first surprise she had drawn away so that she stood to leeward and while they were speaking she took good care that the current of wind passed from him to her also in one hand she carried a little chafingdish producing lively fumigation now if you please i must go back to him nothing would move him he lay for hours as a log lies on a stone i could not have knowledge whether he was living only for his breathing sometimes like a moan the sound of the bell seemed to call him to life for he thought it was his own funeral his mother is with him worn out as she is the lady awoke at his rambling she sent me to find out the meaning now sir please to go back round the corner the shivering wind comes down the passage hardenow was not such a coward as to obey her orders he even wanted to shake hands with her as in her girlhood he used to do when he had frightened this little pupil with too much emendation but esther curtsied at a distance and started awayuntil her retreat was cut off very suddenly why ho girl ho girl and young man in the corner what is the meaning of all this i have come to see things righted my name is worth oglander i find this here old house silent as a grave and you two looking like a brace of robbers young womanyoung womanwhy bless me now if it isnt our own etty cripps i did believe and i would believe but for knowing of your family etty and your brother cripps the carrier that here you are for the purpose of setting this old mansion afire esther having been hard set to sustain what had happened already as well as unblest with a wink of sleep since friday night was now unable to assert her dignity she simply leaned against the wall and gently blew into the embers of her disinfecting stuff she knew that the squire might kill himself after all his weeks of confinement by coming over here in this rash manner and working himself up so but it was not her place to say a word even if she could say it mr oglander said hardenow coming forward and offering his hand while esther looked at them from beneath a cloud of smoke i know your name better than you know mine you happened to be on the continent when i was staying in your village my name is thomas hardenow i am a priest of the anglican church and have no intention of setting anything on fire lor bless me lord bless me are you the young fellow that turned half the heads of beckley and made the oxford examiners all tumble back like dead herrings with their jaws down cripps was in the schools and he told me all about it and you were a friend of poor overshute i am proud to make your acquaintance sir master cripps has inverted the story i fear hardenow answered with a glance at esther while he could not without rudeness get his hand out of the ancient squires which clung to another in this weak time as heartily as it used to do the examiners made a dry herring of me but i am very glad to see you sir i have heard ofat least i mean i fearedthat you were in weak health almost not a bit of it i was fool enoughor rather i should say my sisterto have a lot of doctors down fellows worth their weight in gold or at any rate in brass every day of their own blessed lives and yet with that temptation even they cannot lengthen their own days of that i will tell you some other time they kept me indoors and they drenched me with physicthis that and the other god bless you sir this hour of the air with my own old good mare under me has done me more goodbut my head goes round just a little not anything to notice etty my dear dont you be afraid with these words the squire sank down on the floor not through any kind of fit or even loss of consciousness but merely because his fine old legs being quite out of practice for so many weeks had found it a little more than they could do to keep themselves firm in the stirrups and then carry their master up slippery stairs and after that have to support a good deal of excitement among the trunk parts chapter xxxi throw physic to the dogs in all my life i never knew such a very extraordinary thing said squire oglander on the following tuesday to his old friend dr splinters why look you here he was wholly given up by the very first man in londonthat the poor young fellow wascan you deny that splinters well between you and me and the doorpost squire answered his learned visitor i am not quite so sure that sir anthony is quite the rose and crown of the profession he may be a great court card and all that and the rage with all the nobility but for all that squire there are good men in comparatively obscure positions men who have devoted their lives to science from the purest motives modest men sir who are thankful to pocket their poor guinea men who would scorn any handle to their name or any shabby interloping sir i say there are dd good men but even you splinters come noweven you gave him upunless we are wholly misinformed not at all that was quite a mistake the fact was simply this when sir anthony pronounced his opinion at our last consultation it was not my place to contradict himwe never do that with a london manbut i ventured in my own mind to differ even from our brilliant light sir for i said to myself first see the effect of the remedial agent which i myself in the absence of this londoner have exhibited i was suddenly called away to retrieve a case of shocking blundering by a quack at iffley that was why you did not see me squire oh yes to be sure i quite see now answered mr oglander with a quiet internal wink and when you came you found the most wonderful effect from your remedial agent that i did something i could scarcely have believed soft sweet sleep a genial perspiration an equable pulse nice gentle breathingthe very conditions of hygiene which sir anthonys efforts could never produce why my good sir in all the records of the therapeutic art there is no example of such rapid efficacy i think it will henceforth be acknowledged that dr splinters knows what he is about my dear friend you know that there is nothing i dislike so much as the appearance of vaunting if i had only condescended to that nobody could have stopped me sir but no squire no i have always been the same and i have not an enemy except myself you may say more than that sira great deal more than that you may say that you have many friends doctor who admire your great abilities but as to russel overshute if the poor fellow does come round the general belief will be that he must thank the firebell the firebell my dear sir in this age of advanced therapeuticsoglander you must know better than to listen to that low story splinters i know that foolish tales are told about almost everything but being there myself i thought there might be something in it nothing whatever i never heard such nonsense i was quite angry with esther cripps what can chits of girls know they must have their chatter i suppose they must said the squire sadly thinking of his own dear grace still they may be right sometimes at any rate doctor the firebell did as much good as your medicine did take another glass of wine i would not hurt your feelings for the world my dear old friend oglander answered dr splinters putting up his great gold spectacles so that beneath them he might seefor he never could see through themhow to pour out his fine glass of port oglander you have something or other that you are keeping in the background squire whatever it is out with it between you and me sir there should be nothing but downright yes or no mr oglander downright yes or no sir of course of course said the squire relapsing into some quiet mood again that was how i always liked it splinters you must know i did and i never meant anything against it by bringing this here little bottle back it may have saved the poor boys life and of course it did if you say so but the seal is still on the cork and the stuff all there so it may do good again i dare say the good came through the glass you doctors have such devices mr oglander took a small square bottle from his inner peculiar pocket and gave it to the doctor so as not to disturb his wineglass how the deuce did you get hold of this cried splinters being an angry man when taken without notice this is some of that girls insolent tricksi call her an insolent and wicked girl i call her a good and a brave girlthe very best girl in beckley sincebut my dear splinters you must not be vexed she told me that you had the greatest faith in this last idea of yours and it struck me at once that you might wish to try it in some other case and so i brought it you see it has not been opened it doesnt matter whether it was used or not cried dr splinters vehemently there is the stuff sir and here is the result am i to understand sir that you deny the existence of providence far be such a thing from me the squire replied with a little indignation at such an idea and then remembering that splinters was his guest he changed the subject how could i help having faith in the lord when i see his care made manifest why look at me splinters i am twice the man i was last sunday morning why is it so why because it pleased a gracious providence to make it my duty as a man to rideto ride sir a very considerable distance on a mare who had been eating her head off every one vowed that i never could do it and my good housekeeper locked me in and when i unscrewed the lock she sent two men after me to pick me up very good sir here i am enjoying my glass of port with the full intention of having another yesterday i sent to our roadcontractor for a threeheaded and doublehanded hammer and kale smashed up in about two minutes three hundred and twenty medicine bottles they will come in for the top of the orchard wall squire answered splinters with a twinkling eye it is not at all improbable that you may be right there are some constitutions so perverse that to exhibit the best remedial agent is just the same thing as to reason with a pig but it is high time for me to be jogging on my road if beckley and shotover discard my extremely humble services there are other places in the world sir besides beckley and shotover there is no other place in the world for you except beckley for some hours my friend we have known one another long enough to allow for one another now i would have arranged a rubber for youbut butwell you know what i meansadly selfish but i cannot help it the doctor though vain and irritable was easily touched with softness he thought of all his many children and of the long pain he had felt at losing one out of a dozen then without process of thought he felt for the loss of one where one was all oglander you need not say another word he answered putting forth his hand to squeeze any trifle away between them a rubber in winter is all very well and so it is in summer at the proper time but on a magnificent spring evening to watch the sunset between ones cards is noti mean that it is very nice indeed but still it ought scarcely to be done when you can help it now i will just take the leastest little drop of your grand curacoa before i smoke and then if you have one of those old manillas i am your man for a stroll in the garden to go into a garden in good weather soothes the temper the freedom of getting out of doors is a gracious joy to begin with and when the first blush of that is past without any trouble there come forward so many things to be looked at even since yesterdayif we had the good hap to see them yesterdaymany thousand of little things have spent the time in changing even with the weather scarcely different from yesterdaysthough differ it must in some small points when in its most consistent moodeven with no man to come and dig and fork and roll and by all human devices harass and even without any children dancing plucking pulling trampling and enjoying their blessed little hearts as freely as any flower does yet in the absence of all those local contributions towards variety variety there will be for all who have the time to look for it the most observant and delightful poets of the present age instead of being masters of nature prefer to be natures masters having obtained this power they use it with such diligence and spirit that they make the peach and the apple bloom together and the plum keep the kalendar of the lilac once in a way such a thing does almost happen without the poets aidthat is to say when a long cold winter is broken by a genial outburst waking every dormant life and after that a repressive chill returns and lasts to the may month at such a time when hope deferred springs anew as hope assured and fear breaks into fluttering joy and faith moves steadily into growth then a truly poetic confusion arises in the works of earth in such a state of things the squire and the doctor walked to and fro in the garden the squire still looking very pale and feeble but with the help of his favourite spud managing to get along and to enjoy the evening the blush of the peach wall was not over and yet the trellised appletree was softly unsheathing puckered buds all in little clusters pointed like rosettes of coral the petals of the plumbloom still were hovering with their edges brown although in a corner near a chimney positively a lilacbush was thrusting forth those livid jags which lift and curve themselves so swiftly into plumes of beauty the two good gentlemen were surprised each wanted particularly to hear what the other thought of it but neither would deign to ask and either feared to speak his thoughts for fear of giving the other an advantage because they were rival gardeners and so they avoided the subject this is the very first cigar said the squire as they turned at the end of the peach wall over against a young grosse mignonne beautifully trained on the seymour system and bright with the central glow of pistil although the petals were droppingmy very first cigar since thatyou know what i mean of coursesince i have cared whether i were in my garden or in my grave but the lord supports me providence is good or how could i be smoking this cigar you must not learn to look at things in that way dr splinters answered oglander you must learn to know better you are in an uncomfortable frame of mind or you would not have flouted me with that bottle after all our friendship why bless me only look around you badly pruned as your trees are what a picture there is of largeness yes splinters more than you could find in yours which you amputate into a doctors bamboo but now perhaps you may doubt it splinters because your trees are so very poorbut i have not felt any pride at all any pride at all in one of them what is the good of lovely trees with only ones self to enjoy them now oglander there you are again how often must i tell you your poor little gracie is gone of course and a nice little thing she was to be sure but here you are again as well as ever or at any rate as positive i judge a mans state of health very much by his powers of contradiction and yours are firstrate go to go to you are equal to another wife take a young one and have more gracies splinters do you know what i should do mr oglander answered with his spud uplifted if my powers were such as you supposebecause i smashed your bottles yes i dare say you would knock me down and never beg my pardon till the wedding breakfast you are right in the first part but wrong in the second oh doctor is there no one able to share the simplest thoughts we have to minister to a mind diseased first he must have his own mind diseased as all the blessed poets have but look the green flywho would ever believe it after our siberian winter the aphis is hatched in your young peachshoots before they have made even half a joint that comes of your seymour system ridiculous answered the squire but never mind what matter now then you really do think splintersnow as an old friend try to tell mein pure sincerity do you think that i have altogether lost my gracie oglander no i can truly say no we are all good christians i should hope she is not lost but gone before but my dear fellow will you never understand that she ought to have gone long after it is all very well for you who have got some bakers dozen of little ones and lost only one in the measlesforgive me i know it was hard upon youi say things that i should not saybut if you could only bring your mindhowever i daresay you have tried to do it and what right have i to ask you splinters i know i am puzzleheaded and many people think me worse than that but you have the sense to understand me because for many years you have been acquainted with my constitution now splinters tell me in three wordsshall i live to see my gracie that you will squire and to see her married and to dance on your lap her children so said dr splinters fearing what might happen if he did not say it only to see her that is all i want and to have her in my arms once more and to hear her tell me with her own true tongue that she never ran away from me after that i shall be ready for my coffin and know that the lord has ordered it here comes more of your dust into my eyes splinters will you never learn how to knock your ash off chapter xxxii cripps on celibacy whatever might or may be said by any number of most able and homicidal physicians russel overshute will believe as long as he draws breath of life that by the grace of the lord he owes that privilege to the firebell in this belief he has always been most strongly supported by esther cripps who perhaps was the first to suggest the idea for he at that time must have failed to know a firebell from a waterbucket the doctors had left him through no fear for their own lives but in despair of his there was far less risk of infection now than in the earlier stages no sooner however did the household find out that the medical men had abandoned the case than panic seized their gallant hearts and with one accord they ran away from saturday morning till saturday night when esther came from beckley there was nobody left to watch and soothe the poor despairing misery except the helpless and wornout mother one thing is certain and even the doctors with their usual sharpness found it wise to acknowledge thisboth mr overshute and his mother must have been dead bodies with little hope of christian burial if that brave girl had not set forth without any one even asking her on the saturday night to help them mrs overshute had quite thrown up all hope of everythingsave the mercy of god in a better world and his justice upon her enemieswhen quite in the dark this young girl came while she was lying down on her back and curtsied and asked her pleasure if esther had not curtsied perhaps mrs overshute in that state of mind would have taken her for an angel though ettys bonnet made by herself was not at all angelical but she knew her for one of the lower orders who bend knee instead of neck and belonging herself to a fine old race she rallied her last energies with a power of condescension however these are medical physical social economical and perhaps even psychological questionswherein what remains except perpetual inquiry enough is to say that russell overshute having long had a ringing in his ears was rung out of that and rung back to life by the lively peal of the firebell and ever since that whenever he is illthough it be only a little touch of gouthe immediately sends a good corpulent man to lay hold of the rope and swing to it these things are of later date for the present this young man although he certainly had turned the corner lay still in a very precarious state with a feeble mother to pray for him mrs overshute held that same vile fever but in a very different form as at her time of life was natural with her it was intermittent low stealthy and undermining it never affected her brain or drove her into furious calenture but rooted slowly inward preying on her life quite leisurely their cases differed as a knockdown blow differs from a quiet grasp but though the house lay still in sadness loneliness and dull suspense and though the doctors having abandoned the case had the manners not to come again still from day to day there was some little growth of liveliness hardenow came almost daily having put his class of striders under a deputy sixleaguer the squire also might be expected whenever mother hookham let him out and even zacchary cripps renewed an old washing in that direction he came with the hoops of his cart taken out because of the beautiful weather and four good baskets of clothes for to wash whose wearers were happy enough to have no idea where their things were and quite at the centre of his gravityas felt by himself and endorsed by dobbinanybody getting up with a curious eye might well have beheld a phenomenon for here stood a very large pickling tub with the cover taken off for the sake of air around the sides was salted porkhands and springs and belly piecesand in the middle was a goodsized barrel of the then existent native veed un cried cripps with his coattails up while tugging at his heavy tub veed un etty whatsomever ee do salt is the main thing for un now i have heerd tell that they burns away every bit of the salt inside em in these here bouts of fever if ee can replace un laife comes round or else they goes off like the snuff of a candle bless me i must be getting fevery myzell or never should have a job to lift this here now the quality of this pickle you know well for the most part fell on your shoulders homebred homeborn homefed homeslaughtered and homesaltedthats what i calls pork yes to be sure zak etty answered laying her hand to the tub upon the shaftstock while dobbin wagged his tail at her but what have you got in this very small cask sitting in the middle of all the brine why you know etty you must have seed me bring em for all the great folk about christmastide oysters as lives in the sea and must be salt inside of their barryels so i clapped them in here for a fresh smack of it and uncommonly strengthening things they be if you take them with enow of treble x likely his worship will be too weak to keep them down with the covers on yet as is the proper way they tell me so you best way take out the hearts and give him oh brother cried esther remembering suddenly i ought not to be talking to you like this whatever could i be thinking of what would the people at beckley say they would fear to come nigh you for a month zak and your business would be ruined now do jog on you and dear old dobbin how well i knew the sound of his old feet i cant give you the fever dobbin can i with this perhaps incorrect or at any rate unestablished hypothesis she gave the old horse a lingering kiss just below his blinkers in return for which he jerked off some froth on the sleeve of her dress and shook himself while the carrier having discharged his cargo smote himself with both arms from habit rather than necessity and approached his young sister for his usual hearty smack no zak no she cried running up the steps i have no fear of taking it myself whatever but if i should happen to give it to you i never should get over it well well little un the lord knows best master cripps answered without repining too bitterly at this arrangement but ating of my victuals lonesome is worse than having no salt to them you better come home pretty soon my dear or somehow or other there might happen to be some one over in the corner longside of our best fryingpan etty had heard this threat so often that now she only laughed at it but instead of laughing she blushed most sadly at her brothers parting words god bless you etty for a brave good girl and speed you home to beckley you want more sleep of nights my dear your cheeks are getting like a pillowcase but excoose my mentioning of one thing etty i be like a father to ee dont ee have more than you can help to say to the great scholard master hardenow cripps was a gentleman in an inner kind of way and he took good care to be getting up his shaft with his stiff knee stiffer than ever from the long frost of last winter while he discharged his duty as he thought it at as well as to his sister then he deposited the polished part of his breeches on the drivingboard and brought his gameleg into the right stickout and with his usual deliberation startednay that is too strong a wordpersuaded into progress his congenial and deliberate horse neither of them hurried on a washingday any more than they hurried upon any other day zacchary knew that his sister wasas master phil hiss had said of hera most terrible hand at blushing and she could not bear to be looked at in this electric aurora of maidenhood and therefore he managed to be a long way off ere even he turned both head and hand to deliver last issue of god bless you full of confusion about herself and clearness of duty for other people esther cripps ran in to see to the many things now depending upon her there were now three servants in the house gathered from good stuff around but wholly void of any wit to make up for want of experience esther had no experience either but she possessed good store of sense and quickness and kind energy whatever she thought of her brothers warning she would think of afterwards for the present she must do her best concerning other people and mrs overshute needed now more nursing than her son did zacchary cripps at the very first distance at which he was sure of not being seen began to shake his head and shook it in a resolutely reflective way for nearly three quarters of a mile the trees above him were alive with beauty alike of sight and sound and scent and the carrier made up his mind for a pipe to enable him to consider things his custom was not to smoke except when good occasion offered and he tried to have no contempt for carriers of inferior family who could not deliver a side of bacon without smoking it over again almost zacchary cripps like all good men stood up for the dignity of his work strictly meditating thus he saw a slight figure approaching with a rapid swing and presently met mr hardenow the fellow and tutor of brazenose at the sight of cripps and the wellknown cart stopped short to ask how things were going on at the house on the hill above them the carrier answered that it would be many a long day he was afraid ere his worship could get about again and that he ought to be kept very quiet and those would be his best friends now who had the least to say to him also he was told that the poor old lady would find it as much as her life was worth if she was interrupted or terrified now but my good cripps answered hardenow i am not going either to interrupt or terrify them all i desire is to have a little talk with your good and intelligent sister poor zacchary felt that his own tactics thus were turned against him and after a little stammering and heightened glow of countenance he betook himself to his more usual coursethat of plain outspeaking but first he got down from his drivingboard that he might not fail in due respect to a gentleman and clergyman master cripps had no liking at all for the duty which he felt bound to take in hand he would rather have a row with three turnpikemen than presume to speak to a gentleman therefore his bowleg seemed to twitch him at the knee as he led hardenow aside into a quiet gateway but his eyes were firm and his manner grave and steadfast as he began to speak mr hardenow now i must ask your pardon for a few words as i want to say you are a gentleman of course and a very learned scholar and i be nothing but a common carriera carrier for hire they calls me in the law when they comes upon me for damages howsoever i has to do my part off the road as well as on it sir and my dooty to them of my own household comes next to my dooty to god and myzell you are a good man i know and a kind one and would not beknown to yourself harm any one it would go to your heart i believe mr hardenow from what i seed of you when you was quite a lad if anyhow you was to be art or part in bringing unhappiness of mind to any that had trusted you i should hope so cripps i have some idea of what you mean but can hardly thinkat any rate speak more plainly well then sir i means all about your goings on with our little etty or at any rate her goings on with you which cometh to the same thing in the end so far as i be acquaint of it you might think if you was not told distinkly to the contrairy that having no business to lift up her eyes she never would do so according but i do assure you sir when it cometh to such like manner of taking on the last thing as ever gets called into the account is sensible reason they feels this and they feels that and then they falls to adreaming and the world goes into their tub same as butter and they scoops it out and pats and stamps it to their own size and liking and then the whole melteth and a sour fool is left master cripps what you say is wise and the like has often happened but your sister is a most noble girl you do her gross injustice by talking as if she were nothing but a common village maid she is brave she is pure she is grandly unselfish her mind is well above feminine average anything more so goes always amiss you should not have such a low opinion as you seem to have of your sister cripps sir my opinion is high enough now to bring your own fine words to the test would you ever dream of marrying the maid if i and she both was agreeable it would be an honour to me to do so for the prejudices of the world i care not one fig but surely you know that we contend for the celibacy of the clergy maning as a parson maunt marry a wife asked cripps by the light of nature yes my friend that is what we now maintain in the anglican communion as the tradition of the church well may i be danged cried cripps who was an ardent theologian then if i may make so bold to ask sir how could there a been a tribe of levi they must all a died out in the first generation if em ever come to any generation at all your objection is ingenious cripps but the analogy fails entirely we are guided in such matters by unbroken and unquestionable tradition of the early church then sir if you goes outside of the bible you stand on your own legs and leave us no kind of leg to stand upon however i believe that you mean well sir and i am sure that you never do no great harm and as to our etty if you feel like that in an honest helpless sort of way i beg the honour of shaking hands sir for the spirit that is inside of you certainly certainly cripps with great pleasure and then of asking you to tramp another road for your own sake as well as hers sir and may the lord teach you to know your own mind cripps i will follow your advice for the present though you have said some things that you scarcely ought to say then i humbly beg your pardon sir every one of us doeth that same sometimes the bridle of the tongue falleth into the teeth when the lash is laid on us your metaphors are quite classical however i respect you greatly cripps for your straightforward conduct i am not a weak man any more than you are although you seem to think me one i like and admire your sister esther for courage combined with gentleness i always liked her when she was a child and i understood her nature but as to herliking me more than she ought cripps you are imaginative never heerd before cried cripps any accoosation of that there kind my friend it is the rarest compliment however your horse is quite ready to walk off and so am i towards cowley i will not go to shotover grange today and i will avoid your sister though i rarely do like talking to her you are a man sir cried zacchary cripps as hardenow set off across the fields god bless your reverence though you never get a waife a true man he is and a maight a been a faine one if he hadnt taken to them stiff coat tails chapter xxxiii kit in the meanwhile mrs luke sharp was growing very anxious about her son and only child and idol christopher not that there was anything at all amiss with his bodily health so far at least as she could see but that he seemed so unsettled in his mind so absent and preoccupied and careless even of his outdoor sports which at one time were his only care of course at this time of year there was very little employment for the gun but there was plenty of fishing to be got such as it was round oxford and it must be a very bad time of year when there are no rats for little terriers and badgers for the larger tribe yet none of these things now possessed the proper charm for christopher wherever he was he always seemed to be wanting to be somewhere else and like a hydrophobic dog he hated to be looked at while after the manner of a cat assisted lately by lucina he ran up into his own loft when he thought there was nobody watching well arranged as all this might be and keen and selfsatisfactory there was something keener and not very easy to satisfy looking after it the love of a mother may fairly be trusted to outwit any such calflove as was making a fool of this unfledged fellow fresh from the featherbed of a private school considering whence he came and how he had been brought up and pampered kit sharp was a very fine young fellow andthanks to his liking for gun and rodhe could scarcely be called a milksop still he was only a boy in mind and in manner quite unformed and shy his father for reasons of his own having always refused to enter him at any of the colleges he might perhaps have shaped his raw material by the noblest models if he had been admitted into the society of undergraduates but the members of the university entertained in those days and probably still entertain a just and inevitable contempt for all the nontogati kit sharp had made some fluttering overtures of the flag of friendship towards one or two random undergraduates who had a nice taste for ratting he had even dined and wined once or twice in a not ignoble college and had been acknowledged to know a meerschaum as well as if he owned a statutebook but the boy always fancied perhaps through foolish and shy pride on his part that these most hospitable and kind young men had their jokes to themselves about him perhaps it was so but in pure goodwill take him for all in all and allow for the needs of his situationwhich towards the third year grow imperativeand the oxford undergraduate is as good as any other young gentleman but kit sharp being exceedingly proud and most secretive of his pride would not long receive without return good hospitality and this alone without other suspicions would have set bounds to his dealing with a race profusely hospitable his dear and good mother would gladly have invited a cross duck houseful of undergraduates and left them to get on as they might if only thereby her pet son might have sense of salt for salt with them but mr luke sharp took a different view to his mind the junior members of the glorious university were a most disagreeable and unprofitable lot to deal with he never of course condescended to the vicechancellors court and he despised all little actions in that large words legal sense he liked a fine old don or head of a house who had saved a sack of money or well earned it by vitality but for any such young fellows with no expectations or paulopostfutura such mr sharp was now too long established to put a leaf into his dinnertable this being so and christopher also of restricted pocketmoney so that no dinners at the star or mitre could be contemplated master kit sharp in a town and gown row must have lent the weight of his quiet but very considerable fist to the oppidan faction kit now my darling kit do tell me said mrs sharp for about the fiftieth time as she sat with her son in the sweet spring twilight at the large western window of cross duck house what is it that makes you sigh so you almost break your poor mothers heart i never did know you sigh my own one now is it for want of a rat my darling if rats are a sovereign apiece you shall have one rats mother why i can catch my own without any appeal to the filthy rats are never far away from legal premises like these you should not speak so of your fathers house kit and i am sure that no rats ever come upstairs or out of the window i must jump but now you are only avoiding the subject what is it that disturbs your mind kit once more mother i have the greatest objection to being called kit it sounds so small andand so horribly prosaic all the dictionaries say that it means either the outfit of a common soldier or else a diminutive kind of fiddle christopher i really beg your pardon i know how much loftier you are of course but i cannot get over the habit kit well well thenmy darling i hope you are not at all above being my darling kit mother you may call me what you like it can make no difference in my destinies christopher you make my blood run cold my darling i implore you not to sigh so your dear father pays my allowance on monday i know what has long been the aspiration of your heart kit you shall have a live badger of your own i hate the very name of rats and badgers everything is so low and nasty how can you look at that noble sunset and be full of badgers mother it grieves me to leave you alone but how can i help it when you go on so i shall go for a walk on the botley road take your pipe kit take your pipe whatever you do kit take your pipe screamed poor mrs sharp as he stuck his hat on as if it were never to come off again oh kit there are such deep black holes i will fill your pipe for you if you will only smoke mother you never know how to do it and once more my name is christopher the young man threw a light cloak on his shoulder and set his eyebrows sternly and his countenance looked very picturesque in the glow of his deathshead meerschaum it occurred to his mother that she had never seen anything more noble as soon as she had heard him bang the door mrs sharp ran back to the window whence she could watch all cross duck lane and she saw him striding along towards the quickest outlet to the country how wonderful it is she said to herself with tears all ready only the other day he was quite a little boy and whipped a top and cried if a pin ran into him and now he is far beyond all dispute the finest young man in oxford he has the highest contempt for all vulgar sports and he bolts the door of his bedroom his father calls him thick and soft ah he cannot understand his qualities there is the deepest and purest wellspring of unintelligible poetry in kit his great mind is perturbed and has hurried him into commune with the evening star thank goodness that he has got his pipe before mrs sharp had turned one page of her truly voluminous thoughts about her son a sharp click awoke the frontdoor lock and a steady and welljointed step made creaks on the old oak staircase mrs sharp drew back from her meditative vigil and trimmed her little curls aright miranda i have some work to do tonight said mr sharp in his quiet even voice and i thought it better to come up and tell you so that you need not expect me again just have the fire in the office lighted i can work better there than i can upstairs and i find the evenings damp although the long cold winter is gone at last if i should ring about ten oclock it will be for a cup of coffee if i do not ring then send everybody to bed and do not expect me until you see me certainly luke i quite understand answered mrs sharp having been for years accustomed to such arrangements but my dear before you begin can you spare me five minutes for a little conversation of course i can miranda i am always at your service mrs sharp thought to herself that this was a slight exaggeration still on the whole she had little to complain of mr sharp always remembered the time when he cast sad distant eyes at her miranda pipermore enchanting than a willcase more highly cherished than the deedbox of an earl nothing but impudence had enabled him to marry her thereby his impudence was exhausted in that one direction and he ever remained polite to her then luke will you just take your favourite chair and answer me only one question as she said these words mrs sharp took care to set the chair so that she could get the last gleam of sunset on her dear lords face her husband thoroughly understood all this and accepted the situation now do tell me lukeyou notice everything though you do not always speak of ithave you observed how very strangely kit has been going on for some time now and have you any idea of the reason and do you think that we ought to allow it my dear yes mrs sharp i have observed it you need not be at all uneasy about it i am observing him very closely when i disapprove i shall stop it at once but surely my dear surely i his mother am not to be kept in the dark about it i know that you always take your own course and your course is quite sure to be the right one but surely my dear when something important is evidently going on about my own child you would never have the heart to keep it from me i could not endure it indeed i could not i should fret myself away to skin and bone it would take a long time to do that my dear replied mr sharp as he looked with satisfaction at her fine plump figure it pleased him to hear as he often did that there was not in oxford a finer couple of middleaged people than mr and mrs sharp however i should be exceedingly grieved ever to initiate such a process but first before i tell you anything at all i will ask you to promise two things most clearly my dear i would promise fifty things rather than put up with this cruel anxiety yes i dare say but i do not want rash promises miranda you must pledge yourself to two things and keep your pledges i will do so in a moment with the greatest pleasure you would never ask anything wrong i am sure only do not keep me waiting so in the first place then you must promise me whether my plan turns out well or ill on no account to blame me for it but to give me the credit of having acted for the best throughout nothing can be easier than to promise that my dear you always do act for the best and what is more the best always comes of it very well you promise that also you must pledge yourself to conceal from every one and most of all from christopher everything i am about to tell you and to act under my directions to be sure my dear to be sure i will nothing is more reasonable than that i should keep your secrets i know that you will try miranda and i know that you have much selfcommand also you will see the importance of acting as i direct you all i fear is that when you see poor kit moping or sighing and groaning it may be almost beyond your power to refrain your motherly heart have no fear luke have no fear whatever when i know that it is for his true interest as of course it will be i shall be exceedingly sorry for him but still he may go on as much as he pleases and of course he has not behaved well at all in being so mysterious to his own mother luke sharp looked at his wife to ask whether any offshoot of this reproach was intended at all to come home to him if he had discovered any sign of that the wife of his bosom would have waited long without getting another word from him for seldom as mr sharp showed temper he held back with the chaincurb of expedience as quick a temper as ever threatened to bolt with any mans fair repute but now he received no irritation his wife looked back at him kindly and sweetly with moist expressive eyes and he saw that she still was in her duty miranda he said being touched by this for he had a great deal of conscience my darling i will tell you something such as you never heard before i have made a bold stroke a very bold one but i think it must succeed and justice is with me as you will own after all the attempts to rob us perhaps you never heard a stranger story but still i am sure you will agree with me that in every step i have taken i am most completely and perfectly justified chapter xxxiv a woolhopian it is only fair towards mr sharp to acquit him of all intention to trust his wife with a very important secret as long as he could help it he was well aware of the risk he ran in taking such a desperate step but the risk was forced upon him now by several circumstances also he wanted her aid just now in a matter in which he could not possibly have it without trusting her hence he resolved to make a virtue of necessity as the saying is and at the same time get the great relief which even a strong mind in long scheming obtains by having its burden shared this resolve of his was no sudden one for several days he had made up his mind that when he should be questioned upon the subjectwhich he foresaw must happenhe would earn the credit of candour and the grace of womanly gratitude by making a clean breast of it there could be no better season than this the house was quiet his son was away the shadows of the coming evening softly fell before her step cross duck lane looked very touching in the calm of twilight and mrs sharp was in the melting mood therefore the learned and conscientious lawyer perceived that the clients affairs about which he was going to busy himself might safely wait for another day while he was sweeping his own hearth clean so he locked the door and looked out of the window where sparrows were swarming to their ivy roost and then he drew in the old lattice and turned the iron tongue that fastened it mrs sharp looked on while some little suggestion of fear came to qualify eagerness luke i declare you quite make me nervous i shall be afraid to go to bed tonight really a stranger or a timid person would think you were going to confess a murder my dear if you feel at all inclined to give way mr sharp answered as if glad to escape we will have out our talk tomorrowor notomorrow i have an appointment at woodstock the day after that we will recur to it i see that it will be better so luke is your mind astray i quite fear so can you imagine that i could wait for two days after what you have told me my dear i was only considering yourself if you wish it i will begin at once only for your own sake i must insist on your sitting calmly down there my dear now do not agitate yourself there is nothing to frighten anybody it is the most simple thing and you will laugh when you have heard it then i wish i had heard it luke for i feel more inclined to cry than laugh miranda you must not be foolish such a thing is not at all like you very well now you are quite sedate now please not to interrupt me once but ask your questions afterwards if you ask me a question i shall stop and go to the office with my papers mr sharp looked at his wife and she bowed her head in obedience to begin at the very beginning he said with a smile to reassure her you will do me the justice to remember that i have worked very hard for my living and i have prospered well miranda having you as both the foundation and the crown of my prosperity i was perfectly satisfied as you know living quite up to my wishes and putting a little cash by every year of our lives and paying on a heavy lifeinsurance in case of my own life droppingfor the sake of you and christopher you know all that darling luke i do but you make me cry when you talk like that very well that is as it should be we were as happy as need be expected until the great wrong befell usthe fierce injustice of losing every farthing to which we were clearly entitled you were the proper successor to all the property of old fermitage that old curmudgeon and wholesale poisoner of the university made a fool of himself towards his latter end by marrying miss oglander old blackstrap as of course we know had no other motive for doing such a thing except his low ambition to be connected with a good old family ever since he began life as a bottleboy in the cellars of old jerry pigaud he never did that luke how can you speak so of my fathers own first cousin he was an extremely respectable young man my father always said so while he was making his money miranda of course he was respectable and everybody respected him as soon as he had made it however i have not the smallest intention of reproaching the poor old villain he acted according to his lights and they led him very badly a foolish ambition induced him to marry that pompous old maid joan oglander who had been jilted by commodore patch the son of the famous captain we all know what followed the old man was but a doll in the hands of his ladywife he left all the scrapings and screwings of his life for her to do what she pleased withat least everybody supposes so what do you mean luke asked mrs sharp having inkling of legal surprises do you mean that there is a later will has he done justice to me after all no my dear he never saved his soul by attending to his own kindred but he just had the sense to make a little change at last when his wife would not come near him you know what he died of it was coming on for weeks though at last it struck him suddenly the portwine fungus of his old vaults grew into his lungs and stopped them it had shown for some time in his face and throat and his wife was afraid of catching it she took it to be some infectious fever of which she is always so terribly afraid the old man knew that his time was short but take to his bed he would not of all born men the most stubborn he was as any man must be to get on well if i am to die of the fungus he said i will have a little more of it and he went and with his own hands hunted up a magnum of port which had been laid by from the vintage of in the first days of jerry pigaud but before that he had sent for me and i was there when he opened it luke you take my breath away such wonderful things i have never heard at least not in our own family of course my dear we all accept wonders with quietude till they come home to us well when he fetched out this old bottle it was fungus inside from heel to neck he held it up against the light and the glass being whiter than now they make and the wine gone almost white with age there you could see this extraordinary growth like cords in the bottle and valves across it and a long yellow sheath like a crocusflower i had never seen anything like it before but he knew all about it ah i know a genleman he grunted in his throathe never could say gentleman as you remembera genleman as would give a hundred guineas for this here bottle quibbles he shouldnt have it for a thousand my boy you and i will drink it say no and ill cut off your wife with a halfpenny miranda what could i do but try to humour him to the utmost if i had had the smallest inkling of the iniquitous will he had made of course i never would have sat on the head of the cask down in his dingy and reeking vaults by the hour together to please him but never mind thatin a moment he took a longhandled knife or chopper and holding the bottle upright struck off the neck and a part of the shoulder as straight as a line at the level of the wine not many men could do that he said none of your clumsy corkscrewers for me now quibbles heres a real treat for you talk of beeswing my boy heres a beehive and really it was more like eating than drinking wine for all the body was gone into the fungus nastier stuff i never tasted but luckily he took the lions share now quibbles ill tell you a secret he said after swallowing at least a quart a very pretty girl came and kissed me tother day in among these very bottles such a little ducknot a bit ashamed or afeared of my fungus as my missus is and her breath was as sweet as the violets of well now my little dear thinks i as i stood back and looked at her that was kind of you to kiss an old man adying of port wine fungus and if he only lives another day you shall have the right to kiss the royal family if you cares to do it quibbles i wouldnt call in you nor any other thief of a lawyer lawyers are very well over a glass but keep em outside of the cellar say i very good company in their way but the only company i put trust in is the one i have dealt with all my lifeand many a thousand pounds i have paid themthe royal wine company of oporto so now if anything happens to methough i am not in such a hurry to be binned away and walled up for the resurrectionquibbles wait six months and then you go to the royal oporto company and ask for a genleman of the name of jolly fellows now luke i am all anxiety to hear exclaimed mrs sharp with a sudden interruption what was the end of this very strange affair i perceive now that i have foreseen the whole of it but it is not right that you should speak so long without one morsel of refreshment it is many hours since you dined my dear and a very poor dinner you had of it you shall have a glass of white wine and a slice of tongue between a little cold roll and butter it will not in any way interrupt you i can get it all for you without ringing the bell only let me ask you one thing firstwhy have you never told me this till now because miranda it would disturb your mind and i know that you cannot endure suspense moreover i scarcely knew what to think of it poor old fermitage what with the fungus already in his tubes and what he was taking down might be talking sheer nonsense for all that i knew and indeed for a long time i treated it so and i had no stomach for a voyage to oporto upon mere speculation and for the benefit only of some pretty girl then i found out by the purest chance that no voyage to oporto was needful that old portwine who departed on his cask to a better world the day after his magnum meant nothing more than the london stores and agency of the oporto company and even after that i made one expedition to the minories all for nothing two or three very polite young dons stared at me and thought i was come to chaff them or perhaps had turned up from their vaults topheavy when i asked for senhor jolly fellows and so i came away and lost some months and might never have thought it worth while to go again except for another mere accident my dear what a chapter of accidents cried mrs sharp while feeding him i thought that you were a great deal too clever to allow any room for accidents women think so men know better the lawyer replied sententiously his ability was too wellknown to need his vindication and miranda you forget that i had as yet no personal interest in the question but when i happened to have a portuguese gentleman as a clienta man who had spent many years in englandand happened to be talking of our language to him i told him one part of the story and asked if he could throw any light on it he told me at once that the name which had so puzzled me must be gelofilosa portuguese surname by no means common and the next time i was in town i had occasion to call in st johns street and found myself almost by accident again not far from the companys offices mr sharp you left such a thing to chance when you knew that it might pull down that dreadful womans insolence my dear it is not the duty of my life to mitigate feminine arrogance and to undertake such a crusade gratis i am equal to a bold stroke as you will see if your patience lastsbut never to such a vast undertaking when it comes before me in the way of business naturally i take it up but this was no business of my own and the will was proved and assets called in for the old rogue did not owe one penny well i went again and this time i got hold of the right man miranda i hear the bell the new officebell the successor to the one that succumbed to russel overshute rang as hard as ring it could a special messenger was come from london and in half an hour mr luke sharp was sitting on the box of the night up mail chapter xxxv nightingales this sudden departure of mr luke sharp in the very marrow of his story left his good wife in a trying and altogether discontented state of mind she knew that she could have no more particulars until he came back again for sharp had even less faith in the post than the post of that period deserved she might have to wait for days and days with a double anxiety urging her in the first place although she felt nothing but pity for poor old mrs fermitage and would have been really sorry to hear of anything likely to vex her she could not help being desirous to know if there were any danger of a thing so sad but her second anxiety was a great deal keener being sharpened by the ever moving grit of love in the dreadful state of mind her son was in how would all this act upon him his father had been forced by some urgency of things to put on his boxcoat and make off without even time for a hurried whisper as to the residue of his tale mrs sharp felt that there might be something which her husband feared to spread before her without plenty of time to lead up to it and having for many years been visited whenever she was not quite herself with poignant doubts whether mr sharp was anchored upon scriptural principles she almost persuaded herself for the moment that he meant to put up with the loss of the money however a little reflection sufficed to clear away this sadly awful cloud of scepticism and to assure her that mr sharp however he might swerve in theory would be orthodox enough in practice to follow the straight path towards the money and then she began to think of nothing except her own beloved kit the last hurried words of her husband had beennot one word to kit or you ruin all let him groan as he likes only watch him closely i shall be back by saturday night god bless you my dear keep up your spirits i have the whiphand of the lot of them herein lay her faith and hope she never had known her husband fail when he really made up his mind to succeed and therefore in the bottom of her heart she doubted the genuine loss of grace oglander sharp had discovered and traced to their end clues of the finest gossamer when his interest led him to do so that he should be baffled and own himself to be so was beyond her experience therefore although as yet she had no more than a guess at her husbands schemes she could not help fancying after his words that they might have to do with grace oglander before she had time to think out her thoughts christopher their main subject returned from wytham wood after holding long rivalry of woe with nightingales he still carried on and wellcarried off the style of the lovelorn romeo he swung his cloak quite as well as could be expected of an englishmanwho is born to hate flyaway apparel all of which is womanish but the necessities of his position had driven him now to a very short pipe his favourite meerschaum had fallen into sorrow as terrible as his own in a highly poetical moment he had sucked it so hard that the oil arose and took him with a hot spot upon a white tongue impregnated then with a sonnet all sonnets are of the tongue and ear but kit misliked having his split up just when it was coming to the final kick therefore he gave his pipe a thump beyond such a pipes endurance and being as sensitive as himself and of equally fine material it simply refused to draw any more as long as he breathed poetry still breathing poetry he marched home with the stump of a farthing clay newly baked in the summertown road to console him now if this young man had failed of one of the triple human combinationweed and clay and firewhere and how might he have ended not only that one evening but all the rest of the evenings of his young life his appearance and manner had at first imported to any one whom he came acrossand he truly did come across them in his wide and loose march out of oxford citythat he might be sought for in a few hours time and only the inferior portion found his mother worried him so did his father so did all humanity save onewho worried him more than any or all of it put together the trees and the road and the singing of the birds and the gladness of the green world worried him luckily for himself he had bought a good box of german tinder and from ash to ash his spirit glowed slowly into a more philosophic state gradually the beauty of the trees and hedges and the sloping fields began to steal around him the warbled pleasure of the little birds made overture to his sympathy and the lustrous calm of shadowed waters spread its picture through his mind his body also responded to the influences of the time of day and the love of nature freshened into the natural love of cupboard hunger awoke in his system somewhere and spread sweet pictures in a tasteful part for a moment of supreme agony he wrestled with the coarse material instinct then turned on his heel as our novelists say and made off for his fathers kitchen his poor mother caught him the moment he came in and pulled off his hat and his operacloak and frizzled up his curls for him she seemed to think that he must have been for a journey of at least a hundred leagues that the fault of his going was hers and the virtue of his ever coming back was all his own then she looked at him slyly and with some sadness and yet a considerable touch of pride by the light of a threewicked cocoacandle and feeling quite sure that she had him to herself trembled at the boldness of the shot she made oh kit why have you never told me i have found it all out you have fallen in love christopher fermitage sharp esquireas he always entitled himself upon the collar of spaniel or terrierhad nothing to say for a moment but softly withdrew to have his blush in shadow of all the world best he loved his motherbefore or after somebody elseand his simple unpractised and uncored heart was shy of the job it was carrying on therefore he turned from his mothers face and her eager eyes and expectant arms come and tell me my darling she whispered trying to get a good look at his reluctant eyes and wholly oblivious of her promise to his father i will not be angry at all kit although you never should have left me to find it out in this way there is nothing to find out he answered making a turn towards the kitchen stairs i just want my supper if there is anything to eat to eat kit and i thought so much better of you after all i must have been quite wrong what a shame to invent such stories you must have invented them yourself dear mother said kit with recovered bravery let me hear it all out when i have had my supper i will go down this moment and see what there is replied his good mother eagerly is there anything now that can coax your appetite yes mother oysters will be over tomorrow i should like two dozen fried with butter and a pound and a quarter of rumpsteak cut thick and not overdone you shall have them my darling in twenty minutes now be sure that you put your fur slippers on i saw quite a fog coming over port meadow as much as half an hour ago this is the worst time of year to take cold a may cold is a thirtyday cold what a stupe i must be she continued to herself to imagine that the boy could be in love i will take care to say not another word or i might break my promise to his father what a pity he has a noble moustache coming and only his mother to admire it in spite of all disappointment this good mother paid the warmest heed to the ordering ay and the cooking of the supper of her only child a juicier steak never sat on a gridiron fatter oysters never frizzled with the pure bubble of goodness kit sat up and made short work of all that came before him now mother what is it you want to say his tone was not defiant but nicely selfpossessed and softly rich with triumph of digestion and a silver tankard of morels ale helped him to express himself my dear boy i have nothing to say except that you have lifted a great weight off my mind a very great weight beyond description by leaving behind you not even a trace of the existence of that fine rumpsteak chapter xxxvi may morn it was the morn when the tall and shapely tower of magdalen is crowned with a fillet of shining white awaiting the first step of sunrise once a year for generations this has been the sign of iteager eyes and gaping mouths little knuckles blue with cold and clumsy little feet inclined to slide upon the slippery lead all are bound to keep together for the radiant moment all are a little elated at their height above all other boys all have a strong idea that the sun when he comes will be full of them and every one of them longs to be back beneath his mothers blankets it is a tradition with this choir handed or chanted down from very ancient choral ancestry that the sun never rises on mayday without iced dew to glance upon scientific record here comes in to prop tradition the icy saints may be going by but they leave their breath behind them and the poets who have sent forth their maids to gather the dews of may knew and meant that dew must freeze to stand that operation but though the sky was bright and the dew lay sparkling for the maidens the frost on this particular morning was not so keen as usual the trees that took the early light more chaste without the yellow ray glistened rather with soft moisture than with stiff encrustment and sprays that kept their sally into fickle air half latent showing only little scolloped crinkles with a knob in them held in every downy quillet liquid rather than solid gem christopher sharp looking none the worse for his excellent supper of last night laid his fattish elbow on the parapet of the bridge and mused poetical feeling had fetched him out thus early in the morning to hear the choir salute the sun and to be moved with sympathy the moon is the proper deity of all true lovers and has them under good command when she pleases but for half the weeks of a month she declines to sit in the court of lunacy at least as regards this earth having her own men and women to attend to this young man knew that she could not be found with a view to meditation now and his mind relapsed to the suna coarse power poetical only when he sets and rises with strength and command of the work of men and leaving their dreams to his sister the sun leaped up with a shake of his brow and a scattering of the dewclouds the gates of the east swung right and left so that tall trees on a hill seemed less than reeds in the rush of glory and lines like the spread of a crystal fan trembled along the lowland inlets now and lanes of vision scarcely opened yesterday and closed perhaps tomorrow guided shafts of light along the level widening ways they love tree and tower hill and wall and water and broad meadow stood or lay or leaned according to the stamp set on them one and all receiving sharing and rejoicing in the day between the battlements and above them burst and rose the choral hymn and as the laws of sound compelled it to go upward mainly the part that came down was pleasing christopher seeing but little of the boys and not hearing very much was almost enabled to regard the whole as a vocal effort of the angels and thus in solemn thought he wandered as far as the hightolled turnpike gate i will hie me to cowley said he to himself instead of turning back again there will i probe the hidden import of impending destiny this long and dark suspense is more than can be brooked by human power i know a jolly gipsywoman and if i went home i should have to wait three hours for my breakfast with these words he felt in the pockets of his coat to be sure that oracular cash was there and found a silk purse with more money than usual stored for the purchase of a dog called pablo a hero among badgers what is pablo to me or i to pablo he muttered with a smothered sigh she told me she thought it a cruel and cowardly thing to kill fifty rats in five minutes never morealas never more with a resolute step but a clouded brow he buttoned his coat and strode onward now if he had been in a fit state of mind for looking about him he might have found a thousand things worth looking at but none of them in his present hurry won from him either glimpse or thought he trudged along the broad london road at a good brisk rate while the sun glanced over the highlands and the dewy ridges away on the left towards shotover the noble city behind him stretched its rising sweep of tower and spire and dome and serried battlement stately among ancient trees and rich with more than mere external glory to an englishman and away to the right hand sloped broad meadows green with spring and fluttered with the pearly hyaline of dew lifting pillars of dark willow in the distance where the isis ran but what are these things to a lover unless they hit the moments mood the fair unfenced freelandscaped road for him might just as well have been wattled like a skittlealley and roofed with croggons patent felt at certainor rather uncertainmoments he might have rejoiced in the wide glad heart of nature spread to welcome him and must have felt as lovers feel the ravishment of beauty it happened however that his eyes were open to nothing above or around or before him unless it should present itself in the image of a gipsys tent he turned to the left before the road entered the new enclosures towards iffley and trod his own track towards cowley marsh the crisp dew brushed by his hasty feet ran into large globes behind him and jerks of dust brought up by pressure fell and curdled on them in the haze of the morning he looked much larger than he had any right to seem and the shadow of his arms and hat stretched into hollow places there was no other moving figure to be seen except from time to time of a creature the colonist of commons whose mental frame was not so unlike his own just now as bodily form and style of walking might in misty grandeur seem though kit was not such a stupid fellow when free from his present bewitchment scant of patience he came to a place where the elbow of a hedge jutted forth upon the common a mighty hedge of beetling brows and overhanging shagginess and shelfy curves and brambly depths and true devonian amplitude high farming would have swept it down and out of its long course ploughed an acre young sharp had not traced its windings far before he came upon a tidylooking tent pitched with the judgment of experience in a snug and sheltered spot the rest of the camp might be seen in the distance glistening in the sunrise this tent seemed to have crept away for the sake of peace and privacy christopher quickened his steps expecting to be met by a host of children rushing forth with outstretched hands and shaggy hair and wild black eyes but there was not so much as a child to be seen nor the curling smoke of a hedgetrough fire nor even the scattered ash betokening cookery of the night before the canvas of the tent was down no head peeped forth no naked leg or grimy foot protruded to show that the inner world was sleeping even the dog so rarely absent seemed to be really absent now the young man knew that the tent was not very likely to be unoccupied but naturally he did not like to peep into it uninvited and he turned away to visit the chief community of rovers when the sound of a low soft moan recalled him still for a moment he hesitated until he heard the like sound again low and clear and musical from the deepest chords of sorrow kit felt sure that it must be a woman in storms of trouble helpless and full as he was of his own affairs he was impelled to interfere so he lifted back the canvas drawn across the opening and looked in there lay a woman on the sandy ground with her back turned towards the light her neck and shoulders a little raised by the short support of one elbow and her head and all that therein was fixed in a rigour of gazing although her face was not to be seen and the hopeless moan of her wail had ceased kit sharp knew that he was in the presence of a grand and longabiding woe he drew back and he tried to make out what it was and he sighed for concerteven as a young dog whimpers to a mother who has lost her pupsand little as he knew of women from his own mother or whether or no he judged that this woman had lost a child that it was her only one was more than he could tell or guess the woman disturbed by the change of light turned round and steadily gazed at him or rather at the opening which he filled for her eyes had no perception of him kit was so scared that he jerked his head back and nearly knocked his hat off he never had seen such a thing before and if he had his choice he never would see such a thing again the great dark hollow eyes had lost similitude of human eyes hope and fear and thought were gone nothing remained but desolation and bare reckless misery christophers gaze fell under hers it would be a sheer impertinence to lay his small troubles before such woe what is it oh what is it asked the woman at last having some idea that somebody was near her i am very sorry i assure you maam that i never felt more sorry in all my life said kit who was a very kindhearted fellow and had now espied a small boy lying dead i give you my word of honour maam that if i could have guessed it i would never have looked in without any answer the gipsywoman turned again to her dead child and took two little hands in hers and rubbed them and sat up imagining that she felt some sign of life she drew the little body to her breast and laid the face to hers and breathed into pale open lips scarcely fallen into death and lifted little eyelids with her tongue and would not be convinced that no light came from under them and then she rubbed again at every place where any warmth or polish of the skin yet lingered she fancied that she felt the little fellow coming back to her and she kept the whole of her own body moving to encourage him there was nothing to encourage he had breathed his latest breath his mother might go on with kisses friction and caresses with every power she possessed of muscle and lungs and brain and heart there he lay as dead as a stoneone stone more on the earth and the whole earth could not bring him back again cinnaminta bowed her head she laid the little bit of all she ever loved upon her lap and fetched the small arms so that she could hold them both together and spread the careless face upon the breast where once it had felt its way and then she looked up in search of kit or any one to say something to it is a just thing i have earned it i have robbed an old man of his only child and i am robbed of mine these words she spoke not in her own language but in plain good english and then she lay down in her quiet scoop of sand and folded her little boy in with her christopher saw that there was nothing to be done he cared to go no further in search of fortunetellers and being too young to dare to offer worthless consolation he wisely resolved to go home and have fried bacon wherein he succeeded chapter xxxvii mayday ere yet it was noon of that same day to the great delight of mrs sharp a strong desire to fish arose in the candid bosom of christopher mother he said i shall have a bit of early grub and take my rod and try whether i cant manage to bring you a few perch home for supper or if the perch are not taking yet i may have a chance of a trout or two oh that will be delightful kit we can dine whenever we please you know as your dear father is from home we will have the cold lamb at one oclock i can easily make my dinner then and then kit if you are very good what do you think i will try to do such a treat as you hardly ever had what motherwhat i must be off to get my tackle ready my dear i will send to mr squeaker smith and order a nice light vehicle with a very steady pony and kit i will put on my very worst cloak and a bonnet not worth sixpence and stout indiarubber overshoes and so you shall drive me wherever you please and i will see you catch all the fish and you will enjoy every fish twice as much because your dear mother is looking at you i will bring some sandwiches my pet and your fathers flask of sherry and we can stay out till it is quite dark why kit you dont look pleased about it mother how can i be pleased to hear you speak of such things at this time of year the spring is scarcely beginning yet and the edges of the water are all swampy you would be up to your knees in no time in the most horrible yellow slime i should be most delighted to have your company my dearest mother but it will not do very well kit you know best but at least i can have the ride with you and wait somewhere while you go fishing if i were going anywhere else perhaps we might have contrived it so but while the wind stays in its present quarter it is worse than useless to think of fishing except in the most outlandish places there would not be even a publichouse if you could stop at such a place within miles of the water i am going to and the roads are beyond conception no wheels can get along them except in the very height of summer or a dry blackfrost my dear mother i am truly grieved to lose your company but i must ride the old cob sam and tie him to a tree or gate and over and over again you have told me how long you have been waiting for the chance of a good long afternoon to do a little shopping and the london fashions for the summer season arrived by the coach only yesterday did they indeed are you sure of that well kit i would rather have come with you than seen the whole world of fashions although you can judge and a lady cannot but i do not care about that my dear if only you enjoy yourself ring the bell my darling and i will see about your dinner kits heart burned within him sadly and his cheeks kept it well in countenance as the shocking fraud thus practised by him upon his good unselfish mother however there was no help for it and after all mothers must be made to be cheated or why do they love it so thus wellbalanced with his conscience kit put all his smartest clothes on as soon as the early dinner was done and he felt quite sure in his own mind that his mother was safely embarked upon her grand expedition of shopping he saw her as clean as possible off the premises and round the utmost corner of the lane and then he waited for a minute and a half to be sure that she had not forgotten her purse or something else most essential at last he became sure as sure could be that his admirable mother must now be sitting on a high chair in a fashionable shop and with that he ran up to his own room and kicked off his everyday breeches and with great caution and vast study drew a brandnew pair of noble pantaloons with a military stripe up his wellnourished and established legs he gazed at the result and found that on the whole it was not bad and then he put on his best velvet waistcoat of a chaste sprigpattern not too gaudy a waterfall tie with a turquoise pin and a cutaway coat of a soft bottlegreen completed him for the eyes of the public andfor which he cared far morecertain especially private eyes christopher feeling himself thus attired and receiving the silent approval of his glass stole downstairs in a very clever way and took from his own private cupboard a whip of white pellucid whalebone silvermounted and set with a large and radiant cairngorm pebble his mother had given him this on his very last birthday and he had never used it wisely fearing to be laughed at but now he tucked it under his arm and swaggering as he had seen hussars do turned into a passage leading to his private outlet hugging himself upon all his skill and feeling assured of grand success kit allowed his heels to clank and carried his head with an arrogant twist and so near a window where good light came in large quantity from the garden he marched into his mothers arms kit cried his mother and he said yes being unable to deny that truth his mother looked at him and his jaunty whip and particularly lively suit of clothes and she knew that he had been telling lies to her by the hundred or the bushel and she would have been very glad to scorn him if she could have helped being proud of him kit was unable to carry on any more in the way of falsehood he tried to look fierce but his mother laughed and he saw that he must knock under my dear boy she said for the moment daring to follow up her triumph is this the costume in which you go forth to fish in the most outlandish places with the yellow ooze above your knees and is that your fishingrod oh kitcome kit now you are caught at last my dear mother i have told you stories but i will leave off at last now there is not one instant to explain i have not so much as a moment to spare if you only could guess how important it is you would draw in your cloak in a moment you never shall know another single word unless you have the manners mother to pull in your cloak and let me go by kit you may go when you look at me like that you may as well do anything you have gone by your mother for ever so long or at any rate gone away from her with these words mrs sharp made way for her son to pass her and kit in a reckless manner was going to take advantage of it then he turned back his face to say goodbye and his mothers eyes were away from him she could not look at him because she knew that her look would pain him but she held out her hand and he took it and kissed it and then he made off as hard as he could go mrs sharp turned back and showed some hankering to run after him and then she remembered what a laugh would arise in cross duck lane to see such sport and so she sighed a heavy sighknowing how long she must have to waitand retired to her own thoughtful corner with no heart left for shopping but kit saw that now it was neck or nothing with best foot foremost he made his way through back lanes leading towards the conscientious obscurity of worcester collegefor beaumont street still abode in the futureand skirting the coasts of jericho dangerously hospitable he emerged at last in broad st giles without a stone to prate of his whereabouts here he went into livery stables where he was well known and found the cob sam at his service for no university man would ride him even upon hobsons choice because of his ignominious aspect but kit knew his value and his lasting powers and sagacious gratitude and whenever he wanted a horse trustworthy in patience obedience and wit he always took brown sam to sam it was a treat to carry kit because of the victuals ordered at almost every lenient stage and the grand largesse of oats and beans was more than he could get for a week in stable and so he set forth with a spirited neigh on the kidlington road to cross the cherwell and make his way towards weston the heart of christopher burned within him whenever he thought of his mother but a man is a man for all that and cannot be tied to apronstrings so kit shook his whip and the cairngorm flashed in the sun and the spirit of youth did the same he was certain to see the sweet maid today knowing her manners and customs and when she was ordered forth for her mossy walk upon the margin of the wood the soft sun hung in the light of the wood as if he were guided by the breeze and air and gentle warmth flowed through the alleys where the nesting pheasant ran little fluttering timid things that meant to be leaves please god some day but had been baffled and beaten about so that their faith was shrunk to hope little rifts of cover also keeping beauty coiled inside and ready to open like a bivalve shell to the pulse of the summertide and then to be sweet blossom and the ground below them pressing upward with ambition of young green and the sky above them spread with liquid blue behind white pillows but these things are not well to be seen without just entering into the wood and in doing so there can be no harm with the light so inviting and the way so clear grace had a little idea that perhaps she had better stop outside the wood but still that walk was within her bounds and her orders were to take exercise and she saw some very pretty flowers there and if they would not come to her she had nothing to do but to go to them still she ought to have known that now things had changed from what they were as little as a week ago that a dotted veil of innumerable buds would hang between her and the good miss patch while many forward trees were casting quite a shade of mystery nevertheless she had no fear if anybody did come near her it would only be somebody thoroughly afraid of her for now she knew and was proud to know that kit was the prey of her bow and spear whether she cared for him or not was a wholly different question but in her dismal dullness and long wearisome seclusion the finest possible chance was offered for any young gentleman to meet her and make acquaintance of natures doing at first she had kept this to herself in dread of conceit and vanity but when it outgrew accident she told aunt patch the whole affair and asked what she was to do about it thereupon she was told to avoid the snares of childish vanity to look at the back of her lookingglass and never dare to dream again that any one could be drawn by her her young mind had been eased by this although with a good deal of pain about it and it made her more venturesome to discover whether the whole of that superior estimate of herself was true whether she was so entirely vain or stupid whenever she looked at herself and whether it was so utterly and bitterly impossible that anybody should comeas he saidmiles and miles for the simple pleasure of looking for one or two minutes at herself grace was quite certain that she had no desire to meet anybody when she went into the wood she hoped to be spared any trial of that sort she had been told on the highest authority that nobody could come looking after herthe assertion was less flattering perhaps than reassuring and to test its truth she went a little further than she meant to go suddenly at a corner where the whole of the ground fell downward and grass was overhanging grass so early in the season and sapling shoots from the selfsame stool stood a yard above each other and down in the hollow a little brook sang of its stony troubles to the whispering reedshere grace oglander happened to meet a very fine young man indeed the astonishment of these two might be seen at a moments glance to be mutual the maiden by gift of nature was the first to express it with dress and hand and eye she showed a warm eagerness to retire yet waited half a moment for the sake of proper dignity kit looked at her with a clear intuition that now was his chance of chances to make certainsure of her if he could only now be strong and take her consent for granted and so induce her to set seal to it she never would withdraw and the two might settle the rest at their leisure he loved the young lady with all his heart and beyond that he knew nothing of her except that she was worthy but she had not given her heart as yet and with natural female common sense she would like to know a great deal more about him before she said too much to him also in her mindif not in her heartthere was a clearer likeness of a very different mana man who was a man in earnest and walked with a stronger and firmer step and lurked behind no corners this path is so extremely narrow miss oglander said with a very pretty blush and the ground is so steep that i fear i must put you to some little inconvenience but if i hold carefully by this branch perhaps there will be room for you to pass you are most kind and considerate he answered as if he were in peril of a precipice but i would not for the world give you such trouble and i dont want to go any further now it cannot matter in the least i do assure you but surely you must have been going somewhere you are most polite but i cannot think for one moment of turning you back like this then may i sit down i feel a little tired and the weather has suddenly become so warm dont you think it is very trying to people who are not very strong perhaps it is but surely it ought not to be so to you well i must not put all the blame upon the weather there are so many other things much worse if i could only tell you oh i am so very sorry mr sharp i had no idea you had such troubles it must be so sad for you while you are so young yes i suppose many people call me young and perhaps to the outward eye i am so but no one except myself can dream of the anxieties that prey upon me christopher by this time was growing very crafty as the above speech of his will show the paternal gift was awaking within him but softened by maternal goodness so that it was not likely to be used with much severity and now at the end of his speech he sighed and without any thought laid his right hand on the rich heart of his velvet waistcoat where beautiful forgetmenots were blooming out of willow leaves then grace could not help thinking how that troubleworn right hand had been uplifted in her cause and had descended on the rabbitman and although she was most anxious to discourage the present vein of thought she could not suppress one little sighsweeter music to the ear of kit than ever had been played or dreamed now would you really like to knowyou are so wonderfully good he continued with his eyes cast down and every possible appearance of excessive misery would you i mean do your best not only not to be offended but to pity and forgive me if or rather supposing that i were to endeavour to explain whatwhat it is whowho she isno no i do not quite mean that i scarcely know how to express myself things are too many for me oh but you must not allow them to be so mr sharp indeed you mustnt i am sure that you must have a very good mother from what you told me the other day and if you have done any harm though i scarcely can think such a thing of you the best and most straightforward course is to go and tell your mother everything and then it is so nice afterwards yes to be sure how wise you are you seem to know almost everything i never saw any one like you at all but the fact is that i am a little too old i am obliged now to steer my own course in life my mother is as good as gold and much better but she never could understand my feelings then come in and tell my dear old aunt patch she is so virtuous and she always never doubts about anything she sees the right thing to be done in a moment and she never listens to arguments if you will only come in and see her it might be such a relief to you you seem to mistake me altogether cried the young man with his patience gone what good could any old aunts do to me surely you know who it is that i want how can i imagine that why you only you only you sweet grace i should like to see the whole earth swallowed up if only you and i were left together grace oglander blushed at the power of his words and the pressure of his hand on hers then having plenty of her fathers spirit she fixed her bright sensible eyes on his face so that he saw that he had better stop i am afraid that it is no good he said i am very much obliged to you answered grace with her fair cheeks full of colour and her hands drawn carefully back to her sides but will you be kind enough to stand up and let me speak for a moment i believe that you are very good and i may say very harmless and you have helped me in the very kindest way and i never shall forget your goodness ever since you came i am sure i have been glad to think of you and your dogs and your gun and your fishingrod reminded me of my father and i am very very sorry that what you have just said will prevent me from thinking any more about you or coming anywhere into any kind of places where there are trees like this again i ought to have done itat least i mean i never ought to have done it at all but i did think that you were so nice and now you have undeceived me i know who your father is very well although i have seldom seen him and though i dislike the law i declare that would not have mattered very much to me but you do not even know my name as several times you have proved to me and how you can ride thirty miles from oxford in all sorts of weather without being tired and your dogs so fresh has always been a puzzle to me thirty miles from oxford christopher sharp cried in great amazement for in the very lowest condition of the heart figures will maintain themselves yes thirty miles or thirty leagues sometimes i hear one thing and sometimes the other where you are standing now is about seven miles and threequarters from summertown gate surely mr sharp you are laughing at me how far am i from beckley then according to your calculation how did you ever hear of beckley it is quite a little village a miserable little place indeed then it is not it is the very finest place in all the world or at any rate the nicest and the dearest and the prettiest but how can you just come from america have such an opinion of such a little hole a little hole why it stands on a hill you never can have been near it if you think of calling it a hole and as for my coming from america you seem to have no geography i have never been further away from darling beckley to my knowledge than i am now kit sharp looked at her with greater amazement than that with which she looked at him and then with one accord they spied a fat man coming along the hollow and trying not to glance at them with keen young instinct they knew that this villain was purely intent upon watching them come again if you please tomorrow said grace while pretending to gaze at the clouds you have told me such things that i never shall sleep come earlier and wait for me not that you must think anything only that now you are bound as a gentleman to go on with what you were telling me chapter xxxviii the dignity of the family if grace had only stayed five minutes longer in the place where she was when the fat man came in sight her eyes and heart would have been delighted by the appearance of a true old friend but she felt so much terror of that stout person who always seemed to be watching her afar that in spite of the extraordinary interest aroused by some of her companions words as well as by his manner she could not help running away abruptly and taking shelter in the little bowered cottage meanwhile the stout man in the white frock coat slouched along the furzy valley with a clownish step he carried a long pigwhip and now and then indulged in a crack or flick at some imaginary pig while a crafty grin or a wink of one little eye enlivened his heavy countenance he was clearly aware of all that had been happening in the wood above him for the buds as yet rather served to guide the lines of sight than to baffle them but he showed no desire to interfere for instead of taking the crosspath which would have brought him face to face with kit he kept down the glade towards the timbertrack which led in another direction by the side of the little brook he turned the corner of a thick hollybush and suddenly met his brother master zacchary cripps the carrier the carrier was in no pleasant mood his eyes were stern and steadfast and the colour of his healthy cheeks was deepened into crimson he bore with a bent arm and set muscle the sceptral whip of the family bound with spiral brass and newly fitted with a heavy lash moreover he had come with his sunday hat on and his air and walk were menacing leviticus started and turned pale and his cunning eyes glanced for a chance of escape thou goest not hence brother tickuss said cripps until thou hast answered what i shall ax and answered with thine eyes on mine ax away said the pigman sprawling out his fat legs as if he did not care ax away so long as it be of thy own consarns it is of my own consarns to keep my fathers sons from being rogues and liars and getting into oxford jail and into the hands of the hangman leviticus trembled with fear more than anger thou always was foulmouthed he muttered it is a lie shouted zacchary as big a lie as ever thou spakst i always were that clean of tongueno odds for that now wilt answer me or will not thou liedst to me in oxford streets the last time as i spake to thee well well maybe a small piece i did but nothing to lay hold on much brother zak thou must not be so hard what man can be always arkerate a man can spake the truth if he goeth to try or else a must be a fule and tickuss thou wast always more rogue than fule and now here am i to ax thee spashal what roguery thou beest up to now whom hast thou got at the cottage in the wood thoud best way go up there and see for thyzell a old lady from amerikay as wanteth to retaire frout the world wont her zend thee arunning down the hill ah and id like to see thee zak herd lay thy own whip about thee and her tongue be worse nor a dozen whips really while tickuss was telling this lie he managed to look at his brother so firmly in the rally of impudence brought to bay that zak for the moment in spite of all experience believed him and the carrier dreadedas the lord of swine knew wellnothing so much as a fierce womans tongue what be the reason then he went on still keeping his eyes on the face of tickuss that thou hast been keeping thyself and thy pigs out o market and even thy waife and children to home same as if em had gotten the plague and what be the reason leviticus cripps that thou fearest to go to a wholesome publichouse and have thy pint of ale and see thy neighbours as behooveth a godfearing man to my mind either thou art gone daft and the woman should take the lead o thee or else thou art screwed out of honest ways the carrier now looked at his brother with more of pity than suspicion tickuss had always been regarded as the weak member of the family because he laid on more fat than muscle even in the time of most active growth and to keep him regularly straight was more than all the set efforts of the brotherhood could even when he was young effect therefore zak stood back some little and the butt of his whip fell down to earth leviticus saw his chance and seized it consarning of goin to publichouse i would never be too particular a man may do it or a man may not according to manner of his things at home or his own little brew or the temper of his wife i would not blame him nor yet praise him for things as he knoweth best about to make light of a man for not going to public is the same as to blame him for stopping from church a man as careth for good opinion goeth to both but a cannot always do it and i aint a been in church now for more nor a week of sundays the force of this reasoning came home to cripps if a man was unable to go to church there was good room for arguing that his duty towards the publichouse must not be too rigidly exacted zacchary therefore fetched a sigh none of the race had broken up at so early an age as that of tickuss but still from his own sad experience the carrier knew what pigs were and he thought that his brother though younger than himself might be called away before him tickuss he said i may a been too hard nobody knows but them that has to do it what the worrit of the roads is i may a said a word here and there too much and a bit outside the gospel according to they a man must believe a liar and forgive un and forgive un over and over again the same as i tries to forgive you tickuss zacchary offered his hand to his brother but leviticus was ashamed to take it with the load now weighing upon his mind and the sense in his heart of what zacchary was tickusswhatever his roguery wascould not make believe to have none of it so he turned away with his feelings hurt too much for the clasp fraternal when a man hath no more respect for hiszell he muttered over his puckered shoulder and no more respect for his father and mother avore un than to call his very next brother but one a rogue and a liar and a schemer against publics to my mind he have gone too far and not shown the manners relied upon very well replied cripps just as you like tickuss though i never did hear as i were short of manners and theres twelve mailes of road as knows better than that now since you go on like that and there seemeth no chance of supper long of ee i shall just walk up to cottage and ax any orders for the carrier good evening brother tickuss with these words zak set off and tickuss repented sadly of the evil temper which had forbidden him to shake hands but now to oppose the carriers purpose would be a little too suspicious he must go his way and take his chance he was worse than a pig when his mind was made up go thy way and be danged to thee thought leviticus looking after him little thou wilt take however but to knock thy thick head again a wall old lady looketh out too sharp for any of they danged old beckley carcases come thee down to our ouze he shouted in irony after his brother and tell us the noos thou hast picked up and what em be doing in amerikay a vine time o life for thee to turn spy it was lucky for him that he made off briskly among thick brushwood and tangled swamps for zacchary cripps at the last word turned round with his face of a fine plumcolour and a stamp of rage which made his stiff knees tingle worse than a dozen turnpikes spy didst thou say he shouted staring with his honest wrathful eyes through every glimpse of thicket near the spot where his brother had disappearedspy if thou beest a man come out and say it again to the face of me ill show thee how to spell spy pretty quick leviticus cripps thou art a coward to the back of a thief and a sneaking skulk unless thou comest out of they thick places to stand to the word thou hast spoken zacchary stood in a wide bay of copse and he knew that his voice went through the wood for he spoke with the whole power of his lungs and the tender leaves above him quivered like a little breath of fringe and the birds flew out of their ivy castles and a piece of barefaced rock in the distance answered himbut nothing else thou art a bigger man than i be shouted the carrier being carried beyond himself by the state of things come out if thou art a man and hast any blood of cripps in thee but this appeal received no answer except from the quiet rock again and a peaceful thrush sitting over his nest and well accustomed to the woodmans call zacchary had always felt scorn of tickuss but now he almost disdained himself for springing of one wedlock with him he stood in the place where he must be seen if tickuss wished to see him until he was quite sure that no such longing existed on his brothers part then the family seemed to be lowered so by this behaviour of a leading member that when the carrier moved his legs he had not the spirit to crack his whip what shall us do whatever shall us do he said to himself more reasonably with the anger dying out of his kind blue eyes a hath insulted of me but a hath a big family of little uns to kape up i harnt had no knowledge how that zort o thing may drive a man out of his proper ways like enough it maketh them careful to tell lies and shun the thrashing taking this view of the case master cripps turned away from the path towards his brothers house to which in the flush of first anger he meant to go and there to wait for him and being rather slow of resolution he naturally set forth again on the track of the one last interrupted he would go to this cottage in the wood of which he had heard through one of his washerwomenthough none of them had any washing thenceand then he would satisfy his own mind concerning an ugly rumour which had unsettled that mind since tuesday for in his own hearing it had been saidby a woman it is true but still a woman who came of a truthful family and was married now into the likethat master leviticus cripps was harbouring pirates and conspirators believed to have come from america in a little place out of the way of all honest people where the deaf old woman was nobody ever had leave to the house never a butcher nor baker nor teagrocer nor a milkman nor even a respectable washerwomanthere was nothing except a great dog to rush out and bite without even barking zacchary had no easy task to find the little cottage of which he had heard for it lay well back from all thoroughfares and so embedded among ivied trees that he passed and repassed several times before he descried it and even then he would not have done so if it had not chanced that miss patch who loved good things when she could get them was about to dine on a juicy roaster supplied by the wary leviticus grace herself had prepared the currant sauce before she went forth for her daily walk and deaf old margery daw was stooping over the fierce wood fire on the ground and basting with a short iron spoon the double result was a wreath of blue smoke rising from the crooked chimney and a very rich odour streaming forth from door and window on the vernal air the eyes and the nose of the carrier at once presented him with clear impressions amerikayans understands good living giving utterance to this profound and incontrovertible reflection cripps came to a halt and sagely considered the situation the first thing he asked as usual washow would the law of the land lie here was a lonely unprotected cottage inhabited by an elderly foreign lady who especially sought retirement had he any legal right to insist on knowing who she was and all about her would he not rather be a trespasser and liable to a fine and perhaps the jail if he forced himself in without invitation and wilfully against the inhabitants wish and even if that came to nothingas it mightcould he say that it was a manly and straightforward action on his part he had no enemy that he knew of unless it was black george the poacher but there were always plenty of people ready to say illnatured things about a prosperous neighbour and like enough they would set it afoot that he had gone spying on a helpless lady because she had never employed him and then his brothers reproach which had so fiercely aroused him came back to his mind neither was it wholly absent from his thoughts that a great dog was said to reside on these premises whose manner was the peculiarly unattractive one of rushing out to bite without a bark the carrier had suffered in his time from dogs as was natural to his calling and although his flesh was so wholesome that the result had never been serious he was conscious of a definite desire to defer all increase of experience in that line spy he exclaimed as he sat down rather to rest his stiff knee than to watch the hut that never hath been said of me and never shall without a lie but one on em might come out mayhap and give me some zatisfaction before his words were cool miss patch herself appeared in the doorway she saw not cripps who had happened to put himself in a knowing corner and being in a quietly savage mood from desire of pig and dread that stupid old margery was murdering pig by revolving him too near the fire she cast such a glance at the young leaves around her as seemed enough to nip them in the bud then she threw away something with a scornful sweep and cripps believed almost every word his brother had been saying ill be blessed if i dont scuttle off he said to himself and the moss he was sitting on in my time i have a seen all zorts of womans but none to come nigh this sample as be come over from amerikay sarveth me right for cooriosity amend me if ever i come anigh of any amerikayans again chapter xxxix a tombstone are there any who do not quicken to the impulse of young life lifted free of long repression and the dread of dull relapse can we find a man or woman holding almost any age able to come out and meet the challenge of the sun conveyed in cartel of white clouds of may and yet to stick to private sense of sulky wrongs and brooding hate if we could find such a man or woman by great waste of labour in a search ungracious and if it should seem worth while to attempt to cure the case scarcely anything could be thought of leading more directly towards the end in view than to fetch that person and plant him or her without a word of explanation among the flowerbeds on the little lawn of beckley barton the flowers themselves and their open eyes and the sparkling smile of the grass and the untold commerce of the freighted bees and rich voluntaries of thrush and blackbird ruffled to the throat with song and over the whole the soft flow of sunshine like a vast pervasive river of gold with silver wave of cloudswho could dwell on petty aches and pains among such grandeur the old squire sat in his bowerchair with a warm cloak over his shoulders his age was threescore and ten this day and he looked back through the length of years and marvelled at their fleeting the stirring times of his youth and the daily perils of his prime of life the long hard battle and the slow promotionbecause he had given offence by some projection of honest opinionthe heavy disappointment and the forced retirement from the army when the wars were over with only the rank of major which he preferred to sink in squirebecause he ought to have been according to his own view of the matter a good lieutenantgeneraland then a very short golden age of five years and a quarter from his weddingday to the death of his wife a single and sweethearted wifeand after that as sorrow sank into the soothing breast of time the soft and gentle and undreamedof step of comfort coming almost faster than was welcome while his little daughter grew after that the old man tried to think no more but be content to let the little scenes of dancing and of asking and of listening and of looking puzzled and of waiting to know truly whether all was earnestbecause already childhood had suspicion that there might be things intended to delude itand of raising from the level of papas wellbuttoned pocket clear bright eyes that did not know a guinea from a halfpenny and then with the very extraordinary spring from the elasticity of red calves which happily departs right early the jumping into opened arms and the laying on of little lips and the murmurs of delighted loveto let his recollections of all these die out and to do without them was this old mans business now for he had been convinced at laststrange as it may seem until we call to mind how the strongest convictions are produced by the weakest logicat last he could no longer hope to see his grace again because he had beheld her tombstone having made up his mind to go to church that very sunday morning in spite of all widow hookham could do to stop him he had spied a new stone in the graveyard corner sacred to the family of oglander the old man went up to see what it was and nobody liked to follow him and nobody was surprised that he did not show his white head at the chanceldoor though the parson waited five minutes for him being exceeding loth to waste ten lines which he had interlarded into a sermon of thirty years back for the present sad occasion for the old squire sat on his grandfathers tombstone a tabular piece of memorial suited to an hospitable man where all his descendants might sit around and have their dinners served to them and he leaned his shaven chin on the head of his stout oak staff and he took off his hat and let his white hair fall about he fixed his still bright eyes on the tombstone of his daughter and tried to fasten his mind there also and to make out how old she was he was angry with himself for not being able to tell to a day without thinking but days and years and thoughts and doings of quiet love quite slipping by and spreading without ruffle had left him little to lay hold of as a knotted record therefore he sat with his chin on his stick and had no sense of churchtime until the choir which comprised seven crippses bellowed out an anthem which must have shaken their grandfathers in their graves unless in their time they had done the same in this great uproar and applause which always travelled for half a mile the squire had made his escape from the graveyard and then he had gone home without a word and eaten his dinner because he must when the due time came for it and now being filled with substantial faith that his household was nicely enjoying itself he was come to his bower to think and wonder and perhaps byandby to fall fast asleep but never awake to bright hope again to this relief and mild incline of gentle age his head was bowing and his white hair settling down according as the sun or wind or clouds or time of day desired when some one darkened half his light and there stood mary hookham mary had the newest of all new spring fashions on her head and breast and waist and everywhere a truly spirited girl was she as well as a very handy one and she never thought twice of a sixpence or shilling if a soiled paperpattern could be had for it and now she was busy with half a guinea kindly beginning to form its impress on her moist hardworking palm he have had a time of it she exclaimed as her master began to gaze around oh my what a time of it he have had mary i suppose you are talking of me yes i have had a bad time on the whole but many people have had far worse yes sir and will you see one who hath as fine a young gentleman as ever lived so ready to speak up for everybody and walking like a statute it give me such a turn i do believe you never would know him sir without his name come in with him squire overshute sir if you please requesteth the honour of seeing of you mary i am hardly fit for it i was doing my best to sit quite quiet and to try to think of things i am not as i was yesterday or even as i was this morning but if i ought to see himwhy i will and perhaps i ought no doubt when i come to think of things the poor young man has been very ill to be sure i remember all about it show him where i am at once what a sad thing for his mother his mother is a wonderful clever woman of the soundest views in politics his mother be dead sir i had better tell you for fear of begetting any trifles with him although we was told to keep such things from you howsomever i do think he be coming to himself or he would not have fallen out of patience as a hath done and now here he be sir russel overshute narrowed and flattened into half of his proper size and heightened thereby to unnatural staturefor stoop he would not although so weakhere he was walking along the damp walk when a bed or a sofa or a drawnout chair at shotover grange was his proper place he walked with the help of a crutchhandled stick and his deep mourning dress made him look almost ghastly his eyes however were bright and steady and he made an attempt at a cheerful smile as he congratulated the squire on the great improvement of his health for that i have to thank you my dear friend answered mr oglander for weeks i had been helpless till i helped myself i mean of course by the great blessing of the lord but of your sad troubles whatever shall i say my dear sir say nothing if you pleasei cannot bear as yet to speak of them i ought to be thankful that life is spared to medoubtless for some good purpose and i think i know what that purpose is though now i am confident of nothing neither am i russel neither am i said the old man observing how low his voice was and speaking in a low sad voice himself i used to have confidence in the good will and watchful care of the almighty over all who trust in him but now there is something over therehe pointed towards the churchyardwhich shows that we may carry such ideas to a foolish point but i cannot speak of it say no more i will own replied overshute studying the squires downcast face to see how far he might venture at one time i thought that you yourself carried such notions to a foolish length that was before my illness now i most fully believe that you were quite right yes i suppose that i wasso far as duty goes and the parsons advice but as for the resultwhere is it as yet we see none but we very soon shall can you bear to hear something i want to say and to listen to it attentively i believe that i can russel there is nothing now that can disturb me very much this will disturb you my dear sir but in a very pleasant way i hope as sure as i stand and look at you here and as sure as the almighty looks down at us both that grave in beckley churchyard holds a gipsywoman and no child of yours ah i put it too abruptly as i always do but give me your arm sir and walk a few steps i am not very strong any more than you are but please god we will both get stronger as soon as our troubles begin to lift each of them took the right course to get stronger by putting forth his little strength to help and guide the others steps russel what did you say just now mr oglander asked when the pair had managed to get as far as another little bower graces own and there sat down i must have taken your meaning wrong i am not so clear as i was and often there is a noise inside my head i told you sir that i had proved for certain that your dear daughter has not been buried herenor anywhere else to my firm belief also i have found out and established to my own most bitter cost who it was that lies buried here and of what terrible disease she died as regards my own illness i would go through it againcome what might come of itfor the sake of your darling grace but alas i have lost my own dear mother through this utterly fiendish plotfor such it is i do believe this poor girl buried here was the younger sister of cinnaminta cinnaminta said the squire trying to arouse old memory surely i have heard that name but tell me all russel for gods sake tell me all and how you came to find it out and what it has to do with my lost pet my dear sir if you tremble so i shall fear to tell you another word remember it is all good so far as it goes instead of trembling you should smile and rejoice so i willso i will or at least i will try there now looki have taken a pinch of snuff you need have no fear for me after that all i know beyond what i have told you is that your gracieand my grace toowas driven off in a chaise and pair through the narrow lanes towards wheatley i have not been able to follow the track in my present helpless condition and indeed what i know i only learned this morning and i thought it my duty to come and tell you at once i had it from poor cinnamintas own lips who for a week or more had been lurking near the house to see me this morning i could not resist a little walklonely and miserable as it wasand the poor thing told me all she knew she was in the deepest affliction herself at the loss of her only surviving child and she fancied that i had saved his life before and she had deep pangs of ingratitude and of nemesis etc and hence she was driven to confess all her share which was but a little one she was tempted by the chance of getting money enough to place her child in the care of a firstrate doctor but gracemy poor gracehow was she temptedor was she forced away from me that i cannot say as yet cinnaminta had no idea she did not even see the carriage for she herself was borne off by her tribe who were quite in a panic at the fever but she heard that no violence was used and there was a lady in the chaise and poor grace went quite readily though she certainly did seem to sob a little it was no elopement mr oglander nor anything at all of that kind the poor girl believed that she was acting under your orders in all she did just as she had believed that same when she left her aunts house to meet you on the homeward road through that forged letter which most unluckily she put into her pocket there i believe i have told you all i can think of for the moment of course you will keep the whole to yourself for we have to deal with subtle brutes is there anything you would like to ask russel overshute said the squire i am not fit to go into things now i mean all the little ins and outs and you look so very ill my dear fellow i am quite ashamed of allowing you to talk come into the house and have some nourishment if any man ever wanted it you do now how did you come over well i broke a very ancient vow if there is anything i detest it is to see a young man sitting alone inside of a close carriage but we never know what we may come to i tried to get upon my horse but could not by the bye do you know hardenow not much said the squire i have seen him once or twice and i know that he is a great friend of yours he is one of the new lights is not he i am sure i dont know or care he is a wonderfully clever fellow and as true as steel and a gentleman he has heard of course of your sad trouble but only the popular account of it he does not even know of my feelingsbut i will not speak now of them you may my dear fellow with all my heart you have behaved like a true son to me and if ever a gracious providence overshute took mr oglanders hand and held it in silence for a moment he could not bear the idea of even the faintest appearance of a bargain now the squire understood and liked him all the better and waved his left hand towards the diningroom one thing more while we are alone resumed the young man much as he longed for and absolutely needed good warm victuals hardenow is a tremendous walker six miles an hour are nothing to him the flying dutchman he is called although he hasnt got a bit of calf of course i would not introduce him into this matter without your leave but may i tell him all and send him scouting while you and i are so laid upon the shelf he can go where you and i could not and nobody will suspect him and of course as regards intelligence alone he is worth a dozen of that ass john smith at any rate he would find no mares nests may i try it if so i will take on the carriage to oxford as soon as i have had a bit to eat with all my heart cried the squire whose eyes were full again of life and hope hardenow owes a debt to beckley it was cripps who got him his honours and fellowshipor at least the carrier says so and we all believe our carrier and after all whatever there is to do nobody does it like a gentleman and especially a good scholar i remember a striking passage in the syntax of the eton latin grammar i make no pretension to learning when i quote it for it hath been quoted in the house of lords perhaps you remember it my dear russel my latin has turned quite rusty squire answered overshute knowing as well as proteus what was coming the passage is thismr oglander always smote his frilled shirt in this erudition and delivered ore rotundo scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinit esse feros chapter xl let me out at about the same hour of that sunday afternoon miss patch sat alone in her little cottage stubbornly reasoning with herself she was growing rather weary of her task which had been a long and heavy one a great deal longer and a great deal heavier than she ever could have dreamed at the outset it was for the sake of the kingdom of heaven that she had laid her hand to this plough and now it seemed likely to be a plough in the sense in which that word is lightly used by undergraduates for public opinion miss patch cared nothing her view of the world was purely and precisely scriptural according to her own interpretation any line of action was especially recommended to her by the certainty that the world would condemn it she had led a life of misery with her father the gambling captain the man of fashion who made slaves of his children and being already of a narrow gauge of mind she laid herself out for theology not true religion but enough to please her and make her sure that she was always right grace being truly of a docile nature and most unsuspicious as her father was before her had implicit faith in the truth and honour of her good aunt patch she looked upon her as so devoutly pious and grandly upright that any idea of fraud on her part seemed almost profanity she believed the good lady to be acting wholly under the guidance of her own father and as his representative in which there seemed nothing either strained or strange especially as the squire had once placed his daughter in the charge of miss patch for a course of scriptural and historical reading and the first misgiving in the poor girls mind arose from what christopher sharp had told her of pining and lonely weariness weeks and weeks she had endured under the firm belief that her father was compelled to have it so and in the hope of the glorious time when he should come to take her home for all that she could see good reasonaccording to what she had been toldbut she could see no reason whatever why miss patch should have told her falsehoods as to the place in which they lived having been challenged upon this subject by her indignant niece the elderly lady now sat thinking she was as firmly convinced as ever that in all she had done she had acted strictly and purely for the glory of the lord grace a great heiress and a silly girl was at the point of being snapped up by the papists and made one of them whereupon both an immortal soul and l would be devoted to perdition of this miss patch had been thoroughly assured before she would give her help at all it was well known that russel overshute loved and would win grace oglander and that russels dearest friend was hardenow of brasenose and that hardenow was the deepest jesuit ever admitted to holy orders in the church of england therefore at heart russel overshute must be a papist of the deepest dye and anybody with half an eye could see through that conspiracy to defeat such a scheme miss patch would have promised to spend six months in a hollow tree but promise and performance are a very different pair of shoes and the lady though fed like a woodpecker on the choicest of all sylvan food even now in four months time was tiring of her martyrdom her cottage in a wood had long been growing loathsome to her the deeds of the lord she admired greatly when they were homicidal but of his large and kindly works she had no congenial liking the fluttering spread of leaves that hang like tips of empty gloves one day and after one kind night lift forth like the hand of a baby with his mind made up and the change of colour all under the trees whether the ground be grassed or naked also the delicate sliding of the light in and out the peeling wands of brushwood and flat upon the lichened stones and even in the coarsest hour of the daywhich generally is from to pm when all mankind are diningthe quiet spread and receptive width of growth that has to catch its lightfor none of these pretty little scenes did miss patch care so much as half a patch and she was sure that they gave her the rheumatism she was longing to be in london now to sit beneath the noble eloquence of preachers and orators most divine who spend the prime of the year in reviling their friends and extolling the negro whereas for weeks and weeks in this ungodly forest she had no chance of receiving any spiritual ministration save once when tickuss on a sunday morning had driven her in his pigcart to a little wesleyan chapel some three miles off at the end of a hamlet here people stared at her so and asked such questions that she durst not go again and indeed the pleasure was not worth the risk for the shoemaker who preached was a thoroughly quiet ungifted man without an evil word for anybody not only these large regrets and yearnings were thronging upon this lady now but also a small although feminine feeling of desire for support and guidance strongminded as she was and conscious of her lofty mission from time to time she grew fainthearted in that dreary solitude without the encouragement of the cool male will this for some days she had not received and she knew not why it had failed her though the afternoon was so bright with temptation the wood so rich with wonders miss patch preferred to nurse her knee by the little fire in her parlour she had always hated to be out of doors and to see too much of things which did not bear out her opinions and to lose that clear knowledge of the will of the lord which is lost by those who study him she loved to discern in everything that happened to her liking the grand and infinite potentiality of an allwise providence and if a little thing went amiss she laid all the blame to the badly principled interference of the devil while she was deeply pondering thus and warming her little teapot in ran the beautiful and lively girl who had long been growing too much for her it was not only the brighter spring of young life in this gracie and her pretty ways and nice surprises and pleasure in pleasing others and graceful turns of cookery but also her pure fount of lovingkindness which having no other way out was obliged to steal around miss patch herself although she had been illcontent with the only explanation she could get about her dwellingplaceto wit that in these roadless parts distance was very much a matter of conjecturegrace had no suspicion yet of any plot or conspiracy all things had been planned so deeply and carried out so cleverly that any such suspicion would have been contrary to her nature she had lost by some unaccountable carelessness both the note from her father which she had received at her aunt joans and also his more important letter delivered to her when she met the chaise by her kind and pious aunty patch in the first note delivered by a little boy she had simply been called forth to meet her father in the lane and to walk home with him as he wished to speak with her by herself she was not to wait to pack any of her clothes as they would be sent for afterwards and he hoped her aunt joan would excuse his deferring their little dinner for the present but when instead of meeting him she found the chaise with miss patch inside it and was invited to step in a real letter was handed to her the whole of which in the waning lightthe day being very brown and gloomyshe could not easily make out but she learned enough to see that she was to place herself under the care of miss patch and not expect to see her dear father for at least some weeks to come her hair for the reason therein given was to be cut off at once and not even kept in the carriage and the poor girl submitted with a few low sobs to the loss of her beautiful bright tresses but what were they how small and selfish of her to think twice of them in the presence of the heavy trouble threatening her dear father and the anguish of losing him for so long without even so much as a kiss of farewell for after his first brief scrawl he had found that by starting at once he could catch at falmouth the packet for demerara and thus save a fortnight in getting to his estates which were threatened with ruin if these should be lost to him gracie knew as he had no secrets from her that half his income would go at one sweepwhich for his own sake would matter little but for the sake of his darling must if possible be prevented he had no time now for another word except that he had left his house at beckley just as it stood to be let by his agent to cover the expenses of this long voyage and to get him out of two difficulties he could not have left his dear child there alone and if he could he would not have done so for a most virulent fever had long been hanging about and had now broken out hard by and dr splinters had strictly ordered the moment he heard of it that the dear childs hair should be cropped to her head and burned or cast away for nothing harboured infection as hair did with a few words of blessing and comfort and love and a promise to write from demerara and a fatherly hope that for his sake she would submit to miss patch in all things and make the most of this opportunity for completing her course of scriptural and historical reading the dear old father had signed himself her loving papa w o grace would have been a very different girl from her own frank self if she had even dreamed of suspecting the genuineness of this letter it was in her fathers crabbed and upright and queerlyjointed hand from the first line to the last for a moment indeed she had been surprised that he called himself her papa because he did not like the word and thought it a piece of the foreign stuff which had better continue to be foreign but there stood the word and in his hurry how could he stop to such trifles this letter had been lost poor grace could not imagine how because she had taken such great care of it and had slept with it under her pillow always nevertheless it had disappeared leaving tears of selfreproach in her downcast eyes as she searched the wood for it and this made her careful tenfold of the two letters she had received from georgetown but now as she came with her sunday hat on and her pretty woodstock gloves and her neat brown skirt looped up for challenge of briers and furze and dogrose and best of all with the bloom on her cheeks and the sparkle in her clear soft eyes and the may sun making glory in her rolling clouds of newgrown hairand better than best that smile of the heart filling the whole young face with lightshe really looked as if it would be impossible to say no to her aunty she began it is quite an age since you have let me have a walk at all one would think that i wanted to run away with that very smart young gentleman who possesses and exhibits that extremely lustrous ridingwhip if he has only got a horse to match itwhat is the name dear aunty of that inestimable historical jewel that somebody stole out of somebodys eye grace will you never remember anything it is now called the orloff or schaffras gem and is set in the russian sceptre then that must be the name of this gentlemans horse to enable it to go with such a whip dear aunty now even that whip will not tempt me or move me to run away from you only do please to allow me forth this horrid little garden is so shaded and sour that even a daisy cannot live but in the wood i find all things lovely may i have a run for only half an hour upon one condition replied miss patch that if you see any one you shall come back at once and let me know what even the fat man with the flapped hat and the smock on i never go out without seeing him though he never seems to see me at all he must be very shortsighted oh no my dear never mind that poor man he looks after the cattle or something what i mean is any young gentleman who ought to be at home on the sabbath day and wrestle with your natural frivolity my dear that no worldly thoughts may assault and hurt the soul upon this holy day i will do my best aunty but how can i help thinking of the things i see miss patch having less than any faith in unregenerate human nature feared that she might have been wrong in allowing even this limited freedom to grace the truth of it was that without fresh guidance from a mind far deeper than her own she could not see the right thing to do in the new complication arising the interviews between kit sharp and grace were the very thing desired and surely must have led to something good which ought to be carefully followed up and yet if she met him again she would be quite sure to go on with her questions and kit being purely outside of the plot would reply with the most inconvenient truth miss patch had written as promptly as could be to ask what she ought to do in this crisis but no answer had come through the trusty tickuss nor any wellprovided visit the christianminded lady could not tell at all what to make of it then calling to mind the sacredness of the day she dismissed the subject and sternly rebuked deaf margery daw for not keeping the kettle boiling chapter xli reason and unreason when things were in this very ticklish condition almost everywhere and even cripps himself could scarcely sleep because of rumours and dobbin in his own clean stable found the flies too many for him an exceedingly active man set out to scour the whole of the neighbourhood to the large and vigorous mind of the rev thomas hardenow the worst of all sins because the most tempting and universal was indolence hardenow never condemned a poor man for having his pint or his quart of ale with his better half to help him when he had earned it by a hard days work and had fed his children likewise hardenow thought it not easy to find any hypocrisy more bald or any morality more cheap than that or those which strut about reviling the poor man for taking in the cheaper liquid form the nourishment which his betters can afford to have in the shape of meat and then are not content with it unless it is curdled with some duly sour vintage and passing such crucial points of debate hardenow always could make allowance for any sins rather than those which spring from a treacherous sneaking and lying essence now a council was held at the grange of shotover on the monday a sad and melancholy house it was with its fine old mistress lately buried and its poor young master only half recovered the young tutor had been especially invited and having heard everything from the squire who was proud of having ridden so far yet broke down ridiculously among his boasts and from russel overshute who had thrown himself back for at least three days by excitement and exertion yesterday and also from mrs fermitage who had lately been feeling herself overlooked hardenow thought for some little time before he would give his opinion not that he was by any manner of means possessed with the greatness of his own ideas but that mrs fermitage from a low velvet chair looked up at him with such emphatic inquiry and implicit faith that he was quite in a difficulty how to speak or what to say and so he said a very few short words of sympathy and of kindness and gladly offered to do his best and obey the orders given him so far at least as his duty to his college and pupils permitted he confessed that he had thought of this matter many times before he was invited to do so and without the knowledge which he now possessed or the special interest in the subject which he now must feel for the sake of russel but mrs fermitage filled with respect for the wisdom of a fellow and tutor of a college would not let hardenow thus escape and being compelled to give his opinion he did so with his usual clearness i am not at all a man of the world he said and of the law i know nothing my friend russel is a man of the world and knows a good deal of the law as well a word from him is worth many of mine but if mrs fermitage insists upon having my crude ideas they are these first of the first and by far the most importanti believe that miss oglander is alive and that her father will receive her safe and sound though not perhaps still miss oglander god bless you my dear sir the squire broke in getting up to lay hold of the young mans hand i dont care a straw what her name may besnooks or snobbs or higginbothamif i only get sight of my darling child again russel overshute looked rather queer at this and so did mrs fermitage but the squire continued in the same sort of waywhat odds about her name if it only is my grace exactly so replied hardenow that natural feeling of yours perhaps has been foreseen and counted on and that may be why such trouble was taken to terrify you with the idea of her death also of course that would paralyze your search while the villains are at leisure to complete their work i declare i never thought of that cried russel how extremely thickheaded of me that theory accounts for a number of things that cannot be otherwise explained what a head you have got my dear tom to be sure i wish i could believe it mr oglander exclaimed whilst his sister clasped her fair fat hands and looked with amazement at every one but i see no motive no motive whatever my grace was a dear good girl as everybody knows and a fortune in herself but of worldly goods she had very little any more than i have and her prospects were naturally contingentcontingent upon many things which may not come to pass i hope for many yearsif they ever do here he looked at his sister and she said i hope so therefore continued mr oglander while there are so many fine girls in the county very much better worth carrying offso far as mere worthless pelf is concernedwhy should anybody steal my grace unless they stole her for her own sake here the squire sat down and took to drumming with his stick his feelings were hurt at the ideathough it was so entirely of his own originationthat his daughter had been carried off for the sake of her money not of her own dear self hardenow looked at him and made no answer he felt that it did not behove a mere stranger to ask about the young ladys expectations while overshute was more imperatively silenced by his relations towards the family but mrs fermitage came to the rescue great was her faith in the value of money and she liked to have it known that she had plenty tut tut she cried shaking out her new brocaded silka mourning dress certainly but softly trimmed with purplewhy should we make any mystery of things when the truth is most important and the truth is mr hardenow that my dear niece had very good expectations my deeply lamented husband respected and i may say reverenced for upwards of half a century in every college of oxford and even more so by the corporation for the pure integrity of his character the loftiness of his principles andand the substance of hiswhat they make the wine ofhe was not the man mr hardenow to leave a devoted wife behind him who had stepped perhaps out of her rank a little not being of commercial birth you know but never found cause to regret it without some provision for the earthly time which she being many years his junior come come joan not so very many exclaimed the truthful squire about five or say six at the utmost you were born on the th of june ad worth i was not asking you for statistics mr hardenow you will excuse my brother he has always had a rude style of interruption he learned it i believe in the army and we always make allowance for it but to go back to what i was sayingmy good and ever to be lamented husband being let us say ten years my seniorworth will that content youleft every farthing of his property to me and a good husband always does the same thing i am told and i believe they are ordered in the bible and of course i have no one to leave it to but grace and being so extraordinarily advanced in years as my dear brother has impressed upon you they could not have any very long time to wait and my desire is to do my duty and perhaps that lies at the bottom of it all after relieving her mind in this succinct yet copious manner the good lady went into her chair again carefully directing in whatever state of mind the gathering and the falling of her dress aright and though it might be fancied that her colour had been high anybody now could see that her dignity had conquered it now the whole of this goes for next to nothing said the squire while the young men looked at one another and longed to be out of the way of it as we have got into the subject let us go right down to the bottom of it what are filthy pence and halfpence or a cellar like balaks of silver and gold when compared with the life of one pure dear soul i may not express myself theologically but you can see what i mean exactly i mean that i would kick old portwines dross to the bottom of the red sea where pharaoh lies if it turns out that that has killed my child or made her this long time dead to me having justified his feelings thus the old man stood up and went to the window to look for his horse the very last thing he desired always was to let out what he felt too much but to hear that old thief of a portwine fermitage praised and his lucre put forward quite as if it were an equivalent for grace and to think that he owed to that filthy cause the loss of the liveliest loveliest darling without whom he had neither life nor lovesuch things were enough to break the balance of his patience and the rest might think them out amongst them now this might have made a very serious todo between mr oglander and his sister joan both of them being of the stiffnecked order if he had been allowed to ride away like this mrs fermitage had her great carriage in the yard and two black horses with wide valleys down their backs rattling rings of the brightest brass while they stood in the stable with a bail between them and gently deigned to blow the chaff off from the oats of shotover this goodly pair made a great rush now into the mind of their mistressthe only sort of rush they ever madeand seeing her brother in that state of mind to get away from her she became inspired with an equal desire to get away from him will you kindly ring the bell she said and order my horses to be put to i think i have quite said every word i had to say and being the only lady present of course i labour under somewell some little disadvantages not of course that i mean for a moment to be sure not joan you never do know what you mean you would be a very nasty woman if you did now do let us turn our minds the pleasant way to everything if any word has come from me to lead to strong kind of argument i beg pardon of everybody and then there ought to be an end of it mrs fermitage scarcely knew what to say but in a relenting way looked round for some one to take it up for her and she was not long without somebody mr oglander said russel overshute you really ought to give us time to think you are growing so hasty sir since you came back to your seat in the saddle and your crosscountry ways that you want to ride over every one of usladies and gentlemen all alike the old squire laughed he could not help it at the thought of his own effrontery he felt that there might be some truth about it ever since it had come into his mind that he might not after all be childless he would not have any one know for a thousands pounds why he was laughing or that half another word might turn it into weeping he had seen it proved in learned books that no man knew the way to weep at his time of life and if his own case went against it he had the manners to be ashamed of it so he waited till he felt that his face was right and then he went up to his sister joan who was growing uneasy about her own words and he took her two plump hands in his and gave a glance for all there present to be welcome witnesses and then having knowledge for the last ten years how much too fat she was to lift he managed to kiss her in the two right places disarranging nothing his sister looked up at him as soon as he had done it with a sense of his propriety and study of her harmonies and she whispered to him quietly i beg you pardon brother and he spoke up for all to hear him joan my dear i beg your pardon now the first thing to be done said hardenow is to find cinnaminta and her husband smith but allow me to make one important request that even your adviser mr luke sharp shall not be informed of what has passed today or what overshute found out yesterday with some little surprise they agreed to this chapter xlii meeting the coach there happened however to be some one else whose opinion differed very widely from that of mr hardenow as to the necessity for any prompt appearance of either mr or mrs joseph smith the old red house in cross duck lane was ready to jump out of its windowsif such a feat be possiblewith eagerness and anxiety at the long absence of its master mr luke sharp had not crossed his own threshold for ten whole days including two sundays when even an attorney may give legbail to the power under whose ca ad sa he lives the business of the noble firm of piper pepper sharp co was falling sadly into arrears at the very busiest time of year for mr sharp had always kept his very best clerks in leading strings and kit thus far with his mothers aid had battled against all articles christopher fermitage sharp esq was resolved to be a country gentleman and a sportsman and no quilldriver he felt that his arms and legs as well were a great deal too good for going on and under desk with fine resignation kit accepted the absence of his father with his father away he was a very great man with his father at home he was quite a small boy he liked to play master of a house and frighten his mother and the maids and vow to dine at the mitre all the rest of the weekif that was their style of cookery but poor mrs sharp could not treat the matter thus truly delighted as she was to see her dear boy take his fathers place and conduct himself with dignity as the head of the household and find fault with things of which he knew nothing and order this that and the other awaystill she could not help remembering that all this was not as it ought to be christopher ought to have been in tortures of intense anxiety and so far as that went so ought she and she really tried very hard not to sleep and to sit up listening for the nightbell but a man who thinks everything of his own will and nothing of any other persons wish may be pretty sure that none will miss his presence so much as himself does in spite of all that mrs sharp was anxious and so were the rest of the householdthough rather perhaps with care than loveat the long unaccountable absence of the head and the brain of everything even the boys in cross duck lane who had a strong idea that lawyer sharp would defend them against the magistrates were beginning to feel that they must look out before throwing stones at any other boys you are not at all the thing my darling boy said mrs sharp to christopher on the evening of that same monday on which the council had been held at shotover your want of appetite makes me wretched now put on your cloak my pet and go as far as carfax or magdalen bridge the two evening coaches will soon be inthe defiance and the regulator i have a strong idea that your father will come by one or other of them i may just as well go there as anywhere else the young man answered gloomily for some days now he had striven in vain for an interview with his charmer and most unkindest cut of all he had spied her once and she had run away it does not matter where i go when you talk like that dear child you have no idea what you do you simply break the heart of your poor motherand much you care for that now if you should see any very fresh calves sweetbreads or even a pigs fry or anything you fancy order it in dear at once and be sure that you are at home by nine oclock and bring your dear papa with you if you can kit with a sigh and a roll of his eyes flung his cloak around him and with long slow melancholy strides clomb the arduous steep of carfax here at that timeif any faith there be to bruit of veteranseighty wellequipped quadrigae daily passed with prance of steeds and sound of classic trump and often youthful charioteer more apt to handle than win ribbons forty chariots came from smoke and wealth and din of blessed rome and other forty sped them back with the glory and mud of the country divine the moody kit ensconced himself away from the tramp of the vulgar crowd in the beetling doorway of a tailor who had put his shutters up and thrice being challenged by proctors velvetsleeved and velvetselvaged prosir are you a member of this universitythrice had the pleasure of answering no once and again he wiped his hectic cheek and fevered brow with a yellow bandana from which the winner of last years derby was washing out and he saw the defiance and the regulator pass newly horsed from rival inns exalting their horns against one another with splinterbars swinging behind cocked tails all eager for their race upon the cheltenham road but he saw not the author of his existence yet no tear bedewed his unfilial eye though these were the likeliest coaches all right he said putting his pipe in its case governor wont come home tonight im in no hurry if he isnt i think ill have sheeps trotters its a beastly time of the year for anything twitching his cloak which had two long tassels he strode from his post of observation and morbid meditation towards a tidy and clean little tripeshop he knew the old woman who kept it in george street and she always put him into good condition by generous admiration alas he had stridden but a very few strides when he met the upcoach from woodstock wearily with spent horses making rally for the star the driver a man of fine family at christchurch now in his seventh term and fighting off his smalls with a turn of his strong arm pulled the team together while with the other hand he launched a scouring flourish of the shrill scourge over every blessed horses ears well done my lord said the gentleman on the box as the four horses pulled up foot for foot and stood with their ears and their noses one for one you have brought them up in noble style my lord i never saw it done more perfectly my lord touched his white hat and said nothing he had crowned his day as he always loved to crown it and now if he could get into a back room of the star pull off his topboots and cape and don cap and gown and fetch back to college clear of l fineas happy as any lord would he be till nature sent him forth to drive again tomorrow but kit having very keen ears had recognised even from the other side of the street the sound of his dear fathers voice mr luke sharp never missed a chance of commending a noblemans exploits but he would not have spoken in so loud a tone perhaps if he had known that his son was near at hand for he hated with a consistent hatredwhether he were doing well or illall observation of his movements by any member of his household christopher being well aware of this pursued his own course in the shadow but resolved with filial piety to keep his good father in sight for fear of his falling into any mischief first of all mr sharpas observed at a respectful distance by his sonwent into the coach office and there left his handbag and his travelling coat then carrying something rolled under his arm he betook himself to a little quiet taproom and called for something that loomed and steamed afar very much after the manner of hot brown grog ho ho muttered kit then he isnt going home my duty to the household commands me to learn why with a smack of his lips mr sharp the elder came out into cornmarket street again and turning his back on his home set forth at a rapid pace for the broad desert of st giles here he passed into an unlit alley in the lonely parts beyond st johns and kit full of wonder was about to follow but hung back as the receding figure suddenly stopped and began to shift about in a nice dark place the learned gentleman unrolled the travelling rug he had been carrying undoubled it after that from some selvageand lo there was a city watchmans large loose overall then he pressed down the crown of his black springhat till it lay on his head like a pancake pulled the pouch of his long cloak over that and emerged from his alley with a vigilant slouch whistling moll maloney considerable surprise found its way into the candid mind of christopher well now thought the ungrateful youth as he shrank behind a tree to peep i always knew that the governor was a notch or two too deep for us but what he is up to now surpasses all experience of him what shall i do it seems so nasty to go spying after him and yet things are taking such a very strange turn that for the sake of my mother who is worth a thousand of him i do believe i am bound to see what this strange go may lead to young curiosity sprang forth and strongly backed up his sense of duty insomuch that kit after hesitating and listening for any other step stealthily followed the author of his existence across the dark and dusty road he is going to squeaker smiths thought the lad he will get a horse and ride away no end and of course i can never go after him i am sure it has something to do with me such troubles are enough to drive one mad but mr sharp did not turn in at the lamplit entrance to those mews he shunned the beaming oil which threw barred shadows upon sawdust of a fine device and keeping all his merits in the dark strode on like a watchman newly ordered to his post then suddenly he turned down a narrow unmade lane hillocked with clay and leading as christopher knew quite well to the wildest part of jericho i will follow him no further said kit sharp with a pang of astonishment and doubt he is my father what right have i to pry into his secrets how i wish that i had not followed him at all it serves me right for meanness i will go home now what care i for anythingtrotters cowheel or sweetbread as he turned to carry out this good resolve with a heart that would have ailed him more for leaving fears unfinished the sound of a clouting loutish footstep came along the broken mudbanks of the narrow lane the place was lonely dark and villainous footpads still abounded kit knew that his father often carried large sums of money and always the great gold watch he might have been decoyed here for robbery and murder upon pretence of secret business clearly it was the young mans duty not to be too far away therefore he drew back and stood in the jaws of the dark entrance but while he was ready to leap forth if wanted the sound of quiet voices told him that there was no danger kit could not hear the first few words but his father came back towards the mouth of the lane as if he would much rather not go into the dark too deeply christopher therefore was obliged either to draw back into the hedge and there lie hid without moving or else to come forward and declare himself he knew that the latter was his proper course or he might have known it if he had taken time to think but the dread of his father and the hurry of the moment drove him without thought into the lurkingplace it was quite dark now and there was not a lamp within a furlong of them you quite understand me then mr sharp was speaking in a low clear voice you are not to say a word to cripps about it he is true enough to me because he dare not be otherwise but he is an arrant coward i want a man who has the spirit to defy the law when he knows that he is well backed up governor i am your man for that i have defied the law since i were that high with only my mother in the wukuss to back me what i mean is to defy the wrong fashions of the law the petty rules that go against all common sense and equity all the fashions of the law be wrong i might a got on in the world like a house afire if it hadnt been for the devils own law to tell me a thing is agin the law is as good as an eyster to my teeth go on governor no fear of that i say and you know where to find at any moment a man as resolute as yourselfjoe smith well you know what you have to do in case of any sudden stir arising at present all goes well but all at any moment may go wrong squire overshute is about again at last ah if i could only come across of he of a dark night such as this be and that fool cinnaminta has told him all she knowswhich luckily is not very much i took good care to keep women out of it and the carrier too has been smelling aboutbut he hasnt the sense of his own horse night and day george night and day keep a lookout and have the horses ready you know what i have done for you my man governor if it hadnt been for you i might a seed the clouds through a halter loop you speak the truth and express it well and you may still enjoy that fair opportunity unless you attend to every word i say no fear governor i know you too well a good friend and a bad enemy you be thick and thin sirthick and thin agin all the world sir i sticks by you enough for tonight my man get ready and be off i shall know where to find you as before i shall ride over tomorrow if i find it needful with these words mr luke sharp set off at a good round pace for oxford while the other man shambled and whistled his way homewards up the blackmouthed lane perceiving these things christopher sharp with young bones leaped from his hidingplace astonishment might have been read upon his ingenuous and fat countenance if the lighting committee of the corporation had carried out their duty but having no house of their own out here they had far back put colophon upon the nascent gaspipe the ambition of the city at that time was to fill all the houses of the citizens and extend in no direction but though his countenance for want of light only wasted its amazement kitlike hector with his windpipe damaged but not by any means perforatedgave issue to his sentiments unlike hectorso far as we knowkit had been forming a habit of using language too strong for ladies blow me was his unheroic exclamationblow me if ever yet i knew so queer a start as this sure as eggs is eggs that is the very blackguard i drubbed for his insolence his voice is enough and his snuffle and i believe he was rubbing his nose in the dark i am sure hes the man i could swear its the man though i could not see his filthy face at all my father to be in a conspiracy with him and poor cinnaminta and mr overshute what the dickens is the meaning of it all the governor has a thousand times my brains as everybody says and i am the last to grudge it to him and he thinks he can do what he likes with me i am not quite sure of that if he puts my pecker up too heavily to throw his favourite light on his own reflections kit sharp lit his pipe and followed slowly in his fathers wake wiser and wider and brighter men might be found betwixt every two lampposts but few more simple soft and gentle than this honest lawyers son chapter xliii the motive perfectly free from all suspicions and as happy as he deserved to be mr sharp leaned back in his easy chair after making an excellent supper and gazed with complacency at his good wife he was really glad to be at home again and to find his admiring household safe and to rest for a while with a quiet brain as the lord and master of everything christopher had been sent to bed as if he were only ten years old for instead of exhibiting the proper joy he had behaved in a very strange and absent manner and his father who delighted much in snubbing him sometimes had requested him to seek his pillow kit had accepted this proposal very gladly longing as he did to think over by himself that strange adventure of the evening now darling luke began mrs sharp as soon as she had made her husband quite snug and provided him with a glass of negus you really must be amazed at my unparalleled patience and selfcontrol you ran away suddenly at the very crisis of a most interesting and momentous tale and from that day to this i have not had one word and how to behave to kit has been a riddle beyond riddles how i have seen to the dinneri am sureand of sleep i have scarcely had fifty winks between my anxiety about you and misery at not knowing how the story ended very well miranda i will tell you all the rest together with the postscript added since i went to london only you must stay up very late i fear to get to the proper end of it i will stay till the cocks crow at least i mean dear if after your long journey you are really fit for it if not i will wait till tomorrow dear mr sharp was touched by his wifes consideration for him he loved her more than he loved any one else in the world except himself and though like many other clearheaded men he had small faith in brains feminine he was not quite certain that he might not get some useful idea out of them when the matter at issue was feminine i am ready if you are my dear he said for he hated to beat about the bush only i must know where i left off with all i have done since i quite forget you left off just when you had discovered the real man who was called jolly fellows the man cousin fermitage left his will with to be sure or at least it was a codicil very well i found him in the winevaults of the company where they have been for generations he was going round with some large and good customer such as old fermitage himself had been senhor gelofilos had a link in one hand and in the other a deep dockglass while a man in his shadow bore a flashing gimlet and a longarmed siphontap from cell to cell and pipe to pipe they were going in regular order showing brands ex this and ex that and making little taps and trying them i was admitted without a word as one of this solemn procession being taken for a member of the sacred trade and the number of sips of wine i got and the importance attached to my opinion would have made you laugh miranda at length i got a chance of speaking alone to senhor gelofilos a tall dark gentlemanly man of grave and dignified manner he at once remembered that he had received a paper from mr fermitage of its nature however he knew nothing not being acquainted with our legal forms he had kept it ever since in a box at his house and if i could call upon him after office hours he would show it to me with pleasure accordingly i took a hackneycoach to his house near hampstead in the evening and found that old portwine had not deceived me during our last interview i held in my hand a most important codicil to the old mans will duly executed and attested so far at least as could be decided without inquiry by this codicil he revoked his will thus far that instead of leaving the residue after payment of legacies to his widow absolutely he left her a lifeinterest in that residue after bequeathing the sum of l duty free to his niece grace oglander out of my money luke cried mrs sharp indignantly twenty thousand pounds out of my money and what niece of his was she i should like to know was there nothing whatever for his own flesh and blood nothing whatever answered mr sharp calmly but wait a bit miranda wait well all the residue of his estate after the decease of his said wife joan was by this codicil absolutely given to his said niece grace he said that they both would know why he had made the change and then the rest of his will was confirmed as usual i never heard such a thing i never heard such robbery exclaimed mrs sharp with a panting breast i hope you will contest it all my dear if there is law in the land you cannot fail to upset such a vile vile will you can show that the fungus got into his brain my dear it is my object to establish that will or the codicil rather which i thus discovered i am obliged to proceed very carefully of course a rash step would ruin everything unluckily the executors remain as before though he would not trust them with the codicil well one of them as you know bought such a lot of port halfprice at his testators sale that in three months he required an executor for himself the other took warning by his fate and is going in for claret and the sour rhenish wines this has made him as surly as a bear and he is a most difficult man to manage but if any one can handle him i can and he has a deadly quarrel with that haughty joan i had first ascertained without any stir that the attestation is quite correcttwo stupid bottlemen who gave no thought to what they were doing but can swear to the signing and the codicil itself though portwine drew it without any lawyer is quite clear and good at the proper moment i produce the codicil account for my possession of it go to mr wigginton and make him prove it and then i think we turn the tables on the proud old widow oh luke what a blessed day that would be for me the things i have endured from that odious woman of course it will mortify her not to have disposal and to have to give up lthe miser the screw the expositor hypocrite the filthy silk stockings i should be ashamed to own but darling luke i do not see how we ourselves are a bit the better off for it poor grace being dead of course her father takes the money suppose for a moment that instead of being dead grace oglander is the wedded wife by that time of a certain christopher fermitage sharp and without any settlement what exclaimed mrs sharp jumping with astonishment is it possible is it possible it is more than possible it is probable and without some very bad luck it is certain oh you darling love she very nearly shouted giving him a hug with her plump white arms oh luke luke it is the noblest thing i ever heard and she is such a nice girl too so sweet and clever and superior the very daughter i would have chosen out of fifty thousand and with all that money at her back why we can retire and set up a green barouche i shall have it lined with the new agate colour trimmed with deep puce like the marchioness of marstonsthat is if you approve of course my dear and a pair of irongreys always go the best with that but luke you will laugh at me for being in a hurry there is plenty of time dear is there notthough they do say that carriagebuilders are so slow but they think so much of their old family my dear i know how very wonderfully managing you are and as clever as can be consistent with the highest principle but do tell me how you have contrived all this so well and never even let me guess a single whisper of it it has required some tact and skill mr sharp replied with a twinkle in his eyes and taking a good pull at his portwine negus and even more than that miranda without a bold stroke it could never have been done i staked almost everything upon the die not quite everything for i made all arrangements if we should have to fly fly my dear cried mrs sharp looking up with a very different face what do you mean luke to have to run away quite so there is no great stroke without great miss and if i had missed we must all have bolted suddenly the lord forbid run away in disgrace from my fathers own house and the whole world that knows us i never could have tried to go through such a trial yes my dear miranda it might have come to that and you would have gone through the whole of it without a single murmur luke i positively tremble at you the good woman answered as her eyes fell under his how stern you can look when you want to scare me miranda i tell you the simple truth we must all have been in france within twelve hours if ifwell never mind nothing venture nothing win but happily we have won i believe though we must not be too sure as yet we have justice on our side but justice does not always prevail against petty facts and public opinion would set against us with great ferocity if we failed if we succeed all men will praise us as soon as we begin to spend our money and exert it near home at the outset everything depends upon success of course it always does in everything my dear it is not fair of you to talk like that mrs sharp answered with tears in her eyes for in all her kind and ungirt nature there was no entry for cynicism you must feel that i would hold by you always whatever all the world might have the impudence to say dear beyond a doubt you would you could do no otherwise but that might be of very little use i mean that it would be the very greatest prop and comfort and blessing and support in every way and would keep up ones faith to some extent in human nature and divine assistancebut still if we had to live on three pound ten a week however we will not anticipate the worst you would like to know how the whole thing stands now mrs luke sharp although not very clever and wholly incapable of any plot herself beyond such little stratagems as ladies do concoct for fetching down the price of rep or getting gloves at a quarter of their cost nevertheless had her share of common sense and that which generally goes therewithrespect for the opinion of good people she knew that her husband was a very bold man as well as a very strongwilled one he had often done things which she had thought too daring and yet they had always turned out well but what he had now in hand was even according to his own account the most risky and perilous venture yet and though like the partner of a gambler she warmed up to back his hand and cheer him and let her heart go with him in her wiser mind she had shivers and shudders and a chill shadow of the end of it mr sharp saw that his wife was timid which of all things would be fatal now for her aid was indispensable otherwise perhaps he would not have been quite so ready to tell her everything he had put things so that her dislikes and envies as well as her likings and loves and ambitions would compel her to work with him if she were lukewarm his whole scheme must fail at the mere idea his temper stirred will you hear the rest or is your mind upset he asked a little roughly his wife looked up brightly from some little blink of thought every word of it now i must hear every word if you will be so kind my dear i will go and see that all the doors are shut chapter xliv the manner you see now miranda continued mr sharp as his wife came and sat quite close to him that it was my duty to make the most of the knowledge thus providentially obtained we had met with a bitter disappointment through the most gross injustice brought about no doubt by craft and wheedling and black falsehood when old fermitage stood godfather to our only child and showed a sense of duty towards him by bottling and walling up a pipe of wine everybody looked upon kit as certain to stand in his shoes in the course of time you know how we always looked forward to it not covetously or improperly but simply as a matter of justice and you remember what he said to me before he went to church with joan oglander quibbles my boy this shall make no difference between you and me mind i am sure that he meant it when he said it but that artful woman so led him astray and laid down the law about wives and husbands and county families and all that and pouring contempt upon our profession that all his better feelings left him and he made the will he did and but for her low unwomanly cowardice during his last illness so it would have stoodas she believes it even now to stand oh what a pure delight it will be cried the lady unable to help herself such a triumph of right over might and falsehood do let me be there to see it there is time enough to think of that miranda well as soon as ever i felt quite sure of my ground about the codicil which senhor gelofilos placed in my hands after making inquiry about me here and being satisfied of my relationship and respectability i began to cast about for the most effectual mode of working it it was clear in a moment that the right course was to make a match between grace now the legal heiress and kit the legitimate heir but here i was met by difficulties which appeared at first sight insuperable the pride of the old squire and his family nonsense the suit of russel overshute and the girls own liking for that young fellow which i had some reason to suspect the impossibility of getting at the girl and last not least the stupid shyness of our christopher himself these and other obstacles compelled me to knock them all out of the way by some decisive action the girl must be taken out of stupid peoples power and brought to know what was good for her of course i might have cut the matter short by walking the girl off and allowing her no food until she consented to marry kit and probably if i could only have foreseen my sad anxieties and heavy outlay i should have acted in that way but i have a natural dislike to measures that wear an appearance of harshness and i could not tell how kit might take it or even you miranda dear in this sad puzzle some good inspiration brought to my mind hannah patch then living by herself in london in a sort of a manner she is my sister as i have told you long ago although she is so many years my elder mrs sharp nodded she knew all about it and admired her husband none the less for being the illegitimate son of the fashionable captain patch very well this admirable man resumed you are aware that hannah looked very coldly upon me and spoke of me always as that child of sin until i was enabled to marry you my dear through your disinterested affection which is my choicest treasure having won that and another more lucrative but less delightful partnership i became to sweet hannah the child of love and was immediately allowed the privilege of doing all her legal business gratis you have often grumbled at that but i had some knowledge of what i was about my dear and i soon obtained that due influence over her which all women ought to have some man to wield setting aside her present use hannah patch has l a year of her own which might be much better invested and shall be as soon as it comes to us but it would not do to have her too set up herself oh luke what a largeminded dear you are whispered mrs sharp with much enthusiasm i do believe nothing escapes you and nothing that gets into your hand ever does get out again well i am pretty well for that he answered looking at his large strong palm i began with my hands pretty empty god knows and only my own brain to fill them but perseverance integrity and readiness to oblige have brought me on and above all things miranda the grace that i found in your kind eyes the kind and still pretty eyes looked prettier and almost young with the gleam of tears while the owner of all this integrity proved that it had stood him in good stead by drawing from his pocket and spreading on his head a handkerchief which had cost him yesterday fourteen and sixpence in holborn ready hemmed yes he continued with a very honest smile you see me as i am my dear and there are many poor people in the world worse off still it would never do for me to stop one must be either backward or forward always and i prefer to be forward and i hope to make a great step now but there must be no hesitation well to go on with my story i saw how useful miss patch might be to us she has strong religious views which always make it so easy to guide any one aright by giving the proper turn to things pugnacious dread of popery and valiant terror of the jesuits are the leadingstrings of her poor old mind i got firm hold of both of these and being trustee of her money also i found her quite ready to do good deeds i allowed her to perceive that if things went on without our interference grace oglander would be married and her enormous fortune sacrificed to a man whose bosom friend is a jesuit a fierce wolf in sheeps clothingan uncommonly clever fellow by the byea very young tutor of brasenose she had heard of him for his name is well known among the leaders of this new sect who call themselves anglocatholics and will end by being roman catholics of these good men according to their lights hannah patch has even deeper terror than of downright jesuits naturally such stuff matters not to me except when i can work it hannah patch also had a special grudge against old squire oglander a man very well in his way and very honest who thinks a great deal of his own opinions and is fit to be his own grandfather he had no love at all for the patch connectionthe patch on the family as he called itand the marriage of his stepmother with captain patch and the captains patronising air towards himin a word miranda he hated them all however when hannah was in trouble once or twice and without a roof to shelter herbefore she got her present bit of cashold oglander had her down and was very good and tried to like her he put his child under her care to learn theology as she called it and he paid her well for teaching her the psalms and the other denunciations they went away together to some very lonely place while the squire was a week or two away from home and now it occurred to me that this experience might be repeated and prolonged if needful oglander had been nervous as i knew and as his daughter also knew about some form of black fever or something which had been killing some gipsy people and was likely to come into the villages i made use of this fact with hannah patch to help me and quietly took my young heiress off to a snug little home in the thick of the woods where i should be sorry to reside myself she was under the holy wing of miss patch and there she abides to this present day and i feed them very well i assure you they cost me four pound ten a week for the evangelical hannah believes it to be the clearest mark of the beast to eat meat less than twice a day and leviticus cripps who supplies all the victuals is making a fortune out of me no bigger rogue ever lived than that fellow he is under my thumb so entirely that if i told him to roll in the mud he would roll and yet with all his awe of me he cannot forbear from cheating me he has found out a manner of dipping his pork so that he turns it into beef or mutton according to the orders from the cottage and he charges me butchers price for it and cartage for six miles and a half and a penny a pound for trimming off the flanks my dear said mrs sharp it is impossible he never could deceive a woman so however devoted her mind might be the grain of the meat is quite different and the formation of the bones not at all alike and directly it began to roast well never mind miranda there they are quite reconciled to the situation except that hannah patch is always hankering after the means of grace and the young girl mooning about her sweet old parent and beloved beckley sometimes there are very fine scenes between them but upon the whole they get on well together and appreciate one anothers virtues and i heartily trust that the merits of our kit have made their impression on a sensitive young heart they took to one another quite kindly in the romance of the situation when i brought their sweet innocence into contact by a very simple stratagem the dear young creatures have believed themselves to be outwitting everybody the very thing i laboured for them both to do alls well that ends welldont you think miranda i am so entirely losti mean i am so unable to think it all out without more time being given me mrs sharp answered while she passed her hand across her unwrinkled forehead and into her generally consulted curl that really luke for the moment i can only admire your audacity but i think dear that in a matter of this kindan especially feminine province i may sayyou might have done me the honour of consulting me miranda it was not to be thought of your health and wellbeing are the dearest objects of my life i will only ask could you have borne the suspense and the worry and anxiety of the last four months above all the necessity for silence yes luke i could have been very silent but i cannot abide anxiety you call me a dear fat soul sometimes and your judgment is always correct my dear at the same time i have little views of my own and sensible ways of regarding things you would like to hear my opinion luke and to answer me one or two questions certainly miranda beyond all doubt for what other purpose do i tell you all now let me have a nap for five minutes my dear while you ponder this subject and arrange your questions he threw his smart handkerchief over his head stretched out his feet and took a nice little doze chapter xlv the position among my relations said mrs sharp reclining for fear of asserting herself as soon as her lord looked up again i have always been thought to possess a certain amount of stupid common sense nothing of depth or grand stratagems i mean but a way of being right nearly nine times out of ten and i think that this feeling is coming over me just now my dear if it is so do relieve yourself do not consider my ideas for a moment but let me know what your own are luke how you love to ridicule me well if my opinion is of no account i can only ask questions as you tell me in the first place how did you get the girl away most easily under her fathers orders hannah can write the old gentlemans hand to any extent and his style as well for the glory of the lord she did so and how did you bring her to do such shocking things she must have had a strong idea that they were not honest far otherwise she took an enthusiastic view of the matter from the very first i made it quite clear to her how much there was at stake and the hardest job for a long time was to prevent her from being too zealous she scorns to take anything for herself unless it can be put religiously and for a long time i was quite afraid that i could not get a metal band on her but she found out before it was quite too late that the mission of the brotherlyloveabounders upon the west coast of africa had had all their missionaries eaten up and required a round sum to replace them i promised her l for that when her own mission ends in glory then you are quite certain to have her tight i might trust you for every precaution luke but how have you managed to keep them so quiet while the neighbourhood was alive with it and in what corner of the world have you got them and who was the poor girl that really did die one question at a time if you please miranda though they all hang pretty much upon one hook i have kept them so quiet because they are in a corner of a world where no one goes in a lonely cottage at the furthest extremity of the old stow wood where their nearest road is a timbertrack threequarters of a mile away they are waited on by a deaf old woman who believes them to be americans which accounts to her mind for any oddness their washing is done at home and all their food is procured through cripps the swineherd whose forest farm lies well away so that none of his children go to them cripps is indebted to me and i hold a mortgage of every rod of his land and a bill of sale of his furniture and stock he dare not play traitor and claim the reward or i should throw him into prison for forgery upon a little transaction of some time back moreover he has no motive for i have promised him the same sum and his bill of sale cancelled when the wedding is happily celebrated meanwhile he is making fine pickings out of me and he caters at a profit of cent per cent there is nobody else who knows anything about it except a pair of gipsy fellows too wide awake to come near the law for any amount of guineas one of them is old kershoe the celebrated horsestealer whom i employed to drive and horse the needful vehicle from london he knew where to get his horses without any postmaster being the wiser and his vehicle was a very tidy carriage bought by the gipsies for a dwellingplace and furbished up so that the chaises of the age are not to be compared with it the inquiries made at all liverystables and postinghouses and so on by order of overshute and the good squire and some of them through my own agency have afforded me genial pleasure and some little share of profit really my dear said mrs sharp you were scarcely right in charging for them you should have remembered that you knew all about it that was exactly what i did my dear and i felt how expensive that knowledge was as a little setoff against the pigmasters bills i made heavy entries against the good squire the fault is his own he should not have driven me into costly proceedings by that lowest of all things the arrogance of birth well the other gipsy man is no other than joe smith who jumped the broomstick with the lovely princess cinnaminta you must have heard of her miranda half the ladies in oxford were most bitterly jealous of her some years back i am sure then that i never was mr sharpa poor creature sitting under sacks and doing juggling nothing of the kind you never saw her she is a woman of superior mind and most refined appearance indeed her eyes are such as never oh that is where you have been luke is it while we have been here for a fortnight trembling nonsense miranda dont be so absurd the poor thing has just lost her only child and i believe she will go mad with it it was her pretty sister young khebyra who died of collapse and was buried the same night this case was most extraordinary the fever struck her without any illness just as the plague and the cholera have done with a headlong concentrated leap as a thunderstorm gathers itself sometimes into one blue ball of lightning she was laughing at ten oclock and her poor young jaw tied up at noon and a great panic burst among them luke exclaimed mrs sharp strongly shuddering you never mean to say that you came home to me from being among such people without a change of clothes or anything how could i come home without anything my dear but i was not among them at all that day nor at any other period i never go to work in that coarse sort of way familiarity begets contempt however i was soon informed of this most sad occurrence and for a while it quite upset me coming as it did at such a very busy time however when i had time to dwell more calmly on the subject i began to see a chance of turning this keen blow to my benefit the gipsy camp was broken up with fatalistic terrorthe most abject of all terrors as the courage of the fatalist is the fiercest of all courage they carried off their royal stock the heiress of the gipsy throneas soon as some fine thief is hangedquite as the bees are said to carry off their queen when a hornet comes poor cinnaminta was caught away just when i might have made her useful and only two men were left to attend to the burial of her sister of these my friend joseph smith was one as he ought to be being cinnamintas spouse it was a very active time for me i assure you miranda dear the complication was almost too much to be settled in so short a time and some of my hair which had been quite strong was lying quite flat in the morning perhaps you remember telling me yes that i do luke i could not make it out your hair had always stood so well and a far better colour than the young men have got and you told me that it was gone like that from taking cockles antibilious pills miranda i have never deceived you i did take a couple and they helped me on but without attributing too much to them i did make a lucky turn of it their manner of sepulture is brief and wise or at any rate that of this tribe is though they differ i believe very widely these wait till they are sure that the sun has set and then they begin to excavate i was able to suggest that in this great hurry and scattering of the tribes of israel the wisest plan would be to adopt and adapt a very quiet corner already hollowed and indicated by name which is so much more abiding than substance as a legendary gipsy aceldama the idea was caught at as it well deserved to be in the panic and lack of time and terror of the poor dead body the poor thing was buried there with very hasty movements her sister and the rest being hurried away and it is quite remarkable how this the merest episode has by the turn of events assumed a primary importance foresight and insight and secondsight almost would be attributed to me by any one who did not know the facts scarcely anybody would believe as this thing worked in my favour so much that i can scarcely claim the invention any more than i can take any credit for the weather indeed i may say without the smallest presumption or profanity that something higher than mere fortune has favoured my plans from the very first i had provided for at least one whole days start before any alarm should be given but the weather secured me i may say six weeks before anything could be done in earnest and then the discovery of that body by a girl who was frightened into fits almost and its tardy disinterment and the universal conclusion about it which i perhaps helped in some measure to shape also the illness with which it pleased providence to visit messrs oglander and overshutei really feel that i have the deepest cause to be grateful and i trust that i am so certainly my dear your cause is just said mrs sharp as her husband showed some symptoms of dropping off to sleep again but in carrying it out you have inflicted pain and sad sad anxiety on a poor old man can he ever forgive you or make it up i should hope for his own sake replied the lawyer that he will cast away narrowmindedness otherwise we shall not permit him to rush into the embraces of his daughter but if he proves relentless it matters little except for the opinion of the world he cannot touch portwines property at all and he may do what he likes with his own little wealth his outside value is some l however if i understand him aright we shall manage to secure his money too tied up i dare saybut what matters that he is a most fond papa and his joy will soon wash away all evil thoughts how delightful it will be cried the lady with a sigh to restore his longlost child to him still it will be a most delicate task you must leave all that to me luke with pleasure my dear miranda your kind heart quite adapts you for such a melting scene and indeed i would rather be out of the way but i want your help for more than that you shall have it luke with all my heart and soul it is too late now to draw back though if you had asked my advice i would have tried to stop you but just one question morehow did you get rid of john smith and his inquiries they say that he is such a very shrewd man do you not know will nobody ever know the difference between small uneducated cunning and the clear intelligence of a practised mind to suppose that john smith would ever give me any trouble he has been most useful i directed his inquiries and exhausted the inquisitive spirit through him but you did not let him know miranda now i shall go to bed if i am so very fast asleep can no woman ever dream of large utility i have had no better friend throughout this long anxiety than john smith and without the expenditure of one farthing i have guided him into the course that he should take when he hears of anything the first thing he asks isnow what would lawyer sharp be inclined to think of this perhaps i have taken more trouble than was needful but at any rate it would be disgraceful indeed if john smith could cause me uneasiness the only man i have ever had the smallest fear of has been russel overshute not that the young fellow is at all acute but that he cannot be by any means imbued with the proper respect for my character how very shocking of him my dear luke when your character has been so many years established miranda it is indeed shockingbut what can be expected of a radical ever since that villainous reform bill passed the spirit of true reverence is destroyed but he must have some respect for me as soon as he knows all although to confess the pure truth my dear things have worked in my favour so that i scarcely deserve any credit at all except for the original conception that however was a brave one it was indeed and i am scarcely brave enough to be comfortable there is never any knowing how the world may take things it is true that old fermitage was not your client and you had been very badly treated and had a right to make the most of any knowledge obtained by accident but old mr oglander is your client and has trusted you even in the present matter i do not think that my father would have considered it quite professional to behave so mrs luke sharp was alarmed at her own boldness in making such a speech as this she dropped her eyes under her husbands gaze but he took her remarks quite calmly my dear we will talk of that another time the fact that i do a thingafter all my experienceshould prove it to be not unprofessional at the present moment i want to go to bed and if you are anxious to begin hairsplitting bed is my immediate refuge but if you wish to know about the future of your son you must listen and not try to reason i did not mean to vex you luke i might have been certain that you knew best and you always have so many things behind that solomon himself could never judge you tell me all about my darling kit and i will not even dare to cough or breathe my dear it would grieve me to hear you cough and break my heart if you did not breathe but i fear that your kit is unworthy of your sighs he has lost his young heart beyond redemption without having the manners to tell his mother they all do it luke of course they do it is no good to find fault with them i have been expecting that sort of thing so long and when he went to spiers for the melanochaitotrophe with the yellow stopper to it i knew as well as possible what he was about i knew that his precious young heart must be gone for it cost him seven and sixpence yes my dear and it went the right way in the very line i had laid for it i will tell you another time how i managed that with hannah patch of course to help me the poor boy was conquered at first sight for the weather was cold with snow still in the ditches and i gave him sixpennyworth of brandyballs so kit went shooting and got shot according to my arrangement ever since that the great job has been to temper and guide his rampant energies and of course he knows nothingoh no he would be so very unworthy if he did oh do say that he knows nothing luke my dear i can give you that pleasing assurance although it is a puzzling one to me christopher fermitage sharp knows not grace oglander from the young woman in the moon he believes her to have sailed from a new and better world undoubtedly he is my son miranda yet where did he get his thickheadedness mr sharp miranda make allowance for me such things are truly puzzling however you perceive the situation here is a very fine young fellowin his mothers opinion and his owndesperately smitten with a girl unknown and romantically situated in a wood there is reason to believe that this young lady is not insensible to his merits he looks very nice in his sporting costume he has no one to compete with him he is her only bit of life for the day he leaves her now and then a romantic rabbit and he rescues her from a ruffian but here the true difficulty begins we cannot well unite them in the holy bonds without a clear knowledge on the part of either of the true patronymic of the other the heroine knows that the hero rejoices in the good and useful name of sharp but he knows not that his ladylove is one grace oglander of beckley barton here again you perceive a fine stroke of justice if squire oglander had only extended his hospitalities to us christopher must have known grace quite well and i could not have brought them together so at present he believes her to be a miss holland from the united states of america and as she has promised miss patch not to speak of her own affairs to anybody according to her fathers wish in one of the demerara letters that idea of his might still continue although she has begun to ask him questions which are not at all convenient but things must be brought to a point as soon as possible having the advantage of directing the inquiries or at any rate being consulted about them i see no great element of danger yet and of course i launched all the first expeditions in every direction but the right one that setting up of the tombstone by poor old joan was a very heavy blow to the inquisitive but my dear that did not make the poor girl dead a bit more than she was dead before miranda you do not understand the world the evidence of a tombstone is the strongest there can be and beats that of fifty living witnesses i won a most difficult case for our firm when i was an ardent youth and the victory enabled me to aspire to your hand by taking a mallet and a chisel and a little nitric acid and converting a francis by moonlight into a frances i kept the matter to myself of course for your good father was a squeamish hand but you have heard me speak of it yes but i thought it so wrong my dear even though as you said truth required it truth did require it the old stonemason had not known how to spell the word i corrected his heterography and we confounded the tricks of the evil ones all is fair in love and law so long as violence is done to neither and now i wish kits unsophisticated mind to be led to the perception of that great truth it is needful for him to be delicately admitted to a knowledge of my intentions there is nobody who can do this as you can he takes rather clumsy and obstinate views of things he is too young to understand the main point of all with a mind like his is to dwell upon the justice of our case and the depth of our affection which has led to such a sacrifice of the common conventional view of things my dear but i have had nothing to do with it conception plan and execution are all your own and no other persons why i had not even dreamed still you must put it to him miranda as if it was your doing more than mine he has more faith in yourwell what shall i call it i would not for a moment wrong him by supposing that he doubts his own fathers integrityin your practical judgment let us say and perception of the nicest principles it is absolutely necessary that you should appear to have acted throughout in close unison with me in fact it would be better to let the boy perceive that the whole idea from the very first was yours as in simple fact it must have been if circumstances had permitted me to tell you all that i desired to any idea of yours he takes more kindly perhaps than to those which are mine this is not quite correct some would say but i am above jealousy i always desire that he should love his mother and make a pattern of her his poor father gets knocked about here and there and cannot halt to keep himself rigidly upright though it always is his ambition but women are so different and so much better even kit perceives that truth let him know my darling that your peace of mind is entirely staked upon his following out the plan which you mean to propose to him but my dear luke i have not the least notion of any plan of any sort never mind miranda make him promise i will tell you all about it afterwards it is better not to let him know too much knowledge should come in small doses always otherwise it puffs up young people alas now i feel that i am not as i was twenty years ago i could have sat up all night talking and not shown a sign of it next day i have not had any sleep for the last twelve nights do you see any rays in my eyes dear wife they are sure indications of heart disease when i am tired they always come oh luke luke you will break my heart you shall not say another word have some more negusi insist upon it it is no good to put your hand over the glassand then come to bed immediately you are working too hard for your family my pet chapter xlvi in the meshes now being newly inspired by that warm theologianas miss patch really believed him to beluke sharp the lady felt capable of a bold stroke which her conscience had seemed to cry out against till loftier thoughts enlarged it she delivered to her dear niece a letter written in pale ink and upon strange paper which she drew from a thicker one addressed to herself and received through their butcher from a postoffice wondering who their butcher was but delighted to get her dear fathers letter grace ran away to devour it it was dated from georgetown english guayana and though full of affection showed touching traces of delicate health and despondency the poor girl wiped her eyes at her fathers tender longing to see her once more and his earnest prayers for every blessing upon their invaluable friend miss patch then he spoke of himself in a manner which made it impossible for her to keep her eyes wiped so deep was his sadness and yet so heroically did he attempt to conceal it from her and then came a few lines which surprised her greatly he said that a little bird had told him that during her strict retirement from the world in accordance with his wishes she had learned to esteem a most worthy young man for whom he had always felt warm regard and he might even say affection he doubted whether at his own time of life and with this strange languor creeping over him he could ever bear the voyage to england unless his little darling would come over to fetch him or at least to behold him once more alive and if she would do so she must indeed be quick he need not say that to dream of her travelling so far all alone was impossible but if for the sake of her father she could dispense with some old formalities and speedily carry out their mutual choice he might with his whole heart appeal to her husband to bring her out by the next packet he said little more except that he had learned by the bitter teaching of adversity who were his true friends and who were false no one had shown any truth and reality except mr sharp of oxford but he never could have dreamed till it came to the test that even the lowest of the low would treat him as young mr overshute had done that subject was too painful so he ended with another adjuration to his daughter aunty i have had the most extraordinary letter cried grace coming in with her eyes quite dreadful it astonishes me beyond everything may i see the postmark of yours which it came in i shall think i am dreaming till i see the postmark the stamp of the office do you mean my dear oh yes you are welcome to see grace here it is georgetown demerara the date is not quite clear without my spectacles those foreign dies are always cut so badly never mind the date aunt i have the date inside in my dear fathers writing but i am quite astonished how my father can have heard something about you sly little puss you need not blush so for i long have guessed it but indeed it is not trueindeed it is not i may have been amused but i never neverand oh what he says then of somebody elsesuch a thing i should have thought impossible how can one have any faith in any one my dear child what you mean is this how can one have any faith in worldly and ungodly people with their mouths they speak deceit the poison of asps is under their lips oh no he never was ungodly to see him walk would show you that and if being good to the poor sick people and dashing into the middle of the whoopingcough how am i to know of whom you speak you appear to have acted in a very forward way with some one your father disapproves of i assure you i never did anything of the kind it is not at all my manner i thought you considered it wrong to make unfounded accusations grace what a most unchristian temper you still continue to display at times your cheeks are quite red and your eyes excited in a way very sad to witness the trouble i have taken is beyond all knowledge if you do not value it your father does aunty patch may i see exactly what my daddy says to you i will show you mine if you will show me yours my dear you seem to forget continually you treat me as if i were of your own age and had never been through the very first alarm which comes for our salvation it has not come to you or you could not be so frivolous and worldly as you are when first it rang even for myself how many times does it ring aunt i mean for every individual sinner as you always call us my dear it rings three times as has been proved by the most inspired of all modern preachers the rev wm romaine while amplifying the blessed words of the pious joseph alleine he begins his discourse upon it thus aunty you have told me that so many times that i could go up into his desk and do it it is all so very good and superior but there are times when it will not come you or at any rate i for certain may go down on our knees and pray and nothing ever comes of it i have been at it every night and morning really quite letting go whatever i was thinking ofand what is there to come of it except this letter and it doesnt sound as if my father ever wrote a word of it grace what do you mean if you please i mean what i do not please i mean that i have been here at least five months as long as any fifty and have put up with the miserablest thingsnow never mind about my english if you please it is quite good enough for such a place as thisand have done my very best to put up with you who are enough to take fifty peoples lives away with perpetual proprietyand have hoped and hoped and prayed and prayed till my knees are not fit to be looked atand now after all what has come of it that i am to marry a boy with a red cord down his legs and a crystal in his whip and a pretty face that seems to come from his mammas watchpocket and a very nice and gentle way of looking at a lady as if he were quite capable if he had the opportunity of saying bo to any goose on the other side of the river my dear do you prefer bold ruffians then like the vagabond you were rescued from i dont know at all what i do prefer aunt patch unless it is just to be left to myself and have nothing to say to any one why grace that is the very thing you complained of in your sinful and ungrateful speech just now but do not disturb me with any more temper i must take the opportunity before the mail goes out to tell your poor sick father how you have received his letter oh no if you please not you are quite mistaken if you think that i thought of myself first my dear father knows that i never would do that and it would be quite vain to tell him so oh my darling darling fatherwhere are you now and whatever are you doing grace you are becoming outrageous quite you know quite well where your father is and as to what he is doing you know from his own letter that he is lying ill and longing for you to attend upon him and this is the way that you qualify yourself somehow or other nowi do not mean to be wicked auntbut i dont think my father ever wrote that letteri mean at any rate of his own free will somebody must have stood over himi feel as if i really saw themand made him say this and that and things that he never used to think of saying why he never would have dreamed when he was well of telling me i was to marry anybody he was so jealous of me he could hardly bear any gentleman to dare to smile and he used to make me promise to begin to let him know five years before i thought of any one and now for him to tell me to marry in a weekjust as if he was putting down a silverside to saltand to marry a boy that he scarcely ever heard of and never even introduced to mehe must have been he cannot but have been either wonderfully affected by the climate or shackled down in a slavedrivers dungeon until he had no idea what he was about have you finished grace now is your violence over no i have no violence and it is not half over but still if you wish to say anything i will do all i can to listen to it you are most obliging one would really think that i were seventeen and you nearly seventy aunt patch you know that i am as good as nineteen and instead of being seventy you are scarcely fiftyfive grace your memory is better about ages than about what you do not wish to hear of and you do not wish to hear with the common selfishness of the period of the duty which is the most sacred of all and at the same time the noblest privilegethe duty of selfsacrifice what are your own little inclinations petty conceits and miserable jokesjokes that are ever at deadly enmity with all deep religionah what are theyyou selfish and frivolous girlwhen set in the balance with a parents lifeand a parent whose life would have been in no danger but for his perfect devotion to you aunt patch i never heard you speak of my father at all in that sort of way before you generally talk of him as if he were careless and worldly and heterodox most frivolous and quite unregenerate and now quite suddenly you find out all his value what do you want me to do so much aunt patch dont look at me like that child you quite insult me as if it could matter to me what you doexcept for your own eternal welfare if you think it the right thing to let your father die in a savage land calling vainly for you and buried among landcrabs without a drop of waterthat is a matter for you hereafter to render your own account of you have tired me grace i am not so young as you are and i have more feeling i must lie down a little you have so upset me when you have recovered your proper frame of mind perhaps you will kindly see that margery has washed out the little brown teapot to be sure aunty i am up to all her tricks and i will just toast you a waterbiscuit and put a morsel of salt butter on it scarcely so large as a little french bean go to sleep aunty for about an hour i am getting into a very proper frame of mind i can never stay very long out of it may i go into the wood just to think a little of my darling fathers letter yes grace but not for more than half an hour on condition that you speak to no one you have made my head ache sadly leave your fathers letter here oh no if you please let me take it with me how can i think without it miss patch was so sleepy that she said very well let me see it again when you have made the tea whereupon grace having beaten up the cushion of the good ladys only luxury and laid her down softly and kissed her forehead for fear of having made it ache stole her own chance for a little quiet thought in a shelter of the woods more soft than thought for the summer was coming with a stride of light and bashful corners full of lateness tried to ease it off with moss in a nook of this kind far from any path and tenderly withdrawn into its own green rest the lonely and bewildered girl stopped suddenly and began to think she drew forth the letter which had grieved her so and she wondered that it had not grieved her more it was not yet clear to her young frank mind that suspicion like a mole was at work in it to get her thoughts better and to feel some goodness she sat upon a peaceful turret of new speargrass and spread her letter open and began to cry she knew that this was not at all the proper way to take things and yet if any one had come and preached to her and proved it all she could have made no other answer than to cry the more for it the beautiful light of the glancing day turned corners and came round to her the lovable joy of the many many things which there is no time to notice spread itself silently upon the air or told itself only in fragrance and the glossy young blades of grass stood up and complacently measured their shadows here lay grace for a long sad hour taking no heed of the things around her however much they heeded her the white windflower with its drooping bells and the bluebell and the harebell and the pasqueflowersoftest of all soft tintslikewise the delicate stitchwort and the breath of the lingering primrose and the white violet that outvies its sister that sweet usurper of the coloured name in fragrance and in purity and hiding for its life without any one to seek the sensitive woodsorrel and in and out and behind them all the cups and the sceptres and the balls of moss and the shells and the combs of lichenin the middle of the whole this foolish maid had not one thought to throw to them she ought to have sighed at their power of coming one after another for ever whereas her own life was but a morning dew but she failed to make any such reflection what she was thinking of she never could have told except that she had a long letter on her lap and could not bring her mind to it and here in the hollow when the warmth came round of the evening fringed with cloudlets she was fairer than any of the buds or flowers and ever so much larger but she could not be allowed to bloom like them oh i beg pardon cried an unseen stranger in a very clear keen voice i fear i am intruding in some private grounds i was making a short cut which generally is a long one if you will just show me how to get out again i will get out with all speed and thank you grace looked around with surprise but no fear she knew that the voice was a gentlemans but until she got up and looked up the little hollow she could not see any one please not to be frightened said the gentleman again i deserve to be punished perhaps but not to that extent i fancied that i knew every copse in the county i have proved and must suffer for my ignorance as he spoke he came forward on a little turfy ledge about thirty feet above her and she saw that he looked at her with great surprise she felt that she had been crying very sadly and this might have made her eyes look strange quite as if by accident she let her hair drop forward for she could not bear to be so observed and at that very moment there flowed a gleam of sunshine through it she was the very painting of the picture in her fathers room saints in heaven cried hardenow who never went further than this in amazement i have found grace oglander stop if you pleasei beseech you stop but grace was so frightened and so pledgebound that no adjuration stopped her if hardenow had only been less eager there and then he might have made his bow and introduced himself but gracie thought of the rabbitman and her promise and her loneliness and without looking back she was round the corner and not a ribbon left to trace her by and now again if hardenow had only been less eager he might have caught the fair fugitive by following in her footsteps but for such a simple course as that he was much too clever instead of running down at once to the spot where she had vanished and thence giving chase he must needs try a cross cut to intercept her there were trees and bushes in the way it was true but he would very soon get through them and to meet her face to face would be more dignified than to run after her so he made a beautifully correct cast as to the line she must have taken and aiming well ahead of her leaped the crest of the hollow and set off down the hill apace but here he was suddenly checked by meeting a dense row of hollies which he had not seen by reason of the brushwood in a dauntless manner he dashed in among them scratching his face and hands and losing a fine large piece of black kerseymere from the skirt of his coat and suffering many other lesser damages but what was far worse he lost grace also for out of that holly grove he could not get for a long long time and even then he found himself on the wrong sidethe one where he had entered if good anglocatholics ever did swear the rev thomas hardenow must now have sworn for his plight was of that kind which engenders wrath in the patient and pleasantry on the part of the spectator his face suggested recent duello with a cat his white tie was tattered and hanging down his back his typical coat was a mere postilions jacket and the condition of his gaiters afforded to the sceptic the clearest proof of the sad effects of perpetual selfdenial his hat with the instinct of selfpreservation had rolled out from the thicket when he first rushed in and now he picked up this wiser portion of his head and was thankful to have something left chances were against him but what is chance he had an exceedingly strong will of his own and having had the worst of this matter so far he was doubly resolved to go through with it without a second thought about his present guise or aspect he ran back to the spot which he had left so unadvisedly there he did what he ought to have done ten minutes or a quarter of an hour ago he ran down the slope to the nest in the nook which had been occupied by grace then he took to the track which she had taken but she had been much too quick for him she had even snatched up her letter so that he was none the wiser he came to a spot where the narrow and thickly woven trackway broke into two and whether of the two to choose was more than a moments doubt to him then he seemed to see some glint of footsteps and sweep of soft sprays by a dress towards the right and making a dash through a dark hole towards it was straightway enveloped in a doubled rabbitnet cast over his surviving hat hold un tight jarge now thoust got un cried out somebody whom he could not see poachin son of a gun usll poach un poachingmy good friends cried hardenow trying to lift his arms and turn his head round all vainly you can scarcely know the meaning of that word or you never would think of applying it to me let me see you that i may explain i have been trespassing i am afraid but by the purest accidentallow me to turn round and reason quietly i have the greatest objection to violence i never use nor allow it to be used if you are honest gamekeepers exceeding your duty through earnest zeal i would be the last to find fault with you want of earnestness is the great fault of this age but you must not allow yourselves to be misled by some little recent mischances to my clothes such things befall almost everybody exploring unknown places you are pulling me you are exceeding your duty is the bucolic mind so dense here i am at your mercyjust show yourselves you may choke me if you like but the result will beohthat you will also be choked yourselves a rare fineplucked one as ever i see said rabbiting george to leviticus cripps when hardenow lay between them senseless from the pressure upon his throat ease him off a bit my lad he never done no harm to me they longcoated parsons is good old women and he be cut up into a young gal now lay hold on the poor devil right end foremost zoon as i have stopped uns praching did ever you see such a guy out of a barrow heavywitted tickuss made no answer but laid hold of the captive by his shoulders so that himself might be still unseen if consciousness should return too soon black george tucked the feet under his arm after winding the tail of the net round the shanks and expressing surprise at their slimness and in no better way than this these two ignorant bumpkins swung the body of one of the leading spirits of the rising age to the hogpound thomas hardenow was not the man to be long insensible every fibre of his frame was a wire of electric life he was all thereto use a slang expression which by some wondrous accident has a little pith in itin about two minutes not a bit of him was absent and he showed it by hanging like a lump upon his bearers as they fetched him to an empty hoghouse dropped him anyhow and locked him in then one of them jumped on a little horse and galloped off to oxford chapter xlvii combined wisdom i really cannot go on like this said mr sharp to mrs sharp quite early on the following morning thank god i am not of a nervous nature and patience is one of my largest virtues but acting as i have done for the best i cannot be expected to put up with perpetual suspense this very day i will settle this matter one way or the other the lawyer for the first time now was flurried he had heard of the capture of a spy last nightfor so poor hardenow had been describedand though he had kept that new matter to himself he was puzzled to see his way through with it luke my dear replied mrs sharp with some of her tightenings not done up surely there need not be such hurry you make me quite shiver when you speak like that i shall come down to breakfast without any power and the portmeadow eel will go out for the maids should we ever behold it again luke of course not how could you expect it slippery slipperyhard it is to lay fast hold of anything and the worst of all to bind is woman i do not mean you my dear you need not look like that you are as firm as this tag of your stayscorset corseti beg pardon how can a man tell the fashionable words but luke you surely would not think of proceeding to extremities any extremity if it only were the last for the good of my family i have worked hard and there never should have been all this worry with it miranda i may have strayed outside the truth and outside the lawwhich is so much largerbut one thing i beg you to bear in mind not a thing have i done except for you and kit money to me is the last thing i think of pure affection is the very first and no one can meddle with your settlement oh my darling mrs sharp exclaimed as she fell back from looking at the lookingglass you are almost too good for this world luke you think of everybody in the world except yourself it is not the right way to get on dear we must try to be a little harder i have thought so miranda i must try to do it petty little sentiments must be dropped we must rise and face the state of things which it has pleased providence to bring about i am responsible for a great deal of it and with your assistance i will see it through we must take kit in hand at once my dear wife can i rely upon you luke you may rely upon me for anything short of perjury and if it comes to that i must think first no man ever had a better any more than he could have a truer wife or one so perpetually young with these words mr sharp performed some little operations which even in the highest circles are sometimes allowed to be brought about by masculine hands when clever enough and before very long this affectionate pair went down to breakfast and enjoyed fried eel kit who had caught this fine eel was not there perhaps he was gone forth to catch another so they left him the tail to be warmed up in the present condition of his active mind and the mournful absence of his beloved christopher found a dark and moody pleasure in laying nightlines if his snare were successful he hauled out his victim and with a scornful smile despatched him if the line held nothing he cast it in again with a sigh of habitual frustration this morning however he was not gone forth on his usual round of inspection but had only walked up to the liverystables to make sure of his favourite hack for the day he had made up his mind that he must see grace that very same day come what would of it he would go much earlier and watch the door and if this bad fortune still continued he would rush up at last and declare himself but this bold resolve had a different issue for no sooner had the young man with some reluctance and selfreproach dealt bravely with a solid breakfast than he was requested by his dear mother to come into his fathers little study now this invitation was not in accordance with the present mood of christopher he had made up his mind to be off right soon for the bowers of his beloved with a roll and some tongue in his little fishingcreel and a bottle of beer in each holster in the depth of the wood he might thus get on and enjoy to the utmost fruition of his heart all the beauty of nature around him it was a cruel blow to march just then to a lecture from the governor whose little private study he particularly loathed and regarded as the den of the evil one however he set up his pluck and went mr sharp looking if possible more upright and bright than usual sat in front of the large and stronglegged desk where he kept his more private records such as never went into the office mrs sharp also took a legal chair and contemplated kit with a softer gaze he with a beating heart stood up like a youth under orders to construe my son began the father and the master in a manner large and affable prepare yourself for a little surprise on the part of those whose principal object is your truest welfare for some weeks now you have made your dear mother anxious and unhappy by certain proceedings which you thought it wise and manly to conceal from her yes you know you did kit mrs sharp interposed shaking her short curls and trying to look fierce the boy with a deep blush looked at her as if everybody now was against him christopher we will not blame you resumed mr sharp rather hastily for fear that his wife should jump up and spoil all our object in calling you is not that you have acted according to our wishes mainly though you need not have done it so furtively you have formed an attachment to a certain young lady who leads for the present a retired life in a quiet part of the old stow wood and she returns your affection is it so or is it not iii stammered kit seeking for his mothers eyes which had buried themselves in her handkerchief i cant say a word about what she thinks shesheshe has got such a fashion of running away so but iiiwell then its no good telling a lie about it i am deucedly fond of her that is exactly what i wished to know though not expressed very tastefully well and do you know who she is my son yes i know all that quite well as much as any fellow wants to know she is a young lady and she knows all the flowers and the birds and the names of the trees almost she can put me right about the kings of england and she knows my dogs as well as i do a highly accomplished young lady in short yes i should say a great deal more than that i care very little for accomplishments butbut if i must come to the pointi do like her and no mistake then you would not like some other man to come and run away with her quite against her will that man must run over my body first cried kit with so much spirit that his father looked proud and his poor mother trembled well well my boy continued the good lawyer it will be your own fault if the villain gets the chance i am doing all i can to provide against it and am even obliged to employ some means of a nature not at all congenial to me forfor that very reason you are sure that you love this young lady kit father i would not say anything strong but i would go on my knees all the way from here to there for the smallest chance of getting her very good that is as it should be i would have done the very same for your dear mother mamma you have often reminded me of it when anythingwell those are reminiscences but they lie at the bottom of everything a mercenary marriage is an outrage to all good feeling she has not got a sixpence father she told me so she makes all the bread and she puts by all the dripping my dear boy you know then what a good wife is mamma we shall have to clear out the room where the rockinghorse is and the old magiclantern and let this young couple go into it my dear it would be a long job and there are a great many cracks in the paper but still we could have in old josephine those are mere details momma but this is a serious question and the boy must not be hurried he may not have made up his mind or he may desire to change it tomorrow he is too young to have any settled will and there is no reason why he should not wait not a day will i waitnot an hour would i wait in ten minutes i could pack everything he might wait for a twelvemonth my dear miranda and sound his own feelings and the young girls too if we could only be certain that the young man of rank with the four bay horses was not in earnest when he swore to carry her off tomorrow my dear husband mrs sharp said softly let us hope that he meant nothing by it such things are frequently said and come to nothing i tell you what it is kit almost shouted with his fist upon the sacred desk you cannot in any way enter into my feelings upon such matters i beg your pardon that is not what i mean and i ought never to have said it but still comparatively speaking you can take these things easily and go on and think people foolishbut i cannot i know when my mind is made up and i do it and to stop me with all sorts of nonsenseat least to find fifty reasons why i should do nothingis the surest of all ways to make me do it i have many people who will follow me through thick and thin though you may not believe it because you cannot understand me and your views are confined to propriety mine are not and you may find that out in a very short time at any rate if i do a thing that brings you father and mother into any evil words all i can say is you never should have stopped me with this very lucid expression of ideas christopher strode away and left his parents petrifiedas he thought mrs sharp was inclined to be a dripping well but mr sharp was dry enough exactly exactly he said as he always said when a thing had come up to his reckoning nothing could have been done much better put the money in his best breeches pocket my dear without my knowledge and at the backdoor kiss him adjure him to do nothing rash and lend him your own weddingring and weep for a runaway match the most lucky of all things is the boys mothers weddingring and above all things not a word about his rival until he asksand then all mystery only you know a great deal more than you dare tell oh luke are you sure that it will all go aright miranda tell me anything we can be sure of and you will have given me a new idea and i want ideas i want them sadly my power of invention is failing me or at any rate that of combining my inventions you did not observe that i was nervous did you nervous lukeyou nervous i should think that the end of the world was coming if i saw any nervousness in you and in the presence of a boy indeed my dear wife i will give you my word that i feltwell i will not say nervous if you dislike itbut a little uncomfortable and not quite clear when i saw how kit was taking things real affection is a dreadful thing i did not want so much of it i meant to have told him who she is till the turn of things made me doubt about it but he is quite up for anything now i believe though he must be told before he goes he is such a calf that he must not imagine that she has a sixpence to bless herself he would fly off in a moment if he guessed the truth he must know her name and that you must tell him and you know how to explain it all a thousandfold better than i do possibly i do replied mrs sharp i may have some very few ideas of my own although according to you mr sharp i am only the mother of a calf very well said my dear and i have the honour of being his father they smiled at one another for they both knew how to give and take chapter xlviii masculine error christopher fermitage sharp esquire strode forth to have room as well as time for thought his comely young face was unusually red and he stroked his almost visible moustache as a stimulant to manhood so deep and stern were his meditations that he never even thought of his pipe until he came to a bridge on the botley road whereon he was accustomed to lean and smoke and gaze at the little fish quietly from the force of habit he pulled out his meerschaum flint and steel and german tinder and through blue rings of his own creation watched and envied the little fish for though it was not yet the manner of his mind to examine itself very deeply he had a strong conviction that the fish were happy and that he was miserable upon the former point there could not be two opinionsunless the fish themselves held onewhen any man observed how the little fellows jumped at the spicyflavoured flies that fluttered on fluid gold to them or flashed in and out among one another with a frolicsome spread of silver or best of all in calm contemplation softly moved pellucid fins and gently opened fans of gills with magnifying eyes intent upon the glory of the lustrous world kit considered them with an envious gaze were they harassed were they tortured were they racked with agonised despair by the proceedings of the female fish compelled to turn his grim thoughts inward he knew not that he was jealous he only knew that if he were to meet the young nobleman with the four bay horses it would be an evil day for one of them tush why should he not go and forestall that bloated unprincipled aristocratwhose intentions might even be dishonourableby having four horses himself and persuading that queen of beauty to elope with him he had given his parents due notice and if he had done what they wished by thus falling in love it could not be very much against their wishes if he made a hasty match of it but could this lovely young american be persuaded to come with him he had far too much respect for her to dream of using violence but surely if he could convince her of the peril she was in and could promise her safe refuge with a grave old lady a valued relative of his own while she should have time to consider his suit his devotion his eternal constancy his everlasting absorption into her higher and purer identity he pulled out his purse it contained four and sixpencea shilling and three halfpence for each horse and nothing for the postilions we must do it less grandly he said to himself and after all it will be better so how could four horses ever get through that wood i must have been a fool to think of it a very light chaise and pair will do ten times better at a quarter of the money i can get tick for that from old squeaker himself and the governor will have to pay it need not cost me more than half a crown and about three bob for turnpikes fifteen miles to old aunt peggys on the wycombe road once there i defy them to do what they like i am always the master of that house and i know where they keep the blunderbuss i have the greatest mind not to go home at all but complete my arrangements immediately squeaker would lend me a guinea with pleasure he is a largeminded man i am sure what a fool i was to give poor cinnaminta such a quantity of tin that dayand yet how could i help it i might have gone on like a lord but for that kit turned round and shook his head in several directions trying to bring to his mind the places where money might be hoped for than this there is no mental effort more difficult and absorbing no wonder therefore that in this contemplation he did not hear the upmail fullgallop springing the arch from the cheltenham side to make a fine run into oxford hoi there stoopid the coachman shouted for the bridge was narrow and the coach danced across it with the vigour of the wellcorded team oh kit is it climb for your hat kit kits best friendso far as he had any friends in the universityby a stroke of fine art sent the lash of his whip round the hat of the hero and deposited it ere one might cry where art thou gone on the oilcloth which sat on the top of the luggage which sat on the top of the coach which he drove like the heir of all the race of nimshi the hireling jehu sat beside him and having been at it since nine oclock last night snored with a flourish not inferior to that which the mailguard began upon his horn kit was familiar with a coach at speed as every young englishman at that time was in a twinkle he dashed at the hindboot laid hold of the handle and was up at once the guard with an eye to an honest halfcrown moving sideways but offering no help because it would have been an insult then over the hump of the luggage crawled kit and clapped his own hat on his head and between the shoulders of two fat passengers threw forth his strong arm and bonneted the spanking son of nimshi the leaders ran askew till they were caught up and the smart young driver would have thrown down the reins and committed a personal assault on kit who was perfectly ready to reply to itbeing skilled in the art of selfdefenceif the two fat passengers having seen the whole had not joined hands and stopped it tit for tat tit for tat they cried squire you began it and you have your due and so with a hearty laugh on they galloped if you should have anything to say to me cried kit as he swung himself off the early mail at the corner of his native cross duck lane you will know where to find me but you must wait a day or two for i have a particular engagement all rubbish kit come and wine with me at seven i shall have tooled home the nonpareil by then christopher though stern was placable he kissed his hand to his reconciled friend while he shook his head to decline the invitation and strode off vigorously to consult his mother to consult his dear mother meant to get money out of her which was a very easy thing to do and having a good deal of conscience kit seldom abused that opportunity unless he was really driven to it metallic necessity was on him now his courage had been rising for the last halfhour faint heart never won fair lady rang to the tune of many horses feet his dash through the air had set his spirits flying his exploit and the applause thereof had taught him his own value from this day forth he was a man of the world and a man of the world was entitled to a wife it is the last infirmity of noble and too active minds to feel that nothing is done well unless their presence guides it to doubt the possibility of sage prevision and nice conduct through the ins and outs of things if ever the masterspirit trusts the masterbody to be away and the countless eyes of the brain to give twinkle instead of the two solid lights of the head hence it was that mr sharp at sight of kit came forth to meet him although he had arranged to send the mother and thisas mrs sharp declared to her dying daywas the greatest mistake ever made by a man of most wonderful mind while she was putting away the linen come in here my boy he said to his son who was strictly vexed to see him and yearning to be round the corner there are one or two things that have never been made quite clear to your understanding we do not expect you to be too clearsighted at your time of life and so on come in that i may have a word with you christopher with a little thrill of fear once more entered the sacred den and there stood as usual while his father sat and regarded him with a lightsome smile one of the many causes which had long been at work to impair the young mans filial affection was that his father behaved as if it were not worth while to be in earnest with him as if kit sharp had a mind no riper than just to afford amusement to mature and busy intellects christopher knew his own depth and was trying to be strong too whenever he could think of it and if he did spend most of his time in sport and congenial pastime of one thing he was certainthat he never did harm to any one could his father say that much for himself aha my boy aha said the elder sharp in that very same vein which always so annoyed and vexed his son what will you give me for a little secret a sweet little secret about a young lady in whom you take the deepest interest the ingenuous youth in spite of all efforts could not help blushing deeply for he had a purely candid skin reproduced from piper ancestry and the sense of hot cheeks made him glow to the vital centres of the nobler stuff therefore he scraped with his toeswhich was a trick of hisand kept silence pocket money gone again continued his father pleasantly nothing to offer his kind papa for most valuable information courting is an expensive businessi ought to have remembered that and the younger the parties the more it costs hothouse flowers and a smellingbottle a trifle of a ring just to learn the size that being accepted the bolder brooch charmed bracelet and locket for the virgin heartno wonder you are short of cash my kit you dont know one atom about it cried christopher boiling with meritorious wrath i never gave her nothingand she wouldnt have it the double negative to be sure how forcible and how natural it is well well my boy let us try to believe you scatter all doubts by exhibiting your wealth you had five pounds and ten shillings lately and you pay nothing for anything that can be placed to your fathers credit let me see your cashbox kit this is all that i have at present said christopher pulling out his threeandsixpencefor he had given the guard a shilling but you must not suppose that this is all to which i am entitled i have ious from junior members of the university for really more than i can reckon up and every one of them will get the money from his sisters in the long vacation oh kit kit the firm ends with me i must sell the goodwill for the very worst old song if it once leaks out what a fool you are by what strange cross of reckless blood can such a boy be the future head of piper pepper sharp co mr sharp covered up his long clear head and hidfor this oncetrue emotion kit looked at the kerchief with a very queer glance he was not at all affected by this lamentation however just because he had heard it so often before and he never could make out exactly how much of him his father could manage to descry through that veil palladian well sir he said you have always told me as long as i can remember that i was to be a gentleman and gentlemen trust one another very well said mr sharp replied with a deeply irritating smile and now i will trust you young sir in a matter of importance remember that i trust you as a gentlemanfor i need not tell you one word unless i chooseand if i depart from my usual practice it is partly because you are beginning to claim a sort of maturity very well let us see if it can be relied upon you pledge your word to keep silence and i tell you what you never could find out kit was divided with his mind in twain whether he should draw the sharp falchion of his wit or whether he should rather speak honeysome words and as nearly always happens when minerva is admitted he betook himself to the gentler process very well sir he said pulling up his collar as if he had whiskers to push it down whatever i am told in confidence is allowed to go no further it is scarcely necessary for me to say that i reserve of course the final right of reference to my honour to be sure and to your ripe judgment and almost patriarchal experience kit then be it known to you aged youth that you have not shown hoar sagacity you do not even know who the lady is whom you have honoured with your wise addresses and i dont care a dn who she is cried kit so long as i love her and she loves me my son you are turbulent and hasty your wisdom has left you suddenly your manners also or you would not swear in the presence of your father sir i was wrong and i beg your pardon but i think that i learned the first way of it from you kit kit recall that speech you must have gone altogether dreaming lately my discourse is always moderate and to the last degree professional however in spite of the generous impulse which scarcely seems natural at your threescore years and ten it does seem a needful precaution to learn the name style and title of the lady whom you will vow to love honour andobey her name cried kit without any sense of legal phrase and jingle is grace holland her style is a great deal better than anybody elses and as for title such rubbish is unknown in the gigantic young nation to which she belongs her name said mr sharp setting his face for the conquest of this boy and fixing keen hard eyes upon him is grace oglander the daughter of the old squire of beckley her stylein your sense of the wordis that of a rustic young lady and her title by courtesy is missa barbarous modern abbreviation the youth was at first too much amazed to say a word for he was not quickwitted as his father was he gave a little gasp and his fine brown eyes which he could not remove from his fathers changed their expression from defiance to doubt and from doubt to fear and from fear to sorrow with a little dawning of contempt why my man is this beyond your experience of life asked luke sharp trying to look his son down but failing and beginning to grow uneasy kits face was aflame with excitement and his lips were trembling but his eyes grew stern father i hope you do not mean what you have saidthat you are only joking with meat any rate that you have not known itthat you have not done itthat you have not even left poor old mr oglander one hour wait boy wait you know nothing about it who are you to judge of such matters indeed remember to whom you are speaking if you please i have done what was right and for your sake i have done it for my sake why i never had seen the young lady before i was told that she was dead and buriedmurdered as everybody saidand the tracing of the criminals was mainly left to you i longed to help but i knew that you despised me and now do you mean to say that you did it luke sharp was a quicktempered man he had borne a great deal more than usual and now he spoke with vast disdain to be sure kit i murdered her as is proved to such a mind as yours by the fact of her being now alive what can i have done to have a fool for my son and what have i done to have a rogue for a father you may knock me down sir if you pleasefor mr sharp arose as if that would be his next proceedingyou have always used your authority very much in that manner with me i dont want to be knocked down but if it will do you any good pray proceed to it and down i go i declare after all you have got some little wit cried the lawyer with a smile withdrawing and recovering selfcommand i cannot be angry with a boy like you because you know no better oh here comes your mother your excitement has aroused her mamma you have not the least idea what a lion you have to answer for i leave him to you my dear soothe him feed him and try to find his hummingtop chapter xlix prometheus vinctus i will not die like this it is unseemly to die like this the rev thomas hardenow was exclaiming at this very time but a few miles off i hope i am not a coward altogether but the ignominy is unbearable in this den of eumaeus this sty of sycorax entangled in the meshes of a foul hognet and with hogs grunt grunt for the chorus of my woes my prometheus class is just waiting for me at the present moment so far as i can reckon here the climbing of the day and i had rendered into english verses that delicious bit of choruswith thy woes of mighty groaning mortals feel a fellowmoaning and of colchic land indwellers maids who never quail in fight and so onhow smallminded of me to forget it nowdown to and springs of holywatered rivers wail thy pitiable woe but instead of nymphs of ocean here comes that old pig again if he could only grout up that boardwhich he must do sooner or laterwhat part of me will he begin upon probably this little fingerit is so white and helpless if i could only only moveto be eaten alive by pigs well wellthere is not so very much left for them infinitely better men have had a lower end than that only i would bend my kneesif bend them i couldto the giver of all good that i may be insensible before the pigs begin his plight was a very unfortunate one but still in the blackest veil of woe there is sure to be some little threadbare placefrom so many people having worn that veiland even poor hardenow had one good lookout to wit although he had been without food for sixandtwenty hours now having been caught in the treacherous toils soon after he set his toes towards his dinner he was not by any means in the same state in which a lowchurch clergyman must have been his system was so attuned to fasting and all his parts so disciplined that cupboard was only whispered among them in a submissive manner and even his stomach concluded sorrowfully that it must be friday beyond this considerable advantagewhich could not last much longerthere was really little to console him his cowardly captors not content with the rabbitnet twined round him had swathed him also in the stronger meshes of a corded gignet and even after that black george having had the handling of his legs and discovered the vigour of their boniness was so impressed that he called outi never did heckle such a wiry chap fetch a pair of they tough thongs tickuss same as thou makest use of for ringing of the pigs my lad whishcant ee whish with my name so pat leviticus whispered sulkily but he brought the unyielding thongs wherewith the fellow and tutor of brasenose very soon had his wrists and ankles strapped and in spite of all struggles through the livelong night as firmly as a trussed hare was he fixed nevertheless he could roll a little though not very fast because his elbows stopped him for being of the sharpest they stuck into the ground which was of a loamy nature he fought with this difficulty as with every other for a braver heart never dwelled in any body whether fat or lean and he plucked up his angles from their bed of earth whenever the limits of cord would yield he knew all about the manufacture of twineso far as one not in the trade could know itbecause he had got up the subject for the sake of a whipcord of a puzzle in theocritus but this only served to make his case the worse for at that time honest string was made the dressing and the facing and the thousand other rogueries make it quite impossible to tie a good knot now and even if a strap has any leather in it its first operation is a compromise but at that stouter period bind made bound mr hardenow could roll a little but that was as much as he could do and rolling did him very little good except by way of exercise because he was pulled up short so suddenly by featheredged boarding with a coat of tar the place in which he was penned was most unworthy of such an occupant it was not even the principal mealhouse or the best treasury of wash it was not the kitchen of the tasteful pigs or even their backkitchen but something combining the qualities of their scullery and dustbin but the floor was clean and a man lying lowly so far as smell was concerned had certainly the best of the situation inasmuch as all odours must ascend to the pure ether of the exalted hardenow knew that it was vain to roll because the door was padlocked and the lower end to which he chiefly tended had a loose board lifted every now and then by the unringed snout of a very good old sow pure curiosity was her motive and no evil appetite as her eyes might tell she had never seen a fellow and a tutor of a college rolling as she herself loved to do and yet in a comparatively clumsy way she grunted deep disapproval of his movements and was vexed that her instructions were entirely thrown away ah linus linus be the cry and let the good be conqueror mr hardenow quoted as his legs began to ache henceforth if i have any henceforth how palpably shall i realise the difference between the alindethra and the circular conistra in this limited place i combine the two but without the advantages of either i take it that whether of horse or hen or human being the essential condition of revolutionary enjoyment isthat the limbs be free in my case they are not free the exhilaration which would ensue and of which if i remember rightly pliny speaksor is it aelianmy memory seems to be rolling too but be the authority what it will in my case that exhilaration is at least for the moment not forthcoming but i ought to condemn myself far rather than writers who treat of a subject with the gravity of authority that is to say if they ever tried it experimentum in corpore vili is what all writers have preferred if their own bodies were not too noble what powerful impress they might have left after such a cynical delivery as this it served him particularly right to hit in the course of revolution upon a bit of bone even harder than his own a staunch piece of noble old ossification whether of herbivorous carnivorous or omnivorous dragon such as would have brought professor buckland from christ church headlong or even professor owen from the british museum the melampus of all good dragons hardenow knew nothing about it except that it ran into him and jerked him in such a way over the ground that he got into the highest corner and gladly would have rubbed himself if good hemp had yielded room for it but this sad blow which seemed at first the buffet of the third and crowning billow of his woe proved to be a blessing in disguise inasmuch as the reaction impelled him to a spot where he descried some encouragement to work and a little encouragement was enough for him by virtue of inborn calmness long classical training and memories and pure anglocatholic discipline the young man was still as fresh as paint in a trouble which would have exhausted the vigour of a far more powerful and fiery man russel overshute for instance even in his best health would have worn his wits out long ago by futile wrath and raving hunger mr hardenow could not even guess how there came to be quite a thick cluster of pretty little holes of about the size of a swans quill drilled completely through the board against which his mishap had driven him the board was a stoutish slab of larch cut featheredged and the saw having struck upon most of these holes obliquely their form was elliptic instead of round and their axes not being at right angles to the board they attracted no attention by admitting light since the light of course entered obliquely in some parts as close as the holes of a colander in other places scattered more widely they jotted the plank for nearly a yard of its length and afforded a fine specimen of the penetrative powers of a colony of sirex gigas so often mistaken for the hornet but though as to their efficient cause he could form no opinion hardenow hoped that their final cause might be to save his life which he quietly believed to be in great peril for he knew that he lay in the remote obscurity of a sad and savage wood unvisited by justice trade or benefit of clergy here if no good spirit came or unseen genius to release him die he must at his own leisure which would be a long one and he could discover no moral to be read from his prehistoric skeleton unless it were that very low onestick to thy own business a man of ordinary mind would not have troubled his head about this post me diluvium is the strengthening sentiment of this age no fulcrum whatever for any good work and the death of all immortality hardenow would have none of that he had no idea of leaving ashes fit to nourish nothing collecting his energies for a noble protest against having lived altogether in vain he brought his fettered heels like a doubleheaded hammer as hard as his probolistic swing could whirl against the very thickestcrowded cells of bygone domicile the wooden shed rang and the uprights shook and the nose of the sow at the lower end was jarred and her feelings hurt for truly speaking her motives had been misunderstood and if hardenow had but kept pigs of his own he would have gone to work down there to help her and so perhaps have got her to release him from his toils everybody however must be allowed to go to work in his own way and to find fault with him when he tries to do his best is as all kind critics own alike ungraceful and ungracious mr hardenow worked right hard as he always did at everything and his heels had their sparables as good as new and capable of calcitration though he wore nothing stronger than oxford shoes with a bow of silk ribbon on the instep the ribbon held fast and he kicked or rather swung his feet by a process of revolution as bravely as if he had hessian boots on at the very first stroke he had fetched out a splinter as big as the scoop of a marrowspoon and delivering his coupled heels precisely where little tunnels afforded target in a quarter of an hour he had worked a good hole and was able to refresh himself with the largeness of the outer world not that he could however skilled now in rolling roll himself out of his black jail yetfor the piece punched out was only four inches widebut that he got a very decent width in proportion at least to mans average view for clear consideration of the world outside and what he saw now was a pretty little sight or peep at country scenery for the wood just here was not so thick that a man could not see it by reason of the treesas the irishman forcibly observedbut a dotted slope of bush and timber widening and opening sunny reaches out of the narrow forest track there was no house to be seen nor cottage nor even barn or stable nor any moving creature except a pig or two grouting in the tufted grass and grayheaded daws at leisure perking and prying for the good of their homecircle but presently the prisoner espied a wicketgate nearly at the bottom of the sylvan slope with a little space roughly stoned before italmost a sure sign in a neighbourhood like that of a human dwellingplace inside and when hardenows eyes recovering tone assured him of the existence of some mossgrown steps for the climbing of a horse upon either side he felt a sudden though it may not have been a strictly logical happiness from the warm idea that there must be some of the human race not far from him he placed his lips close to the hole which he had made and shouted his very loudest and then stopped a little while to watch what might come of it and then sent forth another shout but nothing came of it except that the pigs pricked up their ears and looked around and grunted and the jackdaws gave a little jerk or two and flapped their wings but did not fly and a soft woody echo of a fibrous texture answered as weakly as a boy who does not know this was pretty much what hardenow expected he saw that the wicketgate was a long way off three or four hundred yards perhaps but he did not know that his jailer tickuss cripps was the man who lived inside of it otherwise his sagacious mind would have yielded quiet mercy to his lungs for leviticus was such a cruel and cowardly blunderer that in mere terror he probably would have dashed grand brains out but luckily he was far away now and so were all other spies and villains and only a little childboy or girl at that distance nobody could say whichtoddled out to the wicketgate and laid fat arms against it and laboured with impatient grunts to push it open having seen no one for a long time now hardenow took an extraordinary interest in the efforts of this child the success or the failure of this little atom could not in any way matter to him yet he threw his whole power of sight into the strain of the distant conflict he made up his mind that if the child got out he should be able to do the like then having most accurate introspection so far as humanity has such gift he feared that his mind must be a little on the wane ere ever such weakness entered it to any other mind the wonder would have been that his should continue to be so tough but he hated shortcomings and began to feel them laying this nice question by until there should be no child left to look at he gazed with his whole might at this little peg of a body in the distance toppling forward and throwing out behind the weight of its great efforts he wondered at his own interestas we all ought to wonder if we took the trouble this little peg now in battle with the gate was a solid peg in earnest a fine little cripps about five years old as firm as if just turned out of a churn she was backward in speech as all the crippses are and she rather stared forth her ideas than spoke them but still let her once get a settlement concerning a thing that must be done to carry out her own ideas and in her face might be seen once for all that stop she never would till her own self had done it hardenow could not see any face but he felt quite a surety of sturdiness from the solid mould of attitude that heavy gate standing stiffly on its heels groaned obstreperously and gibed at the unripe passion of this little maid it banged her chubby knees and it bruised her warted hand and it even bestowed a low cowardly buffet upon her expressive and determined cheek and while she lamented this wrong and allowed want of judgment to kick out at it unjust it may have been but true it is that she received a still worse visitation the forefoot of the gate which was quite shaky and rattlesome in its joints came down like a skittlepin upon her little toes which were only protected on a sunday ototoi ototoi cried mr hardenow with a thrilling gush of woe as if his own toes were undergoing it bitter yet truly just lamentation awoke all the echoes of the woods and hills and hardenow thought that it was all up nowthat this small atom of the wooded world would accept her sad fate and run in to tell her mother but no this child was the carriers niece and a mans nieceunder some law of the lord untraced by acephalous progenytakes after him oftentimes a great deal closer than his own beloved daughter does whether or no here was this little animal as obstinate as the very carrier taught by adversity she did thusagainst the gatepost she settled her most substantial availability and exerted it and spared it not therewith she raised one solid leg and spread the naked foot thereof while her lips were as firm as any toe of all the lot against the vile thing that had knocked her about and the power that was contradicting her nothing could withstand this fixed resolution of one of the far more resolute moiety of humanity with a creak of surrender the gate gave back and out came little peggy cripps with a broad face glowing with triumph which suddenly fell into a length of terror as the vindictive gate closed behind her to get out had been a great labour but to get back was an impossibility and hardenow even so far away could interpret the gesture of despair and horror poor little thing how i wish that i could help her he said to himself and very soon began to think that mutual aid might with proper skill be compassed with this good idea he renewed his shouts but offered them in a more insinuating form and being now assured that the child was female his capacious mind framed a brief appeal to the very first instinct of all female life possibly therefore the fairer half of pig and daw creation appropriated with pleasure his address at any rate although the child began to look around she had no idea whence came the words pretty little dear little beauty etc with which the learned prisoner was endeavouring to allure her but at last by a very great effort and with pain hardenow managed to extract from the nets his white cravat or rather his cravat which had been white when it first hung down his back from the taloned clasp of the hollies by much contrivance and ingenious rollings he brought out a pretty good wisp of white and hoisted it bravely betwixt gyved feet and at the little breach displayed it and the soft breath of may which was wandering about came and uncrinkled and in little tatters waved the universal symbol of succession apostolical as well as dinnerparties little peggy happened at this moment to be staring with a loose uncertain glimpse of thought that somebody somewhere was calling her by the flutter of the white cravat her wandering eyes were caught at last and fixed for a minute of deliberate growth of wonder not a step towards that dreadful white ghost would she budge but a steadfast idea was implanted in her mind and was likely to come up very slowly it is waste of time i have lost half an hour the poor little thingi have only scared her now let me think what i ought to do next but even while he addressed himself to that very difficult problem hardenow began to feel that he could not grapple with it his mind was as clear as ever but his bodily strength was failing he had often fasted for a longer time but never with his body invested thus and all his members straitened the little girl sank from his weary eyes though he longed to know what would become of her and he scarcely had any perception at all of pigs that were going on after their manner and rabbits quite ready for their early dinner the moment the sun began to slope and a fine cock partridge who in his way was proud because his wife had now laid a bakers dozen of eggs and but for his dissuasion would begin to sit tomorrow and after that a roundnosed hare with a philoprogenitive forehead but no clear idea yet of leverets and after that as the shadows grew long a cart drawn by a horse as carts seem always to demand that they shall bethe horse of a strong and incisive stamp to use the two pet words of the day the cart not so very far behind him there as they gave word to stop at the gate to one anotherand in the cart and above the cart and driving both it and the horse thereof as abraham drove on the plain of mamre zacchary cripps and sitting at his side the fartravelled and accomplished esther chapter l feminine error meanwhile at cross duck house ever since that interview of the morning things were becoming from hour to hour more critical and threatening if mr sharp could only have believed that his son was now a man or at least should be treated as though he were and if after that the too active lawyer could only have conceived it possible that some things might go on all the better without him it is likely enough that his righteous and gallant devices would have sped more easily but luke sharp had governed his own little world so long that he scarcely could imagine serious rebellion and he cared not to hide his large contempt for the intellect of christopher or the grievance which he had always feltat being the father of a donkey and so without further probation or pledge he went forth to make his own arrangements leaving young kit to his mothers charge like a dummy to be stroked down and dressed if he had left kit but an hour before for his mother to tell him everything and round the corners and smooth the levels and wrap it all up in delicious romance as women do so easily with their power of believing whatever they wish the boy might have jumped at the soft sweet bait for he verily loved his sylvan maid but now all his virtue and courage and even temper were on the outlook and only one thing more was needed to drive him to a desperate resolve and that one thing was supplied in the purest innocence by mrs sharp though the question would never have arisen if her son had been left to her sole handling then mother i suppose said kit as simply as if he smelled no rat whatever thoroughly as he understood that race if i should be fortunate enough to marry beautiful miss oglander we shall have to live on bread and cheese until it shall please the senior people to be reconciled and help us no kit what are you talking of child the lady has l of her own and l to follow which nobody can take from her with a very heavy heart he turned away nothing more was required to settle him he saw the whole business of the plotting now and the young romance was out of it he went to the bowwindow looking on the lane and felt himself akin to a little ragamuffin who was cheating all the other boys at marbles hard bitterness and keen misery were battling in his mind which should be the first to have its way and speak this comes of being a lawyers son he cried turning round for one bad glance at his mother she said that she disliked the law i dont dislike i abhor it so you may my dear boy and welcome now this will lift you altogether beyond it your dear father may consider it his duty to continue the office and so on but you will be a country gentleman kit with horses and dogs and manton guns and a pack of hounds and a long barouche and hothouse grapes and i will come and live with you my darling or at least make our country house of it and show you how to manage things for the whole world will be trying to cheat you kit you are too goodnatured and grand in your ways you must try to be a little sharper darling with that mint of money must i but suppose that i wont have it sometimes i believe that you think it manly to provoke your mother the money ought to have been ours kit mine by heritage and justice at least a year and a half ago a moderate provision should have been made for a woman who may have her good pointsthough everybody has failed to discover themand who married with a view to jointure ten thousand pounds would have been very handsomefar handsomer than she ever was poor thingand then by every law human and divine all the rest must have come to you and me my dear now i hope that you see things in their proper light well i dare say i do he answered with a little turn of sulkiness such as he often got when people could not understand him mother you will allow me to have my own opinion as you have yours certainly kit of course my dear you know that you always have been allowed extraordinary liberty in that way no boy in any school could have more even where all the noblemens sons are allowed to make applepie beds for the masters every night my dear boy when your father was away it has rested with you and you cannot deny it to settle to a nicety what there must be for supper such trumpery stuff is not worth a thought i am now like a fellow divided in two you might guess what i am about a little it is high time for me to come forward you cannot see things perhaps as i do how often must i tell you i give you my word as a gentlemanall this is exceedingly trying of course it is kit of course it is what else could be expected of it but still we must all of us go through trials and then we come out purified not if we made them for ourselves mother and made them particularly dirty ones but i cannot talk of it what do i know a lot of things come tempting me everybody laughs at me for wondering what my mind is and everybody cheats me as you said let the governor carry on his own devices i have made up my mind to consider a good deal and behave then according to circumstances you will behave i trust exactly as your parents wish they have seen so much more of the world than you have they are far better judges of right and wrong and their only desire is your highest interest you will break your poor mothers heart dear kit if you do anything foolish now the latter argument had much more weight with young sharp than the former but pledging himself as yet to nothing he ran away to his own room to think while his mother with serious misgivings went down to see about the soup and hurry on the dinner she knew that in vaunting miss oglanders wealth she had done the very thing she was ordered not to do and she was frightened at the way in which her son had taken it mr sharp did not come home to their early dinner at halfpast one oclock indeed his wife did not expect him much and his son was delighted not to see him kit sat heavily but took his food as usual the condition of his mind might be very sad indeed but his body was not to be driven thereby to neglect the duties of its own department he helped his dear mother to some loin of mutton and when she only played with it and her knife and fork were trembling he was angered and his eyes sought hers and she tried to look at him and smile but made a wretched job of it christopher reserved his opinion about this but it did not help in any way to impair his resolution for dessert they had a little dish of strawberries from potplants in the greenhouse and as they were the first of the season the young fellow took to them rather greedily his mother was charmed with this condescension and urged him so well that in about three minutes the shining red globes ticked with gold were represented by a small ignoble pile of frilled stalks blurred with pink at this moment in walked the master of the house he had been as fully occupied as a certain unobtrusive but never inactive gentleman proverbially must be in a gale of wind the day was unusually warm for the may month and the streets of oxford dusty mr sharp had been working a roundabout course and working it very rapidly he had managed to snatch at a sandwich or twofor he could not go long without nourishmentbut throughout all his haste he had given himself with the brightest vision of refreshing joy just time to catch these strawberries at least he was sure of it but now where were they ah i see you know how to snap up a good thing cried the lawyer with a glance of contempt and wrath show the same promptitude in what has been arranged for your benefit this afternoon my boy and then you will be in earnest what you put on your dogs collars this was not the way to treat kit sharp but the lawyer never could resist a sneer even when his temper was at its best which it certainly was not just now kit looked a little ashamed for a moment but made no excuse for his greediness he was sure that his mother would do that best by this time he had resolved to avoid for the present all further dispute with his father whatever was arranged for him he would do his best to accept with one conditionthat he should be allowed to see the young lady first and test her goodwill towards him before her removal as mr sharp mildly called it was attempted his sanguine young heart had long been doing its utmost to convince him that this sweettempered and simple maid could never bring herself to the terrible cruelty of rejecting him he felt how unworthy he was but still so was everybody elseespecially the villain with the four bay horses from that scoundrel he would save her even if he had to dissemble more than he ever had done before luke sharp with his eyes fixed on his son in lofty contemplation beheld as through a grand microscope these despicable little reasonings to argue with kit was more foolish than filing a declaration against a man of straw to suppose that kit would ever really rebel was more absurd than to imagine that a case would be decided upon its merits so be it he said but of course even you would never be quite such a fool as to tell her what your father and mother have done for her good there still was a little to be done and some nicety of combination to see to and after a short consultation with his wife and particular instructions as to management of kit mr sharp rode off on his own stout horse with a heavily loaded whip and a brace of pistols because there were some rogues about chapter li unfilial at seven oclock all must be ready said mr sharp towards the close of a hurried conversation with miss patch grace oglander being sent out of the way according to established signal there is no time to lose and no ladies tricks of unpunctuality if you please we must have daylight for these horrid forestroads and time it so as to get into the london road about halfpast eight we must be in london by two in the morning the horses and all that will be forthcoming kit rides outside and i follow on horseback hannah why do you hesitate because i cannoti cannot go away without having seen that jesuit priest in the pignet wallowing it is such a grand providential workthe arm of the lord has descended from heaven and bound him in his own meshes luke i beg you i implore youi can pack up everything in an hourdo not rob me of a sight like that hannah are you mad you have never been allowed to go near that place and you never shall well you know best but it does seem very cruel after all the lack of grace i have borne with here to miss the great protestant work thus accomplished but suppose that the child should refuse to come with uswe have no letters now nor any other ministration we have no time now for such trumpery we must carry things now with a much higher hand everything hangs upon the next few hours and by this time tomorrow night all shall be safe kit and the girl gone for their honeymoon and you sitting under the most furious dustman that ever thumped a cushion oh luke how can you speak as if you really had no reverence because there is no time for such stuff now we have the strength and we must use it just go and get ready i must ride to meet my people the girl i suppose is with kit by this time what a pair of nincompoops they will be i am sure they will be a very pretty pairso far as poor sinful exterior goesand what is of a thousandfold more importance their worldly means will be the means of grace to hundreds of our poor fellowcreatures who because their skin is of a different tint and in their own opinion a finer one are debarred now hannah no time for that get ready and mind that there must be no feminine weakness if circumstances should compel us to employ a little compulsion call to your mind that the lord is with us the sword of the lord and of gideon pleased with his knowledge of holy writ he went to the place where his horse was tied and there he found a man with a message for him which he just stopped to hearken as loovin as a pair o toortle doves he hath agot her by the middle as sweet as my missus were to me afore us went to church togither black george had been set to watch kit and gracie during their private interview lest any precaution should be overlooked right heres a guinea for you my man now you know what to do till i come backto stay where you are and keep a sharp lookout can the fool in the net do without any water very well after dark give him some food bandage his eyes and walk him to and fro and let him go in banbury all right governor a rare bait he shall have of it with a little swim in the canal to clane un no hardship no cruelty cried mr sharp with his finger to his forehead as he rode away only a little wise discipline to lead him into closer attention to his own affairs black george looked after his master with a grin of admiration he sticketh at nort said george to himself as he began to fill a grimy pipe he sticketh at nort no more than i would and with all that house and lands to back un most folk with money got no pluck left for thinking of others as owneth the same ill be danged if he dothnt carry on as bold as if he slep in a rabbithole with these words he sat down to watch the house according to his orders but this mans description of what he had seen in the wood was not a correct onemuch as he meant to speak the truthfor many reasons and most of all this that he ran away before the end of it it was a pretty and a moving scene but the rabbitman cared a great deal more for the pipe which he could not smoke in this duty and the guinea which he hoped to get out of it and it happened as near as one can tell on this wise grace oglander came down the winding wooded path with her heart pitapatting at every step because she was ordered to meet somebody an idea of that kind did not please her a prude or a prim she would never wish to be and a little bit of flirting had been a great relief and a pleasant change in her loneliness but to bring matters to so stern a point and have to say what she meant to say in as few words as possible and then walk offthese strong measures were not to her liking because she was a most kindhearted girl and had much goodwill towards christopher kit on the other hand came along fast with a resolute brow and firm heavy stride he had made up his mind to be wretched for life if the heart upon which he had set his own should refuse to throb responsively but whatever his fate might be he would tread the highest path of generosity chivalry and honour and this resolution was well set forth in the following nervous and pathetic lines found in his blottingpaper after his untimelybut stay let us not anticipate these words had been watered with a flood of tears c f s to miss g o say that happier mortal woos thee say that nobler knight pursues thee while this blighted being teareth all the festive robes it weareth while this dead heart splits to lose thee ah could i so misuse thee though this bosom rent by thunder crash its last hope anchord in thee liefer would i groan thereunder than by falsehood win thee and now they met in a gentle place roofed with leaves and floored with moss and decorated with bluebells the chill of the earth was gone by and forgotten and the power of the sky come back again stately tree and graceful bush and brown depths of tangled pricklinesseverything having green life in itwas spreading its green and proud of it under this roof and in these halls of bright young verdure the youth and the maid came face to face befittingly grace as bright as a rose and flushing with true tint of wild rose drew back and bowed and then perceiving serious hurt of christopher kindly offered a warm white handa delicious touch for any one kit laid hold of this and kept it though with constant fear of doing more than was established and trying to look firm and overpowering led the fair young woman to a trunk of fallen oak here they both sat down and grace was not so far as she could wish from yielding to a little kind of trembling which arose in her she glanced at kit sideways whenever she felt that he could not be looking at her and she kept her wise eyes mainly downward whenever they seemed to be wantednot that she could not look up and speak only that she would rather wait until there was no other help for it and as for that she felt no fear being sure that he was afraid of her kit on the other hand was full of fear and did all he could in the craftiest manner to make his love look up at him he could not tell how she might take his tale but he knew by instinct that his eyes would help him where his tongue might fail at last he said now will you promise faithfully not to be angry with me oh yes oh yesto be sure said grace why should i be angry because i cant help iti give you my honour i have tried very hard but i cannot help it then who could be angry with you unless it was something very wicked it is not very wicked it is very goodtoo good for me a great deal i am afraid there cannot be many things too good for you you are simple and brave and gentle but this is too good for me ever so much because it is your own dear self grace was afraid that this was coming and now she lifted her soft blue eyes and looked at him quite tenderly and yet so directly and clearly that he knew in a moment what she had for himpity and trust and liking but of hearts love not one atom i know what you mean he whispered sadly with his bright young face cast down i cannot think what can have made me such a fool only please to tell me one thing has there been any chap in front of me how can i tell what you mean asked grace but her colour showed that she could guess i must not ask who it is of course only say its not the swell that drives the four bay horses i do not know any one that drives four bay horses and now i think that i had better go only as i cannot ever meet you any more i must try to tell you that i like you very much and never shall forget what i owe to you and i hope you will very soon recover from thisthis little disappointment and my dear father as soon as we return to englandfor i must go to fetch him graceoh let me call you grace once or twice it cant matter here in the middle of the woodgrace i was so taken up with myself and full of my miserable folly which of course i ought to have known better i must not stop to hear any more there is my handyes of course you may kiss it after all that you have done for me i am going to do a great deal more for you cried kit quite carried away with the yielding kindness of lovely fingers for your sake i am going to injure and disgrace my own fatherthough the lord knows the shame is of his own making it is my father who has kept you here and tonight he is going to carry you off miss patch is only a tool of his your own father knows not a word about it he believes you to be dead and buried your tombstone is set up at beckley and your father goes and cries over it but his lettershis letters from demerara oh my head swims round let me hold by this tree for a moment kit threw his arm round her delicate waist to save her from falling and away crept george who had lurked behind a young birchtree too far off to hear their words you must rouse up your courage said kit with a yearning gaze at his sweet burden yet taking no advantage of her rouse up your courage and i will do my best to save you from myself it is very hardit is cruelly cruel and nobody will thank me his letters from demerara cried grace having scarcely heard a word he said how could he have written them you must be wrong of such letters i have never heard i suppose they must have been forgeries i give you my word that your father has been the whole of the time at beckley and a great deal too ill to go from home too illmy father yes of courseof course how could he help being ill without me and he thinks i am dead oh he thinks that i am dead i wonder that he could dare to be alive but let me try to think a little she tottered back to the old stump of the tree and sat down there and burst forth into an extraordinary gush of weeping more sad and pitiful tears had never watered an innocent face before let me crylet me cry was her only answer when the young man clumsily tried to comfort kit got up and strode about his indignation at her deep low sobs and her brilliant cheeks like a rivers bed and her rich hair dabbled like drifted corn and above all the violent pain which made her lay both hands to her heart and squeezehis wrath made him long to knock down people entitled to his love and reverence he knew that her heart was quite full of her father in all his long desolation and was making a row of pictures of him in deepening tribulation but a girl might go on like that for ever a man must take the lead of her if you please miss oglander he said going up and lifting both her hands and making her look up at him you have scarcely five minutes to make up your mind whether you wish to save your father or to be carried away from him grace in confusion and fear looked up all about herself she had forgotten she had even forgotten that kit was near she was only pondering slowly nowas the mind at most critical moments doessome straw of a trifle that blew across do you care to save your fathers life asked kit rather sternly not seeing in the least the condition of her mind but wondering at it if you do you must come with me this moment down the hill down the hill as fast as ever you can i know a place where they can never find us we must hide there till dark and then i will take you to beckley but the young ladys nerves would not act at command the shock and surprise had been too severe all she could do was to gaze at kit with soft imploring eyes that tried to beg pardon for her helplessness if we stay here another minute you are lost cried kit as he heard the sound of the carriagewheels near the cottage on the rise above them one question onlywill you trust me she moved her pale lips to say yes and faintly lifted one hand to him kit waited for no other sign but caught her in his sturdy arms and bore her down the hill as fast as he could go without scratching her snowwhite face or tearing the arm which hung on his shoulder chapter lii unpaternal meanwhile mr sharp had his forces ready and was waiting for grace and christopher cinnamintas good uncle kershoe who spent half of his useful time in stealing horses and the other half in disguising and disposing of them although he might not have desired to show himself so long before the moonlight yet true to honour here he was blinking beneath a threecornered hat like a grandly respectable coachman the carriage was drawn up in a shady place quite out of sight from the windows and the horses having very rare experience of oats were embracing a fine opportunity in picturesque attitudes of tobacconizingif the depth of the wood covers barbarismthree fine fellows might now be seen to wit black george joe smith and that substantial householder tickuss cripps in the chaise sat a lady of comfortable aspect though fidgeting now with fat wellgloved hands mrs sharp had begged not to have to stop at home and wonder what might be doing with her own kit and the case being now one of neck or nothing her husband had let her come foreseeing that she might be of use with grace oglander for the moment however she looked more likely to need attendance for herself for she kept glancing round towards the cottagedoor while her plump and still comely cheeks were twitching and tears of deep thought about the merits of her son held her heart in quick readiness to be up and help them once mr sharp whose main good point among several others was affection for his wife rode up and in a playful manner tickled her nose with the buckskin loop of his loaded whip and laughed at her she felt how kind it was of him but her smile was only feeble now mind dear said mr sharp reining his horse as strong as an oak and as bright as a daisy feel no anxiety about me you have plenty of nourishment in your three bags keep them all alive with it everything is mapped out perfectly near wycombe without rousing any landlord you have a fresh pair of horses in a desert place called the new road in london i meet you and take charge of you may kit have his pipe on the box i am sure it will make him go so much sweeter fifty if he likes you put his sealskin pouch in you think of every one before yourself but can i get on with that dreadful woman dont you think she will preach me to death luke miranda my dear you are talking loosely you forget the great gift that you possessthe noblest endowment of the nobler sex you can sleep whenever you like and do it without even a suspicion of a snore it is the very finest form of listening goodbye you will be a most happy party when once i see you packed i shall spur on in front mr sharp kissed his hand and rode back to the cottage right well he knew what a time ladies take to put their clothes upon them and the more grow the years of their practice in the art the longer grow the hours needful still he thought miss patch had been quite long enough but what could he say when he saw her at her window with the lookingglass sternly set back upon the drawers lifting her hands in short prayer to the lord as genuine a prayer as was ever tried she was praying for a blessing on this new adventure and that all might lead up to the glory of the kingdom she besought to be relieved at last from her wearying instrumentality mr sharp still had some little faith leftfor he was a man of much good feelingand he did not scoff at his sisters prayer as a man of low nature might have done nevertheless he struck up with his whip at the ivy round her bedroom window to impress the need of brevity and the lady though shocked at the suggestion of curtailment did curtail immediately in less than five minutes she was busy at the doorway seeing to the exit of everything and presently with very pious precision she gave mrs margery daw half a crown and a tract which some friend should read to her after rubbing her glands with a rind of bacon and a wornout pockethandkerchief which had belonged to the mighty rowland hill whose voice went three miles and a half then miss patch with her dress tucked up and her spectacles at their brightest marched with a copy of the scriptures borne prominently forward and the tags of her cloak doubled up on her arm towards the carriage where grace must be waiting for her the sloping of the sunset threw her shadow and the ringdoves in the wood were cooing the peace and the beauty touched even her heart and the hushing of the winds of evening in the nestling of the wood appeased the ruffled mind to that simplicity of childhood where god and good are one but just as she was shaking hands benevolently with mrs sharp before getting into the carriage back rode mr sharp at full gallop and without any ceremony shouted wheres the girl miss oglander why i thought she was here hannah patch answered with a little gasp and i thought she was coming with you cried mrs sharp as well as my dear boy christopher i let her go to meet him as you arranged miss patch exclaimed decisively i had nothing to do with her after that is it possible that the boy has rogued me as mr sharp said these few words his face took a colour never seen before even by his loving wife the colour was a livid purple and it made his sparkling eyes look pale they must be at the cottage mrs sharp suggested let me go to look for the naughty young couple the lawyer had his reasons for preventing this as well as for keeping himself where he was and therefore at a sign from him miss patch turned back and set off with all haste for the cottage no sooner had she turned the corner than joe smith the tall gipsy emerged from the wood with long strides into the road and beckoned to mr sharp urgently the lawyer was with him in a moment and almost struck him in his fury at what he heard how could you allow it you great tinkering fool run to the corner where the two lanes meet take george with you i will ride straight down the road no stop cut the traces of those two horses you jump on one and black george on the other and off for the corner full gallop you ought to be there before the cart i will ride straight for that rotten old jolter zounds is one man to beat five of us waiting for no answer he struck spurs into his horse and stooping over the withers dashed into a tangled alley which seemed to lead towards the timbertrack no wonder mr sharp was in such a rage for what had happened was exactly thisonly much of it happened with more speed than words cripps the carrier had been put up by several friends and relations especially numbers the butcher who missed the pork trade of leviticus to bring things directly to a point instead of letting them go on in a way which was neither one thing nor the other confessing all the claims of duty poor zacchary only asked how he could discharge them he had done his very best and he had found out nothing if any one could tell him what more to do he would wear out his sunday shoes to thank them brother zak said mrs numbers with a feeling which in a less loyal family would have been contempt have you set a woman to work now have you every cripps present was struck with this and most of all the carrier mrs numbers herself was quite ready to go but a feud had arisen betwixt her and susannah as to whether threeholed or fourholed buttons cut the cotton faster and therefore the carrier resolved to take his own sister etty who never quarrelled it was found out that she required change of air and indeed she had been rather delicate ever since her long sad task at shotover now leviticus durst not refuse to receive her much as he disliked the plan the girl went without any idea of playing spy all she knew was that her brother was suspected of falling into low company and she was to put him on his mettle if she could hence it was that hardenow gazing betwixt the two featheredged boards beheldjust before he lost his witsthe honoured vehicle of cripps with empty washing baskets standing on its welcome homeward road to discharge the fair etty at her brothers gate tickuss was away upon mr sharps business and zacchary through a grand sense of honour would not take advantage of the chance by going in craft and wickedness might be in full play with them but a wife should on no account be taken unawares and tempted to speak outside her duty therefore the carrier kissed his sister in the soft gleam of the sunsetclouds and refusing so much as a glass of ale touched up dobbin with a tickle of the whip and that excellent nag after looking round for oats in a dream which his common sense premised to be too sanguine brushed all his latter elegances with his tail and fetching round his blinkers a most sad adieu to esther gave a little grunt at fortune and resignedly set off alas when he grunted at a light days work how little did he guess what unparalleled exertions parted him yet from his stable for the night for while master cripps with an equable mind was jogging it gently on the silent way and thinking how lonely his cottage would be without esther was balancing in his mind the respective charms of his three admirers mary hookham mealy hiss and sally brown of the golden cross and sadly concluding that he must make up his mind to one of the three ere longsuddenly he beheld a thing which frightened him more than a dozen wives cripps was come to a turn of the trackfor it scarcely could be called a roadand was sadly singing to dobbin and himself that exquisite elegiac needles and pins needles and pins when a man marries his trouble begins dobbin also though he never had been married was trying to keep time to this tune as he always did to sound sentiments when the two of them saw a sight that came like a stroke for profanity over them directly in front of them from a thick bush sprang a beautiful girl into the middle of the lane and spread out her hand to stop them if the evening light had been a little paler or even the moon had been behind her a ghost she must have been then and for ever cripps stared as if he would have no eyes any more but dobbin had received a great many comforts from the little hands spread out to him and he stopped and sniffed and lifted up his nose now growing more decidedly aquiline that it might be stroked and even possibly regaled with a bunch of whiteblossomed clover oh cripps good cripps you dear old cripps grace oglander cried with great tears in her eyes you never have forgotten me zacchary cripps they say that i am dead and buried it isnt true not a word of it dear cripps i am as sound alive as you are only i have been shamefully treated do let me get up in your cart good cripps and my father will thank you for ever but missy poor missy cripps stammered out drawing on his heart for every word you was buried on the seventh day of january in the year of our lord three pickaxes was broken over digging of your grave by reason of the frosty weather and all of us come to your funeral do ee go back miss thats a dear the churchyard to beckley is a comfortable place and this here wood no place for a christian but cripps dear cripps do try to let me speak they might have broken thirty pickaxes but i had nothing at all to do with it may i get up oh may i get up it is the only chance of saving me i hear a horse tearing through the wood oh dear clever cripps you will repent it for the rest of all your life even dobbin is sharper than you are you blessed old ass cried a stern young voice as kit sharp who had meant not to show rushed forward there is no time for your heavy brain to work you shall have the young lady dead or alive pardon me graceno help for it now thickheaded bumpkin put one arm round her and off at full gallop with your old screw if you give her up i will hang you by the neck to the tail of your broken rattletrap oh cripps dear cripps i assure you on my honour said grace as tossed up by her lover she sat in the seat of esther i have never been dead any more than you have i cant tell you now oh drive on drive if you have a spark of manhood in you a horse and horseman came out of the wood about fifty yards behind them and grace would have fallen headlong but for the halfreluctant arm of cripps as dobbin with a jump quite unknown in his very first assay of harness set off full gallop over rut and rock with a blow on his back from the fist of kit like the tumble of a chimneypot then christopher sharp after one sad look at grace oglanders flying figure turned round to confront his father what means all this cried the lawyer fiercely being obliged to rein up his horse unless he would trample kit underfoot it means this answered his son with firm gaze and strong grasp of his bridle that you have made a great mistake sirthat you must give up your plan altogetherthat the poor young lady who has been so deceived let go my bridle will you am i to stop hereto be baffled by you idiot let go my bridle father you shall notfor your own sake you shall not i may be an idiot but i will not be a blackguard if by the time i have counted three your hand is on my bridle i will knock you down and ride over you their eyes met in furious conflict of will the elder mans glaring with the blaze of an opal the younger ones steady with a deep brown glow strike me dead if you choose said kit as his father raised his arm with the loaded whip swinging and counted one two threethen the crashing blow fell on the naked temple and it was not needed twice dashing the rowels into his horse whose knees struck the boy in the chest as he fell and hurled him among the bushes the lawyer without even looking round rode madly after zacchary dobbin had won a good start by this time and was round the corner doing great wonders for his time of lifetossing the tubs and the baskets and grace and even the sturdy carrier like fritters in a pan while the cart leaped and plunged and the spokes of the wheels went round too fast to be counted cripps tugged at dobbin with all his might but for the first time in his life the old horse rebelled and flung on at full speed he knoweth best miss he knoweth best cried zacchary while grace clung to him he hath a divination of his own if he dothnt kick the cart to tatters but never would i turn tail on a single manwho is yon chap riding after us oh cripps it is that dreadful man whispered grace with her teeth jerking into her tongue who has kept me in prison and perhaps killed my father oh dobbin sweet dobbin try one more gallop and you shall have clover for ever poor dobbin responded with his best endeavour but alas his old feet and his legs and his breath were not as in the palmy days and a long shambling trot with a canter for a change were the utmost he could compass he wagged his grey tail in brief expostulation conveying that he could go no faster now for it said cripps as the foe overhauled them i never was afeard of one man yet and i dont mane to begin at this time of life missy go down into the body of the cart her rideth aisily enough by now and cover thee up with the buckingbaskets cripps will take thee to thy father little un never fear my deary she obeyed him by jumping back into the cartbut as for hiding in a basket grace had a little too much of her fathers spirit the weather was so fine that no tilt was on she sat on the rail there and faced her bitter foe that child is my ward shouted mr sharp riding up to the side of cripps while his eyes passed on from graces give her up to me this moment fellow i can take her by law of the land and i will liar sharp answered master cripps desiring to address him professionally this here young lady belongeth to her father and no man else shall have her any reasoning thou hast to come down with us will hearken as we goes along if so be that thou keepest to a civil tongue but high words never bate me down one penny and never shall do so while the lord is with me hark you cripps replied mr sharp putting his lips to the carriers ear and whispering so that grace could only guess at enormous sums of money which sums began doubling at every breathdown on the nail and no man the wiser but the devil a great deal the wiser said the carrier grinning gently as if he saw the power of evil fleeing away in discomfiture now liar sharp hath outwitted hisself what liar would offer such a sight of money for what were his own by the lai of the land you cursed fool will you die cried sharp drawing and cocking a great horsepistol your blood be on your headthen yield cripps with great presence of mind made believe for a moment to surrender till mr sharp lowered his weapon and came up to stop the cart and to take out grace in a moment the carrier with a wonderful stroke learned from long whipwielding fetched down his new lash on the eyeball of the young and ticklish horse of the lawyer mad with pain and rage the horse stood up as straight as a soldier drilling and balanced on the turn to fall back break his spine and crush his rider luke sharp in his peril slipped off and the cartwheel comfortably crunched over his left foot his pistolbullet whizzed through a tall old tree he stood on one foot and swore horribly gee wugg dobbin said cripps in a cheerful but not by any means excited vein us neednt gallop any more now i reckon the liar hath put his foot in it plaize now miss grace come and sit to front again we shall have you yet you dd old clod mr sharp in his rage yelled after him oh ill pay you out for this devils own trick you arent come to the corner yet ho ho shouted cripps liar sharp my duty to you you dont catch me goin to the corner sir if some of the firm be awaitin for me there with these words he gaily struck off to the right through a bylane unknown but just passable where the sound of his wheels was no longer heard and the mossy boughs closed over him grace clung to his arm and glory and gladness filled the simple heart of cripps meanwhile mr sharp who had stuck to his bridle limped to his horse but could not mount then he drew forth the other pistol from the near holster and cocked it and levelled it at cripps but thanks to brave dobbin now the distance was too great and he kept the charge for nobler use chapter liii this will do mr sharps young horse being highly fed and victualled for the long ride to london and having been struck in the eye unjustly and jarred in the brain by the roar of a pistol and whizz of a bullet between his pricked ears was now in a state of mind which offered no fair field for pure reasoning process a betterdisposed horse was never foaled and possibly nonesetting dobbin aside as the premier and quite unapproachable typewho took a clearer view of his duties to the provider of corn hay and straw and was more ready to face and undergo all proper responsibilities therefore he cannot be fairly blamed and not a pound should be deducted from his warrantable value simply because he now did what any other young horse in the world would have felt to be right he stared all around to ask what was coming next and he tugged on the bridle with his forefeet out as a leverage against injustice and his hindlegs spread wide apart like a merrythought ready to hop anywhere at the same time he stared with great terrified eyes now at the man who had involved him in these perils and now at the darkening forest which might hold even worse in the background mr sharp was not in the mood for coaxing or any conciliation his left foot was crushed so that he could only hop and to put it to the ground was agony his own son had turned against him and a contemptible clod had outwitted him disgrace and ruin and death stared at him and here was his favourite horse a rebel he fixed his fierce eyes on the eyes of the horse and fairly quelled him with fury the eyes of the horse shrank back and turned and trembled and blinked and pleaded softly and then absolutely fawned being a very intelligent nag he was as sure as any sound christian of the personality of the deviland far worse than that of his presence now before him he came round whinnying to his masters side as gentle as a lamb and as abject as a hangdog he allowed the lame lawyer to pick up his whip and to lash him on his poor back without a wince and to lead him when weary of that to a stump from which he was able to mount again thank you you devil cried mr sharp giving his good horse another swinging lash it is hopeless altogether to ride after the cart that part of the play is played out and done with the pious papa and the milkandwater missy rush into each others arms and as for mewell well i have learned to make a horse obey me now sir if you please we will join the ladiesgently because of your masters foot he rode back quietly along the track over which he had chased the carriers cart and his foot was now in such anguish that the whole of his wonderful selfcommand was needed to keep him silent he set his hard lips and his rigid nose was drawn as pale as parchment and the fire of his eyes died into the dulness of universal rancour no hardhearted man can find his joy in the sweet soft works of nature any more than the naked flint nurses flowers the beauty of the young may twilight flowing through the woven wood and harbouring like a blue bloom here and there in bays of verdure while upward all the great trees reared their domes once more in summer roofage and stopped out the heavens while in among them finding refuge birds before the dark fell on them filled the world with melody and all the hushing rustle of the wellearned night was settling downthrough all of these rode mr sharp and hated every one of them presently his horse gave a little turn of head but was too cowed down to shy again and a tall woman darkly clad was standing by the timber track with one hand up to catch his eyes you here cinnaminta cried the lawyer with surprise i have no time now what do you want with me i want you to see the work of your handyour only child dead by your own blow struck with cold horror he could not speak but he reeled in the saddle with his hand on his heart and stared at cinnaminta it is true she said softly come here and see it even for you luke sharp i never could have wished a sight like this you have ruined my life you have made my people thieves the loss of my children lies on you but to see your only son murdered by yourself is too bad even for such as you i never meant iti never dreamed itgod is my witness that i never did i thought his head was a great deal thicker sneerer as he was he meant no jest now he simply spoke the earnest truth in his passion he had struck men before and knocked them down with no great harm he forgot his own fury in this one blow and the weight of his heavilyloaded whip if you cannot believe she answered sternly supposing him to be jeering still you had better come here he was a kind good lad good to me and to my last child i have made him look very nice will you come or will you go and tell his mother luke sharp looked at her in the same sort of way in which many of his victims had looked at him then he touched his horse gently having had too much of rage and allowed him to take his own choice of way the poor horse having had a very bad time of it made the most of this privilege setting an example to mankind whose first thought is not sure to be of home the poor fellow pointed the white star on his forehead towards his distant stable oxford was many a bad mile away but his heart was set upon being there sleepily therefore he jogged along having never known such a day of it while he thought of his oatsieve sweetly and nice little nibbles at his clover hay and the comfortable soothing of his creased places by a man who would sing a tune to him his rider was in a very different case without one hope to turn to the rising of the moon to assuage the earth of all the long sun fever the spread of dewy light and quivering of the nerves of shadow and then the soft unfeatured beauty of the dim tranquillity coming over luke sharps road or flitting on his face what difference could they make to its white despair he hated light he loathed the shade he scorned the meekness of the dapple and he cursed the darkness out of sight of the road and yet within a level course of it there lay to his knowledge a deep and quiet and seldomtroubled forestpool this had long been in his mind and coming to the footpath now he drew his bridle towards it the moon was here fenced out by trees and thickets of blackthorn and ivy hanging like a funeral pall except that here at the lip of darkness one broad beam of light stole in and shivered on gray boles of willow and quivered on black lustrous smoothness of contemptuous water to the verge of this water luke sharp rode with his horse prepared for anything he swept with his keen eyes all the length of liquid darkness ebbing into blackness in the distance and he spoke his last wordsthis will do then he drove his horse into the margin of the pool till the water was up to the girths and the broad beams of the moon shone over them here he drew both feet from the stirrupirons and sat on his saddle sideways sluicing his crushed and burning foot and watching the water drip from it and then he carefully pulled from the holster the pistol that still was loaded took care that the flint and the priming were right and turning his horse that he might escape while the man fell into deep water steadfastly gazed at the moon and laid the muzzle to his temple justly careful that it should be the temple and the vein which tallied with that upon which he had struck his son a blaze lit up the forestpool and a roar shook the pall of ivy a heavy plash added to the treasures of the deep and a little flotilla of white stuff began to sail about on the black water in the commotion made by man and horse when mr sharp was an officeboy his name had been little bigbrains chapter liv cripps brings home the crown although the solid cripps might now be supposed by other people to have baffled all his enemies in his own mind there was no sense of triumph but much of wonder the first thing he did when all danger was past and dobbin was pedalling his old tunethreehappence and tuppence threehappence and tuppence a good horse knows what his shoes are worthwas to tie up gracie in a pair of sacks he thumped them well on the footboard first to shake all the mealiness out of them and then with permission he spread one over the delicate shoulders and the other in front across the trembling heart and throat then by some hereditary art he fastened them together so that the night air could not creep between cripps you are too good said grace if i could only tell you half the times that i have thought of you and once when i saw a sack of yours lor miss the very one as i have missed had un got a red cross thick to one sidethe lord only knows what a fool i be to carry on with such rumtums now however ill have hold of heand zummat more ere i be done with it here the carrier rubbed his mouth on his sleeve as he always did to stop himself he was not going to publish the family disgrace till he had avenged it but now miss not another word you say inside of them sacks you go to sleep the lord knows you want it dearly and fall away you cant nohow scratched you be to that extreme in getting out of satans den that tallow candles dropped in water is what i must see to none on em knows it no not one on em man or horse it cometh all the same it taketh a man to do it though i should like to see a horse do it said grace and her sleepy smile passed into sleep eager as she was to be in her fathers arms the excitement and the exertion and the unwonted shaking and passage through the air began to tell their usual tale this was the very thing the crafty carrier longed to bring about it left him time to consider how to meet two difficulties the first was to get her through beckley without any uproar of the natives the second to place her in her fathers arms without dangerous emotion the former point he compassed well by taking advantage of the many ins and outs of the leisurely lanes of beckley so that he drew up at the back door of the barton without a single sapient villager being one bit the wiser now if he only had his sister with him the second point might have been better managed because he would have sent her on in front to treat with mrs hookham and employ all the feminine skill supplied by quickness sympathy and invention as it was he must do the best he could and his greatest difficulty was with grace herself the young lady by this time was wide awake and stirred with such violent throbbings of heart at the view of divine and desirable beckley sleeping in the moonlight and at the breath of her own homedoor and haunt of her darling fathers steps that cripps had to hold her down by her sacks and wished that he could strap her so do ee zit still miss do ee zit still he kept on saying till he was afraid of being rude you are a tyrant cripps a perfect tyrant because you have picked me up and been so good have you any right to keep me from my father them rasonings said cripps in a decided tone is good but comes to nothing either you do as i begs of you missy or i turns dobbins head and back you go it is for the squires sake i spake so harsh to ee supposin you was to kill him missy what would you say arterwards oh is he so dreadfully ill as that i will do everything exactly as you tell me then get down very softly miss and run and hide in that old doorway quite out of the moonshine and stay there till i come to fetch ee still covered with the sacks the maiden did as she was told while the carrier with ungainly skill and needless cautions to his horse who stood like a rock descended then he walked into the squires kitchen with whip in hand as usual as if he were come to deliver goods the fat cook now was sitting calmly by the fire meditating to her the time of year made no difference except for the time that meat must hang and the recollection of what was in its prime and the consideration of the draught required and the shutting of the sun out when he spoiled the fire in the fire of young days when herself quite raw this admirable cook had been done brown by a handsome young methodist preacher before she understood what a bastingladle is her head was set spinning by his tongue and eyes he had three wives already but he put her on the list took all her money out of her and went another circuit the poor girl spent about a year in crying and then she returned to the church of england buried her baby and became a cook without being soured by any evil she now had long experience and a ripe style of twirling her thumbs upon her apron plaize mrs cook began zacchary entering under official privilege and trying to look full of business do ee know where to lay hand on mother hookham a vallyble piece of goods i has to deliver and must have good recate for un but lor master cripps now whatever be about it aint one of your hoxford days and us never sends out no washing youve aknowed me a long time now aint you mrs cook did you ever know me for to play trickumtrully never have you done that to my knowledge the good woman answered steadfastly though pained in her heart by the thought of one who had master cripps is known to be the breadth of his own word then my good soul will ee fetch down mother hookham it baint for the flourishes the lord amighty knows i havent got the governing of them little scrawls myself nor the seasoning amongst them as appertains to you bootifully you could a done it mrs cook but the directions here is so particular for a job of this sort you are twenty years too young oh master cripps cried the cook who made a star like that upon a pie for her manual sign well you know that the ruin of my days has been trust in eddication standing outside of it i was atook in and afore there come any pen or pencil l was gone not for a moment do i blame the word of god only them as blasphemeth it but the whole of my innard parts is turned against a papper even on a piecrust dont ee give way now dear heart alive many a time have you told me and every time i feels the more for ee quite a young ooman you be still in a way and a treasure for a young man with a whame in his throat and halfaguinea every week you might aim for roasting dinnerparties but do ee now go and fetch mother hookham down the old ooman isnt in the house master cripps she hath so many things to mind that the wonder is how she can ever go through of them a heavy weight she hath taken off my shoulders ever since here she come in virtue of her tongue but her darter can be had to put a flour to amost anything if my signs isnt grand enough to go into your hat master cripps now my dear good soul replied the carrier standing back and looking at her you be taking of everything in a crooked way you be i have a little thing to see tonort to say of kitchen in it and some sort of style pecooliar requaireth pecooliar management i do assure you and no harm will ee plaize to hearken to me now such as i have to saynot much the brave cook answered this appeal by running to fetch mary hookham in everything that now she did even with such a man as cripps the remembrance of vile deceit made her look out for a witness mary came down with a bounce as if she had never been near her lookingglass but was born with her ribbons and colour to match and her eyes shone fresh at the sight of master cripps how well you be looking my dear for sure said the carrier having as a soldier has his admiration of a pretty girl quickened by the sound of firearms and i be come to make ee look still better mary cast a glance at the cook as if she thought her one too many cripps must be going to declare his mind at last and mary had such faith in him that she required no witness who do ee think i have brought ee back asked zacchary meaning to be very quiet but speaking so loud in his pride that mary with a pale face ran and shut the door upon the steps leading to her masters quarters then she came back more at leisure and put her elbows to her sides and looked at master cripps as if she had never meant to think of him for herself and this made cripps who had been exulting at her first proceedings put down his whip and wonder not miss grace cried mary surely never our miss grace what a intellect that young woman hath said cripps aloud reflecting amost too much i be verily afeared oh no master cripps not at all too much for any one as entereth into it with a household feeling but were i right oh master cripps were i right mary hookham said cripps coming over and laying his hand on her shoulder as he used to do when she was a little wench and made him a curtsy with a glass of ale even then admiring him mary you were right as i never could believe any would have the quickness cripps hath abrought home to this old ancient mansion the very most vallyble case of goods as ever were inside it better than the crown as the young queen hath for ten months now preparing alive asked mary shrinking back towards the fire for his metaphor might mean coffins now there you go down againthere you go down answered cripps who enjoyed the situation and desired to make the most of it i thought you was all intellectbut better perhaps without too much put it to yourself now mary whether i should look like this if i had only brought the remainses oh where is her where is her wherever can her be cried mary forgetting all her fine education in strong vernacular excitement her be where i knows to find her again answered zacchary with a steadfast face it was not for any one to run in and strike a light betwixt him and his own work her might be to abingdon or to banbury proper time come i can vetch her forrard oh i thought you had got her in the house master cripps how disappointing you do grow to be sure i suppose it is the way of all men mary shed a tear and master cripps having been tried by sundry women went closer to be sure of it he was pleased at the sign but he went on with his business you desarve to know everything now can ee shut the doors without a chance of anybody breaking in mary and the cook with a glance at one another fastened all the doors of the large low kitchen except the one leading to the lane itself you bide just as you be said cripps and ill show ee something worth looking at he ran to the place where grace was hiding in the chill and the heat of impatience and he took the coarse sacks from her shoulders as if her sackcloth time was done at last then he led her to the warmth and light and she hung behind afraid of them that strange but not uncommon shyness of ones own familiar homewhen long unseencame over her and she felt for the moment almost afraid of her own beloved father but cripps made her come and both mary hookham and the fat cook cried oh my my good and ran up and kissed her and held her hands while she stood pale and mute with large blue eyes brimful of tears and lips that wavered between smile and sob does hedoes he know about me she managed to say to cripps while she glanced at the door leading up to her fathers room not he lord bless you my dear said cripps it taketh em all half an hour apiece to believe as you ever be alive miss it would never take my father two minutes answered grace he will be a great deal too glad of it to doubt you promised to bide by my diraxions the carrier cried reproachfully if ee dont i ont answer for nort of it now sit you down miss by backkitchen door to come or go either way according as is ordered now mary plaize to go and say that cripps hath come to see his worship about a little mistake he hath made mr oglander never refused to see any who came to visit him his simple straightforward mind compelled him to go through with everything as it turned up whether it were of his own business or any other persons therefore he said show cripps in here cripps was in no hurry to be shown in he felt that he had a ticklish job to carry through and he might drop the handles if himself were touched amiss and he thought that he could get on much better with a clever woman there to help him plaize your worship he began coming in with his finger to his forelock and his stiff knee sticking out dont ee run away now mary thats a dear you knows all the waybills and his worship will allow of you why cripps mr oglander exclaimed you are making a very great fuss tonight and you look as if you had been run over even if it is halfacrown cripps you are come to prove against meput it down i will not dispute it i know that you would rather wrong yourself than me the old gentleman was tired and he did not want to talk in coorse in coorse said zacchary as if every man preferred to wrong himself but the point is a different thing and mary speak up and say you know it is yes sir i do assure you now said mary the point is altogether quite a different sort of thing then why cant you come to it cried the squire is it that you want to marry one another marys face blushed to a fine young colour and cripps made a nod at her as if he meant to think of it but must leave that for another evening i never could abide such stuff muttered mary as if all the world was amade of wives and husbands the squire sat calmly with his head upon his hand and his white hair glistening in the lamplight as he gazed from one to the other with a smile of melancholy amusement it would be a great discomfort to him to lose mary hookhams services and he thought it a little unkind of her to leave him in this sad loneliness but he had not lived threescore years and ten without knowing what the way of the world is therefore if cripps had made up his mindas the women had long been declaring that he as a man was bound to domr oglander would be the last to complain or say a word to damp them the carrier himself had some idea that such was the working of the squires mind now your worship he said putting mary away to a place where she could use her handkerchief will ee plaize to hearken without your own opinion before hast heard what there be to say nayther of us drameth of doing you the wrong to take away mary while you be wanting of her you ought to have knowed us better squire and as for poor mary i aint said a word to back up her hopes of ahaving me yet now miss mary have i no that you never havent master cripps and it may come too late if it ever do come well well continued mr cripps without much terror at the way she turned her back railly your worship it was you who throwed us out reckoning of my times is a hard thing for me and a hundred and four times a year is too much for the discretion of a horse amost very well cripps said the squire in despair every one knows that you must have your time not a word will i speak again until i have your leave i calls it onhandsome of your worship to say that being so contrary of my best karaksteristicks your worship maneth all things for the best i am persuaded but speaking thus you drives me into such a prespiration the same as used to be a sweat when i was young and forced to it now doth your worship know that all things cometh in a round like a sound cartwheel to all such folks as trusts the lord i know that you have such a theory cripps you beat the whole village in theology and the learned scholar in oxford your worship he were quite doubled up about the tribe of levi but for all of their stuff the lord still goeth on making his rounds to his own right time and now his time hath come for you squire do try to speak out cripps and tell me what excites you so mary his worship is beginning to look white fetch in the peppercastor and the gallon of vinegar as i delivered last wednesday no mary no i want nothing of the kind tell himbeg himjust to speak out what he means crippsmaster cripps now cried mary in a tremble you be going too far and then stopping of a heap like his worship ought to be let into the whole of it gradooalgradooalgradooal can ee trust in the word of the lord your worship asked cripps advancing bravely can ee do that now without no disrespect to ee in two minutes more youll drive me mad between you the old squire shouted as he rose and spread his arms in the name of god what is it is it of my daughter yes yes father dearest who else could it be in the whole of the world a clear voice cried as a timid form grew clear they would go on all the night but i could not wait a moment daddy i am sure that you wont be frightened you cant have too much of your own grace can you dont let it go to your heart my darling grace will rub it for you there let me put my head just as i used and then you will be certain wont you she laid her head upon her fathers breast while mary caught hold of the carriers sleeve and led him away to the passage then the old mans weak and trembling fingers strayed among his daughters hair and he could not speak or smile or weep there you will be better directly darling she whispered looking up with streaming eyes as she felt him tremble exceedingly and her quick hands eased him of the little brooch containing her mothers hair and her own which fastened his quivering shirtfrill you wanted me to come back didnt you but not in such a hurry darlingnot in such a hurry father dear why ever dont you kiss me if you did not run away dearsay you did not run away daddy you cannot be so illminded so very wicked to your only child the old man took his childs hand in his own and soothed her down and drew her down until they were kneeling at the table side by side then they put up their hands to thank god for one another and did it not with lips but with heart and soul chapter lv smith to the rescue now in the whole of beckley village scarcely a soul under eighty years of age unless it were of some child under eight tucked up in rosy slumber failed to discuss within half an hour the miracle about grace oglander that word was first set afoot in the parish by a man of settled habits and therefore of sure authority for thomas kale had been put upon a horse when the carriers leg would not go up and ordered to ride for his life to tell squire overshute all that was come to pass this kale was a man of large wondering power gifted moreover with a faith in ghosts which often detracted from his comfort he had seen his young mistress in a halflight only when the household was called to look at her and now he was ordered to a house where a lady had died not more than a few weeks back between beckley barton and shotover grange there are two places known to be haunted the necessity for priming thomas before he started had occurred unluckily to himself alone already as he rode out of the yard a gatepost and a tree shone spectrally he felt the necessity for priming himself and prudent man as he was he saw no mischief in affording it squire overshute could not give him less than a guinea for his tidings therefore though pledged to the utmost not to speak he took the very turn which the prudent cripps had shunned and pulling up at the window of the dusty anvil gave a shout for hot ginandwater the anvil was ringing with hilarity that night and its dust if heavy sprinkling could ally it was subsiding for beckley having played a cricketmatch with islip and beaten the dalesmen by ten wicketsas needs must be with five crippses holding willowan equally invincible resolve arose to outeat the losers at the supper islip defeated but not disgraced was well represented both in flesh and cash and as mr kale called for his modest glass a generous feeling awoke in the breasts of several young men to pay for it for the wickets had been pitched in a meadow of the squires where kale had plied scythe and roller thomas kale saw that it would be a most uncandid and illiberal act to open his mouth for a negative only he firmly restricted good feeling however to three good bumpers and a bottomer pledging himself on compulsion to call on his way back and manage the duplicate but his heart was so good that before he rode off with a flout at all ghosts and goblins he took an old crony by the name upon his smock and told him where to go for a miracle now who should this be but old daddy wakeling that ancient and valued friend of cripps and one of the best men in elsfield parish daddy was forced to spend much of his time outside his own parish for the best of reasonsand a melancholy onethere was no publichouse inside of it here he was now with his fine white locks and patriarchal countenance propounding a test to our finest qualities a touchstone of ones lofty confidence or low cynicismwhether the subject should now be pronounced more venerable or more tipsy but old daddy wakeling would be the very last when getting near the middle of his third gallon to conceal from his friends any gratifying news and ere ever kales horses heels turned the corner daddys wise old lips were wagging into the ear of a crony in less than two minutes phil hiss had got the news a council was held in the longroom of the inn and a march upon the squires house and a serenade by every one who could scrape blow twang or halloa was the resolution of a moment in the thick of the rout as with good intent they approached the oldfashioned coachdoors which led to the front where they meant to be musical a short square fellow slipped out of the crowd and without observation went his way his way was to a little hut of a stable fastened only with a prong outside but holding a nice young horse who had finished his supper but was not sleepy he neighed as john smith came in for he felt quite inclined for a little exercise and he knew the value of the saying he had heardafter supper trot a mile numbers cripps was his owner in that shameful age of ownershipwhich soon will be abolished now that its prime key is gone the key of holy wedlockand the butcher had offered mr smith a ride whenever he should happen to want one the night was well up in the sky and the track of summer daylight starswept the dim remembrance of a brighter hour that hangs round a tree like a halo was gone and only little twinkles shone through bays of leafage against the tidal power of the moon and the long immeasurable stretch of silence spread faint avenues of fear mr john smith was a very brave man imagination never stirred the corpulence of his comfort what he either saw or sifted out by his own process that he believed and very little else and so he rode through light and shade and the grain of the air which is neither while the forest grew deeper with phantasm and the depth of night made way for him suddenly even he was startled in a dark narrow place where he kept the track and stuck his heels under his horses belly for fear of being taken sideways something dashed by him with a pant and roar and fire flying out of it mr smith blessed his stars that he was not rolled over as he very well might have been for that which flew by him like a streak of meteor was a strong horse frantic smith turned round in his saddle and stared but the runaway sped the faster as if he were rushing away from the forest with a pack of wolves behind him the stirrups of his empty saddle struck fire clashing under him and his swift flight scarcely left a sound of breath or hoof to follow him the devil is after him said john smith i never saw a horse in such a state of mind i may as well mark the spot where he came out he has left as sure as i sit here a tale to be told in the background without dismounting he broke off a branch of young white poplar and cast it so that by daylight he could find it and then with a very uneasy mind he rode on to trace the rest of it he was not by any means in luke sharps pay as one or two persons had suspected neither was he even of his privy council and yet he was bound hand and foot to him partly by fealty of a conquered mind and partly by sense of his brother joes complicity and subservience john smith in his own way was an honourable man and money was no bribe to him with quickened alarm he rode on at all speed towards the cottage of the swineherd never in any way had he dealt with the sylvan schemes of mr sharp or even from a distance watched them it was long ere he had any clear suspicionsfor his tall brother kept miles away from himand in seeking the remains of grace under the snowdrift he wrought out his duty with blind honesty john smiths nerves were of iron and even the riderless horse had not scattered them but though he rode on bravely still a cloud of gloom fell over him it would make a sad difference to his life if anything had happened to mr sharp for smith had invested a little money under the lawyers guidance and knowing luke sharp as he did he feared that evil had befallen him hence with dark misgiving and the set resolve to face it he lashed his horse on at a perilous rate through the wattled ways of moonlight the glance and the glimpse of light and shade flew past him like a cataract till suddenly even he was scared by the sound of his name in a sad clear voice he pulled up his horse and laid his hand on the butt of a pistol beneath his cape till a woman came forth into the light and said i was sure you would come but too lateit is too late cinnaminta show me he answered very softly knowing by her gesture that the mischief was at hand as soon as he was off his horse and had made him fast by the bridle she led him round some shadowy corners into a little dingle this had no great trees to crowd it and though it lay below the level of the wood around the moon was high enough now to throw a broad gangway of light along it the sides were fringed or jagged with darkness cumbrous tree or mantled ivy jutting forth black elbows but in the middle lay and spread fair sward of dewy emblements swept with brightness and garnished for a whitsun dance of fairies but now instead of skip and music sigh and sob and wailing noises of the human heart were heard a fine young form of the oxford build lay heavily girt with molehills enfolded vainly in a velvet cloak and vainly on every side adjured to open its eyes and come back again kit was not at all the fellow thus to be addressed in vainif he only could have heard the living voices challenge him his love of sport had been love of pluck as it generally is with englishmen and all his dogs of different sizes must have taught him something his mother now was pulling at him in a storm of fear and hope she felt that he could not be dead because it would be so outrageous and yet her feeble heart was fearful that such things had been before happily for herself she knew not what had happened to him but took it for an accident of the woods for the gipsywoman who alone had seen it had been too kind to tell the truth oh kit kit now only look the poor fond mother was going on only lift one eyelid darling only move one little handhis hands were of very considerable sizeor do anything anything you like dear just to show that you are coming back back to your own mother kitoh my kit my own and ever only kitor christopher if you like it better darlinghere have i been for whole hours and hours and not one word will you say to me if ever i laughed at you kit in my life you must have felt how proud i was there is not anything in all the world or anybody to come near you kit only comeonly be near me instead of breaking all my heart like this worn out with misery she fell back and cinnaminta with a short quick sigh knelt down on the turf and supported her four times have i had to bear it and every time worse than the time before she said in her soft clear tone to herself but only to remind herself of the tenderness she was sure to show and this was her only one and grown up her face still beautiful and lovely with the sad love in her eyes the memory of the time when still there was somebody to live for shone in the gentle light now poured abundantly on all of them of all who had lived and loved and suffered and now made shadows in the moonshine not one had been down to the holy depths of sorrow as this woman had catch un up now cried john smith who never knew how his ideas were timed catch un up by the heels one of ee while i take un by the head this here baistly hole be enow to fetch the ghost of his life out he hath got life in him dont tell me his ears be like a shell and no dead mans is rap on the nob lor bless my heart id sooner have fifty than one on the basket what all on you afeard to heckle him oh no sir oh no sir cried poor mrs sharp as tickuss and another man fell away i am not very strong but i can help my child maam you are a lady said john smith that being his very highest crown of praise but as for youa dd set of cowardsgo to the devil all of you now maam i will not trouble you except to follow after us cinny will clear the way in front it cometh more natural to her and you maam shall follow me as you please and sorry i am not to help you a little shaking will do him a world of good he was taking up kit with a welladjusted balance while he spoke to her and he wasted his breath in nothing except in telling her to follow him as the hind comes after the poor slain fawn or the cow runs after the netted cart where the white face of her calf weeps out even so mrs sharp of her dress thought nothingthough cut up like a carrot in the latest london style and trimmed with almost every flower nature never sawanyhow after kit she went and knew not light from darkness mr smith sturdily managed to get on he was thickly built and had wellset reins and though poor kit was no featherweight his bearer did not flag with him then setting the body of the lad on a mound where the moon shone clearly upon his face and the night air fanned him quietly john smith very calmly pulled out a bright weapon and flourished it and felt the edge oh no sir oh pray sir cried mrs sharp falling on her knees and enclasping her poor boy cinny just lead her behind that bush tis either death or blood with him oh no i never could bear to be out of sight if it really must be done i will not shriek i will not even sigh only let me stay by his side john smith signed to his sisterinlaw who took the mothers trembling hands and turned her away for a moment now fetch cold water that vein must not be allowed to bleed too long maam tis a ticklish one to manage for a surgeon even and at present it is sulky but it only wants a little air and just the least little touch again if you could just manage to go and say your prayers maam we could get on a long sight better oh i never thought of that how sinful of me oh kind good man i implore of you not of me maam pray to god in heaven unless you wish to see me run away and if i do he slips right off the hooks she turned away with her weak hands clasped but whether she prayed or not never could she tell but one thing she bore in mind as long as soul abode with it and that was the leap of her heart when smith shouted in a good loud voice all right chapter lvi fatal accident to the carrier now that little maid who with such strength alike of mind and body had opened the paternal gate and then bewailed her prowess happened to be the especial favourite of her good aunt esther therefore no sooner had the carrier begun his eventful homeward course as heretofore related than etty who loved a forest walk and felt rather dull without zacchary took peggys fat red hand and after a good tea with susannah set forth for an evening stroll to gather flowers and hear the birds sing almost before they had got well into the wooded places peggy shrank away from a black timber shed partly overhung by trees peggy not go there aunt etty she said goose in there a great white goose a ghost you little goose answered esther laughing for still there was good sunset come and show me i want to see a ghost no no no cried the child pulling backward and struggling as hard as she had struggled with the gate peggy see a white goose in a black hole there all day then peggy stop here while i go and look you wont be afraid to do that will you running bravely up to the hole in the boards esther saw to her great amazement the form perhaps the corpse of a man stretched at length on the ground inside it lay too much in the dark for the face to be seen and the dress was so swaddled with netting and earthy that little could be made of it a torn strip of cambric that once had been white lay partly on the body and partly on the board esther caught it up she remembered having ironed something of this shape for somebody once who was going to be examined she knew where to look for the mark and there she saw in small letterst hardenow surprised as she was she did not lose her wits or courage as she used to do she ran to the door of the shed tried the padlock and finding it fastened as she had feared made haste to the grainhouse and seized a bunch of keys not one of them truly was born with the lock but one was soon found to serve the turn then esther pushed back the creaking door and timidly gazed round the shadowy shed she was quite alone now for her little niece with short sobs of terror had set off for home in the light admitted by the open door young esther descried a poor miserable thing helpless still as a log and senseless yet to her faithful heart the idol of all adoration gently step by step she stole to the prostrate form and knelt down softly and reverently touched it she feared to seem to take advantage of a helpless moment and yet a keen joy mixed with terror shone in the eagerness of her eyes he is alive i am sure of that she said to herself as she pulled forth a pair of strong scissors which she always carried he is alive but very very nearly dead what wretches can have treated him like this in two minutes hardenow was free from every cord and throng of bondage his lax arms fell at his sides his legs that had saved his life by kicking slowly sank back to their native angles like a lobsters claw untied and his small and dismally empty stomach quivered almost invisibly oh he is starving or downright starved cried esther watching his white lips which trembled with some glad memory of suction and then stiffened again to some anglican dream after all i have blamed other folk quite amiss he hath corded himself away from his victuals to give way to his noble principles but how could he lock himself in the lord must have sent a bad angel to tempt him and then to turn the key on him before she had finished this reasoning process the girl was halfway towards the cot of tickuss her heart outweighing her mind according to all true feminine proportions she ran in swiftly upon susannah sitting in the dusky kitchen and pondering over a very slow fire the cookery of the childrens supper these good young children never failed to go to see the pigs fed and down at the styes they all were at this moment with no victuals come and the pigs all squeaking because the pigmaster was not at home this was most sad and the children felt it nevertheless they bore it knowing that their own pot was warming but they too might have squeaked if they had known that out of their own pot aunt etty was stealing half the meat and all the little cobs of jelly it was as fine a pot of stuff as ever susannah cripps had made for she did not hold at all with fattening the pigs and starving her own children and she argued most justly while esther all the while was ladling all the virtue out etty had never been known to do anything violent or highhanded yet now without entering into even the very shortest train of reasoning away she went swifter than any train bearing in her right hand the best dresserjug filled with the childrens tidbits of nurture and in her left hand flourishing susannahs own darling silver weddingspoon mrs leviticus longed to rush in chase of her but ere her slowly startled nerves could send the necessary tingle to her ruminating knees the girl was out of sight and for her vestige lingered naught but a very provoking smell of soup now in so advanced a stage of the worlds existence and of this narrative is it needful judicious or even becoming to describe spoonful by spoonful however grateful delicious and absorbing the process of administering and receiving soup to give and take is said by people of large experience in life to be about the latest and most consummate lesson of humanity coming even after that extreme of wisdom which teaches us to grin and bear it but in the present trifling instance two young people very soon began to be comparatively at home with the subject the opening of the eyes in all countries and creatures is done a good deal later than the opening of the mouth the latter being the essential the former quite a fortuitous proceeding after six spoonfuls as counted by esther hardenow opened both his eyes after two or three more he knew where he was and when he had swallowed a dozen and a bonus scarcely any of his wits were wanting still esther for fear of a relapse went on though her hand trembled dreadfully when he sat up with his poor bones creaking sadly and tried to be steady upon her arm but was overbalanced by his weight of brain instead of shrieking or screaming she took advantage of this opportunity and his bony chin dropping afforded the finest opening towards his interior to put it briefly he quite came round and after twenty spoonfuls vowedwith the conscience rushing for the moment into the arms of common sensethat never would he fast again and after thirty were absorbed and beginning to assimilate he gazed at esthers smiling eyes and saw the clearest and truest solution of his postulates on celibacy esther dropped her eyes in terror and made him drink the dregs and bottom with a converts zealous gulp and as it happened this was wise if any malignant persons charge him with having sold for a mess of pottage mans noblest birthright celibacy let every such person be corded up at the longest possible date after breakfast and the shortest before dinneror rather alas before dinnertimelet him stay corded and rolling about in a hoghouse as long as roll he can which never would approach mr hardenows cycle let him throughout this whole period instead of eating expect to be eaten then with a wolf in his stomach if he has one let him lose his wits if he has any and then let a lovely girl come and free him and feed him and cry over him and regard himwith his clothes at their very worst and cakes of dirt in his eyes and mouthas the imperial jove in some dictaean cavern dormant and then as the light and the life flow back and the power of his heart awakes let there manifestly accrue thereto a better gentler and sweeter heart timid even of its own pulse and ashamed of its own veracityand then if he takes all this unmoved why let him be corded up again and nobody come to deliver him esther only smiled and wept at her patients ardent words and impassioned gratitude she knew that between them was a great gulf fixed and that the leap across it seldom has a happy landing and when poor hardenow fell back in the weak reaction of a heart more fit for pain than passion she knelt at his side and nursed and cheered him less with the air of a courted maiden than of a careful handmaid in the end however this feeling like most of those which are adverse to our wishes was prevailed upon to subside and esther although of the least revolutionary and longestestablished stock in englandthat of the genuine crippses whose name originally no doubt chrysippus indicates the possession of a golden horseetty cripps finding that the heart of her adored one had in splinters opinion a perilous fissure requiring change of climate consented at last having no house of her own to come down from the tilt and go to africa for hardenow as he grew older and able to regard mankind more largely came out from many of the narrow ways which like the lanes of beckley satisfy their final cause by leading into one another with the growth of his learning his candour grew and he strove to bind others by his own strap and buckle as little as he offered to be bound by theirs therefore when two of his very best friends made a bona fide job of it and being unable to think their thoughts out got it done by deputy and sank to infallible happiness thomas hardenow pulled up and set his heels into the ground of common sense like a horse at the brink of a quarrypit and the field of reason rich and gracious opened its gates again to him herein he cut no capers as so many of the wilder spirits did but made himself ready for some true work and solid advantage to his race and so before any university mission or ploughandbible enterprise hardenow set forth to open a track for commerce and civilization and to fight the devil and slavery in the rich rude heart of africa besides his extraordinary gift of tongues he had many other qualificationsthe wiriness of his legs and stomach his quiet style of listening so that even a nigger need not be snubbed his magnificent freedom from humour an element fatal to stern convictions and last not least as he said to etty for a clinching argument his wifes acquaintance with the carrying trade happy exile how much better than home misery it is but the house of cripps sent forth another member into banishment with little choice or chance of much felicity on his part as there are woes more strong than tears so are there crimes beyond the lash when the doings of leviticus were brought to light and shown to be unsuccessful a council of crippses was held in his hoghouse and a stern decree passed to expatriate him tickuss was offered his fair say and did his very best to defend himself but the case from the first was hopeless if he had wronged any other parish than beckley or even any other as well there might have been some escape for him cruelty cowardice treason high and low perjury to his own elder brother and eternal disgrace to his birthplacethere was not a word in the mouth of any one half bad enough to use to him the carrier rose and said all he could say for the sake of the many children but weighty with piety as he was he could not stem the manyfountained torrent of the crippsic wrath the pigs of leviticus were divided among all the nephews and nieces and cousins ere ever a creditor got a hockrope or a flickwhip ready and tickuss himself unhoused unstyed unlarded and unsmocked wandered forth with his business gone like a gadarene swineherd void of swine for years and years that fine old hogfarm was the haunt of rats and rabbits never a grunt or squeak of porker ringing or rung eloquently shook the fringe of ivied shade or jarred the acorn in its cup until a third son arose and grew up to zacchary cripps hereafter all the neighbourhood lay under a cloud of fear and sadness because of what luke sharp had done not to others but himself luke sharp the greatest of all lawyersso the affrighted woodman saysmay and must alas be seen at certain moments of the forest moon rising on horseback from the black pool where his black life ended gaining the shore with a silent bound and galloping with his arm held forth as straight as any signpost to the nook of dark lane where he smote his son and then to the ruined hut wherein he imprisoned the fair lady and then to the rotting shed in which he corded and starved the great oxford scholar whether for the assertion of the law luke sharp is allowed by some evil power thus to revisit the glimpses of the moon or whether he lies in silent blackness ignorant of evilsure it is that no one cares to stay beyond the fall of dusk in that part of the forest but as soon as the lawyers wife and son by virtue of the poplar mark had found and quietly buried his disappointed corpse they made the very best of a broken business as cheerfully as could be hoped for each of them sighed very heavily at times especially when they were almost certain of hearing again round the corner or downstairs a masterful and very memorable tread therefore with what speed they might they let their fine old cross duck house and fleeing all low curiosity unpleasant remark and significant glance took refuge under the quiet roof of kits aunt peggy near high wycombe where he had hoped to lodge and woo his timid forest angel here kit found tardy comfort and recovered health quite rapidly by writing his own dirge in many admirable metres till being at length made laureate of a strictly local paperat a salary of nil per annum and some quarts of ale to standhe swung his cloak and lit his pipe in the style of better days from those whom his father had wronged so deeply he would accept no help whatever much as they desired to show their sense of his good behaviour and when the secondbest ambition of his life arrived by coachthat notable dog pabloif christopher could have sniffed lightest scent of beckley or shotover in the black dogwinkles of his nostrils the odds are ten to one that oxford never would have sighed as all through the october term she did at the loss of her finest badgerer in spite of all this obstinacy three people were resolved to make him come round and be comfortable settled and respectable to this they brought him in the end and made him give up fugitive pieces sonnets stanzas to a lefthand glove and epitaphs on a cenotaph the squire and russel and grace could not compose their own snug happiness without providing that kit should be less miserable than his poetry so they married him to a bankers daughter andbetter stillput him in the bank itself the loyalty of mrs fermitage to her distinguished husbands memory was never disturbed by any knowledge of that fatal codicil poor mrs sharp as she slowly recovered from the sad grief wrought by greed more and more reverently cherished her great husbands high repute she rejoined him in a better worldor at least she set forth to do sowithout any knowledge of the blow he had given to her sons head and her own heart kit like a man concealed that outrage and like a good son listened to his departed fathers praises but in her heart the widow felt that some of these might be imperilled if that codicil turned up long time she kept it in reserve as a thunderbolt for joan fermitage but pablos arrival improved her feelings and so did the bankers daughter and finally on kits weddingday with a sigh and a prayer she took advantage of a clear fire and a rapid draughtand the codicil flew through the chimneypot as a lawyers daughter she revered such things in the same capacity she knew that now it could make no great practical difference for grace was quite sure of her good aunts money and again as a widow and mother she felt what a stain must be cast on the name she loved best if this little document ever came to lightother than good firelight but why should esther have had no house of her own as darkly hinted above so as to almost compel her to descend from tilt to tent the reason is not far to seek and he who runs may read it without running out of beckley cripps the carrier now being past the middle milestone of mans life and seeing every day more and more the grey hairs in his horses tail lowered his whip in a shady place and let his reins go slackly and pulled his crooked sixpence out and could not see to read it and yet the summer sun was bright in the top of the bushes over him i vear a must i zee no way out of un zacchary said to his lonely self etty is as good as gone aready her cannot stan out agin

wear out therefore his domestics hath first claim though id soonder draive dobbin than ten of un what shall us do now whatever shall us do zacchary cripps pulled off his hat in a slow perspiration of suspense for if he once made up his mind there would be no way out of it he looked at his horse with a sad misgiving both on his own account and dobbins the marriage of the master might wrong the horse and the horse might no more be the masters suddenly a bright idea struck hima bar of sunshine through the shade thou shalt zettle it dobbin he cried leaning over and stroking his gingery loins it consarneth thee most or leastways quite as much never hath any man had a better horse the will of the lord takes the strength out of all of us but he leaveth and addeth to the wisdom therein dobbin thou seest things as never men can tell of now if thou waggest thy tail to the righti will and so be to the lefti wunt mind what thou doest now call upon thy wisdom nag and give thy master honestly the sense of thy discretion with a settled mind and no disturbance he awaited the delivery of dobbins tail a fly settled on the white foam of the harness on the off side of this ancient horse away
