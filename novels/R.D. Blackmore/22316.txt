frida or the lovers leap a legend of the west country by r d blackmore from slain by the doones by r d blackmore copyright dodd mead and company chapter i on the very day when charles i was crowned with due rejoicingscandlemasday in the year of our lord a loyalty quite as deep and perhaps even more lasting was having its beer at ley manor in the north of devon a loyalty not to the king for the old westcountry folk knew little and cared less about the house that came over the border but to a lord who had won their hearts by dwelling among them and dealing kindly and paying his way every saturday night when this has been done for three generations general and genial respect may almost be relied upon the present baron de wichehalse was fourth in descent from that hugh de wichehalse the head of an old and wealthy race who had sacrificed his comfort to his resolve to have a will of his own in matters of religion that hugh de wichehalse having an eye to this as well as the other world contrived to sell his large estates before they were confiscated and to escape with all the money from very sharp measures then enforced by order of king philip ii in the unhappy low countries landing in england with all his effects and a score of trusty followers he bought a fine property settled and died and left a good name behind him and that good name had been well kept up and the property had increased and thriven so that the present lord was loved and admired by all the neighbourhood in one thing however he had been unlucky at least in his own opinion ten years of married life had not found issue in parental life all his beautiful rocks and hills lovely streams and glorious woods green meadows and golden corn lands must pass to his nephew and not to his child because he had not gained one being a good man he did his best to see this thing in its proper light children after all are a plague a risk and a deep anxiety his nephew was a very worthy boy and his rights should be respected nevertheless the baron often longed to supersede them of this there was every prospect now the lady of the house had intrusted her case to a highly celebrated simplewoman who lived among rocks and scanty vegetation at heddons mouth gathering wisdom from the earth and from the sea tranquillity de wichehalse was naturally vexed a little when all this accumulated wisdom culminated in nothing grander than a somewhat undersized and unhappily female childone moreover whose presence cost him that of his faithful and loving wife so that the heiress of ley manor was greeted after all with a very brief and sorry welcome jennyfried for so they named her soon began to grow into a fair esteem and good liking her father after a year or two plucked up his courage and played with her and the more he played the more pleased he was both with her and his own kind self unhappily there were at that time no shops in the neighbourhood unhappily now there are too many nevertheless upon the whole she had all the toys that were good for her and her teeth had a fair chance of fitting themselves for lifes chief operation in the absence of sugared allurements a brief and meagre account is this of the birth and growth and condition of a maiden whose beauty and goodness still linger in the winter tales of many a simple homestead for sharing her fathers genial nature she went about among the people in her soft and playful way knowing all their cares and gifted with a kindly wonder at them which is very soothing all the simple folk expected condescension from her and she would have let them have it if she had possessed it at last she was come to a time of life when maidens really must begin to consider their responsibilitiesa time when it does matter how the dress sits and what it is made of and whether the hair is well arranged for dancing in the sunshine and for fluttering in the moonlight also that the eyes convey not from that roguish nook the heart any betrayal of hide and seek neither must the risk of blushing tremble on perpetual brinks neither mustbut in a word twas the seventeenth year of a maidens life more and more such matters gained on her motherless necessity strictly anxious as she was to do the right thing always she felt more and more upon every occasion unless it was something particular that her cousin need not so impress his cousinly salutation albert de wichehalse who received that name before it became so inevitable was that same worthy boy grown up as to whom the baron had felt compunctions highly honourable to either party touching his defeasance or rather perhaps as to interception of his presumptive heirship by the said albert or at least by his mother contemplated and alberts father had entrusted him to his uncles special care and love having comfortably made up his mind before he left this evil world that his son should have a good slice of it now therefore the barons chief desire was to heal all breaches and make things pleasant and to keep all the family property snug by marrying his fair jennyfried or frida as she was called at home to her cousin albert now a fine young fellow of fiveandtwenty de wichehalse was strongly attached to his nephew and failed to see any good reason why a certain large farm near martinhoe quite a huge cantle from the ley estates which by a prior devise must fall to albert upon his own demise should be allowed to depart in that way from his posthumous control however like most of our fallible race he went the worst possible way to work in pursuit of his favourite purpose he threw the young people together daily and dinned into the ears of each perpetual praise of the other this seemed to answer well enough in the case of the simple albert he could never have too much of his lively cousins company neither could he weary of sounding her sweet excellence but with the young maid it was not so she liked the good albert well enough and never got out of his way at all moreover sometimes his curly hair and bright moustache when they came too near would raise not a positive flutter perhaps but a sense of some fugitive movement in the unexplored distances of the heart still this might go on for years and nothing more to come of it frida loved her father best of all the world at present chapter ii there happened to be at this time an old fogyof course it is most distressing to speak of anyone disrespectfully but when one thinks of the trouble he caused and not only that but he was an old fogy essentially and preeminentlyand his name was sir maunder meddleby this worthy baronet one of the first of a newly invented order came in his sled stuffed with goosefeathers because he was too fat to ride and no wheels were yet known on the hill tracks to talk about some exchange of land with his old friend our de wichehalse the baron and the baronet had been making a happy day of it each knew pretty well exactly what his neighbours little rashness might be hoped to lead to and each in his mind was pretty sure of having the upper hand of it therefore both their hearts were openbusiness being now dismissed and dinner overto one another they sat in a beautiful place and drew refreshment of mind through their outward lips by means of long reeden tubes with bowls at their ends and something burning clouds of delicate vapour wandered round and betwixt them and the sea and each was well content to wonder whether the time need ever come when he must have to think again suddenly a light form flitted over the rocks as the shadows flit and though frida ran away for fear of interrupting them they knew who it was and both of course began to think about her the baron gave a puff of his pipe and left the baronet to begin in course of time sir maunder spoke with all that breadth and beauty of the vowels and the other things which a devonshire man commands from the lord lieutenant downward if so be that ee gooth vor to ax me ai can zay wan thing and wan oney what one thing is it good neighbour i am well content with her as she is laikely enough and e wad be zo till e zeed a zummut fainer i want to see nothing finer or better than what we have seen just now sir there you be like all varthers amost no zort o oose to advaise un nay nay far otherwise i am not by any means of that nature sir maunder meddleby i have the honour of craving your opinion sir maunder meddleby thought for a while or at any rate meant to be thinking ere ever he dared to deliver himself of all his weighty judgment ive aknowed she my lord witcher ever since her wore that haigh a purty wanch and a peart one but her wanteth the vinish of the coort never do no good wiout un whan a coomth as her must to coorting this was the very thing de wichehalse was afraid to hear of he had lived so mild a life among the folk who loved him that any fear of worry in great places was too much for him and yet sometimes he could not help a little prick of thought about his duty to his daughter hence it came that common sense was driven wild by conscience as forever happens with the few who keep that gadfly six great horses who knew no conscience but had more fleshly tormentors were ordered out and the journey began and at last it ended everything in london now was going almost anyhow kind and worthy people scarcely knew the way to look at things they desired to respect the king and all his privilege and yet they found his mind so wayward that they had no hold of him the court however was doing its best from place to place in its wanderings to despise the uproar and enjoy itself as it used to do bright and beautiful ladies gathered round the king when the queen was gone persuading him and one another that they must have their own way of the lords who helped these ladies to their strong opinions there was none in higher favour with the queen and the king himself than the young lord auberley his dress was like a sweet enchantment and his tongue was finer still and his grace and beauty were as if no earth existed frida was a new thing to him in her pure simplicity he to her was such a marvel such a mirror of the skies as a maid can only dream of in the full moon of st john little dainty glance and flushing and the fear to look too much and the stealthy joy of feeling that there must be something meant yet the terror of believing anything in earnest and the hope that after all there may be nought to come of it and when this hope seems over true the hollow of the heart behind it and the longing to be at home with anyone to love oneselftime is wasted in recounting this that always must be enough that frida loved this gallant from the depths of her pure heart while he admired and loved her to the best of his ability chapter iii the worthy baron was not of a versatile complexion when his mind was quite made up he carried out the whole of it but he could not now make up his mind upon either of two questions of these questions one was thisshould he fight for the king or against him in the struggle now begun by hereditary instincts he was stanch for liberty for letting people have their own opinions who could pay for them and about religious matters and the royal view of them he fell under sore misgiving that his grandfather on high would have a bone to pick with him his other difficulty was what to say or what to think about lord auberley to his own plain way of judging and that human instinct which when highly cultivated equals that of the weaker dogs also to his recollection of what used to be expected in the time when he was young viscount auberley did not give perfect satisfaction nevertheless being governed as strong folk are by the gentle ones the worthy baron winked at little things which did not please him and went so far as to ask that noble spark to flash upon the natives of benighted devon lord auberley was glad enough to retire for a season both for other reasons and because he saw that bitter fighting must be soon expected hence it happened that the six great flemish horses were buckled to early in september of the first year of the civil war while the king was on his westward march collecting men and money the queen was not expected back from the continent for another month there had scarcely been for all the summer even the semblance of a court fit to teach a maiden lofty carriage and cold dignity so that lord de wichehalse thought sir maunder meddleby an oaf for sending him to london but there was someone who had tasted strong delight and shuddering fear glowing hope and chill despair triumph shame and all confusion of the heart and mind and will such as simple maidens hug into their blushing chastity by the moonlight of first love frida de wichehalse knew for certain and forever felt it settled that in all the world of worlds never had been any body any mind or even soul fit to think of twice when once you had beheld lord auberley his young lordship on the whole was much of the same opinion low fellows must not have the honour to discharge their guns at him he liked the king and really meant no harm whatever to his peace of mind concerning his henrietta and if the worst came to the worst everyone knew that out of france there was no swordsman fit to meet even with a rapier the foil of aubyn auberley neither was it any slur upon his loyalty or courage that he was now going westward from the world of camps and war it was important to secure the wavering de wichehalse the leading man of all the coast from minehead down to hartland so that with the full consent of all the kings advisers lord auberley left court and camp to press his own suit peacefully what a difference he found it to be here in midseptember far away from any knowledge of the world and every care only to behold the manner of the trees disrobing blushing with a trembling wonder at the freedom of the winds or in the wealth of deep wood browning into rich defiance only to observe the colour of the hills and cliffs and glens and the glory of the sea underneath the peace of heaven when the balanced sun was striking level light all over them and if this were not enough to make a man contented with his littleness and largeness then to see the freshened pleiads after their long dip of night over the eastern waters twinkling glad to see us all once more and sparkling to be counted these things and a thousand others which without a waft of knowledge or of thought on our part enter into and become our sweetest recollections for the gay young lord possessed no charm nor even interest dull dull how dull it is was all he thought when he thought at all and he vexed his host by asking how he could live in such a hole as that and he would have vexed his young love too if young love were not so large of heart by asking what the foreign tongue was which her people tried to speak their native tongue and mine my lord cried frida with the sweetness of her smile less true than usual because she loved her people and the air of her nativity however take it altogether this was a golden time for her golden trust and reliance are the wellspring of our nature and that man is the happiest who is cheated every day almost the pleasure is tenfold as great in being cheated as to cheat therefore frida was as happy as the day and night are long though the trees were striped with autumn and the green of the fields was waning and the puce of the heath was faded into dingy cinnamon though the tint of the rocks was darkened by the nightly rain and damp and the clear brooks were beginning to be hoarse with shivering floods and the only flowers left were but widows of the sun yet she had the sovereign comfort and the cheer of trustful love lord auberley though he cared nought for the valley of rocks or watersmeet for beetling majesty of the cliffs or mantled curves of woody bay and though he accounted the land a wilderness and the inhabitants savages had taken a favourable view of the ample spread of the inland farms and the loyalty of the tenants which naturally suggested the raising of the rental therefore he grew more attentive to young mistress frida even sitting in shady places which it made him damp to think of when he turned his eyes from her also he was moved a little by her growing beauty for now the return to her native hills the presence of her lover and the homemade bread and forest mutton combining with her dainty years were making her look wonderful if aubyn auberley had not been despoiled of all true manliness by the petting and the froward wit of many a foreign lady he might have won the pure salvation of an earnest love but when judged by that french standard which was now supreme at court this poor frida was a rustic only fit to go to school there was another fine young fellow who thought wholly otherwise to him in his simple power of judging for himself and seldom budging from that judgment there was no one fit to dream of in comparison with her often in this state of mind he longed to come forward and let them know what he thought concerning the whole of it but albert could not see his way toward doing any good with it and being of a bashful mind he kept his heart in order chapter iv the stir of the general rising of the kingdom against the king had not disturbed these places yet beyond what might be borne with everybody liked to talk and everybody else was ready to put in a word or two broken heads however were as yet the only issue so that when there came great news of a real battle fought and lost by englishmen against englishmen the indignation of all the country ran against both parties baron de wichehalse had been thinking after his crop of hay was infor such a faithful hay they have that it will not go from root to rick by less than two months of worryingfrom time to time and even in the middle of his haycocks this good lord had not been able to perceive his proper course arguments there were that sounded quite as if a baby must be perfectly convinced by them and then there would be quite a different line of reason taken by someone who knew all about it and despised the opposite so that many of a less decided way of thinking every day embraced whatever had been last confuted this most manly view of matters and desire to give fair play was scorned of course by the fairer and unfairer half of men frida counted all as traitors who opposed their liege the king go forth my lord go forth and fight she cried to viscount auberley when the doubtful combat of edgehill was firing new pugnacity if i were a man think you that i would let them do so alas fair mistress it will take a many men to help it but since you bid me thus awayhi dixon get my trunks packed and then of course her blushing roses faded to a lily white and then of course it was his duty to support her slender form neither were those dulcet murmurs absent which forever must be present when the female kind begin to have the best of it so they went on once or twice and would have gone on fifty times if fortune had allowed them thus to hang on one another all the world was fair around them and themselves as fair as any vouched the whole world to attest their everlasting constancy but one soft november evening when the trees were full of drops and gentle mists were creeping up the channels of the moorlands and snipes come home from foreign parts were cheeping at their borings and every weary man was gladdened by the glance of a bright wood fire and smell of what was over it there happened to come on a jaded horse a man all hat and cape and boots and mud and sweat and grumbling all the people saw at once that it was quite impossible to make at all too much of him because he must be full of news which after victuals is the greatest need of human nature so he had his own way as to everything he ordered and having ridden into much experience of women kept himself as warm as could be without any jealousy this stern man bore urgent order for the viscount auberley to join the king at once at oxford and bring with him all his gathering having gathered no men yet but spent the time in plucking roses and the wild myrtles of devonshire love the young lord was for once a little taken aback at this order moreover though he had been grumbling half a dozen times a dayto make himself more preciousabout the place and the people and the way they cooked his meals he really meant it less and less as he came to know the neighbourhood these are things which nobody can understand without seeing them i grieve my lord said the worthy baron that you must leave us in this high haste on the whole however this excellent man was partly glad to be quit of him and i am deeply indebted to your lordship for the grievance but it must be so que voulezvous you talk the french mon baron with a frenchman my lord but not when i have the honour to speak with an englishman ah there foreign again my lord you will never speak english de wichehalse could never be quite sure though his race had been long in this country whether he or they could speak born english as it ought to be perhaps you will find he said at last with grief as well as courtesy many who speak one language striving to silence one another he fights best who fights the longest you will come with us my lord not a foot not half an inch the baron answered sturdily ive alaboured hard to zee my best and a cant zee head nor tail to it thus he spoke in imitation of what his leading tenant said smiling brightly at himself but sadly at his subject even so the young man answered i will forth and pay my duty the rustyweathercock my lord is often too late for the oiling with this conceit he left de wichehalse and while his grooms were making ready sauntered down the zigzag path which through rocks and stubbed oaks made toward the rugged headland known far up and down the channel by the name of duty point near the end of this walk there lurked a soft and silent bower made by nature and with all of natures art secluded the ledge that wound along the rockfront widened and the rock fell back and left a little cove retiring into moss and ferny shade here the maid was well accustomed every day to sit and think gazing down at the calm gray sea and filled with rich content and deep capacity of dreaming here she was at the present moment resting in her pure lovedream believing all the world as good and true and kind as her own young self round her all was calm and lovely and the soft brown hand of autumn with the suns approval tempered every mellow mood of leaves aubyn auberley was not of a sentimental cast of mind he liked the poets of the day whenever he deigned to read them nor was he at all above accepting the dedication of a book but it was not the fashion nowas had been in the noble time of watson raleigh and shaksperefor men to look around and love the greater things they grow among frida was surprised to see her dainty lord so early she came here in the morning always when it did not rain too hard to let her mind have pasture on the landscape of sweet memory and even sweeter hope was always fluttering in the distance on the sea or clouds or flitting vapour of the morning even so she now was looking at the mounting glory of the sun above the seaclouds the sun that lay along the land and made the distance roll away hard and bitter is my task the gallant lord began with her to say farewell to all i love but so it ever must be frida looked at his ridingdress and cold fear seized her suddenly and then warm hope that he might only be riding after the bustards my lord she said will you never grant me that one little prayer of mineto spare poor birds and make those cruel gazehounds run down one another i shall never see the gazehounds more he answered petulantly my time for sport is over i must set forth for the war today today she cried and then tried to say a little more for prides sake to go to the war today my lord alas it is too true either i must go or be a traitor and a dastard her soft blue eyes lay full on his and tears that had not time to flow began to spread a hazy veil between her and the one she loved he saw it and he saw the rise and sinking of her wounded heart and how the words she tried to utter fell away and died within her for the want of courage and light and hard and mainly selfish as his nature was the strength and depth and truth of love came nigh to scare him for the moment even of his vanities frida he said with her hand in his and bending one knee on the moss only tell me that i must stay then stay i will the rest of the world may scorn if you approve me this of course sounded very well and pleased her as it was meant to do still it did not satisfy herso exacting are young maidens and so keen is the ear of love aubyn you are good and true how very good and true you are but even by your dear voice now i know what you are thinking lord auberley by this time was as well within himself again as he generally found himself so that he began to balance chances very knowingly if the king should win the warfare and be paramount again this bright star of the court must rise to something infinitely higher than a devonshire squires child a fine young widow of a duke of the royal blood of france itself was not far from being quite determined to accept him if she only could be certain how these things would end themselves many other ladies were determined quite as bravely to wait the course of events and let him have them if convenient on the other hand if the kingdom should succeed in keeping the king in orderwhich was the utmost then intendedaubyn auberley might be only too glad to fall back upon frida thinking it wiser upon the whole to make sure of this little lamb with nobler game in prospect lord auberley heaved as deep a sigh as the size of his chest could compass after which he spoke as follows in a most delicious tone sweetest and my only hope the one star of my wanderings although you send me forth to battle where my arm is needed give me one dear pledge that ever you will live and die my own this was just what frida wanted having trust as our freetraders by vast amplitude of vision have in reciprocity that if a man gets the best of a woman he is sure to give it back therefore these two sealed and delivered certain treaties all unwritten but forever engraven upon the best and tenderest feelings of the lofty human nature that nothing less than death or even greater should divide them is there one among the many who survive such process unable to imagine or remember how they parted the fierce and even desperate anguish nursed and made the most of the pride and selfcontrol that keep such things for comfort afterward the falling of the heart that feels itself the true thing after all let it be so since it must be and no sympathy can heal it since in every case it never never was so bad before chapter v lovers come and lovers go ecstasies of joy and anguish have their proper intervals and good young folk who know no better revel in high misery but the sun ascends the heavens at the same hour of the day by himself dictated and if we see him not it is our earth that spreads the curtain nevertheless these lovers being out of rule with everything heap their own faults on his head and want him to be setting always that they may behold the moon therefore it was useless for the wisest man in the north of devon or even the wisest woman to reason with young frida now or even to let her have the reason upon her side and be sure of it she for her part was astray from all the bounds of reason soaring on the wings of faith and hope and high delusion though the wintertime was coming and the wind was damp and raw and the beauty of the valleys lay down to recover itself yet with her the spring was breaking and the world was lifting with the glory underneath it because it had been firmly pledgedand who could ever doubt itthat the best and noblest lover in this world of noble love would come and grandly claim and win his bride on her next birthday at christmas she had further pledge of her noble lovers constancy in spite of difficulties dangers and the pressing need of men he contrived to send her by some very valiant messengers none of whom would ride alone a beautiful portrait of himself set round with sparkling diamonds also a necklace of large pearls as white and pure as the neck whose grace was to enhance their beauty hereupon such pride and pleasure mounted into her cheeks and eyes and flushed her with young gaiety that all who loved her being grafted with good superstition nearly spoiled their christmastime by serious sagacity she however in the wealth of all she had to think of heeded none who trod the line of prudence and cold certainty it is more than i can tell she used to say most prettily to anybody who made bold to ask her about anything all things go so in and out that i am sure of nothing else except that i am happy the baron now began to take a narrow perhaps a natural view of all the things around him in all the world there was for him no sign or semblance of any being whose desires or strictest rights could be thought of more than once when set against his daughters this of course was very bad for fridas own improvement it could not make her selfish yet but it really made her wayward the very best girls ever seen are sure to have their failings and frida though one of the very best was not above all nature people made too much of this when she could no more defend herself whoever may have been to blame one thing at least is certainthe father though he could not follow all his childs precipitance yet was well contented now to stoop his gray head to bright lips and do his best toward believing some of their soft eloquence the child on the other hand was full of pride and rose on tiptoe lest anybody might suppose her still too young for anything thus between them they looked forward to a pleasant time to come hoping for the best and judging everyone with charity the thing that vexed them most for always there must of course be something was the behaviour of albert nephew to the baron and most loving cousin of frida nothing they could do might bring him to spend his christmas with them and this would be the first time ever since his longclothed babyhood that he had failed to be among them and to lead or follow just as might be required of him such a guest has no small value in a lonely neighbourhood and years of usage mar the circle of the year without him christmas passed and new years day and so did many other days the baron saw to his proper work and took his turn of hunting and entertained his neighbours and pleased almost everybody much against his will he had consented to the marriage of his daughter with lord auberleyto make the best of a bad job as he told sir maunder meddleby still this kind and crafty father had his own ideas for the moment he was swimming with the tide to please his daughter even as for her dear sake he was ready to sink beneath it yet these fathers have a right to form their own opinions and for the most part they believe that they have more experience frida laughed at this of course and her father was glad to see her laugh nevertheless he could not escape some respect for his own opinion having so rarely found it wrong and his own opinion was that something was very likely to happen in this he proved to be quite right for many things began to happen some on theright and some on the left hand of thebarons auguries all of them however might be reconciled exactly with the very thing he had predicted he noticed this and it pleased him well and inspired him so that he started anew for even truer prophecies and everybody round the place wasborn so to respect him that if he missed the mark a little they could hit it for him things stood thus at the old ley manorand folk were content to have them so for fear of getting worse perhapstoward the end of january a d de wichehalse had vowed that his only childalthough so clever for her age and prompt of mind and bodyshould not enter into marriage until she was in her eighteenth year otherwise it would no doubt have all been settled long ago for aubyn auberley sometimes had been in the greatest hurry however hither he must come now as everybody argued even though the fate of england hung on his stirrupleather because he had even sent again with his very best intentions fashionable things for frida and the hottest messages so that if they did not mean him to be quite beside himself everything must be smoking for his wedding at the candlemas but when everything and even everybody elsesave albert and the baron and a few other obstinate peoplewas and were quite ready and rejoicing for a grand affair to be celebrated with wellsprings of wine and delightfully cordial watersmeet rocks of beef hewn into valleys and conglomerate cliffs of pudding when ruddy dame and rosy damsel were absorbed in what to wear and even steady farmers were in practice for the back step in a word when all the country was gone wild about fridas weddingone night there happened to come a man this man tied his horse to a gate and sneaked into the back yard and listened in a quiet corner knowing as he did the ins and outs and ways of the kitchen because he was that very same man who understood the women so and made himself at home by long experience in new places it had befallen this man as it always befell any man of perception to be smitten with the kindly loveliness of frida therefore now although he was as hungry as ever he had been his heart was such that he heard the sound of dishes yet drew no nearer experience of human nature does not always spoil it chapter vi when the baron at last received the letter which this rider had been so abashed to deliver slow but lasting wrath began to gather in his graylashed eyes it was the inborn anger of an honest man at villany mixed with lofty scorn and traversed by a dear anxiety withal he found himself so helpless that he scarce knew what to do he had been to frida both a father and a mother as she often used to tell him when she wanted something but now he felt that no man could administer the velvet touches of the female sympathy moreover although he was so kind and had tried to think what his daughter thought he found himself in a most ungenial mood for sweet condolement any but the best of fathers would have been delighted with the proof of all his prophecies and the riddance of a rogue so that even he though dwelling in his childs heart as his own read this letter when the first emotions had exploded with a real hope that things in the long run would come round again to my most esteemed and honoured friend the lord de wichehalse these from his most observant and most grateful aubya auberleyunder command of his majesty our most royal lord and king i have this day been joined in bands of holy marriage with her highness the duchess of b in france at one time i had hope of favour with your good lordships daughter neither could i have desired more complete promotion but the service of the kingdom and the doubt of my own desert have forced me in these troublous times to forego mine own ambition our lord the king enjoins you with his royal commendation to bring your forces toward bristowe by the day of st valentine there shall i be in hope to meet your lordship and again find pleasure in such goodly company until then i am your lordships poor and humble servant aubyn auberley lord de wichehalse made his mind up not to let his daughter know until the following morning what a heavy blow had fallen on her faith and fealty but as evil chance would have it the damsels of the houseand most of all the gentle cookmaidcould not but observe the riders state of mind toward them he managed to eat his supper in a dark state of parenthesis but after that they plied him with some sentimental mixtures and being only a man at best although a very trusty one he could not help the rise of manly wrath at every tumbler so in spite of dry experience and careworn discretion at last he let the woman know the whole of what himself knew nine good females crowded round him and of course in their kind bosoms every word of all his story germinated ninetyfold hence it came to pass that after floods of tears in council and stronger language than had right to come from under aprons fridas nurse the old herbwoman now called mother eyebright was appointed to let her know that very night the whole of it because my lord might go on mooning for a month about it betwixt his love of his daughter and his quiet way of taking things and all that while the dresses might be cut and trimmed and fitted to a size and fashion all gone by before there came a wedding mother eyebright so was called both from the brightness of her eyes and her faith in that little simple flower the euphrasia though her own lovetide was over and the romance of life had long relapsed into the old allegiance to the hour of dinner yet her heart was not grown tough to the troubles of the young ones therefore all that she could do was done but it was little frida being almost tired with the blissful cares of dress happened to go up that evening earlier than her wont to bed she sat by herself in the firelight with many gorgeous things around herwedding presents from great people and what touched her more the humble offerings of her cottage friends as she looked on these and thought of all the good will they expressed and how a little kindness gathers such a heap of gratitude glad tears shone in her bright eyes and she only wished that all the world could be as blessed as she was to her entered mother eyebright now unworthy of her name and sobbing writhing crushing anguish is a thing which even frida simple and openhearted one would rather keep to her own poor self chapter vii upon the following day she was not half so wretched and lamentable as was expected of her she even showed a brisk and pleasant air to the chief seamstress and bade her keep some pretty things for the time of her own wedding even to her father she behaved as if there had been nothing more than happens every day the worthy baron went to fold her in his arms and let her cry there but she only gave him a kiss and asked the maid for some salt butter lord de wichehalse being disappointed of his outlet thought as all his life he had been forced to think continually that any sort of woman whether young or old is wonderful and so she carried on and no one well could understand her she however in her own heart knew the ups and downs of it she alone could feel the want of any faith remaining the ache of ever stretching forth and laying hold on nothing her mind had never been encouragedas with maidens nowadaystomagnify itself and soar and scorn the heart that victuals it all the deeper was her trouble being less to be explained for a day or two the story is that she contrived to keep her distance and her own opinion of what had been done to her child and almost baby as her father had considered her even he was awed from asking what she meant to do about it something seemed to keep her back from speaking of her trouble or bearing to have it spoken of only to her faithful hound with whom she now began again to wander in the oakwood to him alone had she the comfort of declaring anything this was a dog of fine old english breed and high connections his greatgrandmother having owned a kennel at whitehall itselfa very large and wellconducted dog and now an old one going down into his grave without a stain upon him only he had shown such foul contempt of aubyn auberley proceeding to extremes of illbehaviour toward his raiment that for months young frida had been forced to keep him chained and take her favourite walks without him ah lear now she cried with sense of long injustice toward him you were right and i was wrong at leastat least it seems so lear so called whether by some man who had heard of shakspere or as seems more likely from his peculiar way of contemplating the world at his own angle shook his ears when thus addressed and looked too wise for any dog to even sniff his wisdom frida now allowed this dog to lead the way and she would follow careless of whatever mischief might be in the road for them so he led her without care or even thought on her part to a hut upon the beach of woody bay where albert had set up his staff to think of her and watch her this her cousin and true lover had been grieving for her sorrow to the utmost power of a man who wanted her himself it may have been beyond his power to help saying to himself sometimes how this serves her right for making such a laughingstock of me nevertheless he did his utmost to be truly sorrowful and now as he came forth to meet her in his fishing dress and boots as different a figure as could be from aubyn auberley memories of childish troubles and of strong protection thrilled her with a helpless hope of something to be done for her so she looked at him and let him see the state her eyes were in with constant crying when there was not anyone to notice it also she allowed him to be certain what her hands were like and to be surprised how much she had fallen away in her figure neither was she quite as proud as might have been expected to keep her voice from trembling or her plundered heart from sobbing only let not anybody say a word to comfort her anything but that she now could bear as she bore everything it was of course the proper thing for everyone to scorn her that of course she had fully earned and met it therefore with disdain only she could almost hate anybody who tried to comfort her albert de wichehalse with a sudden start of intuition saw what her father had been unable to descry or even dream the worthy barons time of life for fervid thoughts was over for him despairing love was but a poets fiction or a joke against a pale young lady but albert felt from his own case from burning jealousy suppressed and cold neglect put up with and all the other manypointed aches of vain devotion how sad must be the state of things when plighted faith was shattered also and great ridicule left behind with only a young girl to face it motherless and having none to stroke dishevelled hair and coax the troubles by the firelight however this good fellow did the utmost he could do for her love and pity led him into dainty loving kindness and when he could not find his way to say the right thing he did betterhe left her to say it and so well did he move her courage in his old protective way without a word that could offend her or depreciate her love that she for the moment like a woman wondered at her own despair also like a woman glancing into this and that instead of any steadfast gazing she had wholesome change of view winning sudden insight into alberts thoughts concerning her of course she made up her mind at once although her heart was aching so for want of any tenant in a moment to extinguish any such presumption still she would have liked to have it made a little clearer if it were for nothing else than to be sure of something albert saw her safely climb the steep and shaly walk that led among retentive oak trees or around the naked gully all the way from his lonely cottage to the light and warmth and comfort of the peopled manor house and within himself he thought the more from contrast of his own cold comfort and untended state ah she will forget it soon she is so young she will soon get over that gay frippards fickleness tomorrow i will start upon my little errand cheerfully after that she will come round they cannot feel as we do full of these fond hopes he started on the following morning with set purpose to compel the man whom he had once disliked and now despised unspeakably to render some account of despite done to such a family for after all the dainty viscount was the grandson of a goldsmith who by brokerage for the crown had earned the balls of his coronet in quest of this gay fellow went the stern and solid albert leaving not a word about his purpose there behind him but allowing everybody to believe what all found out all found out as he expected that he was gone to sell his hay perhaps as far as taunton and all the parish looking forward to great rise of forage felt indignant that he had not doubled his price and let them think alackaday and all the year round that men perceive not how the women differ from them in the very source of thought albert never dreamed that his cousin after doing so long without him had now relapsed quite suddenly into her childish dependence upon him and when she heard on the following day that he was gone for the lofty purpose of selling his seven ricks of hay she said not a word but only felt her cold heart so much colder chapter viii she had nothing now to do and nobody to speak to though her father did his utmost in his kind and clumsy way to draw his darling close to him but she knew that all along he had disliked her idol and she fancied now and then that this dislike had had something perhaps to do with what had befallen her this of course was wrong on her part but when youth and faith are wronged the hurt is very apt to fly to all the tender places even the weather also seemed to have taken a turn against her no wholesome frost set in to brace the slackened joints and make her walk until she began to tingle neither was there any snow to spread a new cast on the rocks and gift the trees with airiness nor even what mild winters for the most part bring in counterpoisesoft obedient skies and trembling pleasure of the air and earth butas over her own loveover all the country hung just enough of mist and chill to shut out cheerful prospect and not enough to shut folk in to the hearth of their own comfort in her dull forlorn condition frida still through force of habit or the love of solitude made her daily round of wood and rock seashore and moorland things seemed to come across her now instead of her going to them and her spirit failed at every rise of the hilly road against her in that dreary way she lingered hoping nothing fearing nothing showing neither sigh nor tear only seeking to go somewhere and be lost from self and sorrow in the cloudy and dark day often thus the soft low moaning of the sea encompassed her where she stood in forgotten beauty careless of the wind and wave the short uneasy heave of waters in among the kelpy rocks flowing from no swell or furrow on the misty glass of sea but like a pulse of discontent and longing to go further after the turn the little rattle of invaded pebbles the lithe relapse and soft shampooing lambency of oarweed then the lavered boulders pouring gritty runnels back again and every basined outlet wavering toward another inlet these and every phase of each innumerable toandfro made or met their impress in her fluctuating misery it is the only rest she said the only chance of being quiet after all that i have done and all that people say of me none had been dastard enough to say a syllable against her neither had she in the warmest faith of love forgotten truth but her own dejection drove her not to revile the world as sour natures do consistently but to shrink from sight and fancy that the world was reviling her while she fluttered thus and hovered over the cold verge of death with her sore distempered spirit scarcely sure of anything tidings came of another trouble and turned the scale against her albert de wichehalse her trusty cousin and true lover had fallen in a duel with that recreant and miscreant lord auberley the strictest orders were given that this should be kept for the present from fridas ears but what is the use of the strictest orders when a widowed mother raves alberts mother vowed that the shameless jilt should hear it out and slipped her guards and waylaid frida on the morn of candlemas and overbore her with such words as may be well imagined auntie said the poor thing at last shaking her beautiful curls and laying one little hand to her empty heart dont be cross with me today i am going home to be married auntie it is the day my aubyn always fixed and he never fails me little fool her aunt exclaimed as frida kissed her hand and courtesied and ran round the corner one comfort is to know that she is as mad as a mole at any rate chapter ix frida knowingperhaps more deeply than that violent woman thoughtthe mischief thus put into her stole back to her bedroom and without a word to anyone tired her hair in the grecian snood which her lover used to admire so and arrayed her soft and delicate form in all the bridal finery perhaps that day no bride in englandcertainly none of her youth and beautytreated her favourite lookingglass with such contempt and ingratitude she did not care to examine herself through some reluctant sense of havoc and a bitter fear that someone might be disappointed in her then at the last when all was ready she snatched up her lovers portrait which for days had been cast aside and cold and laying it on her bosom took a snatch of a glance at her lovely self after some wonder she fetched a deep sighnot from clearly thinking anything but as an act of natureand said goodby forever with a little smile of irony to her lookingglass and all the many pretty things that knew her it was her bad luck as some people thought thereafteror her good luck as herself beheld itto get down the stairs and out of the house without anyone being the wiser for the widow de wichehalse alberts mother had not been content with sealing the doom of this poor maiden but in that highly excited state which was to be expected hurried into the house to beard the worthy baron in his den there she found him and although he said and did all sympathy the strain of parental feelings could not yield without hysterics all the servants and especially mother eyebright whose chief duty now was to watch frida were called by the terrified baron and with one unanimous rush replied so that the daughter of the house left it without notice and before any glances was out of sight in the rough ground where the deer were feeding and the umber oakleaves hung it was the dainty time when first the year begins to have a little hope of meaning kindlywhen in the quiet places often free from any haste of wind or hindrances of pattering thaw small and unimportant flowers have a little knack of dreaming that the world expects them therefore neither do they wait for leaves to introduce them nor much weather to encourage but in shelfy corners come in a day or in a nightno man knows quite which it is and there they are as if by magic asking am i welcome and if anybody sees them he is sure to answer yes frida in the sheltered corners and the sunny nooks of rock saw a few of these little things delicately trespassing upon the petulance of spring also though her troubles wrapped her with an icy mantle softer breath of nature came and sighed for her to listen to it and to make the best of all that is not past the sighing more than once she stopped to listen in the hush of the timid south wind creeping through the dishevelled wood and once but only once she was glad to see her first primrose and last and stooped to pluck but on second thoughts left it to outblossom her so past many a briered rock and dingle buff with littered fern green holly copse where lurked the woodcock and arcades of zigzag oak frida kept her bridal robe from spot or rent or blemish passing all these little pleadings of the life she had always loved at last she turned the craggy corner into the ledge of the windy cliff now below her there was nothing but repose from shallow thought rest from all the little troubles she had made so much of deep eternal satisfaction in the arms of something vast but all the same she did not feel quite ready for the great jump yet the tide was in and she must wait at least until it began to turn otherwise her white satin velvet would have all its pile set wrong if ever anybody found her there could be no worse luck than that for any bride on her weddingday therefore up the rockwalk frida kept very close to the landward side all this way she thought of pretty little things said to her in the early days of love many things that made her smile because they had gone so otherwise and one or two that would have fetched her tears if she had any filled with vain remembrance thus and counting up the many presents sent to her for this occasion but remaining safe at home frida came to the little coving bower just inside the point where she could go no further here she had received the pledges and the plight and honour and here her light head led her on to look for something faithful when the tide turns i shall know it if he does not come by that time there will be no more to do it will be too late for weddings for the tide turns at twelve oclock how calm and peaceful is the sea how happy are the sea gulls and how true to one another she stood where if she had cared for life it would have been certain death to stand so giddy was the height and the rock beneath her feet so slippery the craggy headland duty point well known to every navigator of that rockbound coast commands the channel for many a league facing eastward the castle rock and countisbury foreland and westward highveer point across the secluded cove of leymouth with one sheer fall of a hundred fathoms the stern cliff meets the baffled seaor met it then but now the level of the tide is lowering air and sea were still and quiet the murmur of the multitudinous wavelets could not climb the cliff but loops and curves of snowy braiding on the dark gray water showed the set of tide and shift of current in and out the buried rocks standing in the void of fear and gazing into the deep of death frida loved the pair of sea gulls hovering halfway between her and the soft gray sea these good birds had found a place well suited for their nesting and sweetly screamed to one another that it was a contract frida watched how proud they were and how they kept their strong wings sailing and their gray backs flat and quivering while with buoyant bosom each made circles round the other as she watched she saw the turning of the tide below them the streaky bends of curdled water lately true as fairyrings stopped and wavered and drew inward on their flowing curves and outward on the side toward the ebb then the south wind brought the distant toll of her fathers turretclock striking noon with slow deliberation and dead certainty frida made one little turn toward her bower behind the cliff where the many sweet words spoken drew her to this last of hope all was silent there was no one now was the time to go home at last suddenly she felt a heavy drag upon her velvet skirt ancient lear had escaped from the chain she had put on him and more trusty than mankind was come to keep his faith with her you fine old dog it is too late the clock has struck the tide has turned there is no one left to care for me and i have ruined everyone goodby you only true one submissive as he always was the ancient dog lay down when touched and drew his grizzled eyelids meekly over his dim and sunken eyes before he lifted them again frida was below the sea gulls and beneath the waves they fished lear with a puzzled sniff arose and shook his head and peered with his old eyes full of wistful wonder down the fearful precipice seeing something he made his mind up gave one long reechoed howl then tossed his mane like a tawny wave and followed down the deathleap neither body was ever found and the whole of this might not have been known so clearly as it is known unless it had happened that mother eyebright growing uneasy came round the corner just in time to be too late she like a sensible woman never dreamed of jumping after them but ran home so fast that she could not walk to church for three months afterward and when her breath came back was enabled to tell tenfold of all she had seen one of the strangest things in life is the way in which we mortals take the great and fatal blows of life for instance the baron was suddenly told while waiting for frida to sit beside him at his one oclock dinner plaize my lard your lardships darter hath a been and jumped off duty point what an undutiful thing to do was the first thing lord de wichehalse said and those who knew no better thought that this was how he took it aubyn auberley however took a different measure of a brokenhearted fathers strength for the baron buckled on the armour of a century ago which had served his grandsire through hard blows in foreign battles and with a few of his trusty servants rode to join the parliament it happened so that he could not make redress of his ruined life until the middle of the summer then at last his chance came to him and he did not waste it viscount auberley who had so often slipped away and laughed at him was brought to bay beneath a tree in the famous fight of lansdowne the young man offered to hold parley but the old man had no words his snowy hair and rugged forehead hardset mouth and lifted arm were enough to show his meaning the gallant being so skilled of fence thought to play with this old man as he had with his daughter but the gueldres ax cleft his curly head and split what little brain it takes to fool a trusting maiden so in early life deceiver and deceived were quit of harm and may ere now have both found out whether it is better to inflict the wrong or suffer it
