intelligence chapter i introductory near the end of february i think about the th or so though it dont much matter i only know it was near the latter end of summer burning hot with the bushfires raging like volcanoes on the ranges and the river reduced to a slender stream of water almost lost upon the broad white flats of quartz shingle it was the end of february i said when major buckley captain brentwood formerly of the artillery and i geoffry hamlyn sat together over our wine in the veranda at baroona gazing sleepily on the grey plains that rolled away east and northeast towards the sea we had sat silent for some time too lazy to speak almost to think the beautiful flowergarden which lay before us sloping towards the river looked rather brown and sere after the hot winds although the orangetrees were still green enough and vast clusters of purple grapes were ripening rapidly among the yellowing vineleaves on the whole however the garden was but a poor subject of contemplation for one who remembered it in all its full november beauty and so my eye travelled away to the left to a broad paddock of yellow grass which bounded the garden on that side and there i watched an old horse feeding a very old horse indeed a horse which seemed to have reached the utmost bounds of equine existence and yet such a beautiful beast even as i looked some wild young colts were let out of the stockyard and came galloping and whinnying towards him and then it was a sight to see the old fellow as he trotted towards them with his nose in the air and his tail arched throwing his legs out before him with the ease and grace of a fouryearold and making me regret that he wasnt my property and ten years youngeraltogether even then one of the finest horses of his class i had ever seen and suddenly a thought came over me and i grew animated major buckley i said what horse is that what horse is that repeated the major very slowly why my good fellow old widderin to be sure bless me i said you dont mean to say that that old horse is alive still he looks like it said the major hed carry you a mile or two yet i thought he had died while i was in england i said ah major that horses history would be worth writing if you began answered the major to write the history of the horse you must write also the history of every body who was concerned in those circumstances which caused sam to take a certain famous ride upon him and you would find that the history of the horse would be reduced into very small compass and that the rest of your book would assume proportions too vast for the human intellect to grasp how so i said he entered into certain details which i will not give you would have he said to begin at the end of the last century and bring one gradually on to the present time good heavens just consider i think you exaggerate i said not at all he answered you must begin the histories of the buckley and thornton families in the last generation the brentwoods also must not be omittedwhy theres work for several years what do you say brentwood the work of a lifetime said the captain but suppose i were to write a simple narrative of the principal events in the histories of the three families which no one is more able to do than myself seeing that nothing important has ever happened without my hearing of ithow i say would you like that if it amused you to write it i am sure it would amuse us to read it said the major but you are rather old to turn author said captain brentwood youll make a failure of it in fact youll never get through with it i replied not but went into my bedroom and returning with a thick roll of papers threw it on the flooras on the stage the honest notary throws down the longlost willand there i stood for a moment with my arms folded eyeing brentwood triumphantly it is already done captain i said there it lies the captain lit a cigar and said nothing but the major said good gracious me and when was this done partly here and partly in england i propose to read it aloud to you if it will not bore you a really excellent idea said the major my dearthis last was addressed to a figure which was now seen approaching us up a long vista of trellised vines a tall figure dressed in grey the figure one could see as she came nearer of a most beautiful old woman dressed i said in grey with a white handkerchief pinned over her grey hair and a light indian shawl hanging from her shoulders as upright as a dart she came towards us through the burning heat as calmly and majestically as if the temperature had been delightfully moderate a hoary old magpie accompanied her evidently of great age and from time to time barked like an old bulldog in a wheezy whisper my dear said the major hamlyn is going to read aloud some manuscript to us that will be very delightful this hot weather said mrs buckley may i ask the subject old friend i would rather you did not my dear madam you will soon discover in spite of a change of names and perhaps somewhat of localities well go on said the major and so on i went with the next chapter which is the first of the story the reader will probably ask now who on earth is major buckley and who is captain brentwood and last not least who the dickens are you if you will have patience my dear sir you will find it all out in a very short timeread on chapter ii the courtship and marriage of john thornton clerk and the birth of some one who takes rather a conspicuous part in our story sometime between the years and young john thornton then a servitor at christ church fell in love with pretty jane hickman whose father was a welltodo farmer living not far down the river from oxford and shortly before he took his degree he called formally upon old hickman and asked his daughters hand hickman was secretly well pleased that his daughter should marry a scholar and a gentleman like john thornton and a man too who could knock over his bird or kill his trout in the lasher with any one so after some decent hesitation he told him that as soon as he got a living good enough to support jane as she had been accustomed to live he might take her home with a fathers blessing and a hundred pounds to buy furniture and you may take my word for it that there was not much difficulty with the young lady for in fact the thing had long ago been arranged between them and she was anxiously waiting in the passage to hear her fathers decision all the time that john was closeted with him john came forth from the room well pleased and happy and that evening when they two were walking together in the twilight by the quiet river gathering cowslips and fritillaries he told her of his good prospects and how a young lord who made much of him and treated him as a friend and an equal though he was but a servitorand was used to sit in his room talking with him long after the quadrangle was quiet and the fast men had reeled off to their drunken slumbershad only three days before promised him a living of l ayear as soon as he should take his priests orders and when they parted that night at the old stile in the meadow and he saw her go gliding home like a white phantom under the dark elms he thought joyfully that in two short years they would be happily settled never more to part in this world in his peaceful vicarage in dorsetshire two short years he thought alas and alas before two years were gone poor lord sandston was lying one foggy november morning on hampstead heath with a bullet through his heart shot down at the commencement of a noble and useful career by a brainless gamblera man who did all things ill save billiards and pistolshooting his beauty and his strength hurried to corruption and his wealth to the senseless debauchee who hounded on his murderer to insult him but i have heard old thornton tell with proud tears how my lord though outraged and insulted with no course open to him but to give the villain the power of taking his life still fired in the air and went down to the vault of his forefathers without the guilt of blood upon his soul so died lord sandston and with him all johns hopes of advancement a curate now on l ayear what hope had he of marrying and now the tearful couple walking once more by the river in desolate autumn among the flying yellow leaves swore constancy and agreed to wait till better times should come so they waited john in his parish among his poor people and his schoolchildren busy always during the day and sometimes perhaps happy but in the long winter evenings when the snow lay piled against the door and the wind howled in the chimney or worse when the wind was still and the rain was pattering from the eaves he would sit lonely and miserable by his desolate hearth and think with a sigh of what might have been had his patron lived and fiveandtwenty years rolled on until james brown who was born during the first year of his curateship came home a broken man with one arm gone from the battle of st vincent and the great world roared on and empires rose and fell and dull echoes of the great throes without were heard in the peaceful english village like distant thunder on a summers afternoon but still no change for him but poor jane bides her time in the old farmhouse sitting constant and patient behind the long low latticed window among the geraniums and roses watching the old willows by the river fiveandtwenty times she sees those willows grow green and the meadow brighten up with flowers and as often she sees their yellow leaves driven before the strong south wind and the meadow grow dark and hoar before the breath of autumn her father was long since dead and she was bringing up her brothers children her raven hair was streaked with grey and her step was not so light nor her laugh so loud yet still she waited and hoped long after all hope seemed dead but at length a brighter day seemed to dawn for them for the bishop who had watched for years john thorntons patient industry and blameless conversation gave him to his great joy and astonishment the living of drumston worth l ayear and now at last he might marry if he would true the morning of his life was gone long since and its hot noon spent in thankless labour but the evening the sober quiet evening yet remained and he and jane might still render pleasant for one another the downward road toward the churchyard and handinhand walk more tranquilly forward to meet that dark tyrant death who seemed so terrible to the solitary watcher a month or less after john was installed one soft grey day in march this patient couple walked slowly arminarm up the hill under the lychgate past the dark yew that shadowed the peaceful graves and so through the damp church porch up to the old stone altar and there were quietly married and then walked home again no feasting or rejoicing was there at that wedding the very realization of their long deferred hopes was a disappointment in march they were married and before the lanes grew bright with the primroses of another spring poor jane was lying in a newmade grave in the shadow of the old grey tower but though dead she yet lived to him in the person of a brighteyed baby a little girl born but three months before her mothers death who can tell how john watched and prayed over that infant or how he felt that there was something left for him in this world yet and thought that if his child would live he should not go down to the grave a lonely desolate man poor johnwho can say whether it would not have been better if the mothers coffin had been made a little larger and the baby had been carried up the hill to sleep quietly with its mother safe from all the evil of this world but the child lived and grew and at seventeen i remember her well a beautiful girl merry impetuous and thoughtless with black waving hair and dark blue eyes and all the village loved her and took pride in her for they saidshe is the handsomest and the best in the parish chapter iii the history of a certain family living in europe from the battle of trafalgar to the peace of containing facts hitherto unpublished among all the great old commoner families of the south of england who have held the lands of their forefathers through every change of dynasty and religion the buckleys of clere stand deservedly high among the brightest and the oldest all down the stormy page of this great islands history one sees once in a about a hundred years that name in some place of secondrate honour at least whether as admiral general or statesman and yet at the beginning of this present century the representative of the good old family was living at clere house a palace built in the golden times of elizabeth on l ayear while all the county knew that it took l to keep clere in proper repair the two stuart revolutions had brought them down from county princes to simple wealthy squires and the frantic efforts made by godfrey buckley in the south sea scheme to retrieve the family fortunes had well nigh broke them year by year they saw acre after acre of the broad lands depart and yet marmaduke buckley lived in the home of his ancestors and the avenue was untouched by axe or saw he was a widower with two sons john and james john had been to sea from his earliest youth and james had joined his regiment a year or more john had been doing the state good service under his beloved collingwood and on the th october when nelson and collingwood made tryst to meet at the gates of hell john buckley was one of the immortals on the deck of the royal sovereign and when the war fog rolled away to leeward and trafalgar was won and all seas were free he lay dead in the cockpit having lived just long enough to comprehend the magnitude of the victory brave old marmaduke was walking up and down the terrace at clere uneasy and impatient beside him was the good old curate who had educated both the boys and wearily and oft they turned to watch down the long vista of the ancient avenue for the groom who had been despatched to portsmouth to gain some tidings of the lieutenant they had heard of the victory and in their simple way had praised god for it drinking a bottle of the rarest old wine to his majestys health and the confusion of his enemies before they knew whether they themselves were among the number of the mourners and now as they paced the terrace every moment they grew more anxious and uneasy for the long delayed intelligence some trifle took them into the flowergarden and when they came back their hearts leapt up for the messenger was there dismounted opening the gate the curate ran down the steps and taking a blackedged letter from the sorrowful groom gave it into the trembling hands of the old man with a choking sob he opened it and glanced over it and then throwing it towards his friend walked steadily up the steps and disappeared within the dark porch it was just three hasty lines from the great collingwood himself that brave heart in the midst of the din of victory had found time to scrawl a word to his old schoolmate and tell him that his boy had died like a hero and that he regretted him like a son the old man sat that evening in the western gallery tearless and alone brooding over his grief three times the curate had peeped in and as often had retreated fearful of disturbing the old mans solemn sorrow the autumn sun had gone down in wild and lurid clouds and the gallery was growing dark and gloomy when the white figure of a beautiful girl entering silently at the lower door came gliding up the darkening vista past the light of the windows and the shadow of the piers to where the old man sat under the high north window and knelt at his feet weeping bitterly it was agnes talbot the daughter of his nearest neighbour and best friend whom the curate had slyly sent for thinking in his honest heart that she would make a better comforter than he and rightly for the old man bending over her lifted up his voice and wept speaking for the first time since he heard of his bereavement and saying oh my boy my boy he is gone sir said agnes through her tears and gone the way a man should go but there is another left you yet remember him aye james said he alas poor james i wonder if he knows it i wish he were here james is here said she he heard of it before you and came posting over as fast as he could and is waiting outside to know if you can see him the door at the lower end of the gallery opened and a tall and noblelooking young man strode up and took his fathers hand he was above the ordinary height of man with a grand broad forehead and bold blue eyes old marmadukes heart warmed up as he parted his curling hair and he said thank god ive got one left still the old house will not perish yet while such a one as you remains to uphold it after a time they left him at his own request and walked out together through the dark rooms towards the old hall agnes my beloved my darling said james drawing his arm round her waist i knew i should find you with him like a ministering angel say something to comfort me my love you never could love john as i did yet i know you felt for him as your brother as he soon would have been if he had lived what can i say to you my own she replied save to tell you that he fell as your brother should fall amongst the foremost fighting for his countrys existence and james if you must go before me and leave me a widow before i am a bride it would render more tolerable the short time that would be left me before i followed you to think that you had fallen like him there will be a chance of it agnes said james for stuart they say is going to italy and i go with him there will be a long and bloody war and who knows how it will end stay you here quiet with the old man my love and pray for me the end will come some day i am only eighteen and an ensign in ten years i may be a colonel they parted that night with tears and kisses and a few days afterwards james went from among them to join his regiment from that time agnes almost lived with old marmaduke her fathers castle could be seen over the trees from the windows of clere and every morning wet or dry the old man posted himself in the great north window of the gallery to watch her coming all day she would pervade the gloomy old mansion like a ray of sunlight now reading to him now leading him into the flowergarden in fine weather till he grew quite fond of flowers for her sake and began even to learn the names of some of them but oftenest of all she would sit working by his side while he told her stories of times gone by stories which would have been dull to any but her but which she could listen to and applaud best of all she liked to hear him talk of james and his exploits by flood and field from his youth up and so it was that this quiet couple never tired one another for their hearts were set upon the same object sometimes her two sisters noble and beautiful girls would come to see him but they indeed were rather intruders kind and good as they were and sometimes old talbot looked round to see his old friend and talked of bygone fishing and hunting which roused the old man up and made him look glad for half a day after still however agnes and the old curate were company enough for him for they were the only two who loved his absent son as well as he the love which had been divided between the two seemed now to be concentrated upon the one and yet this true old briton never hinted at james selling out and coming home for he said that the country had need of every one then more particularly such a one as james time went on and he came back to them from corunna and spending little more than a month at home he started away once more and next they heard of him at busaco wounded and promoted then they followed him in their hearts along the path of glory from talavera by albuera and vittoria across the pyrenees and while they were yet reading a longdelayed letter written from toulouse at midnightafter having been to the theatre with lord wellington wearing a white cockadehe broke in on them again to tell them the war was wellnigh over and that he would soon come and live with them in peace then what delightful reunions were there in the old gallery window going over all the weary campaigns once more pleasant rambles too down by the riverside in the sweet may evenings old marmaduke and the curate discreetly walking in front and james and agnes loitering far behind and in the succeeding winter after they were married what pleasant rides had they to meet the hounds and merry evenings before the bright woodfire in the hall never were four people more happy than they the war was done the disturber was confined and peace had settled down upon the earth peace yes but not for long spring came on and with it strange disquieting rumours growing more certain day by day till the terrible news broke on them that the faithless tyrant had broke loose again and that all europe was to be bathed in blood once more by his insane ambition james had sold out of the army so that when agnes first heard the intelligence she thanked god that her husband at least would be safe at home during the storm but she was soon to be undeceived when the news first came james had galloped off to portsmouth and late in the evening they saw him come riding slowly and sadly up the avenue she was down at the gate before he could dismount and to her eager inquiries if the news were true he replied all too true my love and i must leave you this day week my god said she leave me again and not six months married surely the king has had you long enough may not your wife have you for a few short months listen to me dear wife he replied all the peninsular men are volunteering and i must not be among the last for every man is wanted now buonaparte is joined by the whole army and the craven king has fled if england and prussia can combine to strike a blow before he gets head thousands and hundreds of thousands of lives will be spared but let him once get firmly seated and then hey for ten years more war beside the thing is done my name went in this morning she said gods will be done and he left his young bride and his old father once again the nightingale grew melodious in the midnight woods the swallows nestled again in the chimneys and day by day the shadows under the old avenue grew darker and darker till merry june was half gone and then one saturday came the rumour of a great defeat all the long weary summer sabbath that followed agnes and marmaduke silently paced the terrace till the curatehaving got through his own services somehow and broken down in the prayer during war and tumultscame hurrying back to them to give what comfort he could alas that was but little he could only speculate whether or not the duke would give up brussels and retire for reinforcements if the two armies could effect a union they would be near about the strength of the french but then the prussians were cut to pieces so the curate broke down and became the worst of the three cheer up good souls for he you love shall not die yet for many long years while you are standing there before the porch dreading the long anxious night waterloo has been won and hehaving stood the appointed time in the serried square watching the angry waves of french cavalry dash in vain against the glittering wall of bayonetsis now leaning against a gun in the french position alive and well though fearfully tired listening to the thunder of the prussian artillery to the north and watching the red sun go down across the wild confusion of the battlefield but home at clere none slept that night but met again next morning weary and harassed all the long three days none of them spoke much but wandered about the house uneasily about ten oclock on the wednesday night they went to bed and the old man sleeps from sheer weariness it was twelve oclock when there came a clang at the gate and a sound of horses feet on the gravel agnes was at the window in a moment who goes there she cried an orderly from colonel mountford at portsmouth said a voice below a letter for mr buckley she sent a servant to undo the door and going to the window again she inquired trembling do you know what the news is orderly a great victory my dear said the man mistaking her for one of the servants your master is all right theres a letter from him inside this one and i daresay mrs buckley used to add when she would tell this old waterloo story as we called it that the orderly thought me a most heartless domestic for when i heard what he said i burst out laughing so loud that old mr buckley woke up to see what was the matter and when heard he laughed as loud as i did so he came back to them again with fresh laurels but agnes never felt safe till she heard that the powers had determined to chain up her bete noir buonaparte on a lonely rock in the atlantic that he might disturb the world no more then at last she began to believe that peace might be a reality and a few months after waterloo to their delight and exultation she bore a noble boy and as we shall see more of this boy probably than of any one else in these following pages we will if you please appoint him hero with all the honours and emoluments thereunto pertaining perhaps when i have finished you will think him not so much of a hero after all but at all events you shall see how he is an honest upright gentleman and in these times perhaps such a character is preferable to a hero old marmaduke had been long failing and two years after this he had taken to his bed never to leave it again alive and one day when the son and heir was rolling and crowing on his grandfathers bed and agnes was sewing at the window and james was tying a fly by the bedside under the old mans directions he drew the child towards him and beckoning agnes from the window spoke thus my children i shant be long with you and i must be the last of the buckleys that die at clere nay i mean it james listen carefully to me when i go the house and park must go with me we are very poor as you well know and you will be doing injustice to this boy if you hang on here in this useless tumbledown old palace without money enough to keep up your position in the county you are still young and it would be hard for you to break up old associations it got too hard for me lately though at one time i meant to do it the land and the house are the worst investment you can have for your money and if you sell a man like you may make money in many ways gordon the brewer is dying to have the place and he has more right to it than we have for he has ten acres round to our one let him have the estate and found a new family the people will miss us at first god bless em but theyll soon get used to gordon for hes a kindly man and a just and i am glad that we shall have so good a successor remember your family and your ancestors and for that reason dont hang on here as i said before in the false position of an old county family without money like the singletons of hurst living in a ruined hall with a miserable overcropped farm a corner of the old deer park under their drawingroom window no my boy i would sooner see you take a farm from my lord than that and now i am tired with talking and so leave me but after i am gone remember what i have said a few days after this the old man passed peacefully from the world without a sigh they buried him in the family vault under the chancel windows and he was the last of the buckleys that slept in the grave of his forefathers and the old arch beneath the east window is built up for ever soon after he was gone the major as i shall call him in future sold the house and park and the few farms that were left and found himself with twelve thousand pounds ready to begin the world again he funded his money and made up his mind to wait a few years and see what to do determining that if no other course should open he would emigrate to canadathe paradise of halfpay officers but in the meantime he moved into devonshire and took a pretty little cottage which was to let not a quarter of a mile from drumston vicarage such an addition to john thorntons little circle of acquaintances was very welcome the major and he very soon became fast friends and noble mrs buckley was seldom a day without spending an hour at least with the beautiful wilful mary thornton chapter iv some new faces the twilight of a winters evening succeeding a short and stormy day was fast fading into night and old john thornton sat dozing in his chair before the fire waiting for candles to resume his reading he was now but little over sixty yet his hair was snowy white and his face looked worn and aged anyone who watched his countenance now in the light of the blazing wood might see by the downdrawn brows and uneasy expression that the old man was unhappy and disquieted the book that lay in his lap was a volume of shakespeare open at the merchant of venice something he had come across in that play had set him thinking the book had fallen on his knees and he sat pondering till he had fallen asleep yet even in his slumber the uneasy expression stayed upon his face and now and then he moved uneasily in his chair what could there be to vex him not poverty at all events for not a year ago a relation whom he had seldom seen and of late years entirely lost sight of had left him l and a like sum to his daughter mary and his sister miss thornton a quiet good old maid who had been a governess all her life had come to live with him so that he was now comfortably off with the only two relations he cared about in the world staying with him to make his old age comfortable yet notwithstanding all this john was unhappy his daughter mary sat sewing in the window ostensibly for the purpose of using the last of the daylight but the piece of white muslin in her hand claimed but a small part of her attention sometimes she gave a stitch or two but then followed a long gaze out of the window across the damp gravel and plushy lawn towards the white gate under the leafless larches again with an impatient sigh she would address herself to her sewing but once more her attention would wander to the darkening garden so at length she rose and leaning against the window began to watch the white gate once more but now she starts and her face brightens up as the gate swings on its hinges and a tall man comes with rapid eager step up the walk john moves uneasily in his sleep but unnoticed by her for she stands back in the shadow of the curtain and eagerly watches the new comer in his approach her father sits up in his chair and after looking sadly at her for a moment then sinks back with a sigh as though he would wish to go to sleep again and wake no more the maid bringing in candles met the new comer at the door and carrying in the lights before him announced mr george hawker i remember his face indistinctly as it was then i remember it far better as it was twenty years after yet i must try to recall it for you as well as i can for we shall have much to do with this man before the end as the light from the candles fell upon his figure while he stood in the doorway any man or woman who saw it would have exclaimed immediately what a handsome fellow and with justice for if perfectly regular features splendid red and brown complexion faultless white teeth and the finest head of curling black hair i ever saw could make him handsome handsome he was without doubt and yet the more you looked at him the less you liked him and the more inclined you felt to pick a quarrel with him the thin lips the everlasting smile the quick suspicious glance so rapidly shot out from under the overhanging eyebrows and as quickly withdrawn were fearfully repulsive as well as a trick he had of always clearing his throat before he spoke as if to gain time to frame a lie but perhaps the strangest thing about him was the shape of his head which i believe a child would have observed we young fellows in those times knew little enough about phrenology i doubt indeed if i had ever heard the word and yet among the village lads that man went by the name of flatheaded george the forehead was both low and narrow sloping a great way back while the larger part of the skull lay low down behind the ears all this was made the more visible by the short curling hair which covered his head he was the only son of a small farmer in one of the distant outlying hamlets of drumston called woodlands his mother had died when he was very young and he had had but little education but had lived shut up with his father in the lonely old farmhouse and strange stories were in circulation among the villages about that house not much to the credit of either father or son which stories john thornton must in his position as clergyman have heard somewhat of so that one need hardly wonder at his uneasiness when he saw him enter for mary adored him the rest of the village disliked and distrusted him but she with a strange perversity loved him as it seldom falls to the lot of man to be lovedwith her whole heart and soul i have brought you some snipes mr thornton said he in his most musical tones the white frost last night has sent them down off the moor as thick as bees and this warm rain will soon send them all back again i only went round through fernworthy and combe and i have killed five couple thank you mr george thank you said john they are not so plentiful as they were in old times and i dont shoot so well either as i used to do my sights going and i cant walk far it is nearly time for me to go i think not yet sir i hope not yet for a long time said george hawker in an offhand sort of way but mary slipped round kissed his forehead and took his hand quietly in hers john looked from her to george and dropped her hand with a sigh and soon the lovers were whispering together again in the darkness of the window but now there is a fresh footfall on the garden walk a quick rapid decided one somebody burst open the halldoor and without shutting it dashes into the parlour accompanied by a tornado of damp air and announces in a loud though not unpleasant voice with a foreign accent i have got the new scolopax he was a broad massive built man about the middle height with a square determined set of features brightened up by a pair of merry blue eyes his forehead was i think the finest i ever saw so high so broad and so upright and altogether he was the sort of man that in a city one would turn round and look after wondering who he was he stood in the doorway dripping and without goodeven or salutation of any sort exclaimed i have got the new scolopax no cried old john starting up all alive have you though how did you get him are you sure it is not a young jack come in and tell us all about it only think the obstinacy and incredulity of you english replied the new comer totally disregarding johns exclamations and remaining dripping in the doorway far exceeds anything i could have conceived if i had not witnessed it if i told you once i told you twenty times that i had seen the bird on three distinct occasions in the meadow below reels mill and you each time threw your jacksnipe theory in my face today i marked him down in the bare ground outside haveldon wood then ran at full speed up to the jager and offered him five shillings if he would come down and shoot the bird i showed him he came killed the bird in a style that i would give a years tobacco to be master of and remarked as i paid him his money that he would like to get five shillings for every one of those birds he could shoot in summer time the jolterhead thought it was a sandpiper but he wasnt much further out than you with your jacksnipes bah my dear doctor mulhaus said john mildly i confess myself to have been foolishly incredulous as to our little place being honoured by such a distinguished stranger as the new snipe but come in to the fire and smoke your pipe while you show me your treasure mary you know likes tobacco and mr george i am sure he added in a slightly altered tone will excuse it mr george would be charmed but the doctor standing staring at him openeyed for a moment demanded in an audible whisper who the deuce is that mr george hawker doctor from the woodlands i should have thought you had met him before never replied the doctor and i dontand i mean i have had the honour of hearing of him from stockbridge excuse me sir a moment i am going to take a liberty i am a phrenologist he advanced across the room to where george sat laid his hand on his forehead and drawing it lightly and slowly back through his black curls till he reached the nape of his neck ejaculated a hah which might mean anything and retired to the fire he then began filling his pipe but before it was filled set it suddenly on the table and drawing from his coat pocket a cardboard box exhibited to the delighted eyes of the vicar that beautiful little brownmottled snipe which now bears the name of colonel sabine and having lit his pipe set to work with a tiny penknife and a pot of arsenical soap all of which were disinterred from the vast coatpocket before mentioned to reduce the plump little bird to a loose mass of skin and feathers fit to begin again his new life in death in a glasscase in some collectors museum george hawker had sat very uneasy since the doctors phrenological examination and every now and then cast fierce angry glances at him from under his lowered eyebrows talking but little to mary but now he grows more uneasy still for the gate goes again and still another footfall is heard approaching through the darkness that is james stockbridge i should know that step among a thousand whether brushing through the long grass of an english meadow in may time or quietly pacing up and down the orange alley in the new world between the crimson snow and the blazing west or treading lightly across the wet ground at black midnight when the cattle are restless or the blacks are abroad or even i should think staggering on the slippery deck when the big grey seas are booming past and the good ship seems plunging down to destruction he had loved mary dearly since she was almost a child but she poor pretty fool used to turn him to ridicule and make him fetch and carry for her like a dog he was handsomer cleverer stronger and better tempered than george hawker and yet she had no eyes for him or his good qualities she liked him in a sort of way nay it might even be said that she was fond of him but what she liked better than him was to gratify her vanity by showing her power over the finest young fellow in the village and to use him as a foil to aggravate george hawker my aunt betsy spinster used to say that if she were a man sooner than stand that hussys airs meaning marys in the way young stockbridge did shed cut and run to america which in the old ladys estimation was the last resource left to an unfortunate human creature before suicide as he entered the parlour johns face grew bright and he held out his hand to him the doctor too shoving his spectacles on his forehead greeted him with a royal salute of about twentyone short words but he got rather a cool reception from the lovers in the window mary gave him a quiet good evening and george hoped with a sneer that he was quite well but directly the pair were whispering together once more in the shadow of the curtain so he sat down between the doctor and the vicar james like all the rest of us had a profound respect for the doctors learning and old john and he were as father and son so a better matched trio could hardly be found in the parish as they sat there before the cheerful blaze smoking their pipes a good rain jim a good warm kindly rain after the frost began the vicar a very good rain sir replied jim some idiots said the doctor take the wing bones out first now my method of beginning at the legs and working forward is infinitely superior yet that ass at crediton after i had condescended to show him persisted his own way was the best all this time he was busy skinning his bird how are your southdowns looking jim says the vicar footrot eh well yes sir says james they always will you know in these wet clays but i prefer em to the leicesters for all that how is scapegrace hamlyn asked the vicar he is very well sir he and i have been out with the harriers today ah taking you out with the harriers instead of minding his business just like him hell be leading you astray james my boy young men like you and he who have come to be their own masters so young ought to be more careful than others besides you see both you and hamlyn being squires have got an example to set to the poorer folks we are neither of us so rich as some of the farmers sir no but you are both gentlemen born you see and therefore ought to be in some way models for those who are not bosh said the doctor all this about hamlyns going out harehunting i dont mind it once aweek said the vicar ignoring the doctors interruption but four times is rather too much and hamlyn has been out four days this week twice with wrefords and twice with holes he cant deny it jim couldnt so he laughed you must catch him sir he said and give him a real good wigging hell mind you but catch him soon sir or you wont get the chance doctor do you know anything about new south wales botany bay said the vicar abstractedly convict settlement in south seas jerry shaw begged the judge to hang him instead of sending him there judge wouldnt do it though jerry was too bad for that hamlyn and i are thinking of selling up and going there said jim do you know anything about it doctor what said the doctor the mysterious hidden land of the great south sea tasmans land nuyts land leuwins land de witts land any fools land who could sail round it and never have the sense to land and make use of itthe new country of australasia the land with millions of acres of fertile soil under a splendid climate calling aloud for some one to come and cultivate them the land of the eucalypti and the marsupials the land of deep forests and boundless pastures which go rolling away westward plain beyond plain to none knows where yes i know something about it the vicar was knocked all of a heap at james announcement and now slightly recovering himself said you hear him he is going to botany bay he is going to sell his estate acres of the best land in devon and go and live among the convicts and who is going with him why hamlyn the wise oh dear me and what is he going for that was a question apparently hard to answer if there was a reason jim was either unwilling or unable to give it yet i think that the real cause was standing there in the window with a look of unbounded astonishment on her pretty face going to leave us james she cried coming quickly towards him why whatever shall i do without you yes miss mary said james somewhat huskily i think i may say that we have settled to go hamlyn has got a letter from a cousin of his who went from down plymouth way and who is making a fortune and besides i have got tired of the old place somehow lately i have nothing to keep me here now and there will be a change and a new life there in short said he in despair of giving a rational reason i have made up my mind oh said mary while her eyes filled with tears i shall be so sorry to lose you i too said james shall be sorry to start away beyond seas and leave all the friends i care about save one behind me but times are hard for the poor folks here now and if i as squire set the example of going i know many will follow the old country mr thornton he continued is getting too crowded for men to live in without a hard push and depend on it when poor men are afraid to marry for fear of having children which they cant support it is time to move somewhere the hive is too hot and the bees must swarm so those that go will both better themselves and better those they leave behind them by giving them more room to work and succeed its hard to part with the old farm and the old faces now but perhaps in a few years one will get to like that country just as one does this from being used to it and then the old country will seem only like a pleasant dream after one has awoke think twice about it james my boy said the vicar dont be such an ass as to hesitate said the doctor impatiently it is the genius of your restless discontented nation to go blundering about the world like buffaloes in search of fresh pasture you have founded already two or three grand new empires and you are now going to form another and men like you ought to have their fingers in the pie well god speed you and hamlyn too wherever you go are you going home mr hawker george who hated james from the very bottom of his heart was not illpleased to hear there would be a chance of soon getting rid of him he had been always half jealous of him though without the slightest cause and tonight he was more so than ever for mary since she had heard of james intended departure had grown very grave and silent he stood hat in hand ready to depart and as usual when he meant mischief spoke in his sweetest tones i am afraid i must be saying good evening mr thornton why james he added this is something quite new so you are going to botany without waiting to be sent there ha ha well i wish you every sort of good luck my dear friend hamlyn too what a loss hell be to our little society so sociable and affable as he always is to us poor farmers sons youll find it lonely there though you should get a wife to take with you oh yes i should certainly get married before i went good night all this was meant to be as irritating as possible but as he went out at the door he had the satisfaction to hear james clear honest laugh mingling with the vicars for as george had closed the door the doctor had said looking after him gott in himmel that young man has got a skull like a tomcat this complimentary observation was lost on mary who had left the room with george the vicar looked round for her and sighed when he missed her ah said he i wish he was going instead of you so does the new colony ill be bound added the doctor soon after this the party separated when james and the doctor stood outside the door the latter demanded where are you going to sydney i believe doctor goose i mean now home no you aint said the doctor you are going to walk up to hamlyns with me and hear me discourse accordingly about eleven oclock these two arrived at my house and sat before the fire till halfpast three in the morning and in that time the doctor had given us more information about new south wales than we had been able to gather from ordinary sources in a month chapter v in which the reader is made accomplice to a misprision of felony those who only know the river taw as he goes sweeping clear and full past orchards and farmhouses by woods and parks and through long green meadows after he has left dartmoor have little idea of the magnificent scene which rewards the perseverance of anyone who has the curiosity to follow him up to his granite cradle between the two loftiest eminences in the west of england on the left great cawsand heaves up down beyond down a vast sheet of purple heath and golden whin while on the right the lofty serrated ridge of yestor starts boldly up black against the western sky throwing a long shadow over the wild waste of barren stone at his feet some scotchmen perhaps may smile at my applying the word magnificent to heights of only feet yet i have been among mountains which double ben nevis in height and with the exception of the murray gates in australia and a glen in madeira whose name i have forgotten i have never seen among them the equal of some of the northern passes of dartmoor for gloomy magnificence for i consider that scenery depends not so much on height as on abruptness it is an evil depressing place far as the eye can reach up the glen and to the right it is one horrid waste of grey granite here and there a streak of yellow grass or a patch of black bog not a tree nor a shrub within the skyline on a hot summers day it is wearisome enough for the lonely angler to listen to the river crawling lazily through the rocks that choke his bed mingled with the clocking of some watermoved boulder and the chickchick of the stonechat or the scream of the golden plover overhead but on a wild winters evening when day is fast giving place to night and the mist shrouds the hill and the wild wind is rushing hoarse through tor and crag it becomes awful and terrible in the extreme on just such a night as that at that time when it becomes evident that the little light we have had all day is about to leave us a lonely watcher was standing by the angry swelling river in the most desolate part of the pass at a place where a vast confusion of formless rocks crosses the stream torturing it into a hundred boiling pools and hissing cascades he stood on the summit of a cairn close to the river and every now and then shading his eyes with his hand he looked eastward through the driving rain as though expecting some one who came not but at length grown tired of watching he with an oath descended to a sheltered corner among the boulders where a smouldering peatfire was giving out more smoke than heat and crouching over it began to fan the embers with his hat he was a somewhat short though powerful man in age about forty very dark in complexion with black whiskers growing half over his chin his nose was hooked his eyes were black and piercing and his lips thin his face was battered like an old sailors and every careless unstudied motion of his body was as wild and reckless as could be there was something about his toute ensemble in short that would have made an australian policeman swear to him as a convict without the least hesitation there were redeeming points in the mans face too there was plenty of determination for instance in that lower jaw and as he bent now over the fire and his thoughts wandered away to other times and places the whole appearance of the man seemed to change and become milder and kindlier yet when some slight noise makes him lift his head and look round there is the old expression back again and he looks as reckless and desperate as ever what he is is more apparent and the ghost of what he might have been has not wholly departed i can picture to myself that man scowling behind the bayonet line at maida or rapidly and coolly serving his gun at trafalgar helping to win the dominion of all seas or taking his trick at the helm through arctic iceblocks with parry or toiling on with steadfast sturt kneedeep in the sand of the middle desert patiently yet hopelessly scanning the low quivering line of the northwest horizon in fifty situations where energy and courage are required i can conceive that man a useful citizen yet here he is on the lone moor on the winters night a reckless cursing thrice convicted man his very virtueshis impatient energy and undeniable couragehis greatest stumblingblocks leading him into crimes which a lazy man or a coward would have shrunk from deserted apparently by god and man he crouched there over the low fire among his native rocks and meditated fresh villanies he had been transported at eighteen for something i know not what which earned transportation in those days and since then his naturally violent temper aggravated instead of being broken by penal discipline had earned him three fresh convictions in the colony from the last of these sentences he had escaped with a cunning and address which had baffled the vigilance of the sydney police good as they were and had arrived home two years before this time after twentyone years absence at his native village in the moor none there knew him or even guessed who he was his brother a small farmer who would have taken him to his heart had he recognised him always regarded him as a suspicious stranger and what cut him deeper still his mother his old halfblind palsied mother whose memory he had in some sort cherished through the horrors of the hulk the convictship the chaingang and the bush knew him not only once when he was speaking in her presence she said abruptly the voice of him is like the voice of my boy that was took away but he was smoothfaced like a girl and yere a dark wrinkled man sides he died years agone over the water but the old lady grew thoughtful and silent from that day and three weeks after she was carried up to her grave by the little grey church on the windy hill at the funeral william lee the man whom i have been describing pushed quietly through the little crowd and as they threw the first earth on the coffin stood looking over the shoulder of his brother who was unconscious of his existence like many men who have been much in great solitudes and have gone days and weeks sometimes without meeting a fellowcreature he had acquired the habit of thinking aloud and if anyone had been listening they would have heard much such a soliloquy as the following expletives omitted or rather softened a brutal cold country this for a man to camp out in never a bucklog to his fire no nor a stick thicker than your finger for seven mile round and if there was youd get a month for cutting it if the youngun milks free this time ill be off to the bay again i know but will he by george he shall though the young snob i know he darent but come and yet its my belief hes late just to keep me soaking out in the rain whew its cold enough to freeze the tail off a tin possum and this infernal rubbish wont burn at least not to warm a man if it wasnt for the whisky i should be dead theres a rush of wind i am glad for one thing there is no dead timber overhead hell be drinking at all the places coming along to get his courage up to bounce me but there aint a publichouse on the road six miles from this so the drink will have pretty much died out of him by the time he gets to me and if i can get him to sit in this rain and smoke backer for five minutes he wont be particular owdacious ill hide the grog too between the stones hell be asking for a drink the minute he comes i hope dick is ready he is pretty sure to be hes a good little chap that dick he has stuck to me well these five years i wouldnt like to trust him with another mans horse though but this other one is no good hes got all the inclination to go the whole hog and none of the pluck necessary if he ever is lagged he will be a worse one than ever i was or dick either there he is for a hundred pounds a faint halloo sounded above the war of the weather and lee putting his hand to his mouth replied with that strange cry so well known to all australianscoee a man was now heard approaching through the darkness now splashing deep into some treacherous moss hole with a loud curse now blundering among looselying blocks of stone lee waited till he was quite close and then seizing a bunch of gorse lighted it at his fire and held it aloft the bright blaze fell full upon the face and features of george hawker a cursed place and a cursed time he began for an appointment if you had wanted to murder me i could have understood it but i am pretty safe i think your interests dont lie that way well well you see returned lee i dont want any meetings on the cross up at my place in the village the whole house aint mine and we dont know who may be listening i am suspected enough already and it wouldnt look well for you to be seen at my place folks would have begun axing what for dont see it said george besides if you did not want to see me at home why the devil do you bring me out here in the middle of the moor we might have met on the hill underneath the village and when we had done business gone up to the publichouse dd if i understand it he acquiesced sulkily to the arrangement however because he saw it was no use talking about it but he was far from comfortable he would have been still less so had he known that lees shout had brought up a confederate who was now peering over the rocks almost touching his shoulder well said lee here we are so we had better be as comfortable as we can this devils night got anything to drink deuce a swipe of grog have i but i have got some real barrets twist that never paid duty as i knowd on so just smoke a pipe before we begin talking and show you aint vexed id sooner have had a drop of grog such a night as this we must do as the spaniards do when they cant get anything said lee go without they both lit their pipes and smoked in silence for a few minutes till lee resumed if the witches werent all dead there would be some of them abroad tonight hear that only a whimbrel isnt it said george thats something worse than a whimbrel im thinking said the other theres some folks dont believe in witches and the like he continued but a man thats seen a naked old hag of a gin ride away on a myallbough knows better lord said george i shouldnt have thought youd have believed in the like of thatbut i dothat old devils dam dame parker that lives alone up in hatherleigh wood got gibbering some infernal nonsense at me the other day for shooting her black cat i made the cross in the road though so i suppose it wont come to anything perhaps not said lee but id sooner kill a man than a black cat another pause the tobacco so much stronger than any george had been accustomed to combined with the cold made him feel nervous and miserable when i was a boy resumed lee there were two young brothers made it up to rob the squires house down at gidleigh they separated in the garden after they cracked the crib agreeing to meet here in this very place and share the swag for they had got nigh seventy pound they met and quarrelled over the sharing up and the elder one drew out a pistol and shot the younger dead the poor boy was sitting much where you are sitting now and that long tuft of grass grew up from his blood i believe thats all a lie said george you want to drive me into the horrors with your humbugging tales lee seeing that he had gone far enough if not too far proposed somewhat sulkily that they should begin to talk about what brought them there and not sit crouching in the wet all night well said george its you to begin what made you send for me to this infernal place i want money said lee then youd better axe about and get some said george youll get none from me i am surprised that a man with your knowledge of the world should have sent me such a letter as you did yesterday i am indeedwhat the devils that he started on his feet a blaze of sudden light filled the nook where they were sitting and made it as bright as day and a voice shouted out ha ha ha my secret coves whats going on here something quiet and sly eh something worth a fiftypound note eh dont you want an arbitrator eh heres one ready made youre playing a dangerous game my flash man whoever you are said lee rising savagely ive shot a man down for less than that so youve been stagging this gentleman and me and listening have you for just half a halfpenny he added striding towards him and drawing out a pistol you shouldnt go home this night dont you be a fool bill lee said the new comer i saw the light and made towards it and as i come up i heard some mention made of money now then if my company is disagreeable why ill go and no harm done what its you is it said lee well now youve come you may stop and hear what its all about i dont care you are not very squeamish or at least usednt to be george saw that the arrival of this man was preconcerted and cursed lee bitterly in his heart but he sat still and thought how he could outmanoeuvre them now said lee i aint altogether sorry that you have come for i want to tell you a bit of a yarn and ask your advice about my behaviour this is about the state of the case a young gentleman a great friend of mine was not very many years ago pretty much given up to fast living cockfighting horseracing and many other little matters which all young fellows worth anything are pretty sure to indulge in and which are very agreeable for the time but which cost money and are apt to bring a man into low society when i tell you that he and i first met in exeter as principals in crossing a fight you may be sure that these pursuits had brought the young gentleman into very low company indeed in fact he was over head and ears in debt raising money in every way he could hook or crook square or cross to satisfy certain creditors who were becoming nasty impatient and vexatious i thought something might be made of this young gentleman so finding there was no pride about him i cultivated his acquaintance examined his affairs and put him up to the neatest little fakement in the world just showed him how to raise two hundred pounds and clear himself with everybody just by signing his fathers name thereby saving the old gent the trouble of writing it he is very infirm is dad and anticipating by a few years what must be his own at last not to mention paying off a lot of poor publicans and horsedealers who could not afford to wait for their money blowed if i dont think it the most honest action he ever did in his life well he committed thewrote the name i meanand stood two tenpound notes for the information quite handsome but now this same young gent is going to marry a young lady with five thousand pounds in her own right and she nearly of age her father i understand is worth another five thousand and very old so that what hell get ultimately if he marries into that family counting his own expectations wont be much less i should say than twenty thousand pounds now i mean to say under these circumstances i should be neglecting my own interests most culpably if i didnt demand from him the trifling sum of three hundred pounds for holding my tongue why curse you broke in hawker you said two hundred yesterday exactly so said lee but that was yesterday tomorrow if the job aint settled itll be four and the day after five its no use george hawker he continued you are treed and you cant help yourself if i give information you swing and you know it but id rather have the money than see the man hanged but mind said he with a snarl if i catch you playing false by the lord ill hang you for love for an instant the wretched george cast a hurried glance around as if considering what wild chance there was of mastering his two enemies but that glance showed him that it was hopeless for they both stood close together each holding in his hand a cocked pistol so in despair he dropped his eyes on the fire once more while lee chuckled inwardly at his wise foresight in bringing an accomplice by jove he said to himself its lucky dicks here if i had been alone hed have been at me then like a tiger it would have been only man to man but he would have been as good as me hed have fought like a rat in a corner george sat looking into the embers for a full half minute while the others waited for his answer determined that he should speak first at length he raised his head and said hoarsely looking at neither of them and where am i to get three hundred pounds a simple question very easily answered said lee do what you did before with half the difficulty you manage nearly everything now your father is getting blind so you need hardly take the trouble of altering the figures in the bankers book and some slight hint about taking a new farm would naturally account for the old mans drawing out four or five hundred the things easier than ever take my advice young man said dick and take the shortest cut out of the wood you see my friend here william has got tired of these parts as being you see hardly free and easy enough for him and he wants to get back to a part of the world he was rather anxious to leave a few years ago if he likes to take me back with him why he can i rather fancy the notion myself give him the money and in three months well both be fourteen thousand odd miles off meanwhile you marry the young lady and die in your bed an honest gentleman at eightyfour instead of being walked out some cold morning to a gallows at twentytwo needs must where the devil drives replied george you shall have the money this day week and now let me go for i am nearly froze dead thats the talk said lee i knew you would be reasonable if it hadnt been for my necessities i am sure i never would have bothered you well good night george rose and departed eastward towards the rising moon while lee and his companion struck due west across the moor the rain had ceased and the sky was clear so that there was not much difficulty in picking their way through the stones and mosshags suddenly lee stopped and said to his comrade with an oath dick my boy i didnt half like the way that dog left us nor i either replied the other he has got some new move in his head you may depend on it hell give you the slip if he can let him try it said lee oh only just let him try it and then the pair of worthies walked home chapter vi george hawker goes to the fairwrestles but gets thrown on his back shoots at a mark but misses it lee had guessed rightly when george found himself so thoroughly entrapped and heard all his most secret relations with lee so openly discussed before a third man he was in utter despair and saw no hope of extrication from his difficulties but this lasted for a very short time even while lee and dick were still speaking he was reflecting how to turn the tables on them and already began to see a sparkle of hope glimmering afar lee was a returned convict george had very little doubt of that a thousand queer expressions he had let fall in conversation had shown him that it was so and now if he could but prove it and get lee sent back out of the way and yet that would hardly do after all it would be difficult to identify him his name gave no clue to who he was there were a thousand or two of lees hereabouts and a hundred william lees at least still it was evident that he was originally from this part of the country it was odd no one had recognised him so george gave up this plan as hopeless still said he there is a week left surely i can contrive to bowl him out somehow and then he walked on in deep thought he was crossing the highest watershed in the county by an open lowsided valley on the southern shoulder of cawsand to the left lay the mountain and to the right tors of weathered granite dim in the changing moonlight before him was a small moorpool in summer a mere reedy marsh but now a bleak tarn standing among dangerous mosses sending ghostly echoes across the solitude as the water washed wearily against the black peat shores or rustled among the sere skeleton reeds in the shallow bays suddenly he stopped with a jar in his brain and a chill at his heart his breath came short and raising one hand he stood beating the ground for half a minute with his foot he gave a stealthy glance around and then murmured hoarsely to himself aye that would do that would do well and i could do it too when i was halfdrunk was that the devil chuckling joyous to himself across the bog no only an innocent little snipe getting merry over the change of weather bleating to his companions as though breeding time were come round again crowd close little snipes among the cupmoss and wolfsfoot for he who stalks past you over the midnight moor meditates a foul and treacherous murder in his heart yes it had come to that and so quickly he would get this man lee who held his life in his hand and was driving him on from crime to crime to meet him alone on the moor if he could and shoot him what surety had he that lee would leave him in peace after this next extortion none but his wordthe word of a villain like that he knew what his own word was worth what wonder if he set a small value on lees he might be hung as it was he would be hung for something taw steps was a wild place and none were likely to miss either lee or his friend it would be supposed they had tramped off as they came there could be no proof against him none whatever no one had ever seen them together they must both go well two men were no worse than one hatherleigh had killed four men with his own hand at waterloo and they gave him a medal for it they were likely honest fellows enough not such scoundrels as these two so arguing confusedly with himself only one thing certain in his mind that he was committed to the perpetration of this crime and that the time for drawing back was passed long ago he walked rapidly onwards towards the little village where he had left his horse in an outhouse fearing to trust him among the dangerous bogs which he had himself to cross to gain the rendezvous at taw steps he rapidly cleared the moor and soon gained the little grey street lying calm and peaceful beneath the bright winter moon which was only now and then obscured for a moment by the last flying clouds of the late storm hurrying after their fellows the rill which ran brawling loud through the village swollen by the late rains at length forced on his perception that he was fearfully thirsty and that his throat was parched and dry this is the way men feel in hell i think said he lord let me get a drink while i can the rich man old jack reads about couldnt get one for all his money he walked up to a stone horsetrough a little off the road he stooped to drink and started back with an oath what pale wild ghastly face was that looking at him out of the cool calm water not his own surely he closed his eyes and having drunk deep walked on refreshed he reached the outhouse where his horse was tied and as he was leading the impatient animal forth one of the children within the cottage adjoining woke up and began to cry he waited still a moment and heard the mother arise and soothe it then a window overhead opened and a woman said is that you mr hawker aye said he its me come for the horse he was startled at the sound of his own voice it was like another mans but like the voice of some one he seemed to know too a new acquaintance it will be morn soon resumed the woman the child is much worse tonight and i think hell go before daybreak well wellmuch sorrow saved maybe ill go to bed no more tonight lest my boy should be off while im sleeping good night sir god bless you may you never know the sorrow of losing a firstborn years after he remembered those random words but now he only thought that if the brat should die there would be only one pauper less in bickerton and so thinking mounted and rode on his way he rode fast and was soon at home he had put his horse in the stable and shoeless was creeping up to bed when as he passed his fathers door it opened and the old man came out light in hand he was a very infirm old man much bent though evidently at one time he had been of great stature his retreating forehead heavy grey eyebrows and loose sensual mouth rendered him no pleasing object at any time and as he stood in the doorway now with a half drunken satyrlike leer on his face he looked perfectly hideous wheres my pretty boy been he piped out how pale he looks are you drunk my lad no wish i was replied george give me the keys dad and let me get a drink of brandy ive been vexed and had nought to drink all night i shall be getting the horrors if i dont have something before i go to bed the old man got him half a tumbler of brandy from his room where there was always some to be had and following him into his room sat down on the bed whos been vexing my handsome son said he my son that ive been waiting up for all night death and gallows to them whoever they are is it that palefaced little parsons daughter or is it her tightlaced hypocrite of a father that comes whining here with his good advice to me who know the world so well never mind my boy keep a smooth face and play the humbug till youve got her and her money and then break her impudent little heart if you will go to sleep my boy and dream you are avenged on them all i mean to be father on some of them i tell you replied george thats right my man good night good night old dad said george as he watched him out of the room a kinder softer expression came on his face his father was the only being he cared for in the world he slept a heavy and dreamless sleep that night and when he woke for the first time the bright winters sun was shining into his room and morning was far advanced he arose strengthened and refreshed by his sleep with a light heart he began whistling as he dressed himself but suddenly stopped as the recollection of the night before came upon him was it a reality or only a dream no it was true enough he has no need to whistle this morning he is entangled in a web of crime and guilt from which there is no escape he dressed himself and went forth into the fresh morning air for a turn walking up and down on the broad gravel walk before the dark old porch a glorious winters morning the dismal old stonehouse manygabled held aloft its tall red chimneys towards the clear blue sky and looked bright and pleasant in the sunshine the deep fir and holly woods which hemmed it in on all sides save in front were cheerful with sloping gleams of sunlight falling on many a patch of green moss red fern and bright brown last years leaves in front far below him rolled away miles of unbroken woodland and in the far distance rose the moor a dim cloud of pearly grey a robin sat and sung loud beside him sole songster left in the wintry woods but which said as plain as bird could say could he have understood it see the birds are not all dead in this dreary winter time i am still here a pledge from my brothers when yon dim grey woods grow green and the brown hollows are yellow with kingcups and primroses the old melody you know so well shall begin again and the thrush from the oak top shall answer to the goldentoned blackbird in the copse sayingour mother is not dead but has been sleeping she is awake againlet all the land rejoice little part had that poor darkened mind in such thoughts as these if any softening influence were upon him this morning he gave no place to it the robin ceased and he only heard the croak of a raven an old inhabitant of these wild woods coming from the darkest and tallest of the firtrees then he saw his father approaching along the garden walk one more chance for thee unhappy man go up to him now and tell him all he has been a kind father to you with all his faults get him on your side and you may laugh lee to scorn have you not the courage to tell him for a moment he hesitated but the dread of his fathers burst of anger kept him silent he hardened his heart and whistling waited for the old man to come up how is he this morning said his father what has he got his old clothes on for and such fine ones as he has in his drawer why should i put on my best clothes this day father aintee going down to revils true said george i had forgotten all about it yes i shall go down of course are you going to play wrestle asked the father maybe i may but come in to breakfast wheres madge indoors said the father waiting breakfastmortal cross curse her crossness said george if i were ye dad id kick her out in the lane next time she got on one of her tantrams a tall woman about forty stepped out of the house as he uttered these words ye hear what he says william hawker she said ye hear what yere own lawful son says hed kick me out in the lane and yed stand there and let him ye old dog i dont doubt hush george said the old man you dont know what youre saying boy go in madge and dont be a fool you bring it on yourself the woman turned in a contemptuous way and walked in she was a very remarkable looking person tall and upright at least six feet high with swarthy complexion black eyes and coalblack hair looped up loosely in a knot behind she must have been very beautiful as a young girl but was now too fierce and hawkish looking though you would still call her handsome she was a fullblooded gipsy of one of the best families which however she totally denied when i say that she bore the worst of characters morally and had the reputation besides of being a witch of the highest acquirementsa sort of double first at satans universityi have said all i need to say about her at present these three sat down to breakfast not before each of them however had refreshed themselves with a dram all the meal through the old man and madge were quarrelling with one another till at length the contest grew so fierce that george noticed it a thing he very seldom took the trouble to do i tell thee said the old man yell get no more money this week what have ee done with the last five pounds george knew well enough she had given it to him many a time did she contrive to let him have a pound or two and blind the old man as to where it was gone the day before he had applied to her for some money and she had refused and in revenge george had recommended his father to turn her out knowing that she could hear every word and little meaning it in reality ye stingy old beast she replied very slowly and distinctly i wish ye were dead and out of the way ill be doing it myself some of these odd times and looking at him fixedly and pointing her finger she began the hebrew alphabetaleph beth c from the th psalm i wont have it screamed the old man stop or ill kill you i will george you wont see your father took before your eyes stop her come quiet old girl none of that said george taking her round the waist and putting his hand before her mouth be reasonable now she continued to look at the old man with a smile of triumph for a short time and then said with a queer laugh its lucky you stopped me oh very lucky indeed now are you going to give the money you old jew she had carried the day and the old man sulkily acquiesced george went up stairs and having dressed himself to his taste got on horseback and rode down to the village which was about three miles this was the day of the revels which corresponds pretty well with what is called in other parts of england a pleasure fair that is to say although some business might be done yet it was only a secondary object to amusement the main village of drumston was about a mile from the church which i have before noticed and consisted of a narrow street of cobhouses whitewashed and thatched crossing at right angles by a little stone bridge over a pretty clear troutstream all around the village immediately behind the backs of the houses rose the abrupt red hills divided into fields by broad oak hedges thickly set with elms the water of the stream intercepted at some point higher up was carried round the crown of the hills for the purposes of irrigation which even at this dead season showed its advantages by the brilliant emerald green of the tender young grass on the hillsides drumston in short was an excellent specimen of a close dull dirty and i fear not very healthy devonshire village in the red country on this day the main street usually in a state of ancledeep mud six months in the year was churned and pounded into an almost kneedeep state by four or five hundred hobnail shoes in search of amusement the amusements were various drinking very popular swearing ditto quarrelling eating pastry gingerbread and nuts female pastime and looking at a filthy italian leading a still more filthy monkey who rode on a dog the only honest one of the three this all day till night dropped down on a scene of drunkenness and vice which we had better not seek to look at further surely if ever man was right old joey bender the methodist shoemaker was right when he preached against the revels for four sundays running and said roundly that he would sooner see all his congregation leave him and go up to the steeplehouse church in a body than that they should attend such a crying abomination the wrestling the only honest sensible amusement to be had was not in much favour at drumston such wrestling as there was was carried on in a little croft behind the principal of the publichouses for some trifling prize given by the publicans in this place james stockbridge and myself had wandered on the afternoon of the day in question having come down to the revel to see if we could find some one we wanted there was a small ring of men watching the performances and talking each and all of them not to his neighbour or to himself but to the ambient air in the most unintelligible devonshire jargon rendered somewhat more barbarous than usual by intoxication frequently one of them would address one of the players in language more forcible than choice as he applauded some piece of finesse or condemned some clumsiness on the part of the two youths who were struggling about in the centre under the impression they were wrestling there were but two moderate wrestlers in the parish and those two were george hawker and james stockbridge and james and myself had hardly arrived on the ground two minutes before george coming up greeted us after a few commonplace civilities he challenged james to play let us show these muffs what play is said he its a disgrace to the county to see such work james had no objection so having put on the jackets they set to work to the great admiration of the bystanders one of whom a drunken tinker expressed his applause in such remarkable language that i mildly asked him to desist which of course made him worse the two wrestlers made very pretty play of it for some time till james feinting at some outlandish manoeuvre put george on his back by a simple trip akin to scholarsmate at chess george fell heavily for they were both heavy men he rose from the ground and walked to where his coat was sulkily james thinking he might have been hurt went up to speak to him but the other greeting him with an oath turned and walked away through the crowd he was in a furious passion and he went on to the little bridge that crossed the stream we saw him standing looking into the water below when a short lightlooking man came up to him and having spoken to him for a few minutes walked off in the direction of exeter at a steady rapid pace that man was dick the companion of lee i knew all this well afterwards george was standing as i have described on the bridge when he came up to him and touching him said i want to speak to you a moment mr hawker george turned round and when he saw who it was asked angrily what thedo you want no offence sir you see im in trouble theres a warrant out against me and i must fly i am as hardup as a poor cove could be can you give me a trifle to help me along the road here was a slice of good luck to get rid of this one so easily george gave him money and having wished him farewell watched him striding steadily up the long hill towards exeter with great satisfaction then he went back to the publichouse and sat drinking an hour or more at last he got out his horse to ride homeward the crowd about the publichouse door was as thick as ever and the disturbance greater some of the women were trying to get their drunken husbands home one man had fallen down deaddrunk beside the door in the mud and his wife was sitting patiently beside him several girls were standing wearily about the door dressed in their best each with a carefully folded white pockethandkerchief in her hand for show and not for use waiting for their sweethearts to come forth when it should suit them while inside the tap all was a wild confusion of talk quarrelling oaths and smoke enough to sicken a scavenger these things are changed now or are changing year by year now we have our rural policeman keeping some sort of order and some show of decency and indeed these little fairs the curse of the country are gradually becoming extinct by the exertions of a more energetic class of county magistrates and though there is probably the same amount of vice public propriety is at all events more respected i think i may say that i have seen as bad or even worse scenes of drunkenness and disorder at an english fair as ever i have in any australian mining town george hawker was so hemmed in by the crowd that he was unable to proceed above a footspace he was slowly picking his way through the people when he felt some one touching him on the leg and looking round saw lee standing beside him what lee my boy you here said he i have just seen your amiable comradehe seems to be in trouble dicks always in trouble mr hawker replied he he has no care or reason he isnt a bad fellow but im always glad when he is out of my way i dont like being seen with him this is likely to be his last time though he is in a serious scrape and by way of getting out of it he is walking into exeter along the high road as if nothing was the matter theres a couple of traps in belston after him now and i came down here to keep secure bythebye have you thought of that little matter we were talking about the other night to tell you the truth i dont care how soon i am out of this part of the country oh ah replied george ive thought of it and its all right can you be at the old place the day after tomorrow that can i said lee with much pleasure youll come alone this time i suppose said george i suppose you dont want to share our little matter with the whole country no fear mr george i will be there at eight punctual and alone well byebye said george and rode off it was getting late in the evening when he started and ere he reached home it was nearly dark for the last mile his road lay through forestland noble oaks with a plentiful undergrowth of holly overshadowed a floor of brown leaves and red fern and at the end of the wood nearest home where the oaks joined their own fir plantations one mighty gnarled tree broader and older than all the rest held aloft its withered boughs against the frosty sky this oak was one of the bogie haunts of the neighbourhood all sorts of stories were told about it all of which george of course believed so that when his horse started and refused to move forward and when he saw a dark figure sitting on the twisted roots of the tree he grew suddenly cold and believed he had seen a ghost the figure rose and stalked towards him through the gathering gloom he saw that it held a baby in its arms and that it was tall and noblelooking then a new fear took possession of him not supernatural and he said in a low voiceellen that was my name once george hawker replied she standing beside him and laying her hand upon his horses shoulder i dont know what my name is now im sure it surely cant remain the same and me so altered what on earth brings you back just at this time in gods name asked george hunger cold misery drunkenness disease those are the merry companions that lead me back to my old sweetheart look here george should you know him again she held up a noble child about a year old for him to look at the child disturbed from her warm bosom began to wail what cry to see your father child she exclaimed see what a bonnie gentleman he is and what a pretty horse he rides while we tread along through the mire what have you come to me for ellen asked george do you know that if you are seen about here just now you may do me a great injury i dont want to hurt you george she replied but i must have money i cannot work and i dare not show my face here cant you take me in tonight george only just tonight and let me lie by the fire ill go in the morning but i know its going to freeze and i do dread the long cold hours so i have lain out two nights now and i had naught to eat all day doee take me in george for old loves sake do she was his own cousin an orphan brought up in the same house with him by his father never very strong in her mind though exceedingly pretty she had been early brought to ruin by george on the birth of a boy about a year before the old mans eyes were opened to what was going on and in a furious rage he turned her out of doors and refused ever to see her again george to do him justice would have married her but his father told him if he did so he should leave the house with her so the poor thing had gone away and tried to get needlework in exeter but her health failing and george having ceased to answer all applications from her she had walked over and lurked about in the woods to gain an interview with him she laid her hand on his and he felt it was deadly cold put my coat over your shoulders nelly and wait an instant while i go and speak to madge i had better let her know you are coming then we shant have any trouble he rode quickly through the plantation and gave his horse to a boy who waited in front of the door in the kitchen he found madge brooding over the fire with her elbows on her knees and without raising her head or turning round she said home early and sober what new mischief are you up to none madge none but heres the devil to pay ellens come back shes been lying out these three nights and is awful hard up its not my fault i have sent her money enough in all conscience where is she inquired madge curtly outside in the plantation why dont you bring her in you treacherous young wolf replied she what did you bring her to shame for if you are going to starve her i was going to fetch her in said george indignantly only i wanted to find out what your temper was like you vicious old cow how did i know but what you would begin some of your tantrums and miscall her no fear o that no fear of pots and kettles with me lead her in lad before shes frozen george went back for her and finding her still in the same place brought her in madge was standing erect before the fire and walking up to the unfortunate ellen took her baby from her and made her sit before the fire better not face the old man said she hes away to the revels and hell come home drunk make yourself happy for tonight at all events the poor thing began to cry which brought on such a terrible fit of coughing that madge feared she would rupture a bloodvessel she went to get her a glass of wine and returned with a candle and then for the first time they saw what a fearful object she was oh she said to george you see what i am now i aint long for this world only keep me from worse george while i am alive and do something for the boy afterwards and i am content youre going to get married i know and i wish you well but dont forget this poor little thing when its motherless if you do and let him fall into vice youll never be lucky george oh you aint going to die old nelly said george not for many years yet youre pulled down and thin but youll pick up again with the spring now old girl get some supper out before he comes home they gave her supper and put her to bed in the morning very early george heard the sound of wheels below his bedroom window and looking out saw that madge was driving out of the yard in a light cart and watching her closely saw her pick up ellen and the child just outside the gate then he went to bed again and when he awoke he heard madges voice below and knew she was come back he went down and spoke to her is she gone he asked in course she is replied madge do you think i was going to let her stay till the old man was about how much money did you give her besides what she had from me i made it five pounds in all that will keep her for some time and then you must send her some more if you let that wench starve you ought to be burnt alive a man would have married her in spite of his father a likely story said george that i was to disinherit myself for her however she shant want at present or we shall have her back again and that wont do you know george said madge you promise to be as great a rascal as your father the old man had as madge prophesied come home very drunk the night before and had lain in bed later than usual so that when he came to breakfast he found george gun in hand ready to go out going shooting my lad said the father where be going down through the hollies for a woodcock ill get one this morning its near full moon all the morning they heard him firing in the bottom below the house and at one oclock he came home emptyhanded why george said his father what hast thee been shooting at i thought ee was getting good sport ive been shooting at a mark he replied who be going to shoot now eh george asked the old man no one as i know of he replied going over to eggesford eh georgey this nice full moon is about the right thing for thee they fellowes be good fellows to keep a fat haunch for their neighbours george laughed as he admitted the soft impeachment of deerstealing but soon after grew sullen and all the afternoon sat over the fire brooding and drinking he went to bed early and had just got off his boots when the door opened and madge came in whats up to now old girl said george what are you going to be up to eh she asked with your gun only going to get an outlying deer said he thats folly enough but theres a worse folly than that its worse folly to wipe out moneyscores in blood its a worse folly if you are in a difficulty to put yourself in a harder one to get out of the first its a worse why youre mad broke in george do you think i am fool enough to make away with one of the keepers i dont know what you are fool enough to do only mind my words before its too late she went out and left him sitting moodily on the bed what a clever woman she is he mused how she hits a thing off shes been a good friend to me ive a good mind to ask her advice ill think about it tomorrow morning but on the morrow they quarrelled about something or another and her advice was never asked george was moody and captious all day and at evening having drank hard he slipped off and gun in hand rode away through the darkening woods towards the moor it was dark before he had got clear of the labyrinth of lanes through which he took his way his horse he turned out in a small croft close to where the heather began and having hid the saddle and bridle in a hedge strode away over the moor with his gun on his shoulder he would not think he would sooner whistle distance seemed like nothing to him and he was surprised and frightened to find himself already looking over the deep black gulf through which the river ran before he thought he was halfway there he paused to look before he began to descend a faint light still lingered in the frosty sky to the southwest and majestic yestor rose bold and black against it down far far beneath his feet was the river dimly heard but not seen and as he looked to where it should be he saw a little flickering star which arrested his attention that must be lees firethere he began to descend boldly at first but afterwards more stealthily and now more silently still for the fire is close by and it were well to give him no notice it is in the old place and he can see it now not ten yards before him between two rocks nearer yet a little with catlike tread there is lee close to the fire sitting on the ground dimly visible yet clearly enough for his purpose he rests the gun on a rock and takes his aim he is pinioned from behind by a vigorous hand and a voice he knows cries in his earhelp bill or youll be shot the gun goes off in the scuffle but hurts nobody and lee running up george finds the tables completely turned and himself lying after a few desperate struggles helplessly pinioned on the ground dick had merely blinded him by appearing to go to exeter they both thought it likely that he would attack lee but neither supposed he would have stolen on him so treacherously dick had just noticed him in time and sprung upon him or lees troubles would have been over for ever you treacherous young sweep you shall hang for this were lees first words ten thousand pounds would not save you now dick youre a jewel if i had listened to you i shouldnt have trusted my life to the murdering vagabond ill remember tonight my boy as long as i live although it appeared at first that ten thousand pounds would not prevent lee handing george over to justice yet after a long and stormy argument it appeared that the lesser sum of five hundred would be amply sufficient to stay any ulterior proceedings provided the money was forthcoming in a week so that ultimately george found himself at liberty again and to his great astonishment in higher spirits than he could have expected at all events said he to himself as he limped back lame and bruised i have not got that on my mind even if this other thing was found out there is a chance of getting off surely my own father wouldnt prosecutethough i wouldnt like to trust to it unless i got madge on my side his father i think i have mentioned was too blind to read and george used to keep all his accounts so that nothing would seem at first to look more easy than to imitate his fathers signature and obtain what money he wished but george knew well that the old man was often in the habit of looking through his bankers book with the assistance of madge so that he was quite unsafe without her his former embezzlement he had kept secret by altering some figure in the bankers book but this next one of such a much larger amount he felt somewhat anxious about he however knew his woman well and took his measures accordingly on the day mentioned he met lee and gave him the money agreed on and having received his assurances that he valued his life too much to trouble him any more saw him depart fully expecting that he should have another application at an early date under which circumstances he thought he would take certain precautions which should be conclusive but he saw lee no more no more for many many years but how and when they met again and who came off best in the end this tale will truly and sufficiently set forth hereafter chapter vii major buckley gives his opinion on troutfishing on emigration and on george hawker spring had come again after a long wet winter and every orchardhollow blushed once more with appleblossoms in warm sheltered southern valleys hedges were already green and even the tall hedgerowelms began day after day to grow more shady and dense it was a bright april morning about ten oclock when mary thornton throwing up her fathers studywindow from the outside challenged him to come out and take a walk and john getting his hat and stick immediately joined her in front of the house where is your aunt my love said john she is upstairs said mary i will call her she began throwing gravel at one of the upper windows and crying out auntie auntie the sash was immediately thrown no that is too violent a wordsay lifted up and a beautiful old ladys face appeared at the window my love it said in a small soft voice pray be careful of the windows did you want anything my dear i want you out for a walk auntie so come along certainly my love brother have you got your thick kerchief in your pocket no said the vicar i have not and i dont mean to have commencement of a sorethroat lecture from the window cut short by the vicar who says my dear i shall be late if you dont come jesuitically on his part for he was going nowhere so she comes accordingly as sweetlooking an old maid as ever you saw in your life people have no right to use up such beautiful women as governesses its a sheer waste of material miss thornton had been a governess all her life and now at the age of fiveandforty had come to keep her brothers house for him add her savings to his and put the finishingtouch on marys somewhat rough education my love said she i have brought you your gloves oh indeed auntie i wont wear them said mary i couldnt be plagued with gloves nobody wears them here mrs buckley wears them and it would relieve my mind if you were to put them on my dear i fear my ladys end was accelerated by unfortunately in her last illness catching sight of lady kates hands after she had been assisting her brother to pick green walnuts mary was always on the eve of laughing at these aristocratic recollections of her aunt and to her credit be it said she always restrained herself though with great difficulty she so wildly brought up without rule or guidance in feminine matters could not be brought to comprehend that prim lineandrule life of which her aunt was the very impersonation nevertheless she heard what miss thornton had to say with respect and if ever she committed an extreme gaucherie calculated to set her aunts teeth on edge she always discovered what was the matter and mended it as far as she was able they stood on the lawn while the glove controversy was going on and a glorious prospect there was that bright spring morning in one direction the eye was carried down a long broad and rich vale intersected by a gleaming river and all the way down set thick with hamlet farm and church in the dim soft distance rose the two massive towers of a cathedral now filling all the countryside with the gentle melody of their goldentoned bells while beyond them in the misty south there was a gleam in the horizon showing where the sky dipped down to sea and sands its as soft and quiet as a sunday said the vicar and what a fishing day i have half a mindhallo look here the exclamation was caused by the appearance on the walk of a very tall and noblelooking man about thirty leading a grey pony on which sat a beautiful woman with a child in her arms our party immediately moved forward to meet them and a most friendly greeting took place on both sides mary at once taking possession of the child this was major buckley and his wife agnes i mentioned before that after clere was sold the major had taken a cottage in drumston and was a constant visitor on the vicar generally calling for the old gentleman to come fishing or shooting and leaving his wife and his little son samuel in the company of mary and miss thornton i have come vicar to take you out fishing said he get your rod and come a capital day why heres the doctor so there was standing among them before any one had noticed him i announce said he that i shall accept the most agreeable invitation that any one will give me what are you going to do major going fishing ah and you madam turning to miss thornton i am going to see mrs lee who has a low fever poor thing which mrs lee madam mrs lee of eyford and which mrs lee of eyford madam mrs james lee junior or senior persevered the doctor junior replied miss thornton laughing ah said the doctor now we have it i would suggest that all the mrs lees in the parish should have a ticket with a number on it like the voituriers buckley lay it before the quartersessions if you say the idea came from a foreigner they would adopt it immediately miss thornton i will do myself the honour of accompanying you and examining the case so the ladies went off with the doctor while the vicar and major buckley turned to go fishing i shall watch you major instead of fishing myself said the vicar where do you propose going to the red water said the major accordingly they turn down a long deep lane which looks certainly as if it would lead one to a red brook for the road and banks are of a brickcolour and so it does for presently before them they discern a red mill and a broad pleasant ford where a crystal brook dimples and sparkles over a bed of reddishpurple pebbles it is very clear says the major whats the fly to be vicar thats a very hard question to answer says the vicar your scotchman eh or a small blue dun well try both says the major and in a very short time it becomes apparent that the small dun is the man for the trout seem to think that it is the very thing they have been looking for all day and rise at it two at a time they fish downwards and after killing halfadozen halfpound fish come to a place where another stream joins the first making it double its original size and here there is a great oakroot jutting into a large deep pool the vicar stands back intensely excited this is a sure place for a big fish the major eager but cool stoops down and puts his flies in just above the root at once not as a greenhorn would taking a few wide casts over the pool first thereby standing a chance of hooking a little fish and ruining his chance for a big one and at the second trial a deepbodied brown fellow about two pounds dashes at the treacherous little blue and gulps him down then what a todo is there the vicar jumping about on the grass giving all sorts of contradictory advice the major utterly despairing of ever getting his fish ashore fighting a losing battle with infinite courage determined that the trout shall remember him at all events if he does get away and the trout furious and indignant but not in the least frightened trying vainly to get back to the old root was there ever such a fish but the major is the best man for after ten minutes troutie is towed up on his side to a convenient shallow and the vicar puts on his spectacles to see him brought ashore he scientifically pokes him in the flank and spans him across the back and pronounces ex cathedra youll find sir there wont be a finer fish take him all in all killed in the parish this season ah its a noble sport says the major i shant get much more of it im afraid why shouldnt you well ill tell you says the major do you know how much property i have got no indeed i have only ten thousand pounds and how am i to bring up a family on the interest of that i should fancy it was quite enough for you said the vicar you have only one son how many more am i likely to have eh and how should i look to find myself at sixty with five boys grown up and only l ayear that is rather an extreme case said the vicar you would be poor then certainly just what i dont want to be besides wanting to make some money i am leading an idle life here and am getting very tired of it and so he hesitated and so said the vicar i am thinking of emigrating to new south wales to go into the sheepfarming line there there indeed said the vicar and what has put you up to it why my wife and i have been thinking of going to canada for some time and so the idea is not altogether new the other day hamlyn you know him showed me a letter from a cousin of his who is making a good deal of money there having seen that letter i was much struck with it and having made a great many other inquiries i laid the whole information before my wife and begged her to give me her opinion and she recommended you to stay at home in peace and comfort interposed the vicar on the contrary she said she thought we ought by all means to go returned the major wonderful indeed and when shall you go not for some time i think not for a year i hope not what a lonely old man i shall be when you are all gone nay vicar i hope not said the major you will stay behind to see your daughter happily married and your grandchildren about your knees the vicar sighed heavily and the major continued bythebye miss thornton seems to have made a conquest already young hawker seems desperately smitten did it ever strike you yes it has struck me very deep indeed said the vicar but what can i do you surely would not allow her to marry him how can i prevent it she is her own mistress and i never could control her yet how can i control her when her whole heart and soul is set on him good god said the major do you really think she cares for him oh she loves him with her whole heart i have seen it a long while my dear friend you should take her away for a short time and see if she will forget him anything sooner than let her marry him why should she not marry him said the vicar she is only a farmers granddaughter we are nobody you know but he is not of good character oh there is nothing more against him than there is against most young fellows he will reform and be steady do you know anything special against him asked the vicar not actually against him but just conceive my dear friend what a family to marry into his father i speak the plain truth is a most disreputable drunken old man living in open sin with a gipsy woman of the worst character by whom george hawker has been brought up what an atmosphere of vice the young fellow himself is universally disliked and distrusted too all over the village can you forgive me for speaking so plain there is no forgiveness necessary my good friend said the vicar i know how kind your intentions are but i cannot bring myself to have a useless quarrel with my daughter merely because i happen to dislike the object of her choice it would be quite a useless quarrel she has always had her own way and always will what does miss thornton say asked the major nothing she never does say anything she regards hawker as marys accepted suitor and though she may think him vulgar she would sooner die than commit herself so far as to say so she has been so long under others and without an opinion save theirs that she cannot form an opinion at all they had turned and were walking home when the vicar sticking his walkingcane upright in the grass began again it is the most miserable and lamentable thing that ever took place in this world look at my sister again what a delicate old maid she is used to move and be respected more than most governesses are in the highest society in the land therell be a home for her when i die think of her living in the house with any of the hawkers and yet sir that womans sense of duty is such that shed die sooner than leave her niece sooner be burnt at the stake than go one inch out of the line of conduct she has marked out for herself the vicar judged his sister most rightly we shall see that hereafter a man of determination and strength of character could have prevented it at the beginning you would say i dare say he might have but i am not a man of determination and strength of character i never was and i never shall be do you consider it in the light of a settled question then said the major that your daughter should marry young hawker god knows she will please herself i spoke to her at first about encouraging him and she began by laughing at me and ended by making a scene whenever i spoke against him i was at one time in hopes that she would have taken a fancy to young stockbridge but i fear i must have set her against him by praising him too much it wants a woman you know to manage those sort of things it does indeed you see as i said before i have no actual reason to urge against hawker and he will be very rich i shall raise my voice against her living in the house with that woman madgein fact i wont have it but take it all in all i fear i shall have to make the best of it major buckley said no more and soon after they got home there was mrs buckley queenly and beautiful waiting for her husband and there was mary pretty and full of fun there also was the doctor smoking and contemplating a new fern and miss thornton with her glovedhands folded calculating uneasily what amount of detriment marys complexion would sustain in consequence of walking about without her bonnet in an april sun one and all cried out to know what sport and little sam tottered forward demanding a fish for himself which having got he at once put into his mouth head foremost the doctor taking off his spectacles examined the contents of the fishbasket and then demanded now my good friend why do you give yourself the trouble to catch trout in that roundabout way requiring so much skill and patience in germany we catch them with a neta far superior way i assure you get any one of the idle young fellows about the village to go down to the stream with a net and they will get more trout in a day than you would in a week what said the major indignantly put a net in my rented waterif i caught any audacious scoundrel carrying a net within half a mile of it id break his neck you cant appreciate the delights of flyfishing doctoryou are no sportsman no i aint said the doctor you never said anything truer than that james buckley i am nothing of the sort when i was a young man i had a sort of brute instinct which made me take the same sort of pleasure in killing a boar that a cat does in killing a mouse but i have outlived such barbarism ha ha said the vicar and yet he gave ten shillings for a snipe and hes handandglove with every poacher in the parish the snipe was a new species sir said the doctor indignantly and if i do employ the hunters to collect for me i see no inconsistency in that but i consider this flyfishing mania just of a piece with your idiotic i repeat it idiotic institution of foxhunting why if you laid baits poisoned with nux vomica about the haunts of those animals you would get rid of them in two years the doctor used to delight in aggravating the major by attacking english sports but he had a great admiration for them nevertheless the major got out his wifes pony and setting her on it and handing up the son and heir departed home to dinner they were hardly inside the gate when mrs buckley began my dear husband did you bring him to speak of the subject we were talking about he went into it himself wife tooth and nail well well indeed my dear agnes do you know that although i love the old man dearly i must say i think he is rather weak so i fear said mrs buckley but he is surely not so weak as to allow that young fellow to haunt the house after he has had a hint that he is making love to mary my dear he accepts him as her suitor he says he has been aware of it for some time and that he has spoken to mary about it and made no impression so that now he considers it a settled thing what culpable weakness so mary encourages him then she adores him and wont hear a word against him unfortunate girl said mrs buckley and with such a noble young fellow as stockbridge ready to cut off his head for her it is perfectly inconceivable young hawker is very handsome my dear you must remember is he said mrs buckley i call him one of the most evillooking men i ever saw my dear agnes i think if you were to speak boldly to her you might do some good you might begin to undermine this unlucky infatuation of hers and i am sure if her eyes were once opened that the more she saw him the less she would like him i think james said mrs buckley that it becomes the duty of us who have been so happy in our marriage to prevent our good old vicars last days from being rendered miserable by such a mesalliance as this i am very fond of mary but the old vicar my dear has taken the place of your father to me he is like a second father to me too said the major but he wants a good many qualities that my own father had he hasnt his energy or determination why if my father had been in his place and such an illlooking young dog as that came hanging about the premises my father would have laid his stick about his back and it would be a good thing if somebody would do it now such was major buckleys opinion chapter viii the vicar hears something to his advantage my dear said old miss thornton that evening i have consulted mrs buckley on the sleeves and she is of opinion that they should be pointed do you think said mary that she thought much about the matter she promised to give the matter her earnest attention said miss thornton so i suppose she did mrs buckley would never speak at random if she once promised to give her real opinion no i dont think she would auntie but she is not very particular in her own dress she always looks like a thorough lady my dear mrs buckley is a woman whom i could set before you as a model for imitation far sooner than myself she is a duck at all events said mary and her husband is a darling miss thornton was too much shocked to say anything to hear a young lady speak of a handsome military man as a darling went quite beyond her experience she was considering how much bread and water and backboard she would have felt it her duty to give lady kate or lady fanny in old times for such an expression when the vicar who had been dozing woke up and said bless us what a night the equinoctial gales come back again this rain will make up for the dry march with a vengeance i am glad i am safely housed before a good fire unlucky words he drew nearer to the fire and began rubbing his knees he had given them about three rubs when the door opened and the maids voice was heard ominous of evil thomas jewel is worse sir and if you please his missis dont expect hell last the night and could you just step up just stepping up was a pretty little euphemism for walking three long miles dead in the teeth of a gale of wind with a fierce rushing tropical rain one of the numerous tenders of the ship jewel had just arrived before the wind under bare poles an attempt to set a rag of umbrella having ended in its being blown out of the boltropes and the aforesaid tender jewel was now in the vicarage harbour of refuge reflecting what an awful job it would have in beating back against the monsoon who has come with this message said the vicar entering the kitchen followed by miss thornton and mary me sir says a voice from the doorway oh come in will you said the vicar its a terrible night is it not oh loord said the voice in replyintending that ejaculation for a very strong affirmative and advancing towards the light displayed a figure in a long brown greatcoat reaching to the ancles and topped by some sort of headdress resembling very closely a small black carpet bag tied on with a red cotton handkerchief this was all that was visible and the good vicar stood doubting whether it was male or female till catching sight of an immense pair of hobnail boots peeping from the lower extremity of the coat he made up his mind at once and began my good boy there was a cackling laugh from under the carpet bag and a harsh grating voice replied i be a gurl dear me said the vicar then what do you dress yourself in that style forso old jewel is worse us dont think all live the night is the doctor with him said the vicar the talians with un by which he understood her to mean dr mulhaus all foreigners being considered to be italians in drumston an idea they got i take it from the wandering organ men being of that nation well said the vicar i will start at once and come its a terrible night the owner of the greatcoat assented with a fiendish cackle and departed the vicar having been well wrapped up by his sister and daughter departed also with a last injunction from miss thornton to take care of himself easier said than done such a night as this a regular southwesterly gale accompanied by a stinging cutting rain which made it almost impossible to look to windward earth and sky seemed mixed together and each twig and bough sent a separate plaint upon the gale indignant at seeing their freshacquired honours torn from them and scattered before the blast the vicar put his head down and sturdily walked against it it was well for him that he knew every inch of the road for his knowledge was needed now there was no turn in the road after he had passed the church but it took straight away over the high ground up to hawkers farm on the woodlands old jewel whom he was going to see had been a hind of hawkers for many years but about a twelvemonth before the present time he had left his service partly on account of increasing infirmity and partly in consequence of a violent quarrel with madge he was a man of indifferent character he had been married once in his life but his wife only lived a year and left him with one son who had likewise married and given to the world seven as barbarous neglected young savages as any in the parish the old man who was now lying on his deathbed had been a sort of confidential man to old hawker retained in that capacity on account the old man said once in his drink of not having any wife to worm family affairs out of him so it was generally believed by the village folks that old jewel was in possession of some fearful secrets such as a murder or two for instance or a brace of forgeries and that the hawkers darent turn him out of the cottage where he lived for their lives perhaps some of these idle rumours may have floated through the vicars brain as he fought forwards against the storm but if any did they were soon dismissed again and the good mans thoughts carried into a fresh channel and he was thinking what a fearful night this would be at sea and how any ship could live against such a storm when he came to a white gate which led into the deep woods surrounding hawkers house and in a recess of which lived old jewel and his family now began the most difficult part of his journey the broader road that led from the gate up to the hawkers house was plainly perceptible but the little path which turned up to the cottage was not so easily found and when found not easily kept on such a black wild night as this but at length having hit it he began to follow it with some difficulty and soon beginning to descend rapidly he caught sight of a light and at the same moment heard the rushing of water oh said he to himself the water is come down and i shall have a nice job to get across it any people but the jewels would have made some sort of a bridge by now but they have been content with a fallen tree ever since the old bridge was carried away he scrambled down the steep hill side with great difficulty and not without one or two nasty slips which to a man of his age was no trifle but at length stood trembling with exertion before a flooded brook across which lay a fallen tree dimly seen in the dark against the gleam of the rushing water i must stand and steady my nerves a bit after that tumble he said before i venture over there thats the brig of dread with a vengeance however i never came to harm yet when i was after duty so ill chance it the cottage stood just across the brook and he halloed aloud for some one to come after a short time the door opened and a man appeared with a lantern who is there demanded dr mulhaus wellknown voice is it you vicar aye rejoined the other its me at present but it wont be me long if i slip coming over that log here goes he said as he steadied himself and crossed rapidly while the doctor held the light ah he added when he was safe across i knew i should get over all right you did not seem very certain about it just now said the doctor however i am sincerely glad you are come i knew no weather would stop you thank you old friend said the vicar and how is the patient going fast more in your line than mine the man believes himself bewitched not uncommon said the vicar in these parts they are always bothering me with some of that sort of nonsense they went in only an ordinary scene of poverty dirt and vice such as exists to some extent in every parish in every country on the globe nothing more than that and yet a sickening sight enough a squalid damp close room with the earthen floor sunk in many places and holding pools of water the mother smoking in the chimney corner the eldest daughter nursing an illegitimate child and quarrelling with her mother in a coarse angry tone the children ragged and hungry fighting for the fireside the father away at some unlawful occupation probably or sitting drinking his wages in an alehouse that was what they saw and what any man may see today for himself in his own village whether in england or australia that working mans paradise drink dirt and sloth my friends of the working orders will produce the same effects all over the world as they came in the woman of the house rose and curtseyed to the vicar but the eldest girl sat still and turned away her head the vicar after saluting her mother went gently up to her and patting the babys cheek asked her kindly how she did the girl tried to answer him but could only sob she bent down her head again over the child and began rocking it to and fro you must bring it to be christened said the vicar kindly can you come on wednesday yes ill come she said with a sort of choke and now the woman having lit a fresh candle ushered them into the sick mans room typhus and scarlatina said the doctor how this place smells after being in the air he is sensible again i think quite sensible the sick man answered aloud so youve come mr thornton im glad of it ive got a sad story to tell you but ill have vengeance if you do your duty you see the state i am in ague said the vicar and who gave it me why god sent it to you said the vicar all people living in a narrow wet valley among woodlands like this must expect ague i tell you she gave it to me i tell you she has overlooked me and all this doctors stuff is no use unless you can say a charm as will undo her devils work my good friend said the vicar you should banish such fancies from your mind for you are in a serious position and ought not to die in enmity with anyone not die in enmity with her id never forgive her till she took off the spell whom do you mean asked the vicar why that infernal witch madge that lives with old hawker said the man excitedly thats who i mean why what injury has she done you bewitched me i tell you given me these shaking fits she told me she would when i left and so she has to prevent my speaking i might a spoke out anytime this year only the old man kept me quiet with money but now its nigh too late what might you have spoken about asked the vicar well ill just relate the matter to you said the man speaking fast and thick and ill speak the truth a twelvemonth agone this madge and me had a fierce quarrel and i miscalled her awful and told her of some things she wasnt aware i knew of and then she said if ever a word of that escapes your lips ill put such a spell on ye that your bones shall shake apart then i says if you do your bastard son shall swing who do you mean by her bastard son young george hawker he is not the son of old mrs hawker madge was brought to bed of him a fortnight before her mistress and when she bore a stillborn child old hawker and i buried it in the wood and we gave madges child to mrs hawker who never knew the difference before she died on the word of a dying man is that true demanded the vicar on the word of a dying man thats true and this also i says to madge your boy shall swing for i know enough to hang him and she said where are your proofs and io lord o lord shes at me again he sank down again in a paroxysm of shivering and they got no more from him enough there was however to make the vicar a very silent and thoughtful man as he sat watching the sick man in the close stifling room you had better go home vicar said the doctor you will make yourself ill staying here i do not expect another lucid interval no said the vicar i feel it my duty to stay longer for my own sake too what he has let out bears fearfully on my happiness doctor yes i can understand that my friend from what i have heard of the relations that exist between your daughter and that young man you have been saved from a terrible misfortune though at the cost perhaps of a few tears and a little temporary uneasiness i hope it may be as you say said the vicar strange only today major buckley was urging me to stop that acquaintance i should have ventured to do so too vicar had i been as old a friend of yours as major buckley he is not such a very old friend said the vicar only of two years standing yet i seem to have known him ten at daybreak the man died and made no sign so as soon as they had satisfied themselves of the fact they departed and came out together into the clear morning air the rainclouds had broken though when they had scrambled up out of the narrow little valley where the cottage stood they found that the wind was still high and fierce and that the sun was rising dimly through a yellow haze of driving scud they stepped out briskly revived by the freshness of all around and had made about half the distance home when they descried a horseman coming slowly towards them it seemed an early time for any one to be abroad and their surprise was increased at seeing that it was george hawker returning home where can he have been so early said the doctor so late you mean said the vicar he has not been home all night now i shall brace up my nerves and speak to him my good wishes go with you vicar said the doctor and walked on while the other stopped to speak with george hawker good morning mr thornton you are early afoot sir yes i have been sitting up all night with old jewel he is dead is he indeed sir said hawker he wont be much loss sir to the parish a sort of happy release one may say for every one but himself can i have the pleasure of a few words with you mr hawker surely sir said he dismounting allow me to walk a little on the way back with you what i have to say mr hawker said the vicar is very short and i fear also very disagreeable to all parties i am going to request you to discontinue your visits to my house altogether and in fact drop our acquaintance this is very sudden sir said hawker am i to understand sir that you cannot be induced by any conduct of mine to reconsider this decision you are to understand that such is the case sir and this is final mr thornton quite final i assure you said the vicar nothing on earth should make me flinch from my decision this is very unfortunate sir said george for i had reason to believe that you rather encouraged my visits than otherwise i never encouraged them it is true i permitted them but since then circumstances have come to my ears which render it imperative that you should drop all communication with the members of my family more especially to speak plainly with my daughter at least sir said george let me know what charge you bring against me i make no charges of any sort replied the vicar all i say is that i wish the intercourse between you and my daughter to cease and i consider sir that when i say that it ought to be sufficient i conceive that i have the right to say so much without question i think you are unjust sir i do indeed said george i may have been unjust and i may have been weak in allowing an intimacy which i do not deny mind you to spring up between my daughter and yourself but i am not unjust now when i require that it should cease i begin to be just do you forbid me your house sir i forbid you my house sir most distinctly and i wish you goodday there was no more to be said on either side george stood beside his horse after the vicar had left him till he was fairly out of earshot and then with a fierce oath he said you puritanical old humbug ill do you yet youve heard about nell and her cursed brat but the daughter aint always the same way of thinking with the father old man the vicar walked on glad enough to have got the interview over till he overtook the doctor who was walking slowly till he came up he felt as though the battle was gained already though he still rather dreaded a scene with mary how have you sped friend asked the doctor have you given the young gentleman his congee i have he replied doctor now half the work is done i feel what a culpable coward i have been not to do it before i have been deeply to blame i never should have allowed him to come near us surely the girl will not be such a fool as to regret the loss of such a man i shall tell her all i know about him and after that i can do no more no more i never had her confidence she has always had a life apart from mine the people in the village all so far below us in every way have been to me acquaintances and only that but they have been her world and she has seen no other she is a kind affectionate daughter but she would be as good a daughter to any of the farmers round as she is to me she is not a lady that is the truth god help the man who brings up a daughter without a wife you do her injustice my friend said the doctor i understand what you mean but you do her injustice all the female society she has ever seen before mrs buckley and your sister came here was of a rank inferior to herself and she has taken her impressions from that society to a great extent but still she is a lady compare her to any of the other girls in the parish and you will see the difference yes yes that is true said the vicar you must think me a strange man to speak so plainly about my own daughter doctor and to you too whom i have known so short a time but one must confide in somebody and i have seen your discretion manifested so often that i trust you they had arrived opposite the vicars gate but the doctor resisting all the vicars offers of breakfast declined to go in he walked homeward toward his cottagelodgings and as he went he mused to himself somewhat in this style what a good old man that is and yet how weak i used to say to myself when i first knew him what a pity that a man with such a noble intellect should be buried in a country village a pastor to a lot of ignorant hinds and yet he is fit for nothing else with all his intelligence and all his learning he has no go in himno back to his head contrast him with buckley and see the difference now buckley without being a particularly clever man sees the right thing and goes at it through fire and water but our old vicar sees the right and leaves it to take care of itself he cant manage his own family even that girl is a fine girl a very fine girl a good deal of character about her but her animal passions are so strong that she would be a tartar for anyone to manage she will be too much for the vicar she will marry that man in the end and if he dont use her properly shell hate him as much as she loves him now she is more like an italian than an english girl hi theres a noble rhamnea the vicar went into his house and found no one up but the maids who were keeping that saturnalia among the household gods which i am given to understand goes on in every wellregulated household before the lords of the creation rise from their downy beds i have never seen this process myself but i am informed by the friend of my heart who looked on it once for five minutes and then fled horror struck that the first act consists in turning all the furniture upside down and beating it with brooms further than this i have no information if any male eye has penetrated these awful secrets beyond that let the owner of that eye preserve a decent silence there are some things that it is better not to know only let us hope brother that you and i may always find ourselves in a position to lie in bed till it is all over in australia it may be worth while to remark this custom with many other religious observances has fallen into entire desuetude the vicar was very cross this morning he had been sitting up all night which was bad and he had been thinking these last few minutes that he had made a fool of himself by talking so freely to the doctor about his private affairs which was worse nothing irritated the vicars temper more than the feeling of having been too free and communicative with people who did not care about him a thing he was very apt to do and on this occasion he could not disguise from himself that he had been led into talking about his daughter to the doctor in a way which he characterised in his own mind as being indecent as i said he was cross and anything in the way of clearing up or disturbance always irritated him though he generally concealed it but there was a point at which his vexation always took the form of a protest more or less violent and that point was determined by anyone meddling with his manuscript sermons so on this unlucky morning in spite of freshlit fires smoking in his face and fenders in dark passages throwing him headlong into lurking coalscuttles he kept his temper like a man until coming into his study he found his favourite discourse on the sixth seal lying on the floor by the window his lectures on the th psalm on the hearthrug and the maid fanning the fire with his chef doeuvre the waterloo thanksgiving then i am sorry to say he lost his temper instead of calling the girl by her proper name he addressed her as a distinguished jewish lady a near relation of king ahab and snatching the sermon from her hand told her to go and call miss mary or hed lay his stick about her back the girl was frightenedshe had never seen her master in this state of mind before so she ran out of the room and having fetched mary ensconced herself outside the door to hear what was the matter mary tripped into the room looking pretty and fresh why father she said you have been up all night i have ordered you a cup of coffee how is old jewel dead said the vicar never mind him mary i want to speak to you seriously about something that concerns the happiness of your whole life father she said you frighten me let me get you your coffee before you begin at all events stay where you are i order you said the father i will have no temporizing until the matter grows cold i will speak now do you hear now listen she was subdued and knew what was coming she sat down and waited had he looked in her face instead of in the fire he would have seen an expression there which he would little have likeda smile of obstinacy and selfwill i am not going to mince matters and beat about the bush mary he began what i say i mean and will have it attended to you are very intimate with young hawker and that intimacy is very displeasing to me well she said well he answered i say it is not well i will not have him here you are rather late father she said he has had the run of this house these six months you should have spoken before i speak now miss said the vicar succeeding in working himself into a passion and that is enough i forbid him the house now you had better tell him so father i wont i daresay you wont said the vicar but i have told him so already this morning you have she cried father you had no right to do that you encouraged him here and now my love is given you turn round and try to break my heart i never encouraged him you all throw that in my face you have no natural affection girl i always hated the man and now i have heard things about him sufficient to bar him from any honest mans house unjust she said i will never believe it i daresay you wont said the vicar because you dont want to you are determined to make my life miserable there was jim stockbridge such a noble handsome gentlemanly young fellow and nothing would please you but to drive him wild till he left the country now go away and mind what i have said you mean to break my heart i see she turned as she was going out father she said is james stockbridge gone yes gone sailed a fortnight ago and all your doing poor boy i wonder where he is now where is he now under the cliffs of madeira standing on the deck of a brave ship beneath a rustling cloud of canvas watching awestruck that noble island like an aerial temple brown in the lights blue in the shadows floating between a sapphire sea and an azure sky far aloft in the air is ruivo five thousand feet overhead father of the great ridges and sierras that run down jagged and abrupt till they end in wild surfwashed promontories he is watching a mighty glen that pierces the mountain dark with misty shadows he is watching the waterfalls that stream from among the vineyards into the sea below and one long white monastery perched up among the crags above the highway of the world borne upon the full north wind the manhood and intelligence of europe goes past day by day in white winged ships and above all unheeding century after century the old monks have vegetated there saying their masses and ringing their chapel bells high on the windy cliff chapter ix when the kye came hame and when mary had left the room the vicar sat musing before the fire in his study well said he to himself she took it quieter than i thought she would now i cant blame myself i think i have shown her that i am determined and she seems inclined to be dutiful poor dear girl i am very sorry for her there is no doubt she has taken a fancy to this handsome young scamp but she must get over it it cant be so very serious as yet at all events i have done my duty though i cant help saying that i wish i had spoken before things went so far the maid looked in timidly and told him that breakfast was ready he went into the front parlour and there he found his sister making tea she looked rather disturbed and as the vicar kissed her he asked her where was mary she is not well brother she answered she is going to stay upstairs i fear something has gone wrong with her she and i had some words this morning answered he and that happens so seldom that she is a little upset that is all i hope there is nothing serious brother said miss thornton no i have only been telling her that she must give up receiving george hawker here and she seems to have taken a sort of fancy to his society which might have grown to something more serious so i am glad i spoke in time my dear brother do you think you have spoken in time i have always imagined that you had determined for some reason which i was not master of that she should look on mr hawker as her future husband i am afraid you will have trouble mary is selfwilled mary was very selfwilled she refused to come downstairs all day and when he was sitting down to dinner he sent up for her she sent him for an answer that she did not want any dinner and that she was going to stay where she was the vicar ate his dinner notwithstanding he was vexed but on the whole felt satisfied with himself this sort of thing he said to himself was to be expected she would get over it in time he hoped that the poor girl would not neglect her meals and get thin he might have made himself comfortable if he had seen her at the cold chicken in the back kitchen she could not quite make the matter out she rather fancied that her father and hawker had had some quarrel the effects of which would wear off and that all would come back to its old course she thought it strange too that her father should be so different from his usual self and this made her uneasy one thing she was determined on not to give up her lover come what would so far in life she had always had her own way and she would have it now all things considered she thought that sulks would be her game so sulks it was to be carried on until the vicar relented she sat up in her room till it was evening twice during the day her aunt had come up and the first time she had got rid of her under pretence of headache but the second time she was forced in decency to admit her and listen entirely unedified to a long discourse proving beyond power of contradiction that it was the duty of every young englishwoman to be guided entirely by her parents in the choice of a partner for life and how that lady kate as a fearful judgment on her for marrying a captain of artillery against the wishes of her noble relatives was now expiating her crimes on l ayear and when she might have married a duke lady kate was miss thorntons awful example her naughty girl she served to point many a moral of the old ladys but lady fanny her sister was always represented as the pattern of all christian virtues who had crowned the hopes of her family and wellwishers by marrying a gouty marquis of sixtythree with fifty thousand ayear on this occasion mary struck the old lady dumbknocked her cold our american cousins would sayby announcing that she considered lady emily to be a fool but that lady kate seemed to be a girl of some spirit so miss thornton left her to her own evil thoughts and as evening began to fall mary put on her bonnet and went out for a walk out by the back door and round through the shrubbery so that she gained the front gate unperceived from the windows but ere she reached it she heard the latch go and found herself face to face with a man he was an immensely tall man six foot at least his long heavy limbs loosely hung together and his immense broad shoulders slightly rounded in features he was hardly handsome but a kindly pleasant looking face made ample atonement for want of beauty he was dressed in kneebreeches and a great blue coat with brass buttons too large even for him was topped by a broadbrimmed beaver hat with fur on it halfaninch long in age this man was about fiveandtwenty and well known he was to all the young fellows round there for skill in all sporting matters as well as for his kindheartedness and generosity when he saw mary pop out of the little side walk right upon him he leaned back against the gate and burst out laughing no hardly burst out his laughter seemed to begin internally and silently till after one or two rounds it shook the vast fabric of his chest beyond endurance and broke out into so loud and joyous a peal that the blackbird fled screeching indignantly from the ivytree behind him what thomas troubridge said mary my dear cousin how are you now dont stand laughing there like a great gaby but come and shake hands what on earth do you see to laugh at in me nothing my cousin poll nothing he replied you know that is my way of expressing approval and you look so pretty standing there in the shade that i would break any mans neck who didnt applaud shake hands says you ill shake hands with a vengeance so saying he caught her in his arms and covered her face with kisses you audacious she exclaimed when she writhed herself free ill never come within armslength of you again how dare you only cousinly affection i assure you poll rather more violent than usual at finding myself back in drumston but entirely cousinly where have you been then tom she asked why to london to be sure give us ano you keep off sir or youll catch it what took you there went to see stockbridge and hamlyn off then they are gone she asked gone sure enough i was the last friend theyll see for many a long year how did stockbridge look was he pretty brave pretty well braver than i was mary my girl why didnt ye marry him whatyou are at me with the rest are you she answered why because he was a gaby and youre another and i wouldnt marry either of you to save your livesnow then do you mean to say you would not have me if i asked you pooh pooh i know better than that you know and again the shrubbery rang with his laughter now go in tom and let me get out said mary i say tom dear dont say you saw me i am going out for a turn and i dont want them to know it tom twisted up his great face into a mixture of mystery admiration wonder and acquiescence and having opened the gate for her went in but mary walked quickly down a deep narrow lane overarched with oak and melodious with the full rich notes of the thrush till she saw down the long vista growing now momentarily darker the gleaming of a ford where the road crossed a brook not the brook where the vicar and the major went fishing quite a different sort of stream although they were scarcely half a mile apart and joined just below here all the soil was yellow clay and being less fertile was far more densely wooded than any of the red country the hills were very abrupt and the fields but sparely scattered among the forest land the stream itself where it crossed the road flowed murmuring over a bed of loose blue slate pebbles but both above and below this place forced its way almost invisible through a dense oak wood deeply tangled with undergrowth a stone footbridge spanned the stream and having reached this it seemed as if she had come to her journeys end for leaning on the rail she began looking into the water below though starting and looking round at every sound she was waiting for some one a pleasant place this to wait in so dark so hemmed in with trees and the road so little used spring was early here and the boughs were getting quite dense already how pleasant to see the broad red moon go up behind the feathery branches and listen to the evensong of the thrush just departing to roost and leaving the field clear for the woodlark all night there were a few sounds from the village a lowing of cows and the noise of the boys at play but they were so tempered down by the distance that they only added to the evening harmony there is another sound now horses feet approaching rapidly from the side opposite to that by which she had come and soon a horseman comes in sight coming quickly down the hill when he sees her he breaks into a gallop and only pulls up when he is at the side of the brook below her this is the man she was expectinggeorge hawker ah vicar how useless is your authority when lovers have such intelligence as this it were better they should meet in your parlour under your own eye than here in the budding springtime in this quiet spot under the darkening oaks hawker spoke first i guessed he said that it was just possible you might come out tonight come down off the bridge my love and let us talk together while i hang up the horse so as he tied the horse to a gate she came down off the bridge he took her in his arms and kissed her now my poll said he i know what you are going to begin talking about i daresay you do george she answered you and my father have quarrelled the quarrel has been all on one side my love he said he has got some nonsense into his head and he told me when i met him this morning that he would never see me in his house again what has he heard george it must be something very shocking to change him like that do you know what it is perhaps i do he said but he has no right to visit my fathers sins on me he hates me and he always did and he has been racking his brains to find out something against me that rascally german doctor has found him an excuse and so he throws in my teeth as fresh discovered what he must have known years ago i dont think that george i dont think he would be so deceitful not naturally he wouldnt i know but he is under the thumb of that doctor and you know how he hates meif you dont i do i dont know why dr mulhaus should hate you george i do though that sleeky dog stockbridge who is such a favourite with him has poisoned his mind and all because he wanted you and your money and because you took up with me instead of him well now said mary dont go on about himhe is gone at all events but you must tell me what this is that my father has got against you i dont like to i tell you it is against my father not me well she answered if it was anyone but me perhaps you ought not to tell it but you ought to have no secrets from me georgei have kept none from you well my darling i will tell you then you know madge at our place yes i have seen her well its about her she and my father live together like man and wife though they aint married and the vicar must have known that these years and yet now he makes it an excuse for getting rid of me i always thought she was a bad woman said mary but you are wrong about my father he never knew it till now i am certain and of course you know he naturally wont have me go and live in the house with a bad woman does he think then or do you think replied george with virtuous indignation that i would have thought of taking you there no id sooner have taken you to america well so i believe george this wont make any difference in you mary no i neednt ask it you wouldnt have come here to meet me tonight if that had been the case it ought to make a difference george she replied i am afraid i oughtnt to come out here and see you when my father dont approve of it but you will come my little darling for all that he said not here thoughthe devil only knows who may be loitering round here half a dozen pair of lovers a night perhapsno meet me up in the croft of a night i am often in at gosfords of an evening and i can see your window from there you put a candle in the righthand corner when you want to see me and ill be down in a very few minutes i shall come every evening and watch indeed she said i wont do anything of the sort at least unless i have something very particular to say then indeed i might do such a thing now i must go home or they will be missing me stay a minute mary said he you just listen to me they will some of them be trying to take my character away you wont throw me off without hearing my defence dear mary i know you wont let me hear what lies they tell of me and dont you condemn me unheard because i come from a bad house tell me that youll give me a chance of clearing myself with you my girl and ill go home in peace and wait what girl could resist the man she loved so truly when he pleaded so well with his arm about her waist and his handsome face bent over her lit up with what she took to be love not she at all events she drew the handsome face down towards her and as she kissed him fervently said i will never believe what they say of you love i should die if i lost you i will stay by you through evil report and good report what is all the world to me without you and she felt what she said and meant it what though the words in which she spoke were borrowed from the trashy novels she was always readingthey were true enough for all that george saw that they were true and saw also that now was the time to speak about what he had been pondering over all day and suppose my own love he said that your father should stay in his present mind and not come round well she said what are we to do he asked are we to be always content with meeting here and there when we dare is there nothing further what do you mean she said in a whisper what shall we do cant you answer that he said softly try no i cant answer you tell me what fly he said in her ear fly and get married thats what i mean oh thats what you mean she replied oh george i should not have courage for that i think you will my darling when the time comes go home and think about it he kissed her once more and then she ran away homeward through the dark but she did not run far before she began to walk slower and think fly with him she thought run away and get married what a delightfully wild idea not to be entertained for a moment of course but still what a pleasant notion she meant to marry george in the end why not that way as well as any other she thought about it again and again and the idea grew more familiar at all events if her father should continue obstinate here was a way out of the difficulty he would be angry at first but when he found he could not help himself he would come round and then they would all be happy she would shut her ears to anything they said against george she could not believe it she would not he should be her husband come what might she would dissemble and keep her fathers suspicions quiet more she would speak lightly of george and make them believe she did not care for him but most of all she would worm from her father everything she could about him her curiosity was aroused and she fancied perhaps george had not told her all the truth perhaps he might be entangled with some other woman she would find it all out if she could so confusedly thinking she reached home and approaching the door heard the noise of many voices in the parlour there was evidently company and in her present excited state nothing would suit her better so sliding up to her room and changing her dress a little she came down and entered the parlour behold cried the doctor as she entered the room the eveningstar has arisen at last my dear young lady we have been loudly lamenting your absence and indisposition i have been listening to your lamentations doctor she replied they were certainly loud and from the frequent bursts of laughter i judged they were getting hysterical so i came down there was quite a party assembled the vicar and major buckley were talking earnestly together troubridge and the doctor were side by side while next the fire was mrs buckley with young sam asleep on her lap and miss thornton sitting quietly beside her having saluted them all mary sat down by mrs buckley and began talking to her then the conversation flowed back into the channel it had been following before her arrival i mean to say vicar said the major that it would be better to throw the four packs into two then you would have less squabbling and bickering about the different boundaries and you would kill the same number of hares with half the dogs and you would throw a dozen men out of work sir replied the vicar in this parish and the next and that is to be considered and about half the quantity of meat and horseflesh would be consumed which is another consideration i tell you i believe things are better as they are i hear they got a large sterncabin did they mr troubridge said the doctor i hope theyll be comfortable they should have got more amidships if they could they will be sick the longer in their position poor boys said troubridge theyll be more heartsick than stomachsick i expect theyd halfrepented before they sailed mary sat down by mrs buckley and had half an hours agreeable conversation with her till they all rose to go mrs buckley was surprised at her sprightliness and good spirits for she had expected to find her in tears the doctor had met the major in the morning and told him what had passed the night before so mrs buckley had come in to cheer mary up for the loss of her lover and to her surprise found her rather more merry than usual this made the good lady suspect at once that mary did not treat the matter very seriously or else was determined to defy her father which as mrs buckley reflected she was perfectly able to do being rich in her own right and of age so when she was putting on her shawl to go home she kissed mary and said kindly my love i hope you will always honour and obey your father and i am sure you will always under all circumstances remember that i am your true friend good night and having bidden her good night mary went in the doctor was gone with the major but tom troubridge sat still before the fire and as she came in was just finishing off one of his thundering fits of laughter at something that the vicar had said my love said the vicar i am so sorry you have been poorly though you look better tonight your dear aunt has been to toms room so there is nothing to do but to sit down and talk to us why cousin tom she said laughing i had quite forgot you at least quite forgot you were going to stay here why what a time it is since i saw you isnt it he replied such a very long time if i remember right we met last out at the gate lets see how long was that ago you ought to remember she replied youre big enough well good night im going to bed she went to her room but not to bed she sat in the window looking at the stars pale in the full moonlight wondering wondering what george was doing wondering whether she would listen to his audacious proposal and wondering lastly what on earth her father would say if she did chapter x in which we see a good deal of mischief brewing a month went on and may was well advanced the lanes had grown dark and shadowy with their summer bravery the banks were a rich mass of verdure once more starred with wildrose and eglantine and on the lesser woodland stream the king fern was again concealing the channel with brilliant golden fronds while brown bare thornthickets through which the wind had whistled savagely all winter were now changed into pleasant bowers where birds might build and sing a busy month this had been for the major fishing every day and pretty near all day determined as he said to make the most of it for fear it should be his last year there was a beaten path worn through the growing grass all down the side of the stream by his sole exertions and now the mayfly was coming and there would be no more fishing in another week so he worked harder than ever mrs buckley used to bring down her son and heir and sit under an oak by the riverside sewing pleasant long days they were when dinner would be brought down to the old tree and she would spend the day there among the long meadowgrass purple and yellow with flowers bending under the soft west wind pleasant to hear the corncrake by the hedgeside or the moorhen in the water but pleasantest of all was the time when her husband tired of fishing would come and sit beside her and the boy throwing his latelypetted flowers to the wind would run crowing to the spotted beauties which his father had laid out for him on the grass the vicar was busy in his garden and the doctor was often helping him although the most of his time was spent in natural history to which he seemed entirely devoted one evening they had been employed rather later than usual and the doctor was just gone when the vicar turned round and saw that his sister was come out with her basket and scissors to gather a fresh bouquet for the drawingroom so he went to join her and as he approached her he admired her with an affectionate admiration such a neat trim figure with the snowwhite handkerchief over her head and her white garden gloves what a contrast to mary he thought both good of their sort though he added good evening brother began miss thornton was not that dr mulhaus went from you just now yes my dear you had letters of introduction to dr mulhaus when he came to reside in this village asked miss thornton yes lord c whom i knew at oxford recommended me to him his real name i daresay is not mulhaus do you know what his real name is brother how very awkward plain plump questions of this kind are the vicar would have liked to answer no but he could not tell a lie he was also a very bad hand at prevaricating so with a stammer he said yes so do i said miss thornton good lord my dear how did you find it out i recognised him the first instant i saw him and was struck dumb i was very discreet and have never said a word even to you till now and lately i have been thinking that you might know and so i thought i would sound you i suppose you saw him when you were with her ladyship in paris in yes often said miss thornton he came to the house several times how well i remember the last the dear girls and i were in the conservatory in the morning and all of a sudden we heard the door thrown open and two men coming towards us talking from the breakfastroom we could not see them for the plants but when we heard the voice of one of them the girls got into a terrible flutter and i was very much frightened myself however there was no escape so we came round the corner on them as bold as we could and there was this dr mulhaus as we call him walking with him with himwith who the emperor alexander my dear whose voice we had recognised i thought you would have known whom i meant my dear love said the vicar i hope you reflect how sacred that is and what a good friend i should lose if the slightest hint as to who he was were to get among the gentry round you dont think he has recognised you how is it likely brother that he would remember an english governess whom he never saw but three times and never looked at once i have often wondered whether the major recognised him no buckley is a peninsular man and although at waterloo never went to paris lansmulhaus i mean was not present at waterloo so they never could have met my dear discreet old sister what tact you have i have often said to myself when i have seen you and he together if she only knew who he wasand to think of your knowing all the time ha ha ha thats very good i have lived long where tact is required my dear brother see there goes young mr hawker id sooner see him going home than coming here now id go out for a turn in the lanes but i know i should meet half a dozen couples courting as they call it bah so ill stay in the garden the vicar was right about the lanes being full of lovers never a vista that you looked down but what you saw a ghostly pair walking along side by side not arm in arm you know the man has his hands in his pockets and walks a few feet off the woman they never speak to one anotheri think i dont go too far in saying that i have met them and overtaken them and come sharp round corners on to them but i never heard them speak to one another i have asked the young men themselves whether they ever said anything to their sweethearts and those young men have answered no that they didnt know as they did so that i am inclined to believe that they are contented with that silent utterance of the heart which is so superior to the silly whisperings one hears on dark ottomans in drawingrooms but the vicar had a strong dislike to lovers walks he was a practical man and had studied parish statistics for some years so that his opinion is entitled to respect he used to ask why an honest girl should not receive her lover at her fathers house or in broad daylight and many other impertinent questions which we wont go into but which many a westcountry parson has asked before and never got an answer to of all pleasant places in the parish surely one of the pleasantest for a meeting of this kind was the old oak at the end of hawkers plantation where george met nelly a night we know of so quiet and lonely and such pleasant glimpses down long oaken glades with a bright carpet of springing fern surely there will be a couple here this sweet may evening so there is walking this way too george hawker is one of them but we cant see who the other is who should it be but mary though with whom he should walk with his arm round her waist talking so affectionately but see she raises her head why that is not mary that is old jewels dowdy handsome brazenfaced grandaughter now im going home to supper miss jenny he says so you pack off or youll have your amiable mother asking after you bythebye your sisters going to be married aint she he referred to her eldest sisterthe one that the vicar and the doctor saw nursing a baby the night that old jewel died yes replied the girl her mans going to have her at last thats his baby shes got you know and it seems hell sooner make her work for keeping it than pay for it hisself so theyre going to be married better late than never george left her and went in into the gloomy old kitchen now darkening rapidly there sat madge before the fire in her favourite attitude with her chin on her hand and her elbow on her knee well old woman said he wheres the old man away to colyton fair she answered i hope hell have the sense to stay there tonight then said george hell fall off his horse in a fit coming home drunk some of these nights and be found dead in a ditch good thing for you if he was may be said george but id be sorry for him too you would she said laughing why you young fool youd be better off in fifty ways why you unnatural old vixen said he indignantly do you miscall a man for caring for his own father aye and not such a bad un either and thats a thing im best judge of hes been a good father to you george and i like you the better lad for speaking up for him hes an awful old rascal my boy but youll be a worse if you live now stop that talk of yours madge and dont go on like a mad woman or else we shall quarrel and that i dont want for ive got something to tell you i want your help old girl aye and youll get it my pretty boy though you never tell me aught till you are forced well im going to tell you something now so keep your ears open madge where is the girl upstairs wheres the man outside in the stable doing down your horse bend over the fire and whisper in my ear lad madge old girl he whispered as they bent their heads togetherive wrote the old mans name where i oughtnt to have done what again she answered three times for gods sake mind what youre at george why said he astonished did you know id done it before twice i know of she said once last year and once last month how do you think hed have been so long without finding it out if it hadnt been for me and what a fool you were not to tell me before why you must be mad i as near let the cat out of the bag coming over that last business in the book without being ready for it as anything could be however its all right at present but whats this last why the five hundred i only did it twice you mustnt do it again george you were a fool ever to do it without me we are hardly safe now if he should get talking to the bank people however he never goes there and you must take care he dont i say madge said george what would he do if he found it out i couldnt answer for him said she he likes you best of anything next his money and sometimes i am afraid he wouldnt spare even you if he knew he had been robbed you might make yourself safe for any storm if you liked how marry that little doll thornton and get her money then if it came to a row you could square it up well said george i am pushing that on the old man wont come round and i want her to go off with me but she cant get her courage up yet well at all events said madge you should look sharp theres a regular tightlaced mob about her and they all hate you theres that mrs buckley her conversation will be very different from yours and shell see the difference and get too proud for the like of you that womans a real lady and thats very dangerous for she treats her like an equal just let that girl get over her first fancy for you and shell care no more about you than nothing get hold of her before shes got tired of you and theres another thing said george that tom troubridge is staying there again thats very bad said madge she is very likely to take a fancy to him hes a fine young fellow you get her to go off with you ill find the money somehow here comes the old man old hawker came in halfdrunk and sulky why george he said you at home i thought youd have been down hanging about the parsons you dont get on very fast with that girl lad i thought youd have had her by now youre a fool boy he reeled up to bed and left the other two in the kitchen george said madge tell us what you did with that last money i aint going to tell you he answered ha ha she said you hadnt need to hide anything from me now well i like to tell you this least of all he said that last money went to hush up the first matter did any one know of the first matter then said madge aghast yes the man who put me up to it who was that no one you know william lee of belston no one i know she answered sarcastically not know my old sweetheart bill lee of belston and i the only one that knew him when he came back well ive kept that to myself because no good was to be got by peaching on him and a secrets always worth money why lad i could have sent that man abroad again quicker than he come if i had awanted why hadnt you trusted me at first youd asaved five hundred pound youll have him back as soon as thats gone hed better mind himself then said george vindictively none o that now said madge thats what you were after the other night with your gun but nothing came of it i saw that in your face when you came home now get off to bed and if bill lee gives you any more trouble send him to me he went to bed but instead of sleeping lay thinking it would be a fine thing he thought to get her and her money i am very fond of her for her own sake but then the money would be the making of me i ought to strike while the iron is hot who knows but what nell might come gandering back in one of her tantrums and spoil everything or some of the other girls might get talking and this cursed cheque too that ought to be provided against what a fool i was not to tell madge about it before i wonder whether she is game to come though i think she is she has been very tender lately it dont look as if she was getting tired of me though she might take a fancy into her head about troubridge i daresay her father is putting him up to it though indeed that would be sure to set her against him if he hadnt done that with stockbridge shed have married him i believe well ill see her tomorrow night and carry on like mad terribly awkward it will be though if she wont however well see theres a way to make her and so he fell asleep as somebody would have it the very next day the vicar and mary had a serious quarrel whether his digestion was out of order whether the sight of so many lovecouples passing his gate the night before had ruffled him and made him bilious or whether some one was behind hand with his tithe we shall never know only we know that shortly after dinner they disagreed about some trifle and mary remained sulky all the afternoon and that at teatime driven on by pitiless fate little thinking what was hanging over him he made some harsh remark which brought down a flood of tears whereat getting into a passion he told mary somewhat unjustly that she was always sulking and was making his life miserable that it was time that she was married that tom troubridge was an excellent young fellow and that he considered it was her duty to turn her attention immediately to gaining his affections mary said with tearful indignation that it was notorious that he was making love to miss burrit of paiskow and that if he wasnt shed never never think of him for that he was a great lumbering stupid stupid fool there now then the vicar got into an unholy frame of mind and maddened by marys tears and the sight of his sister wiping her frightened face with her handkerchief said with something like an asseveration that she was always at it that she was moping about and colloquing with that infamous young scoundrel hawker that he would not have it that if he found him lurking about his premises hed either break his neck himself or find some one who could and a great deal more frantic nonsense such as weak men generally indulge in when they get in a passion much better left unsaid at any time but which on this occasion as the reader knows was calculated to be ruinous mary left the room and went to her own she was in a furious passion against her father against all the world she sat on the bed for a time and cried herself quiet it grew dark and she lit a candle and put it in the right corner of the window and soon after wrapping a shawl around her she slipped down the backstairs and went into the croft not long before she heard a low whistle to which she replied and in a very few minutes felt georges arm round her waist and his cheek against hers i knew you would not disappoint me tonight my love he began i have got something particular to say to you you seem out of sorts tonight my dear its not my fault is it not yours george oh no she said my father has been very cruel and unjust to me and i have been in a great passion and very miserable i am so glad you came tonight that i might tell you how very unhappy i was tell me everything my love dont keep back any secrets from me i wont indeed george ill tell you everything though some of it will make you very angry my father broke out about you at teatime and said that you were hanging about the place and that he wouldnt have it and then he said that i ought to marry tom troubridge and that i said id never do and then he went on worse again hes quite changed lately george i aint at all happy with him the cure is in your own hands mary come off with me i can get a licence and we could be married in a week or so or two then what follows why your father is very angry he is that at present but hell of course make believe he is in a terrible way well in a few weeks hed see it was no use carrying on that his daughter had married a young man of property who was very fond of her and as she was very fond of and that matters might be a deal worse that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush and so hell write a kind affectionate letter to his only child and say that he forgives her husband for her sake thats how the matter will end depend upon it oh george george if i could only think so can you doubt it use your reason my dear and ask yourself what he would gain by holding out you say hes so fond of you oh i know he is well my darling he wouldnt show it much if he was angry very long you dont know what a change it will make when the things once done when i am his soninlaw hell be as anxious to find out that im a saint as he is now to make me out a sinner say yes my girl i am afraid george of nothing come you are going to say yes now but when george not yet tomorrow night impossible sunday evening the better the day the better the deed come no refusal now it is too late my darling at ten oclock i shall be here under your window one kiss more my own and good night chapter xi in which the vicar preaches a farewell sermon who has not seen the misery and despair often caused in a family by the senseless selfishness of one of its members who has not felt enraged at such times to think that a man or woman should presume on the affection and kindheartedness of their relatives and yet act as if they were wholly without those affections themselves and lastly who of us all is guiltless of doing this let him that is without sin among us cast the first stone the spring sun rose on the sabbath morning as if no trouble were in store for any mortal that day the vicar rose with the sun for he had certain arrears of the days sermons to get through and he was in the habit of saying that his best and clearest passages were written with his window open in the brisk morning air but although the air was brisk and pleasant this morning and all nature was in full glory the inspiration did not come to the vicar quite so readily as usual in fact he could not write at all and at one time was thinking of pleading ill health and not preaching but afterwards changed his mind and patched the sermons up somehow making both morning and afternoon five minutes shorter than usual he felt queer and dull in the head this morning and after breakfast he walked to church with his sister and daughter not speaking a word miss thornton was rather alarmed he looked so dull and stupid but mary set it all down to his displeasure at her she was so busy with far other thoughts at church that she did not notice the strange halting way in which her father read the servicesometimes lisping sometimes trying twice before he could pronounce a word at all but after church miss thornton noticed it to her and she also noticed as they stood waiting for him under the lychgate that he passed through the crowd of neighbours who stood as usual round the porch to receive him without a word merely raising his hat in salutation conduct so strange that miss thornton began to cry and said she was sure her brother was very ill but mary said it was because he was still angry with her that he spoke to no one and that when he had forgotten his cause of offence he would be the same again at lunch the vicar drank several glasses of wine which seemed to do him good and by the time he had to miss thorntons great astonishment drunk half a bottle he was quite himself again mary was all this time in her room and the vicar asked for her but miss thornton said she was not very well oh i remember said the vicar i quarrelled with her last night i was quite in the wrong but my dear sister all yesterday and today i have been so nervous i have not known what i said or did i shall keep myself up to the afternoon service with wine and tomorrow we will see the doctor dont tell mary i am ill she will think she is the cause poor girl afternoon service went off well enough when mary heard his old familiar voice strong clear and harmonious filling the aisles and chapels of the beautiful old church she was quite reassured he seemed stronger than usual even and never did the congregation listen to a nobler or better sermon from his lips than the one they heard that spring afternoon the last alas they ever had from their kind old vicar mary could not listen to it the old innocent interest she used to have in her fathers success in preaching was gone as of old sitting beneath the carved oak screen she heard the sweet simple harmony of the evening hymn roll up and die in pleasant echoes among the lofty arches overhead as of old she could see through the rich traceried windows the moor sloping far away calm and peaceful bathed in a misty halo of afternoon sunshine all these familiar sights and sounds were the same but she herself was different she was about to break rudely through from the old world of simple routine and homely pleasure and to cast herself unthinking into a new world of passion and chance and take the consequences of such a step let them be what they might she felt as if she was the possessor of some guilty secret and felt sometimes as if some one would rise in church and denounce her how would all these quiet folks talk of her tomorrow morning that was not to be thought of she must harden her heart and think of nothing only that tomorrow she would be far away with her lover poor mary many a woman and many a man who sat so quiet and calm in the old church that afternoon had far guiltier secrets than any you ever had to trouble them and yet they all drank slept and died as quietly as many honest and good men poor girl let us judge as kindly of her as we can for she paid a fearful penalty for her selfwill she did but break through the prejudices of her education we may say and if she was undutiful what girls are not under the influence of passion if such poor excuses as these will cause us to think more kindly of her let us make them and leave the rest to god perhaps brother you and i may stand in a position to have excuses made for us one day therefore we will be charitable my lord was at church that afternoon a very rare circumstance for he was mostly at his great property in the north and had lately been much abroad for his health so when miss thornton and mary joined the vicar in the main aisle and the three went forth into the churchyard they found the villagers drawn respectfully back upon the graves and his lordship waiting in close confabulation with farmer wreford to receive the vicar as he came out a tall courtly grizzledlooking man he was with clear grey eyes and a modulated harmonious voice well did their lordships of the upperhouse know that voice when after a long sleepy debate it aroused them from ambrosial slumbers with biting sarcasm and most disagreeably told truths and most heartily did a certain proportion of their lordships curse the owner of that voice for a talented eloquent meddlesome innovator but on all his great estates he was adored by the labourers and townsfolk though hated by the farmers and country squires for he was the earliest and fiercest of the reform and freetrade warriors he came up to the vicar with a pleasant smile i have to thank you mr thornton for a most charming sermon though having the fault common to all good things of being too short miss thornton i hope you are quite well i saw lady d the other day and she begged that when i came down here i would convey her kindest love to you i think she mentioned that she was about to write to you i received a letter from her ladyship last week said miss thornton informing me that dear lady fanny had got a son and heir happy boy said my lord fifty thousand ayear and nothing to do for it unless he likes besides a minority of at least ten years for l is getting very shaky miss thornton and is still devotedly given to stewed mushrooms nay my dear lady dont look distressed she will make a noble young dowager this must be your daughter mr thorntonpray introduce me mary was introduced and his lordship addressed a few kindly commonplaces to her to which she replied with graceful modesty then he demanded of the vicar where is dr mulhaus has he been at church this afternoon at that moment the doctor attended by the old clerk was head and shoulders into the old oak chest that contained the parish registers looking for the book of burials for sixteen hundred and something not being able to get to the bottom he got bodily in as into a bath and after several dives succeeded in fishing it up from the bottom and standing there absorbed for a few minutes up to his middle in dusty parchments and angry moths he got his finger on a particular date and dashed out of church book in hand and hatless crying vicar vicar just as the villagers had cleared off and my lord was moving away with the vicar to the parsonage to take tea when his lordship saw the wild dusty figure come running out of the church porch with the parish register in his hand and no hat on his head he understood the position immediately he sat down on a tombstone and laughed till he could laugh no longer no need to tell me he said through his laughter that he is unchanged just as mad and energetic as ever at whatever he takes in hand whether getting together impossible ministries or searching the parishregister of an english village how do you do my dear old friend and how do you do old democrat answered the doctor politics seem to agree with you i believe you would die without vexationjust excuse me a moment look you here you infidel to the vicar showing him the register theres his name plainburrows curate of this parish now what do you say the vicar acquiesced with a sleepy laugh and proposed moving homewards miss thornton hoped that the doctor would join them at dinner as usual the doctor said of course and went back to fetch his hat my lord following him into the church when the others had gone down the hill and were waiting for the nobleman and the doctor at the gate miss thornton watched the two coming down the hill my lord stopped the doctor and eagerly demonstrated something to him with his forefinger on the palm of his hand but the doctor only shook his head and then the pair moved on my lord made himself thoroughly agreeable at dinner as did also the doctor mary was surprised too at the calm highbred bearing of her aunt the way she understood and spoke of every subject of conversation and the deference with which they listened to her it was a side of her aunts character she had never seen before and she felt it hard to believe that that intellectual dignified lady referred to on all subjects was the old maid she had been used to laugh at and began to feel that she was in an atmosphere far above what she was accustomed to all this is above me she said to herself let them live in this sphere who are accustomed to it i have chosen wiser out of the rank in which i have been brought up i would sooner be george hawkers wife than sit there crushed and bored by their highflown talk soon after dinner she retired with her aunt they did not talk much when they were alone so mary soon retired to her room and having made a few very slight preparations sat down at the window the time was soon to come but it was very cold the maids were out as they always were on sunday evening and there was a fire in the kitchenshe would go and sit thereso down she went she wished to be alone so when she saw a candle burning in the kitchen she was disappointed but went in nevertheless my lords groom who had been sitting before the fire rose up and saluted her a handsome young man rather square and prominent about the jaws but nevertheless foolish and amiable looking the sort of man one would suppose who if his lord were to tell him to jump into the pit tophet would pursue one of two courses either jump in himself without further to do or throw his own brother in with profuse apologies from the top of his sleek round head to the sole of his perfect topboot the model and living exponent of what a servant should befit to be put into a case and ticketed as such he saluted her as she came in and drawing a letter from his hat put it into her astonished hands my orders were miss that i was not to give it to you unless i saw you personally she thanked him and withdrew to read it it was a scrawl from george hawker the first letter she had ever received from him and ran as follows my hearts darling i shall be in the croft tonight according to promise ready to make you the happiest woman in england so i know you wont fail my lord is coming to church this afternoon and will be sure to dine with you so i send this present by his groom sam a good young chap which i have known since he was so high and like well only that he is soft which is not to his disadvantage gh she was standing under the lamp reading this when she heard the diningroom door open and the men coming out from their wine she slipped into the room opposite and stood listening in the dark she could see them as they came out there was my lord and the doctor first and behind came major buckley who had dropped in as his custom was on sunday evening and who must have arrived while she was upstairs as they passed the door inside which she stood his lordship turned round and said i tell you what my dear major if that old hawker was a tenant of mine id take away his lease and if i could force him to leave the parish one man of that kind does incalculable harm in a village by lowering the tone of the morality of the place thats the use of a great landlord if he does his duty he can punish evildoers whom the law does not reach dont say anything more about him said the doctor in a low voice its a tender subject in this house it is eh said my lord thanks for the hint goodbahmulhaus let us go up and have half an hour with miss thornton before i go they went up and then her father followed he seemed flushed and she thought he must have been drinking too much wine after they were in the drawingroom she crept upstairs and listened they were all talking except her father it was halfpast nine and she wished they would go so she went into her bedroom and waited the maids had come home and she heard them talking to the groom in the kitchen at ten oclock the bell was rung and my lords horse ordered soon he went and not long afterwards the major and the doctor followed then she saw miss thornton go to her room and her father walk slowly to his and all was still throughout the house she took her hat and shawl and slipped down stairs shoeless into her fathers study she laid a note on his chimneypiece which she had written in the morning and opening the backdoor fled swiftly forth not daring to look behind her quickly under the blinking stars under the blooming appletrees out to the croftgate and there was george waiting impatiently for her according to promise i began to fear you were not coming my dear quick jump she scrambled over the gate and jumped into his arms he hurried her down the lane about a hundred yards and then became aware of a dark object in the middle of the road thats my gig my dear once in that and we are soon in exeter all right bob all right replied a strange voice in the dark and she was lifted into the gig quickly in another moment george was beside her and they were flying through the dark steep lanes at a dangerous speed the horse was a noble beastthe finest in the country sideand like his driver knew every stock and stone on the road so that ere poor mary had recovered her first flurry they had crossed the red ford and were four miles on the road towards the capital and began to feel a little more cheerful for she had been crying bitterly dont give way polly said george no fear of my giving way now george if i had been going to do that id have done it before now tell us what you are going to do i have left everything to you i think we had better go straight on to london my dear he replied and get married by licence we could never stop in exeter and if you feel up to it i should like to get off by early coach tomorrow morning what do you say by all means shall we be there in time yes two hours before the coach starts have you money enough george she asked plenty he replied if you go short you must come to me you know she said they rattled through the broad streets of a small country town just as the moon rose the noble minster which had for many years been used as the parish church slept quietly among the yews and gravestones all the town was still only they two were awake flying she thought from the fellowship of all quiet men was her father asleep now she wondered what would miss thornton say in the morning and many other things she was asking herself when she was interrupted by george saying only eight miles to exeter we shall be in by daybreak so they left crediton minster behind them and rolled away along the broad road by the river beneath the whispering poplars as miss thornton was dressing herself next morning she heard the vicar go down into his study as usual she congratulated herself that he was better from being up thus early but determined nevertheless that he should see a doctor that day who might meet and consult with dr mulhaus then she wondered why mary had not been in she generally came into her aunts room to hookandeye her as she called it but not having come this morning miss thornton determined to go to her and accordingly went and rapped at her door no answer could the girl have been fool enough thought miss thornton nonsense no she must be asleep she opened the door and went in everything tidy the bed had not been slept in miss thornton had been in at an elopement and a famous one before so she knew the symptoms in a moment well she remembered the dreadful morning when lady kate went off with captain brentwood of the artillery well she remembered the countess going into hysterics but this was worse than that this touched her nearer home oh you naughty girl oh you wicked ungrateful girl to go and do such a thing at a time like this when ive been watching the paralysis creeping over him day by day how shall i tell him how shall i ever tell him he will have a stroke as sure as fate he was going to have one without this i dare not tell him till breakfast and yet i ought to tell him at once i was brought into the world to be driven mad by girls oh dear i wish they were all boys and we might send them to eton and wash our hands of them well i must leave crying and prepare for telling him she went into his study and at first could not see him but he was therea heap of black clothes lay on the hearthrug and miss thornton running up saw that it was her brother speechless senseless clasping a letter in his hand she saw that the worst was come and nerved herself for work like a valiant soul as she was she got him carried to his bed by the two sturdy maids and sent an express for dr mulhaus and another for the professional surgeon then she took from her pocket the letter which she had found in the poor vicars hand and going to the window read as follows when you get this father i shall be many miles away i have started to london with george hawker and god only knows whether you will see me again try to forgive me father and if not forget that you ever had a daughter who was only born to give you troubleyour erring but affectionate mary it will be seen by the reader that this unlucky letter written in agitation and hurry contained no allusion whatever to marriage but rather left one to infer that she was gone with hawker as his mistress so the vicar read it again and again each time more mistily till sense and feeling departed and he lay before his hearth a hopeless paralytic at that moment mary beside george was rolling through the fresh morning air up the beautiful exe valley her fears were gone with daylight and sunshine and as he put his arm about her waist she said i am glad we came outside are you quite happy now he asked quite happy chapter xii in which a very muscular christian indeed comes on the stage for the first four weeks that the vicar lay paralyzed the neighbouring clergymen had done his duty but now arose a new difficulty at drumston who was to do the duty while the poor vicar lay there on his back speechless how asked miss thornton of tom troubridge are we to make head against the dissenters now let the duty lapse but one single week my dear friend and you will see the chapels overflowing once more my brother has always had a hard fight to keep them to church for they have a natural tendency to dissent here and a great number dont care what the denominations are so long as there is noise enough if that is the case answered tom old mark hooks place of worship should pay best id back them against bedlam any day they certainly make the loudest noise at a revival said miss thornton but what are we to do that i am sure i dont know my dearest auntie said troubridge but i am here and my horse too ready to go any amount of errands i see no way said miss thornton but to write to the bishop and i see no way else said tom unless you like to dress me up as a parson and see if i would do miss thornton wrote to the bishop with whom she had some acquaintance and told him how her brother had been struck down with paralysis and that the parish was unprovided for that if he would send any gentleman he approved of she would gladly receive him at drumston armed with this letter tom found himself for the first time in his life in an episcopal palace a sleek servant in black opened the door with catlike tread and admitted him into a dark warm hall and on toms saying in a hoarse whisper as if he was in church that he had brought a note of importance and would wait for an answer the man glided away and disappeared through a springdoor which swung to behind him tom thought it would have banged but it didnt bishops doors never bang tom had a great awe for your peers spiritual he could get on well enough with a peer temporal particularly if that proud aristocrat happened to be in want of a horse but a bishop was quite another matter so he sat rather uncomfortable in the dark warm hall listening to such dull sounds as could be heard in the gloomy mansion a broad oak staircase led up from the hall into lighter regions and there stood on a landing above a lean wheezy old clock all over brass knobs which as he looked on it choked and sneezed four but now there was a new sound in the house an indecent secular sound a door near the top of the house was burst violently open and there was a scuffle a loud voice shouted twice unmistakeably and distinctly soo good bitch and then the astounded tom heard the worrying of a terrier and the squeak of a dying rat there was no mistake about it he heard the bones crack then he made out that a dog was induced to go into a room on false pretences and deftly shut up there and then he heard a heavy step descending the stairs towards him but before there was time for the perpetrator of these sacrileges to come in sight a side door opened and the bishop himself came forth with a letter in his hand a mild clever gentlemanlylooking man he was too tom remarked and said pray is there not a messenger from drumston here tom replied that he had brought a letter from his cousin the vicar he had rather expected to hear it demanded where is the audacious man who has dared to penetrate these sacred shades and was agreeably relieved to find that the bishop wasnt angry with him dear me said the bishop i beg a thousand pardons for keeping you in the hall pray walk into my study so in he went and sat down the bishop resumed you are mr thorntons cousin sir tom bowed i am about the nearest relation he has besides his sister my lord indeed said the bishop i have written to miss thornton to say that there is a gentleman a relation of my own now living in the house with me who will undertake mr thorntons duties and i dare say also without remuneration he has nothing to do at presentoh here is the gentleman i spoke of here was the gentleman he spoke of holding a dead rat by the tail and crying out look here uncle what did i tell you i might have been devoured alive had it not been for my faithful fly your enemy he was about six feet or nearly so in height with a highly intellectual though not a handsome face his brown hair carelessly brushed fell over a forehead both broad and lofty beneath which shone a pair of bold clear grey eyes the moment troubridge saw him he set him down in his own mind as a goer by which he meant a man who had go or energy in him a man he thought who is thrown away as a parson the bishop ringing the bell began again this is my nephew mr frank maberly the sleek servant entered my dear frank pray give that rat to sanders and let him take it away i dont like such things in the study i only brought it to convince you uncle said the other here you are sanders but sanders would have as soon shaken hands with the pope he rather thought the rat was alive and taking the tongs he received the beast at a safe distance while tom saw a smile of contempt pass over the young curates features youd make a good missionary sanders said he and turning to troubridge continued pray excuse this interlude sir you dont look as if you would refuse to shake me by my ratty hand tom thought he would sooner shake hands with him than fight him and was so won by maberlys manner that he was just going to say so when he recollected the presence he was in and blushed scarlet my dear frank resumed his uncle mr thornton of drumston is taken suddenly ill and i want you to go over and do his duties for him till he is better most certainly my dear lord and when shall i go say tomorrow will that suit your household sir said the bishop tom replied yes certainly and took his leave then the bishop turning to frank said the living of drumston nephew is in my gift and if mr thornton does not recover as is very possible i shall give it to you i wish you therefore to go to drumston and become acquainted with your future parishioners you will find miss thornton a most charming old lady frank maberly was the second son of a country gentleman of good property and was a very remarkable character his uncle had always said of him that whatever he chose to take up he would be first in and his uncle was right at eton he was not only the best cricketer and runner but decidedly the best scholar of his time at cambridge for the first year he was probably the noisiest man in his college though he never lived what is called hard but in the second year he took up his books once more and came forth third wrangler and first class and the second day after the classlist came out made a very long score in the match with oxford few men were more popular though the fast men used to call him crotchety and on some subjects indeed he was very impatient of contradiction and most of his friends were a little disappointed when they heard of his intention of going into the church his father went so far as to say my dear frank i always thought you would have been a lawyer id sooner be awell never mind what but you might have gone into the army frank said his father i am going into the army sir he said into the army of christ old mr maberly was at first shocked by this last expression from a son who rarely or never talked on religious matters and told his wife so that night but he added since ive been thinking of it im sure frank meant neither blague nor irreverence he is in earnest i never knew him tell a lie and since he was six years old he has known how to call a spade a spade hell make a good parson said the mother hell be first in that as he is in everything else said the father but hell never be a bishop said mrs maberly why not said the husband indignantly because as you say yourself husband he will call a spade a spade bah you are a radical said the father go to sleep at the time of john thorntons illness he had been ordained about a year and ahalf he had got a title for orders as a curate in a remote part of devon but had left it in consequence of a violent disagreement with his rector in which he had been most fully borne out by his uncle who by the bye was not the sort of man who would have supported his own brother had he been in the wrong since then frank maberly had been staying with his uncle and as he expressed it working the slums at exeter miss thornton sat in the drawingroom at drumston the day after toms visit to the bishop waiting dinner for the new curate tom and she had been wondering how he would come miss thornton said probably in the bishops carriage but tom was inclined to think he would ride over the dinner time was past some ten minutes when they saw a man in black put his hand on the gardengate vault over and run breathless up to the halldoor tom had recognised him and dashed out to receive him but ere he had time to say good day even the new comer pulled out his watch and having looked at it said in a tone of vexation twentyone minutes as near as possible nay a little over by jove how pursy a fellow gets mewed up in town how far do you call it now from the buller arms it is close upon four miles said tom highly amused so they told me replied frank maberly i left my portmanteau there and the landlordfellow had the audacity to say in conversation that i couldnt run the four miles in twenty minutes its lucky a parson cant bet or i should have lost my money but the last mile is very much uphill as you must allow ill tell you what sir said tom there isnt a man in this parish would go that four mile under twenty minutes if any man could i ought to know of it miss thornton had listened to this conversation with wonder not unmixed with amusement at first she had concluded that the bishops carriage was upset and that frank was the breathless messenger sent forward to chronicle the mishap but her tact soon showed the sort of person she had to deal with for she was not unacquainted with the performances of public schoolboys she laughed when she called to mind the bouleversement that used to take place when lord charles and lord frederick came home from harrow and invaded her quiet schoolroom so she advanced into the passage to meet the newcomer with one of her pleasantest smiles i must claim an old womans privilege of introducing myself mr maberly she said your uncle was tutor to the bs when i was governess to the ds so we are old acquaintances can you forgive me miss thornton he said for running up to the house in this lunatic sort of way i am still half a schoolboy you know what an old jewel she is he added to himself tom said may i show you your room mr maberly if you please do said frank and added get out fly what are you doing here but miss thornton interceded for the dog a beautiful little black and tan terrier whose points tom was examining with profound admiration thats a brave little thing mr maberly said he as he showed him to his room i should like to put in my name for a pup they stood face to face in the bedroom as he said this and frank not answering him said abruptly by jove what a splendid man you are what do you weigh now close upon eighteen stone just now i should think said tom ah but you are carrying a little flesh said frank why yes said tom ive been to london for a fortnight that accounts for it said frank many dissenters in this parish a sight of all sorts said tom they want attracting to church here they dont go naturally as they do in some parts i see said frank i suppose theyll come next sunday though to see the new parson my best plan will be to give them a stinger so that theyll come again why you see said tom its got about that therell be no service next sunday so theyll make an excuse for going to meeting our best plan will be for you and i to go about and let them know that theres a new minister then youll get them together and after that i leave it to you to keep them shall we go down to dinner they came together going out of the door and frank turned and said will you shake hands with me i think we shall suit one another aye that we shall said tom heartily youre a mans parson thats about what you are but he added seriously you wouldnt do among the old women you know at dinner miss thornton said i hope mr maberly you are none the worse after your run are you not afraid of such violent exercise bringing on palpitation of the heart not i my dear madam he said let me make my defence for what otherwise you might consider mere boyish folly i am passionately fond of athletic sports of all kinds and indulge in them as a pleasure no real man is without some sort of pleasure more or less harmless nay even your fanatic is a man who makes a pleasure and an excitement of religion my pleasures are very harmless what can be more harmless than keeping this shell of ours in the highest state of capacity for noble deeds i know he said turning to tom what the great temptation is that such men as you or i have to contend against it is the pride of life but if we know that and fight against it how can it prevail against us it is easier conquered than the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eye though some will tell you that i cant construe my greek testament and that the pride of life means something very different i hold my opinion however in spite of them then again although i have taken a good degree not so good as i might though i consider that i have only just begun to study consequently i read hard still and shall continue to do so the next twenty years please god i find my head the clearer and my intellect more powerful in consequence of the good digestion produced by exercise so i mean to use it till i get too fat which will be a long while first aint you afraid said tom laughing of offending some of your weaker brothers consciences by running four miles because a publican said you couldnt disputing with a publican might be an error of judgment said frank bah might beit was but with regard to running four milesno it is natural and right that a man at fiveandtwenty should be both able and willing to run four miles a parson above all others as a protest against effeminacy with regard to consciences those very tender conscienced men oughtnt to want a parson at all miss thornton had barely left the room to go up to the vicar leaving tom and frank maberly over their wine when the halldoor was thrown open and the wellknown voice of the doctor was heard exclaiming in angry tones if sir if always at ifs if blucher had destroyed the bridge say you as if he ever meant to be such a vandal and if he had meant to do it do you think that fifty wellesleys in one would have stayed him no sir and if he had destroyed every bridge on the seine sir he would have done better than to be overruled by the counsels of wellington glory go with him however he was a good man and why forsoothbecause the english bore the brunt at waterloo in consequence of the prussians being delayed by muddy roads and ligny said the laughing voice of major buckley oh doctor dear i like to make you angry because then your logic is so very outrageous you are like the man who pleaded not guilty of murder first because he hadnt done it secondly that he was drunk when he did it and thirdly that it was a case of mistaken identity ha ha laughed the doctor merrily recovering his good humour in a moment thats an irish story for a thousand pounds theres nothing english about that ha ha they were presented to frank as the new curate the doctor after a courteous salutation put on his spectacles and examined him carefully frank looked at him all the time with a quiet smile and in the end the doctor said allow me the privilege of shaking hands with you sir shall i be considered rude if i say that i seldom or never saw a finer head than yours on a mans shoulders and judging by the face it is well lined like a buckbasket said frank full of dirty linen plenty of it and of some quality but not in a state fit for use yet i will have it washed up and wear such of it as is worth soon the doctor saw he had found a man after his own heart and it was not long before frank and he were in the seventh heaven of discussion meanwhile the major had drawn up alongside of tom and said any news of the poor little dove that has left the nest old friend yes said tom eagerly we have got a letter good news too thank god for that said the major and where are they they are now at brighton whats that said the doctor turning round any news they told him and then it became necessary to tell frank maberly what he had not known before that the vicar had a daughter who had gone off one of the prettiest sweetest creatures mr maberly said the major that you ever saw in your life none of us i believe knew how well we loved her till she was gone and a very remarkable character besides said the doctor such a force of will as you see in few women of her age obscured by passion and girlish folly it seemed more like obstinacy to us but she has a noble heart and when she has outlived her youthful fancies i should not be surprised if she turned out a very remarkable woman chapter xiii the discovery of the forgeries one morning the man who went once aweek from old hawkers at the woodlands down to the post brought back a letter which he delivered to madge at the door she turned it over and examined it more carefully than she generally did the old mans letters for it was directed in a clerklike hand and was sealed with a big and importantlooking seal and when she came to examine this seal she saw that it bore the words b and f bank so they are at it again are they she said the deuce take em i say though for that matter i cant exactly blame the folks for looking after their own well theres no mistake about one thing he must see this letter else some of em will be coming over and blowing the whole thing he will ask me to read it for him and ill do so right an end lord what a breeze therell be i hope i shall be able to pull my lad through though it very much depends on the old uns temper however i shall soon know old hawker was nearly blind and although an avaricious suspicious old man as a general rule trusted implicitly on ordinary occasions to george and madge in the management of his accounts reflecting with some reason that it could not be their interest to cheat him of late however he had been uneasy in his mind madge there was no denying had got through a great deal more money than usual and he was not satisfied with her account of where it had gone she we know was in the habit of supplying georges extravagances in a way which tried all her ingenuity to hide from him and he mistrusting her statements had determined as far as he could to watch her on this occasion she laid the letter on the breakfast table and waited his coming down hoping that he might be in a good humour so that there might be some chance of averting the storm from george madge was much terrified for the consequences but was quite calm and firm not long before she heard his heavy step coming down the stairs and soon he came into the room evidently in no favourable state of mind if you dont kill or poison that black tomcat was his first speech by the lord i will i suppose you keep him for some of your witchwork but if hes the devil himself as i believe he is ill shoot him i wont be kept out of my natural sleep by such a devils brat as that hes been keeping up such a growling and a scrowling on the henhouse roof all night that i thought it was old scratch come for you and getting impatient if you must keep an imp of satan in the house get a mole or a rat or some quiet beast of that sort and not such a vicious toad as him shoot him after breakfast if you like she said hes no friend of mine get your breakfast and dont be a fool theres a letter for you take and read it yah read it she says and knows im blind said hawker you artful minx you want to read it yourself he took the letter up and turned it over and over he knew the seal and shot a suspicious glance at her then looking at her fixedly he put it in his breastpocket and buttoned up his coat there he said ill read it oh yes believe me ill read it you jezebel youd better eat your meat like a christian man she answered and not make such faces as them wheres the man he asked outside i suppose tell him i want the gig im going out for a drive a pleasure drive you know all down the lane and back again cut along and tell him before i do you a mischief she saw he was in one of his evil humours when nothing was to be done with him and felt very uneasy she went and ordered the gig and when he had finished breakfast he came out to the door youd best take your big coat she said else youll be getting cold and be in a worse temper than you areand thats bad enough lord knows for a poor woman to put up with how careful she is said hawker what care she takes of the old man ive left you ten thousand pounds in my will ducky goodbye he drove off and left her standing in the porch what a wild tall figure she was standing so stern and steadfast there in the morning suna woman one would rather have for a friend than an enemy hawker was full of other thoughts than these coupling his other suspicions of madge with the receipt of this letter from the bank he was growing very apprehensive of something being wrong he wanted this letter read to him but whom could he trust who better than his old companion burrows who lived in the valley below the vicarage so whipping up his horse he drove there but found he was out he turned back again puzzled going slowly and as he came to the bottom of the hill below the vicarage he saw a tall man leaning against the gate and smoking hell do for want of a better he said to himself hes an honestgoing fellow and weve always been good friends and done good business together though he is one of that cursed vicarage lot so he drew up when he came to the gate i beg your pardon mr troubridge he said with a very different tone and manner to what we have been accustomed to hear him use but could you do a kindness for a blind old man i have no one about me that i can trust since my son is gone away i have reason to believe that this letter is of importance could you be so good as to read it to me i shall be happy to oblige you mr hawker said tom i am sorry to hear that your sight is so bad yes im breaking fast said hawker however i shant be much missed i dont inquire how the vicar is because i know already and because i dont think he would care much for my inquiries after the injury my son has done him i will break the seal now may i trouble you tom troubridge read aloud b and f bank such a date sirmay i request that you will favour me personally with a call at the earliest possible opportunity at my private office broad street i have reason to fear that two forged cheques bearing your signature have been inadvertently cashed by us the amount i am sorry to inform you is considerable i need not further urge your immediate attention this is the third communication we have made to you on the subject and are much surprised at receiving no answer i hope that you will be so good as to call at once yours sir c p rollox manager i thank you mr troubridge said the old man quietly and politely you see i was not wrong when i thought that this letter was of importance may i beg as a favour that you would not mention this to any one certainly mr hawker i will respect your wish i hope your loss may not be heavy the loss will not be mine though will it said old hawker i anticipate that it will fall on the bank it is surely at their risk to cash cheques why a man might sign for all the money i have in their hands and surely they would be answerable for it i am not aware how the law stands mr hawker said troubridge fortunately no one has ever thought it worth while to forge my name well i wish you a good day sir with many thanks said hawker can i do anything for you in exeter old hawker drove away rapidly in the direction of exeter his horse a fine black clearing the ground in splendid style although a cunning man he was not quick in following a train of reasoning and he was halfway to exeter before he had thoroughly comprehended his situation and then all he saw was that somebody had forged his name and he believed that madge knew something about it i wish my boy george was at home he said hed save me getting a lawyer now i am altogether in the hands of those bank folks if they like to cheat me though its not likely theyd do that at all events i will take dickson with me dickson was an attorney of good enough repute a very clever quiet man and a good deal employed by old hawker when his business was not too disreputable some years before hawker had brought some such excessively dirty work to his office that the lawyer politely declined having anything to do with it but recommended him to an attorney who he thought would undertake it and from that time the old fellow treated him with marked respect and spoke everywhere of him as a man to be trusted such an effect had the fact of a lawyer refusing business made on him he reached exeter by two oclock so rapidly had he driven he went at once to dicksons and found him at home busy swinging the poker in deep thought before the fireplace in his inner office he was a small man with an impenetrable expressionless face who never was known to unbend himself to a human being only two facts were known about him one was that he was the best swimmer in exeter and had saved several lives from drowning and the other was that he gave away for him large sums in private charity such was the man who now received old hawker with quiet politeness and having sent his horse round to the inn stable by a clerk sat down once more by the fire and began swinging the poker and waiting for the other to begin the conversation if you are not engaged mr dickson said hawker i would be much obliged to you if you could step round to the b and f bank with me i want you to witness what passes and to read any letters or papers for me that i shall require the attorney put down the poker got his hat and stood waiting all without a word you wont find it necessary to remark on anything that occurs mr dickson unless i ask your opinion the attorney nodded and whistled a tune and then they started together through the crowded street the bank was not far and hawker pushed his way in among the crowd of customers it was some time before he could get hold of a clerk there was so much business going on when at last he did so he saidi want to see mr rollox he told me to call on him at once he is engaged at present said the clerk it is quite impossible you can see him you dont know what you are talking about man said hawker send in and tell him mr hawker of drumston is here oh i beg your pardon mr hawker i have only just come here and did not know you porter show mr hawker in they went into the formal bank parlour there was the leather writing table the sheet almanac the iron safe and all the weapons by which bankers war against mankind as in all other sanctuaries of the kind moreover there was the commanderinchief himself sitting at the table a bald clever gentlemanlylooking man who bowed when they came in good day mr hawker i am obliged to you for calling at last we thought something was wrong mr dickson i hope you are well are you attending with mr hawker or are you come on private business the attorney saidim come at his request and relapsed into silence ah said the manager i am on the whole glad that mr hawker has brought a professional adviser with him though he added laughing it is putting me rather at a disadvantage you know two to oneeh now gentlemen if you will be so good as to close the door carefully and be seated i will proceed to business hoping that you will give me your best attention about six or eight months agolet me be particular though said he referring to some papersthat is rather a loose way of beginning here it is the fourth of september last yearyes on that day mr hawker a cheque was presented at this bank drawn in favour of bearer and signed in your name for two hundred pounds and cashed the person who presented it being well known here who interrupted hawker excuse me sir said the manager allow me to come to that hereafter you were about to say i anticipate that you never drew a cheque on bearer in your life quite true that ought to have excited attention but it did not till a very few weeks ago our headclerk casting his eye down your account remarked on the peculiarity and on examining the cheque was inclined to believe that it was not in your usual handwriting he intended communicating with me but was prevented for some days by my absence and in the meantime another cheque similar but better imitated was presented by the same person and cashed without the knowledge of the headclerk on the cheque coming into his hands he reprimanded the cashier and he and i having more closely examined them came to the conclusion that they were both forgeries we immediately communicated with you and to our great surprise received no answer either to our first or second application we however were not idle we ascertained that we could lay our hands on the utterer of the cheques at any moment and tried a third letter to you which has been successful the two letters you speak of have never reached me mr rollox said hawker i started off on the receipt of yours this morningthe first i saw i am sorry sir that the bank should lose money through me but by your own showing sir the fault lay with your own clerks i have never attempted to deny it mr hawker said the manager but there are other matters to be considered before i go on i wish to give you an opportunity of sending away your professional adviser and continuing this conversation with me alone they both turned and looked at the lawyer he was sitting with his hands in his pockets and one would have thought he was whistling only no sound came his face showed no signs of intelligence in any feature save his eyes and they were expressive of the wildest and most unbounded astonishment i have nothing to do in this matter sir said hawker that i should not wish mr dickson to hear he is an honourable man and i confide in him thoroughly so be it then mr hawker said the manager i have as high an opinion of my friend mr dickson as you have but i warn you that some part of what will follow will touch you very unpleasantly i dont see how said hawker go on if you please will you be good enough to examine these two cheques and say whether they are genuine or not i have only to look at the amount of this large one to pronounce it an impudent forgery said hawker i have not signed so large a cheque for many years there was one last january twelvemonth of pounds for the land at highcot and that is the largest i believe i ever gave in my life there can be no doubt they are forgeries your sight i believe is too bad to swear easily to your own signature but that is quite enough now i have laid this case before our governor lord c and he went so far as to say that under the painful circumstances of the case if you were to refund the money the bank might let the matter drop but that otherwise it would be their most painful duty to prosecute i refund the money laughed hawker you are playing with me sir prosecute the dog i will come and see him hung ha ha it will be a terrible thing if we prosecute the utterer of these cheques said the manager why said hawker bythebye you know who he is dont you tell me who it is your own son mr hawker said the manager almost in a whisper hawker rose and glared at them with such a look of deadly rage that they shrank from him appalled then he tottered to the mantelpiece and leant against it trying to untie his neckcloth with feeble trembling fingers open your confounded window there rollox cried the lawyer starting up wheres the wine look sharp man hawker waved to him impatiently to sit down and then said at first gasping for breath but afterwards more quietly are you sure it was he that brought those cheques certainly sir said the manager you may be sure it was he had it been any one else they would not have been cashed without more examination and on the last occasion he accounted rather elaborately for your drawing such a large sum hawker recovered himself and sat down dont be frightened gentlemen he said not this time ive something to do before that comes it wont be long the doctor says but i must transact some business first o lord i see it all now that cursed cursed woman and her boy have been hoodwinking me and playing with me all this time have they oh but ill have my vengeance on em one to the stocks and another to the gallows i unfortunately cant give you any information where that man is that has the audacity to bear my name sir said he to the manager his mother at one time persuaded me that he was a child of mine but such infernal gipsy drabs as that cant be depended on you know i have the honour to wish you a very good afternoon sir thanking you for your information and hoping your counsel will secure a speedy conviction i shall probably trouble you to meet me at a magistrates tomorrow morning where i will take my oath in his presence that those cheques are forgeries you will find alterations in my bankers book too i expect well look into it all tomorrow come along dickson my sly little weasel ive a gay nights work for you im going to leave all my property to my cousin nick my bitterest enemy and a lawsuit with it thatll break his heart theres fun for the lawyerseh my boy so talking the old man strode firmly forth with a bitter malignant scowl on his flushed face the lawyer followed him and when they were in the street hawker again asked him to come to the inn and make his will for him ill stay by you hawker and see that you dont make a fool of yourself i wish you would not be so vindictive its indecent youll be ashamed of it tomorrow but in the meantime its indecent ha ha laughed hawker how quietly he talks one can see that he hasnt had a bastard child fathered on him by a gipsy hag come along old fellow theres fifty pounds worth of work for you this week if i only live through it he took the lawyer to the inn and they got dinner hawker ate but little for him but drank a good deal dickson thought he was getting drunk but when dinner was over and hawker had ordered in spiritsandwater he seemed sober enough again now mr dickson said he i am going to make a fresh will tomorrow morning and i shall want you to draw it up for me after that i want you to come home with me and transact business you will do a good days work i promise you you seem to me now to be the only man in the world i can trust i pray you dont desert me as i said before replied the lawyer i wont desert you but listen to me i dont half like the sudden way you have turned against your own son why dont you pay this money and save the disgrace of that unhappy young man i dont say anything about your disinheriting himthats no business of minebut dont be witness against him the bank or rather my lord c has been very kind about it take advantage of their kindness and hush the matter up i know you aint in the pay of the bank said hawker so i wont charge you with it i know you better than to think youd lend yourself to anything so mean but your conduct looks suspicious if you hadnt done me a few disinterested kindnesses lately i should say that theyd paid you to persuade me to stop this so as they might get their money back and save the cost of a prosecution but i aint so far gone as to believe that and so i tell you as one man to another that if youd come suddenly on such a mine of treason and conspiracy as i have this afternoon and found a lad that you have treated as and tried to believe was your own son youd be as bad as me every moment i think of it it comes out clearer that woman that lives with me has palmed that brat of hers on me as my child and he and she have been plundering me these years past the money that woman has made away with would build a ship sir what shes done with it her master the devil only knows and ive said nought about it because shes a witch and i was afraid of her but now ive found her out she has stopped the letters that they wrote to me about this boys forgery and that shows she was in it she shall pack i wont prosecute her no ive reasons against that but ill turn her out in the world without a sixpence you see im quiet enough now youre quiet enough said the lawyer and youve stated your case very well but are you sure this lad is not your son if i was sure that he was said hawker it wouldnt make any difference as i know on ah man you dont know what a rage im in if i chose i could put myself into such an infernal passion at this moment as would bring on a plectic fit and lay me dead on the floor but i wont do it not yet ill have another drop of brandy and sing you a song shall i give ee roger amaying or whatll ye have ill have you go to bed and not take any more brandy said the lawyer if you sing get in one of the waiters and sing to him hed enjoy it im going home but i shall come to breakfast tomorrow morning and find you in a different humour good night old mole said hawker good night old bat old parchment skin old sixty per cent ha ha if a wench brings a brat to thee old lad chuck it out o window and her after it thou can only get hung for it man they can only hang thee once and that is better than to keep it and foster it and have it turn against thee when it grows up good night dickson came to him in the morning and found him in the same mind they settled down to business and hawker made a new will he left all his property to his cousin a man he had had a bitter quarrel with for years except pounds to his groom and pounds to tom troubridge for an act of civility so the words ran in reading a letter for a man who ought to have been his enemy and when the will a very short one was finished and the lawyer proposed getting two of his clerks as witnesses hawker told him to fold it up and keep it that he would get it witnessed byandby youre coming home with me he said and well get it witnessed there youll see why when its done then they went to the manager of the bank and got him to go before a magistrate with him whilst he deposed on oath that the two cheques before mentioned were forgeries alleging that his life was so uncertain that the criminal might escape justice by his sudden death then he and dickson went back to the inn and after dinner started together to drive to drumston they had been so engaged with business that they had taken no notice of the weather but when they were clear of the northern suburbs of the town and were flying rapidly along the noble turnpikeroad that turning eastward skirts the broad exe for a couple of miles before turning north again they remarked that a dense black cloud hung before them and that everything foreboded a violent thunderstorm we shall get a drowning before we reach your place hawker said the lawyer im glad i brought my coat lawyers never get drowned said hawker though i believe you have tried it often enough when they crossed the bridge and turned to the north along the pretty banks of the creedy they began to hope that they would leave it on the right but ere they reached newton st cyres they saw that it was creeping up overhead and stopping a few minutes in that village perceived that the folks were all out at their doors talking to one another as people do for companys sake when a storm is coming on before they got to crediton they could distinguish above the sound of the wheels the thunder groaning and muttering perpetually and as they rattled quickly past the grand old minster a few drops of rain began to fall the boys were coming out of the grammar school in shoals laughing running whooping as the manner of boys is hawker drove slowly as he passed through the crowd and the lawyer took that opportunity to put on his greatcoat weve been lucky so far he said and now we are going to pay for our good luck before it is too late hawker pull up and stay here if we have to stop all night ill pay expenses i will indeed it will be dark before we are home do stop not for a thousand pound said hawker i wouldnt baulk myself now for a thousand pound hey fancy turning her out such a night as this without sixpence in her pocket why a man like you that all the county knows a man who has got two gold medals for bravery aint surely afraid of a thunderstorm i aint afraid of the thunderstorm but i am of the rheumatism said the other as for a thunderstorm youre as safe out of doors as in some say safer but youre mistaken if you suppose i dont fear death hawker i fear it as much as any man it didnt look like it that time you soused in over the weir after the groom lad said hawker bah man said the lawyer im the best swimmer in devon that was proved by my living at that weir in flood time so i have less to fear than any one else why if that boy hadnt been as quiet and plucky as he was i knew i could kick him off any minute and get ashore hallo thats nearer the storm burst on them in full fury and soon after it grew dark the good horse however stepped out gallantly though they made but little way for having left the high road and taken to the narrow lanes their course was always either up hill or down and every bottom they passed grew more angry with the flooding waters as they proceeded still through darkness rain and storm they held their way till they saw the lights of drumston below them how far is it to your house hawker said the lawyer this storm seems to hang about still it is as bad as ever you must be very wet its three miles to my place but a level road at least all uphill gently rising cheer up we wont be long they passed through the village rapidly lighted by the lightning the last three miles were done as quickly as any part of the journey and the lawyer rejoiced to find himself before the white gate that led up to hawkers house it was not long before they drew up to the door the storm seemed worse than ever there was a light in the kitchen and when hawker had halloed once or twice a young man ran out to take the horse is that you my boy said hawker rub the horse down and come in to get something this aint a night fit for a dog to be out in is it no indeed sir said the man i hope nones out in it but what likes to be they went in madge looked up from arranging the table for supper and stared at hawker keenly he laughed aloud and said so you didnt expect me tonight deary eh youve chose a bad night to come home in old man she answered a terrible night aint it wouldnt she have been anxious if shed a known id been out dont know as i should she said that gentleman had better get dried and have his supper ive got a bit of business first deary wheres the girl in the other kitchen call herlord listen to that a crash of thunder shook the house heard loud above the rain which beat furiously against the windows madge immediately returned with the servant girl a modest quietlooking creature evidently in terror at the storm get out that paper dickson and well get it signed the lawyer produced the will and madge and the servant girl were made to witness it dickson having dried the signatures took charge of it again and then hawker turned round fiercely to madge thats my new will he said my new will old woman oh you cat ive found you out madge saw a storm was coming worse than the one which raged and rattled outside and she braced her nerves to meet it what have you found out old man she said quietly ive found out that you and that young scoundrel have been robbing and cheating me in a way that would bring me to the workhouse in another year i have found out that he has forged my name for nearly a thousand pounds and that youve helped him i find that you yourself have robbed me of hundreds of pounds and that i have been blinded and cozened and hoodwinked by two that i kept from the workhouse and treated as well as i treated myself thats what i have found out gipsy well was all madge said standing before him with her arms folded so i say said hawker it is very well the mother to the streets and the boy to the gallows you wouldnt prosecute him william your own son no i shant he repliedbut the bank will and couldnt you stop it i could but if holding up my little finger would save him i wouldnt do it oh william she cried throwing herself on her knees dont look like that i confess everything visit it on me but spare that boy you confess do you he said get up get out of my house you shant stay here but she would not go but hanging round him kept saying spare the boy william spare the boy over and again till he struck her in his fury and pulled her towards the door get out and herd with the gipsies you belong to he said you witch you cant cry now but she moaned oh not such a night as this william not tonight i am frightened of the storm let me stay tonight i am frightened of the lightning oh i wouldnt turn out your dog such a night as this out out you devil oh william only one out you jezebel before i do you a mischief he had got the heavy door open and she passed out moaning low to herself out into the fierce rain and the black darkness and the old man held open the door for a minute to see if she were gone no a broad flickering riband of light ineffable wavered for an instant of time before his eyes lighting up the country far and wide but plainly visible between him and the blaze was a tall dark bareheaded woman wildly raising her hands above her head as if imploring vengeance upon him and ere the terrible explosion which followed had ceased to shake the old house to its foundations he shut the door and went muttering alone up to his solitary chamber the next morning the groom came into the lawyers room and informed him that when he went to call his master in the morning he had found the bed untouched and hawker sitting half undressed in his armchair dead and cold chapter xiv the majors visit to the nagshead major buckley and his wife stood together in the verandah of their cottage watching the storm all the afternoon they had seen it creeping higher and higher blacker and more threatening up the eastern heavens until it grew painful to wait any longer for its approach but now that it had burst on them and night had come on dark as pitch they felt the pleasant change in the atmosphere and in spite of the continuous gleam of the lightning and the eternal roll and crackle of the thunder they had come out to see the beauty and majesty of the tempest they stood with their arms entwined for some time in silence but after a crash louder than any of those which had preceded it major buckley said my dearest agnes you are very courageous in a thunderstorm why not james she said you cannot avoid the lightning and the thunder wont harm you most women fear the sound of the thunder more than anything but i suspect that ciudad rodrigo made more noise than this husband it did indeed my dear more noise than i ever heard in any storm yet it is coming nearer i am afraid it will shake the poor vicar very much said mrs buckley ah there is sam crying they both went into the sittingroom little sam had petitioned to go to bed on the sofa till the storm was over and now awakened by the thunder was sitting up in his bed crying out for his mother the major went in and lay down by the child on the sofa to quiet him what said he sammy youre not afraid of thunder are you yes i am said the child very much indeed i am glad you are come father lightning never strikes good boys sam said the major are you sure of that father said the little one that was a poser so the major thought it best to counterfeit sleep but he overdid it and snored so loud that the boy began to laugh and his father had to practise his deception with less noise and by degrees the little hand that held his moustache dropped feebly on the bedclothes and the major ascertaining by the childs regular breathing that his son was asleep gently raised his vast length and proposed to his wife to come into the verandah again the storm is breaking my love said he and the air is deliciously cool out there put your shawl on and come out they went out again the lightning was still vivid but the thunder less loud straight down the garden from them stretched a broad gravel walk which now cut up by the rain into a hundred water channels showed at each flash like rivers of glittering silver looking down this path toward the black wood during one of the longest continued illuminations of the lightning they saw for an instant a dark tall figure apparently advancing towards them then all the prospect was wrapped again in tenfold gloom mrs buckley uttered an exclamation and held tighter to her husbands arm every time the garden was lit up they saw the figure nearer and nearer till they knew that it was standing before them in the darkness the major was about to speak when a hoarse voice heard indistinctly above the rushing of the rain demanded is that major buckley at the same minute the stormlight blazed up once more and fell upon an object so fearful and startling that they both fell back amazed a woman was standing before them tall upright and bareheaded her long black hair falling over a face as white and ghastly as a three days corpse her wild countenance rendered more terrible by the blue glare of the lightning shining on the rain that streamed from every lock of her hair and every shred of her garments she looked like some wild daughter of the storm who had lost her way and came wandering to them for shelter i am major buckley was the answer what do you want but in gods name come in out of the rain come in and get your things dried my good woman said mrs buckley what do you want with my husband such a night as this before i dry my things or come in i will state my business said the woman coming under the verandah after that i will accept your hospitality this is a night when polecats and rabbits would shelter together in peace and yet such a night as this a man turns out of his house the woman who has lain beside him twenty years who are you my good soul said the major they call me madge the witch she said i lived with old hawker at the woodlands till tonight and he has turned me out i want to put you in possession of some intelligence that may save much misery to some that you love i can readily believe that you can do it said the major but pray dont stand there come in with my wife and get your things dried wait till you hear what i have to say george hawker my son your songood god i thought you would have known that the vicar does well this son of mine has run off with the vicars daughter well well he has committed forgery itll be known all over the country tomorrow and even now i fear the runners are after him if he is taken before he marries that girl things will be only worse than they are but never mind whether he does or not perhaps you differ with me perhaps you think that if you could find the girl now you could stop her and bring her home but you dont know where she is i do and if you will give me your solemn word of honour as a gentleman to give him warning that his forgery for five hundred pounds is discovered i will give you his direction the major hesitated for a moment thinking if you reflect a moment you must see how straightforward my story is what possible cause can i have to mislead you i know which way you will decide so i wait patiently i think i ought to say yes my love said the major to his wife if it turned out afterwards that i neglected any opportunity of saving this poor girl particularly if this tale of the forgery be true i should never forgive myself i agree with you my dear said mrs buckley give your promise and go to seek her well then said the major i give you my word of honour that i will give hawker due warning of his forgery being discovered if you will give me his direction i anticipate that they are in london and i shall start tonight to be in time for the morning coach now will you give me the address yes said madge they are at the nags head buckingham street strand london can you remember that i know where the street is said the major now will you go into the kitchen and make yourself comfortable my dear you will see my valise packed ellen get this persons clothes dried and get her some hot wine bythebye said he following her into the kitchen you must have had a terrible quarrel with hawker for him to send you out such a night as this it was about this matter she said the boy forged on his father and i knew it and tried to screen him my own son you know it was natural enough said the major you are not deceiving me are you i dont see why you should though before god i am not i only want the boy to get warning you must sleep here tonight said the major and tomorrow you can go on your way though if you cannot conveniently get away in the morning dont hurry you know my house is never shut against unfortunate people i have heard a great deal of you but i never saw you before you must be aware however that the character you have held in the place is not such as warrants me in asking you to stay here for any time the major left the kitchen and crossed the yard in a bedroom above the stable slept his groom a man who had been through his campaigns with him from first to last it was to waken him that the major took his way up the narrow stairs towards the loft jim he said i want my horse in an hour the man was out of bed in a moment and while he was dressing the major continued you know buckingham street strand jim dont you when you were recruiting you used to hang out at a publichouse there unless i am mistaken exactly so sir we did and a many good chaps we picked up there gents and all sorts why it was in that werry place major as we listed lundon him as was afterwards made sergeant for being the first man into sebastian and arterwards married skettles her as fell out of eighteen stories at brussels looking after the duke and she swore at them as came to pick her up she did and walked in at the front door as bold as brass there my good lad said the major whats the good of telling such stories as that nobody believes them you know do you know the nags head there its a terribly low place is it not its a much changed if it aint sir said jim putting on his breeches i was in there not eighteen months since its a fightinghouse and there used to be a dog show there and a reunion of vocal talent and all sorts of villanies well see to the horse jim and ill sing out when im ready said the major and went back into the house he came back through the kitchen and saw that madge was being treated by the maids with that respect that a reputed witch never fails to command then having sat for some time talking to his wife and finding that the storm was cleared off he kissed his sleeping child and its mother and mounting his horse in the stableyard rode off towards exeter in the morning when mrs buckley came down stairs she inquired for madge they told her she had been up some time and having got some breakfast was walking up and down in front of the house going there mrs buckley found her her dress was rearranged with picturesque neatness and a red handkerchief pinned over her rich dark hair that last night had streamed wild and wet in the tempest altogether she looked an utterly different being from the strange stormbeaten creature who had craved their hospitality the night before mrs buckley admired the bold upright handsome figure before her and gave her a cheery good morning i only stayed said madge to wish you goodbye and thank you for your kindness when they who should have had some pity on me turned me out you took me in you are heartily welcome said mrs buckley cannot i do more for you do you want money i fear you must none i thank you kindly she replied that would break the spell goodbye goodbye said mrs buckley madge stood in front of the door and raised her hand the blessing of god she said shall be upon the house of the buckleys and more especially upon you and your husband and the boy that is sleeping inside he shall be a brave and a good man and his wife shall be the fairest and best in the country side your kine shall cover the plains until no man can number them and your sheep shall be like the sands of the sea when misfortune and death and murder fall upon your neighbours you shall stand between the dead and the living and the troubles that pass over your heads shall be like the shadow of the light clouds that fly across the moor on a sunny day and when in your ripe and honoured old age you shall sit with your husband in a garden of your own planting in the lands far away and see your grandchildren playing around you you shall think of the words of the wild lost gipsy woman who gave you her best blessing before she went away and was seen no more mrs buckley tried to say amen but found herself crying something there was in that poor creature homeless penniless friendless that made her heart like wax she watched her as she strode down the path and afterwards looked for her reappearing on a high exposed part of the road a quarter of a mile off thinking she would take that way but she waited long and never again saw that stern tall figure save in her dreams she turned at last and one of the maids stood beside her oh missis she said youre a lucky woman today theres some in this parish would have paid a hundred pounds for such a fortune as that from her itll come trueyou will see i hope it may you silly girl said mrs buckley and then she went in and knelt beside her sleeping boy and prayed that the blessing of the gipsy woman might be fulfilled it was quite late on the evening of his second days journey that the major occupying the boxseat of the exterminator dashed with cometlike speed through so much of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world as showed itself in piccadilly at halfpast seven on a spring afternoon hah he soliloquized passing hydepark corner these should be the folks going out to dinner they dine later and later every year at this rate theyll dine at halfpast one in twenty years time thats the dukes new house eh coachman by george theres his grace himself on his brown cob god bless him there are a pair of goodstepping horses and old lady e behind em by jovein her warpaint and featherspinker than ever she hasnt got tired of it yet shed dance at her own funeral if she could and theres charley bridgenorth in the club balconyi wonder what he finds to do in peace timeand old b talking to him what does charley mean by letting himself be seen in the same balcony with that disreputable old fellow i hope he wont get his morals corrupted ah so here we are eh he dismounted at the white horse cellar and took a hasty dinner his great object was speed and so he hardly allowed himself ten minutes to finish his pint of port before he started into the street to pursue the errand on which he had come it was nearly nine oclock and he thought he would be able to reach his destination in ten minutes but it was otherwise ordered his evil genius took him down st james street he tried to persuade himself that it was the shortest way though he knew all the time that it wasnt and so he was punished in this way he had got no further than crockfords when in the glare of light opposite the door of that establishment he saw three men standing one of whom was talking and laughing in a tone perhaps a little louder than it is customary to use in the streets nowadays buckley knew that voice well better perhaps among the crackle of musketry than in the streets of london and as the broadshouldered owner of it turned his jolly handsome face towards him he could not suppress a low laugh of satisfaction at the same moment the beforementioned man recognised him and shouted out his name busaco buckley by the lord he said revisiting once more the glimpses of the gaslamps my dear old fellow how are you and where do you come from the major found himself quickly placed under a lamp for inspection and surrounded by three old and wellbeloved fellowcampaigners what could a man do under the circumstances nothing if human and fallible i should say but what the major didstay there laughing and joking and talking of old times and freshen up his honest heart and shake his honest sides with many an old halfforgotten tale of fun and mischief now he said at last you must let me go you barton to the first man he had recognised you are a married man what are you doing at crockfords the same as you are said the otherstanding outside the door the pavements free i suppose i havent been in such a place these five years where are you staying old boy the major told them and they agreed to meet at breakfast next morning then after many farewells and callings back he pursued his way towards the strand finding to his disgust that it was nearly ten oclock he nevertheless held on his way undiscouraged and turning by degrees into narrower and narrower streets came at last on one quieter than the others which ended abruptly at the river it was a quiet street save at one point and that was where a blaze of gas then recently introduced and a great object of curiosity to the major was thrown across the street from the broad ornamented windows of a flash publichouse here there was noise enough two men fighting and three or four more encouraging while a halfdrunken woman tried to separate them from the inside too came a noise of singing quarrelling and swearing such as made the major cross the road and take his way on the darker side of the street but when he got opposite the aforesaid publichouse he saw that it was called the nags head and that it was kept by one j trotter what an awful place to take that girl to said the major but there may be some private entrance and a quiet part of the house set by for a hotel nevertheless having looked well about him he could see nothing of the sort and perceived that he must storm the bar but he stood irresolute for a moment it looked such a very low place clean and handsome enough but still the company about the door looked so very disreputable j trotter he reflected why that must be trotter the fightingman i hope it may be he will remember me so he crossed when he came within the sphere of the gas lamps those who were assisting at the fight grew silent and gazed upon him with open eyes as he reached the door one of them remarked with a little flourish of oaths as a margin or garland round his remark that of all the swells hed ever seen that un was the biggest at all events similarly when they in the bar saw that giant form the blue coat and brass buttons and above all the moustache sure sign of a military man in those days conversation ceased and the major then and there became the event of the evening he looked round as he came in and through a door leading inwards he saw george hawker himself standing talking to a man with a dog under each arm the major was not deceived as to the identity of j trotter j trotter the hero of a hundred fights stood himself behind his own bar a spectacle for the gods a chest like a bull a red neck straight up and down with the back of his head and a fist like a seals flipper proclaimed him the prizefighter and his bright grey eye and ugly laughing face proclaimed him the merry goodhumoured varlet that he was what a wild state of amazement he was in when he realized the fact that major buckley of the th was actually towering aloft under the chandelier and looking round for some one to address with what elephantine politeness and respect did he show the major into a private parlour sweeping off at one round nearly a dozen pintpots that covered the table and then shutting the door stand bowing and smiling before his old pupil and so you are gone into business john are you said the major im glad to see it i hope you are doing as well as you deserve much better than that said the prizefighter much better than that sir i assure you well im going to get you to do something for me said the major do you know john that you are terribly fat the business allus does make flesh sir more especially to coves as has trained much yes yes john i am going from the point there is a young man of the name of hawker here the prizefighter remained silent but a grin gathered on his face i never contradicts a gentleman he said and if you say hes here why in course he is here but i dont say hes here you mind that sir my good fellow i saw him as i came in said the major oh indeed said the other then that absolves me from any responsibility he told me to deny him to anybody but one and you aint she he spends a deal of money with me sir so in course i dont want to offend him bythebye sir excuse me a moment the major saw that he had got hold of the right man and waited willingly the fightingman went to the door and called out my dear a tall goodlooking woman came to the bar who made a low curtsey on being presented to the major my dear repeated trotter the south side the particular i suppose she said in course said he so she soon appeared with a bottle of madeira which was of such quality that the major having tasted it winked at the prizefighter and the latter laughed and rubbed his hands now said the major do you mind telling me whether this hawker is here alone he dont live here he only comes here of a day and sometimes stays till late this evening a pretty young ladyyes a ladycome and inquired for him in my bar and i was struck all of a heap to see such a creature in such a place all frightened out of her wits so i showed her through in a minute and up stairs to where my wife sits and she waited there till he come in and she hadnt been gone ten minutes when you come the major swore aloud without equivocation or disguise ah he said if i had not met barton pray trotter have you any idea where hawker lives not the least in the world further than its somewhere hampstead way thats a thing he evidently dont want known do you think it likely that he and that young lady live in the same house i need not disguise from you that i am come after her to endeavour to get her back to her family i know they dont live in the same house said trotter because i heard her say tonight before she went away do look round george she says at my house for ten minutes before you go home you have done me a great kindness said the major in what you have told me i dont know how to thank you its only one said the prizefighter in return for a many you done me and you are welcome to it sir now i expect youd like to see this young gent so follow me if you please through many passages past many doors he followed him until they left the noise of the revelry behind and at last at the end of a long dark passage the prizefighter suddenly threw open a door and announcedmajor buckley there were four men playing at cards and the one opposite to him was george hawker the major saw at a glance almost before anyone had time to speak that george was losing money and that the other three were confederates the prizefighter went up to the table and seized the cards then after a momentary examination threw both packs in the fire when gents play cards in my house i expect them to use the cards i provides at the bar and not private packs whether marked or not mr hawker i warned you before about this youll lose every sixpence youre worth and then you will say it was done at my house quite forgetting to mention that i warned you of it repeatedly but george took no notice of him really major buckley he began this is rather rather an intrusion you would sayeh mr hawker said the major so it is but the urgency of my business must be my apology can you give me a few words alone george rose and came out with them the prizefighter showed them into another room and the major asked him to stand in the passage and see that no one was listening you see john he added we are very anxious not to be overheard i am not at all particular myself said george hawker i have nothing to conceal you will alter your mind before i have done sir said the major george didnt like the look of affairshow came it that the major and the prizefighter knew one another so well what did the former mean by all this secrecy he determined to put a bold face on the matter miss thornton is living with you sir i believe began the major not at all sir miss thornton is in lodgings of her own i have the privilege of seeing her for a few hours every day in fact i may go as far as to say that i am engaged to be married to her and that that auspicious event is to come off on thursday week may i ask you to favour me with her direction said the major i am sorry to disoblige you major buckley but i must really decline answered george i am not unaware how disinclined her family are to the connexion and as i cannot but believe that you come on their behalf i cannot think that an interview would be anything but prejudicial to my interest i must remind you too that miss thornton is of age and her own mistress in every way while george had been speaking it passed through the majors mind what a checkmate it would be if i were to withhold the information i have and set the runners on him here i might save the girl and further the ends of justice but my hands are tied by the promise i gave that womanhow unfortunate then mr hawker he said aloud i am to understand that you refuse me this address i am necessitated to refuse it most positively sir i am sorry for it i leave it to your conscience now i have got a piece of intelligence to give you which i fear will be somewhat unpalatablei got your address at this place from a woman of the name of madge you did exclaimed george who was turned out of doors by your father the night before last in consequence i understood of some misdeeds of hers having come to light she came immediately to my house and offered to give me your direction on condition of my passing my word of honour to deliver you this message that the forgery pounds was the sum mentioned i think was discovered and that the bank was going to prosecute i of course form no judgment as to the truth or falsehood of this i leave you to take your own measures about itonly i once again ask you whether you will give me an interview with miss thornton george had courage enough left to say hoarsely and firmly no then replied the major i must call you to witness that i have performed my errand to you faithfully i beg also that you will carry all our kindest remembrances to miss thornton and tell her that her poor father was struck with paralysis when he missed her and that he is not expected to live many weeks and i wish you good night he passed out and down the stairs as he passed the public parlourdoor he heard a man bawling out a song two or three lines of which he heard and which made him blush to the tips of his ears old soldier as he was as he walked up the street he soliloquised a pretty mess ive made of itdone him all the service i could and not helped her a biti see there is no chance of seeing her though i shall try i will go round hampstead tomorrow though that is a poor chance in paris now or vienna one could find her directly what a pity we have no police chapter xv the brighton races and what happened thereat george hawker just waited till he heard the retiring footsteps of the major and then leaving the house held his way rapidly towards marys lodgings which were in hampstead but finding he would be too late to gain admittance altered his course when he was close to the house and went to his own house which was not more than a few hundred yards distant in the morning he went to her and she ran down the garden to meet him before the servant had time to open the door looking so pretty and bright ah george said she you never came last night after all your promises i shall be glad when its all over george and we are together for good it wont be long first my dear he answered we must manage to get through that time as well as we can and then well begin to sound the old folks you see i am come to breakfast i expected you she said come in and we will have such a pleasant chat and after that you must take me down the town george and we will see the carriages now my love said george ive got to tell you something that will vex you but you must not be downhearted about it you know the fact is that your friends as they call themselves moving heaven and earth to get you back by getting me out of the way have hit on the expedient of spreading false reports about me and issuing scandals against me they found out my address at the nags head and came there after me not half an hour after you were gone and i only got out of their way by good luck you ought to give me credit for not giving any living soul the secret of our whereabouts so that all i have got to do is to keep quiet here until our little business is settled and then i shall be able to face them boldly again and set everything straight how cruel she said how unjust i will never believe anything against you george i am sure of that my darling he said kissing her but now there is another matter i must speak about though i dont like toi am getting short of money love i have got nearly a hundred pounds george she said and as i told you i have five thousand pounds in the funds which i can sell out at any time i like we shall do well then my polly now let us go for a walk all that week george stayed with her quietly till the time of residence necessary before they could be married was expired he knew that he was treading on a mine which at any time might burst and blow his clumsy schemes to the wind but circumstances were in his favour and the time came to an end at last he drank hard all the time without letting mary suspect it but afterwards when it was all over wondered at his nerve and selfpossession through all those trying days when he was forced eternally to have a smile or a laugh ready and could not hear a step behind him without thinking of an officer or look over his head without thinking he saw a gallows in the air it was during this time that he nursed in his heart a feeling of desperate hatred and revenge against william lee which almost became the leading passion of his life he saw or thought he saw that this man was the author of all the troubles that were gathering so thick around his head and vowed if chance threw the man in his way again that he would take ample and fearful vengeance let it cost what it might and though this feeling may have sometimes grown cold yet he never to the last day forgot or forgave the injuries this man had done him mary was as innocent of business as a child and george found little difficulty in persuading her that the best thing she could do under present circumstances was to sell out the money she had in the funds and place it in a bank to be drawn on as occasion should require saying that they should be so long perhaps before they had any other fund to depend on that they might find it necessary to undertake some business for a living in which case it would be as well to have their money under command at a moments notice there was not far from the bank an old stockbroker who had known her father and herself for many years and was well acquainted with all their affairs though they had but little intercourse by letter to him she repaired and merely informing him that she was going to marry without her fathers consent begged him to manage the business for her which he complimenting her upon her good fortune in choosing a time when the funds were so high immediately undertook at the same time recommended her to a banker where she might open an account on the same day that this business was concluded a licence was procured and their wedding fixed for the next day now thought george as he leapt into bed on that night let only tomorrow get over safely and i can begin to see my way out of the wood again and in the morning they were married in hampstead church parson clerk pewopener and beadle all remarked what a handsome young couple they were and how happy they ought to be and the parson departed and the beadle shut up the church and the mice came out again and ate the bibles and the happy pair walked away down the road bound together by a strong chain which nothing could loose but death they went to brighton mary had said she would so like to see the sea and the morning after they arrived therethe morning after their weddingmary wrote an affectionate penitential letter to her father telling him that she was married and praying his forgiveness they were quite gay at brighton and she recovered her spirits wonderfully at first george soon made acquaintances who soon got very familiar after the manner of their kindgreasy tawdry bedizened bucksnever asleep always proposing a game of cards always carrying off her husband mary hated them while she was at times proud to see her husband in such fine company such were the eagles that gathered round the carcass of george hawker and at last these eagles began to bring the henbirds with them who frightened our poor little dove with the amplitude and splendour of their feathers and their harsh strange notes george knew the character of those women well enough but already he cared little enough about his wife even before they had been a month married going on the principle that the sooner she learned to take care of herself the better for her and after they had been married little more than a month mary thought she began to see a change in her husbands behaviour to her he grew sullen and morose even to her every day almost he would come to her with a scowl upon his face and when she asked if he was angry with her would say no that he wasnt angry with her but that things were going wrongaltogether wrong and if they didnt mend he couldnt see his way out of it at all but one night he came home cheerful and hilarious though rather the worse for liquor he showed her a roll of notes which he had won at rouletteover a hundred poundsand added that shall be the game for me in future polly all square and aboveboard there my dear george i wish youd give up gambling so i will some of these fine days my dear i only do it to pass the time its cursed dull having nothing to do tomorrow is the great day at the races george i wish you would take me i never saw a horserace ay to be sure said he well go and whats more well go alone i wont have you seen in public with those dowdy drabs so they went alone such a glorious day as it wasthe last happy day she spent for very long how delightful it was all this rush and crush and shouting and hubbub around while you were seated in a phaeton secure above the turmoil what delight to see all the beautiful women in the carriages and grandest sight of all which struck awe and admiration into marys heart was the great prince himself that noble gentleman in a guttersided hat and a wig so fearfully natural that mary secretly longed to pull his hair but princes and duchesses were alike forgotten when the course was cleared for the great event of the day and one by one the sleek beauties came floating along above the crowd towards the startingpost then george leaving mary in the phaeton to the care of their landlady pushed his way among the crowd and by dint of hard squeezing got against the rail he had never seen such horses as these he had never known what firstclass horseracing was here was a new passion for him which like all his others should only by its perversion end in his ruin he had got some money on one of the horses though he of course had never seen it there was a cheer all along the line and a dark bay fled past towards the startingpost seeming rather to belong to the air than the ground by george he said aloud as the blood mounted to his face and tingled in his ears i never saw such a sight as that before he was ashamed of having spoken aloud in his excitement but a groom who stood by said for his consolation i dont suppose you ever did sir nor no man else thats young velocipede and thats chiffney aridin him youll see that horse walk over for everything next year but now the horses came down five of them abreast at a walk amid a dead silence from the crowd three of them steady old stagers but two jumping and pulling back velocipede back lara says the starter down goes the flag they dart away and then there is a low hum of conversation until a murmur is heard down the course which swells into a roar as you notice it the horses are coming one of the royal huntsmen gallops by and then as the noise comes up towards you you can hear the maddening rush of the horses feet upon the turf and at the same time a bay and a chestnut rush past in the last fierce struggle and no man knows yet who has won then the crowd poured once more over the turf and surged and cheered round the winning horses soon it came out that velocipede had won and george turning round delighted stood face to face with a gipsy woman she had her hood low on her head so that he could not see her face but she said in a low voice let me tell your fortune it is told already mother said george velocipede has won you wont tell me any better news than that this day i know no george hawker i shant replied the gipsy and raising her hood for an instant she discovered to his utter amazement the familiar countenance of madge will you let me tell your fortune now my boy she said what madge old girl by jove you shall well whod a thought of seeing you here ive been following you and looking for you ever so long she said they at the nags head didnt know where you were gone and if i hadnt been a gipsy and o good family id never have found you youre a good old woman he said i suppose youve some news for me i have she answered come away after me he followed her into a booth and they sat down she began the conversation are you married she asked ay a month since and youve got her money yes he said but ive been walking into it make the most of it said madge your fathers dead dead ay dead and whats worse lad he lived long enough to alter his will oh lord what do you mean i mean she said that he has left all his money to your cousin he found out everything all in a minute as it were and he brought a new will home from exeter and i witnessed it and he turned me out of doors and next morning after i was gone he was found dead in his bed i got to london and found no trace of you there till by an accident i heard that you had been seen down here so i came on ive got my living by casting fortins and begging and cadging and such like sometime ive slept in a barn and sometime in a hedge but ive fought my way to you true and faithful through it all you see so hes gone said george between his teeth and his money with him thats awful what an unnatural old villain he got it into his head at last george that you werent his son at all the lunaticand what put that into his head he knew you werent his wifes son you see and he had heard some stories about me before i came to live with him and so at the last he took to saying hed nought to do with you then you mean to say that you are my boy she said my own boy why lad who but thy own mother would a done for thee what i have and thou never thinking of it all these years blind lad good god said george and if i had only known that before how differently id have gone on how id have sneaked and truckled and fetched and carried for him bah its enough to drive one mad all this hideandseek work dont pay old woman you and i are bowled out with it how easy for you to have given me a hint of this years ago to make me careful but you delight in mystery and conglomeration and you always will therei aint ungrateful but when i think of what weve lost no wonder i get wild and what the devil am i to do now youve got the girls money to go on with she said not so very much of it he replied i tell you ive been playing likenever mind what this last month and ive lost every night then ive got another woman in tow that costsoh curse her what dont she cost what with money and botherin short if i dont get something from somewhere in a few months i shall be in queer street what chance is there of the parsons dying it dont matter much to you when he dies i expect said she for you may depend that those thats got hold of him wont let his money come into your hands hes altered his will you may depend on it do you really think so i should think it more probable than not you see that old matter with the bank is known all over the country although they dont seem inclined to push it against you for some reason yet its hardly likely that the vicar would let his money go to a man who couldnt be seen for fear of a rope youre a raven old woman he said what am i to do give up play to begin with well start some business with whats left ha ha well ill think of it you must want some money old girl heres a fipunnote i dont want money my boy im all right she said oh nonsense take it i wont she answered give me a kiss george he kissed her forehead and bent down his head reflecting when he looked up she was gone he ran out of the booth and looked right and left but saw her nowhere then he went sulkily back to his wife he hardly noticed her but said it was time to go home all the way back and after they had reached their lodgings he kept the same moody silence and she frightened at some unheardof calamity forbore to question him but when she was going to bed she could withhold her anxiety no longer and said to him oh george you have got some bad news let me share it with you if it is anything about my father i implore you to tell me how is it i have got no answer to the letter i wrote a month ago he answered her savagely i dont know anything about your father and i dont care ive got bad news dd bad news if that will make you sleep the sounder and once for all youll find it best when you see me sulky not to give me any of your tantrums in addition mind that he had never spoken to her like that before she went to her bed crushed and miserable and spent the night in crying while he went forth and spent the night with some of his new companions playing wildly and losing recklessly till the summer morning sun streamed through the shutters and shone upon him desperate and nigh penniless ripe for a fall lower than any he had had as yet chapter xvi the end of marys expedition let us hurry over what is to follow i who knew her so well can have no pleasure in dwelling over her misery and degradation and he who reads these pages will i hope have little sympathy with the minor details of the life of such a man as george hawker some may think that she has been punished enough already for leaving her quiet happy home to go away with such a man she must have learnt already such would say that he cares nothing for her let her leave her money behind and go back to her father to make such amends as she may for the misery she has caused him alas my dear madam who would rejoice in such a termination of her troubles more than myself but it is not for me to mete out degrees of punishment i am trying with the best of my poor abilities to write a true history of certain people whom i knew and i no more than any other human creature can see the consequences that will follow on any one act of folly or selfishness such as this poor foolish girl has committed we must wait and watch judging with all charity let you and me go on with her even to the very end good men draw together very slowly yet it is one of the greatest happinesses one is capable of to introduce two such to one another and see how soon they become friends but bad men congregate like crows or jackals and when a new one appears he is received into the pack without question as soon as he has given proof sufficient of being a rascal this was the case with george hawker his facility for making acquaintance with rogues and blacklegs was perfectly marvellous any gentleman of this class seemed to recognise him instinctively and became familiar immediately so that soon he had round him such a circle of friends as would have gone hard to send to the dogs the most honourable and virtuous young man in the three kingdoms when a new boy goes to school his way is smoothed very much at first by the cakes and pocketmoney he brings with him till these are gone he must be a weak boy indeed who cannot at a small school find some one to fight his battles and fetch and carry for him thackeray has thought of this what does he not think of in his little book dr birch where a young sycophant is represented saying to his friend who has just received a hamper hurrah old fellow ill lend you my knife this was considered so true to nature on board a ship in which i once made a long voyage that it passed into a proverb with us and if any one was seen indulging in a luxury out of the way at dinnersay an extra bottle of wine out of his private storehalfadozen would cry out at once hurrah old fellow ill lend you my knife a modest way of requesting to be asked to take a glass of wine better than that supplied by the steward in the same way george hawker was treated by the men he had got round him as a man who had a little property that he had not got rid of and as one who was to be used with some civility until his money was gone and he sank down to the level of the rest of themto the level of living by his wits if they were sharp enough to make a card or billiard sharper or otherwise to find his level among the proscribed of society let that be what it might and georges wits were not of the first order or the second and his manners and education were certainly not those of a gentleman or likely to be useful in attracting such unwary persons as these arabs of the metropolis preyed upon so it happened that when all his money was played away which came to pass in a month or two the higher and cleverer class of rascals began to look uncommonly cold upon him at first poor crushed mary used to entertain of an evening some of the elite among the cardsharpers of londonmen who actually could have spoken to a gentleman in a public place and not have got kicked these men were polite and rather agreeable and one of them a captain saxon was so deferential to her and seemed so entirely to understand her position that she grew very fond of him and was always pleased to see him at her house though indeed she saw but little of any men who came there soon after any of them arrived she used to receive a signal from george which she dared not disobey to go to bed and when she lay there lonely and sleepless she could detect from the absence of conversation save now and then a low fierce oath that they were playing desperately and at such times she would lie trembling and crying once or twice during the time she remembered these meetings they were rudely broken upon by oaths and blows and on one particular occasion she heard one of the gamesters when infuriated call her husband a dd swindling dog of a forger in these times which lasted but a few months she began to reflect what a fool she had been and how to gratify her fancy she had thrown from her everything solid and worth keeping in the world she had brought herself to confess in bitterness and anguish that he did not love her and never had and that she was a miserable unhappy dupe but notwithstanding she loved him still though she dreaded the sight of him for she got little from him now but oaths and taunts it was soon after their return from brighton that he broke out first on some trivial occasion and cursed her aloud he said he hated the sight of her pale face for it always reminded him of ruin and misery that he had the greatest satisfaction in telling her that he was utterly ruined that his father was dead and had left his money elsewhere and that her father was little better that she would soon be in the workhouse and in fine said everything that his fierce wild brutal temper could suggest she never tempted another outbreak of the kind that one was too horrible for her and crushed her spirit at once she only tried by mildness and submission to deprecate his rage but every day he came home looking fiercer and wilder as time went on her heart sunk within her and she dreaded something more fearful than she had experienced yet as i said after a month or two his first companions began to drop off or only came bullying and swearing to demand money and now another class of men began to take their place the sight of whom made her blood coldworse dressed than the others and worse mannered with strange foul oaths on their lips and then after a time two ruffians worse looking than any of the others began to come there of whom the one she dreaded most was called maitland he was always very civil to her but there was something about him his lowering evil face and wild looks which made him a living nightmare to her she knew he was flying from justice by the way he came and went and by the precaution always taken when he was there but when he came to live in the room over theirs and when by listening at odd times she found that he and her husband were engaged in some great villany the nature of which she could not understand then she saw that there was nothing to do but in sheer desperation to sit down and wait the catastrophe about this time she made another discovery that she was penniless and had been so some time george had given her money from time to time to carry on household expenses and she contrived to make these sums answer well enough but one day determined to know the worst she asked him at the risk of another explosion how their account stood at the bank he replied in the best of his humours apparently that the five thousand they had had there had been overdrawn some six weeks and that if it hadnt been for his exertions in various ways shed have been starved out before now all gone she said and where to to the devil he answered and you may go after it and what are we to do now george the best we can but the baby george i shall liein in three months you must take your chance and the baby too as long as theres any money going youll get some of it if you wrote to your father you might get some ill never do that she said wont you said he ill starve you into it when money gets scarce things remained like this till it came to be nearly ten months from their marriage mary had never written home but once from brighton and then as we know the answer had miscarried so she conceiving she was cast off by her father had never attempted to communicate with him again the time grew nigh that she should be confined and she got very sick and ill and still the man maitland lived in the house and he and george spent much of their time at night away together yet poor mary had a friend who stayed by her through it allcaptain saxon the great billiard sharper many a weary hour when she was watching up anxious and ill for her husband this man would come and sit with her talking agreeably and well about many things but chiefly about the life he used to lead before he fell so low as he was then he used to say mrs hawker you cannot tell what a relief and pleasure it is to me to have a lady to talk to again you must conceive how a man brought up like myself misses it surely captain saxon she would say you have some relations left why not go back to them they wouldnt own me he said i smashed everything a fine fortune amongst other things by my goings on and they very properly cast me off i never got beyond the law though many wellknown men speak to me now but they wont play with me though i am too good and so you see i play dark to win from young fellows and i am mixed up with a lot of scoundrels a man brought an action against me the other day to recover two hundred pounds i won of him but he couldnt do anything and the judge said that though the law couldnt touch me yet i was mixed up notoriously with a gang of sharpers that was a pleasant thing to hear in courtwasnt itbut true it has often surprised me to see how temperate you are captain saxon she said i am forced to be he said i must keep my hand steady see there its as firm as a rock no the consolation of drink is denied me i have something to live for still ill tell you a secret ive insured my life very high in favour of my little sister whom i ruined and who is out as a governess if i dont pay up to the last you see or if i commit suicide shell lose the money i pay very high i assure you on one occasion not a year ago i played for the money to pay the premium only two nights before it would have been too late there was touch and go for you but my hand was as steady as a rock and after the last game was over i fainted good lord she said what a terrible life but suppose you fall into sickness and poverty then you may fall into arrear and she will lose everything after all he laughed aloud a strange wild laugh no said he i am safe there if physicians are to be believed sometimes when i am falling asleep my head begins to flutter and whirl and i sit up in bed breathless and perspiring till it grows still again then i laugh to myself and say not this time then but it cant be long now those palpitations mrs hawker are growing worse and worse each month i have got a desperate incurable heart complaint that will carry me off sudden and sure without warning i hope to a better sort of world than this i am sorry for you captain saxon she said sobbing so very very sorry for you i thank you kindly my good friend he replied its long since i had so good a friend as you now change the subject i want to talk to you about yourself you are going to be confined in a few days i fear she said have you money my husband seems to have money enough at present but we have none to fall back upon what friends have you none that i can apply to hm he said well you must make use of me and as far as i can manage it of my purse too in case of an emergency i mean you know mrs hawker he added looking full at her to make this offer to you as i would to my own sister dont in gods name refuse my protection such as it is from any mistaken motives of jealousy now tell me as honestly as you dare how do you believe your husband gets his living i have not the least idea but i fear the worst you do right he said forewarned is forearmed and at the risk of frightening you i must bid you prepare for the worst although i know nothing about what he is engaged in yet i know that the man maitland who lives above and who you say is your husbands constant companion is a desperate man if anything happens apply to me straightway and i will do all i can my principal hope is in putting you in communication with your friends could you not trust me with your story that we might take advice together she told him all from beginning to the end and at the last she said if the worst should come whatever that may be i would write for help to major buckley for the sake of the child that is to come major buckleyhe asked eagerlydo you mean james buckley of the th the same man she replied my kindest friend oh lord he said growing pale ive got one of these spasms coming on a glass of water my dear lady in gods name he held both hands on his heart and lay back in his chair a little with livid lips gasping for breath by degrees his white hands dropped upon his lap and he said with a sigh nearer still old friend nearer than ever not far off now but he soon recovered and said mrs hawker if you ever see that man buckley again tell him that you saw charley biddulph who was once his friend fallen to be the consort of rogues and thieves cast off by everyone and dying of a heart complaint but tell him he could not die without sending a tender love to his good old comrade and that he remembered him and loved him to the very end and i shall say too said mary when all neglected me and forgot me this charles biddulph helped and cheered me and when i was fallen to the lowest that he was still to me a courteous gentleman and a faithful adviser and that but for him and his goodness i should have sunk into desperation long ago be sure that i will say this too the door opened and george hawker came in good evening captain saxon said he my wife seems to make herself more agreeable to you than she does to me i hope you are pleased with her however you are welcome to be i thank god i aint jealous wheres maitland he has not been here tonight george she said timidly curse him then give me a candle im going upstairs dont go on my account captain saxon well if you will good night saxon bade him goodnight and went george went up into maitlands room where mary was never admitted and soon she heard him hammer hammering at metal overhead she was too used to that sound to take notice of it so she went to bed but lay long awake thinking of poor captain saxon less than a week after that she was confined she had a boy and that gave her new life poorly provided for as that child was he could not have been more tenderly nursed or more prized and loved if he had been born in the palace with his majestys right honourable ministers in the anteroom drinking dry sillery in honour of the event now she could endure what was to come better and less than a month after just as she was getting well again all her strength and courage were needed the end came she was sitting before the fire about ten oclock at night nursing her baby when she heard the streetdoor opened by a key and the next moment her husband and maitland were in the room sit quiet now or ill knock your brains out with the poker said george and seizing a china ornament from the chimneypiece he thrust it into the fire and heaped the coals over it were caught like rats you fool if they have tracked us said maitland and nothing but your consummate folly to thank for it i deserve hanging for mixing myself up with such a man in a thing like this now are you coming or do you want halfan hour to wish your wife goodbye george never answered that question there was a noise of breaking glass downstairs and a moment after a sound of several feet on the stair make a fight for it said maitland if you can do nothing else make for the backdoor but george stood aghast while mary trembled in every limb the door was burst open and a tall man coming in said in the kings name i arrest you george hawker and william maitland for coining maitland threw himself upon the man and they fell crashing over the table george dashed at the door but was met by two others for a minute there was a wild scene of confusion and struggling while mary crouched against the wall with the child shut her eyes and tried to pray when she looked round again she saw her husband and maitland securely handcuffed and the tall man who first came in wiping the blood from a deep cut in his forehead said there is nothing against this woman is there sanders nothing sir except that she is the prisoner hawkers wife poor woman said the tall man she has been lately confined too i dont think it will be necessary to take her into custody take away the prisoners i shall stay here and search he began his search by taking the tongs and pulling the fire to pieces soon he came to the remnants of the china ornament which george had thrown in and after a little more raking two or three round pieces of metal fell out of the grate a very green trick he remarked well they must stay there to cool before i can touch them and turning to mary said could you oblige me with some stickingplaster your husbands confederate has given me an ugly blow she got some and put it on for him oh sir she said can you tell me what this is all about easy maam said he maitland is one of the most notorious coiners in england and your husband is his confederate and assistant weve been watching just to get a case that there would be no trouble about and weve got it and if it is proved she asked trembling he looked very serious mrs hawker i know your history as well as your husbands the same as if you told it to me so i am sorry to give a lady who is in misfortune more pain than i can help but you know coining is a hanging matter she rocked herself wildly to and fro and the chair where she sat squeezing the child against her bosom till he cried she soothed him again without a word and then said to the officer who was searching every nook and cranny in the room shall you be obliged to turn me out of here or may i stay a few nights you can stay as long as you please madam he said thats a matter with your landlady not me but if i was you id communicate with my friends and get some money to have my husband defended theyd sooner pay for the rope to hang him she said you seem a kind and pitiful sort of man tell me honestly is there any chance for him honestly none there may be some chance of his life but there is evidence enough on this one charge leave alone others mind you to convict twenty men why weve evidence of two forgeries committed on his father before ever he married you so that if he is acquitted on this charge hell be arrested for another outside the court all night long she sat up nursing the child before the fire which from time to time she replenished the officers in possession slept on sofas and dozed in chairs but when the day broke she was still there pale and thoughtful sitting much in the same place and attitude as she did before all this happened the night before which seemed to her like a year ago so great was the change since then then thought she he was nothing but a villain after all he had merely gained her heart for moneys sake and cast her off when it was gone what a miserable fool she had been and how rightly served now to be left penniless in the world penniless but not friendless she remembered captain saxon and determined to go to him and ask his advice so when the strange weird morning had crept on to such time as the accustomed crowd began to surge through the street she put on her bonnet and went away for the first time to seek him at his lodgings in a small street leading off piccadilly an old woman answered the door the captain was gone she said to boulogne and wouldnt be back yet for a fortnight would she leave any name she hardly thought it worth while all the world seemed to have deserted her now but she said more in absence of mind than for any other reason tell him that mrs hawker called if you please mrs hawker the old woman said theres a letter for you maam i believe and something particular too cause he told me to keep it in my desk till you called just step in if you please mary followed her in and she produced a letter directed to mrs hawker when mary opened it which she did in the street after the door was shut the first thing she saw was a banknote for five pounds and behind it was the following note i am forced to go to boulogne at a moments notice with a man whom i must not lose sight of should you have occasion to apply to me during my absence which is fearfully probable i have left this begging your acceptance of it in the same spirit as that in which it was offered and i pray you to accept this piece of advice at the same time apply instantly to your friends and go back to them at once dont stop about london on any excuse you have never known what it is to be without money yet take care you never do when a man or a woman is poor and hungry there is a troop of devils who always follow such whispering all sorts of things to them they are all or nearly all known to me take care you do not make their acquaintance yours most affectionately charles biddulph what a strange letter she thought he must be mad yet there was method in his madness too devils such as he spoke of had leant over her chair and whispered to her before now plain to be heard but that was in the old times when she sat brooding alone over the fire at night she was no longer alone now and they had fledfled scared at the face of a baby she went home and spoke to the landlady but little was owing and that she had money enough to pay without the five pounds that the kind gambler had given her however when she asked the landlady whether she could stay there a week or two longer the woman prayed her with tears to begone that she and her husband had brought trouble enough on them already but there was still a week left of their old tenancy so she held possession in spite of the landlady and from the policeofficers who were still about the place she heard that the two prisoners had been committed for trial and that that trial would take place early in the week at the old bailey three days before the trial she had to leave the lodgings with but little more than two pounds in the world for those three days she got lodging as she could in coffeehouses and such places always meeting however with that sort of kindness and sympathy from the women belonging to them which could not be bought for money she was in such a dull state of despair that she was happily insensible to all smaller discomforts and on the day of the trial she endeavoured to push into the court with her child in her arms the crowd was too dense and the heat was too great for her so she came outside and sat on some steps on one side of a passage once she had to move as a great personage came up and then one of the officers said come my good woman you mustnt sit there you know thats the judges private door i beg pardon she said and i will move if you wish me but they are trying my husband for coining and the court is too hot for the child if you will let me sit there i will be sure to get out of the way when my lord comes past the man looked at her as if it was a case somewhat out of his experience and went away soon however he came back again and after staring at her a short time said do you want anything missis anything i can get i am much obliged to you nothing she said but if you can tell me how the trial is going on i shall be obliged to you he shook his head and went away and when he returned telling her that the judge was summing up he bade her follow him and found her a place in a quiet part of the court she could see her husband and maitland standing in the dock quite close to her and before them the judge was calmly slowly and distinctly giving the jury the history of the case from beginning to end she was too much bewildered and desperate to listen to it but she was attracted by the buzz of conversation which arose when the jury retired they seemed gone a bare minute to her when she heard and understood that the prisoners were found guilty then she heard maitland sentenced to death and george hawker condemned to be transported beyond the seas for the term of his natural life in consideration of his youth so she brought herself to understand that the game was played out and turned to go the officer who had been kind to her stopped her and asked her where she was going she answered to devonshire and passed on but almost immediately pushed back to him through the crowd which was pouring out of the doors and thanked him for his kindness to her then she went out with the crowd into the street and almost instinctively struck westward through the western streets roaring with carriages crowded with foot passengerslike one in a dreampast the theatres and the arches and all the great rich world busy seeking its afternoon pleasure through the long suburbs getting more scattered as she went on and so out on to the dusty broad western highway a lonely wanderer with only one thought in her throbbing head to reach such home as was left her before she died at the first quiet spot she came to she sat down and forced herself to think two hundred miles to go and fifteen shillings to keep her never mind she could beg she had heard that some made a trade of begging and did well hard if she should die on the road so she pushed on through the evening toward the sinking sun till the milestones passed slower and slower and then she found shelter in a tramps lodginghouse and got what rest she could in a week she was at taunton then the weather which had hitherto been fair and pleasant broke up and still she held on with the rain beating from the westward in her face as though to stay her from her refuge dizzy and confused but determined still along the miry highroad she had learnt from a gipsy woman with whom she had walked in company for some hours how to carry her child across her back slung in her shawl so with her breast bare to the storm she fought her way over the high bleak downs glad and happy when the boy ceased his wailing and lay warm and sheltered behind her swathed in every poor rag she could spare from her numbed and dripping body late on a wild rainy night she reached exeter utterly penniless and wet to the skin she had had nothing to eat since noon and her breast was failing from want of nourishment and overexertion still it was only twenty miles further surely she thought god had not saved her through two hundred such miles to perish at last the child was dry and warm and fast asleep if she could get some rest in one of the doorways in the lower part of the town till she was stronger she could fight her way on to drumston so she held on to st thomass and finding an archway drier than the others sat down and took the child upon her lap restrest was a fiction she was better walkingsuch aches and cramps and pains in every joint she would get up and push on and yet minute after minute went by and she could not summon courage she was sitting with her beautiful face in the light of a lamp a woman well and handsomely dressed was passing rapidly through the rain but on seeing her stopped and said my poor girl why do you sit there in the damp entry such a night as this i am cold hungry ruined thats why i sit under the arch replied mary rising up come home with me said the woman i will take care of you i am going to my friends replied she are you sure they will be glad to see you my dear said the woman with that pretty little pledge at your bosom i care not said mary i told you i was desperate desperate my pretty love said the woman a girl with beauty like yours should never be desperate come with me mary stepped forward and struck her so full and true that the woman reeled backwards and stood whimpering and astonished out you false jade said mary you are one of those devils that saxon told me of who come whispering and peering and crowding behind those who are penniless and deserted but i have faced you and struck you and i tell you to go back to your master and say that i am not for him the woman went crying and frightened down the street thinking that she had been plying her infamous trade on a lunatic but mary sat down again and nursed the child but the wind changed a little and the rain began to beat in on her shelter she arose and went down the street to seek a new one she found a deep arch well sheltered and what was better a lamp inside so that she could sit on the stone step and see her babys face dainty quarters truly she went to take possession and started back with a scream what delusion was this there under the lamp on the step sat a woman her own image nursing a baby so like her own that she looked down at her bosom to see if it was safe it must be a fancy of her own disordered brain but nofor when she gathered up her courage and walked towards it a woman she knew well started up and laughing wildly cried out ha ha mary thornton ellen lee said mary aghast thats me dear replied the other youre welcome my love welcome to the cold stones and wet streets and to hunger and drunkenness and evil words and the abomination of desolation thats what we all come to my dear is that his child whose said mary this is george hawkers child hush my dear said the other we never mention his name in our society you know this is his tooa far finer one than yours cis jewell had one of his too a poor little rat of a thing that died and now the minx is flaunting about the highstreet every night in her silks and her feathers as bold as brass i hope youll have nothing to say to her you and i will keep house together they are looking after me to put me in the madhouse youll come too of course god have mercy on you poor nelly said mary exactly so my dear the poor lunatic replied of course he will but about him you know you heard the terms of his bargain what do you mean asked mary why about him you know g h madge the witchs son he sold himself to the deuce my dear on condition of ruining a poor girl every year and he has kept his contract hitherto if he dont you knowcome here i want to whisper to you the poor girl whispered rapidly in her ear but mary broke away from her and fled rapidly down the street poor ellen shouting after her ha ha the parsons daughter tooha ha let me get out of this town o lord she prayed most earnestly if i die in the fields and so she sped on and paused not till she was full two miles out of the town towards home leaning on the parapet of the noble bridge that even then crossed the river exe the night had cleared up and a soft and gentle westerly breeze was ruffling the broad waters of the river where they slept deep dark and full above the weir just below where they broke over the low rocky barrier the rising moon showed a hundred silver spangles among the broken eddies the cool breeze and the calm scene quieted and soothed her and for the first time for many days she began to think she was going back but to what to a desolated home to a heartbroken father to the jeers and taunts of her neighbours the wife of a convicted felon what hope was left for her in this world none and that child that was sleeping so quietly on her bosom what a mark was set on him from this time forwardthe son of hawker the coiner would it not be better if they both were lying below there in the cold still water at rest but she laughed aloud this is the last of the devils he talked of said she i have fought the others and beat them i wont yield to this one she paused abashed for a man on horseback was standing before her as she turned had she not been so deeply engaged in her own thoughts she might have heard him merrily whistling as he approached from the town but she heard him not and was first aware of his presence when he stood silently regarding her not two yards off my girl he said i fear youre in a bad way i dont like to see a young woman pretty as i can see you are even now standing on a bridge with a baby talking to herself you mistake me she said i was not going to do that i was resting and thinking where are you going he asked to crediton she replied once there i should almost fancy myself safe see here he said my waggon is coming up behind i can give you a lift as far as there are you hungry ah she said if you knew if you only knew they waited for the waggons coming up for they could hear the horses bells chiming cheerily across the valley i had an only daughter went away once he said but glory to god i got her back again though she brought a child with her and ive grown to be fonder of that poor little baseborn one than anything in this world so cheer up i am married she said this is my lawful boy though it were better perhaps he had never been born dont say that my girl said the old farmer for such she took him to be but thank god you havent been deceived like so many are the waggon came up and was stopped he made her take such refreshment as was to be got and then get in and lie quiet among the straw till in the grey morning they reached crediton the weather had grown bad again and long before sunrise after thanking and blessing her benefactor poor mary struck off once more with what strength she had left along the deep red lanes through the driving rain chapter xvii exodus but let us turn and see what has been going forward in the old parsonage this long weary year not much that is noteworthy i fear the chronicle of a years sickness and unhappiness would be rather uninteresting so i must get on as quick as i can the vicar only slowly revived from the fit in which he fell on the morning of marys departure to find himself hopelessly paralytic unable to walk without support and barely able to articulate distinctly it was when he was in this state being led up and down the garden by the doctor and frank maberly the former of whom was trying to attract his attention to some of their old favourites the flowers that miss thornton came to him with the letter which mary had written from brighton immediately after their marriage it was on the whole a great relief for the vicar he had dreaded to hear worse than this they had kept from him all knowledge of hawkers forgery on his father which had been communicated to them by major buckley so that he began to prepare his mind for the reception of george hawker as a soninlaw and to force himself to like him so with shaking palsied hand he wrote dear girlin sickness or sorrow remember that i am still your father i hope you will not stop long in london but come back and stay near me we must forget all that has passed and make the best of it john thornton miss thornton wrote my dearest foolish maryhow could you leave us like that my love oh if you had only let us know what was going on i could have told you such things my dear but now you will never know them i hope i hope mr hawker will use you kindly your father hopes that you and he may come down and live near him but we know that is impossible if your father were to know of your husbands fearful delinquencies it would kill him at once but when trouble comes on you my love as it must in the end remember that there is still a happy home left you here these letters she never received george burnt them without giving them to her so that for a year she remained under the impression that they had cast her off so only at the last did she as the sole hope of warding off poverty and misery from her child determine to cast herself upon their mercy the year had nearly passed when the vicar had another stroke a stroke that rendered him childish and helpless and precluded all possibility of his leaving his bed again miss thornton found that it was necessary to have a man servant in the house now to move him and so on so one evening when major and mrs buckley and the doctor had come down to sit with her she asked did they know a man who could undertake the business i do said the doctor i know a man who would suit you exactly a strong knave enough an old soldier i dont think we should like a soldier in the house doctor said miss thornton they use such very odd language sometimes you know this man never swears said the doctor but soldiers are apt to drink sometimes you know doctor said miss thornton and that wouldnt do in this case ive known the man all my life said the doctor with animation and i never saw him drunk he seems faultless doctor said the major smiling no he is not faultless but he has his qualifications for the office nevertheless he can read passably and might amuse our poor old friend in that way he is not evil tempered though hasty and i think he would be tender and kindly to the old man he had a father once himself this man and he nursed him to his latest day as well as he was able after his mother had left them and gone on the road to destruction and my man has picked up some knowledge of medicine too and might be a useful ally to the physician a paragon said mrs buckley laughing now let us hear his faults dear doctor they are many he replied i dont deny but not such as to make him an ineligible person in this matter to begin with he is a foola dreaming fool who once mixed himself up with politics and went on the assumption that truth would prevail against humbug and when he found his mistake this fellow instead of staying at his post as a man should he got disgusted and beat a cowardly retreat leaving his duty unfulfilled when i look at one side of this mans life i wonder why such useless fellows as he were born into the world but i opine that every man is of some use and that my friend may still have manhood enough left in him to move an old paralytic man in his bed and his name doctor you must tell us that said mrs buckley looking sadly at him i am that man said the doctor rising dear miss thornton you will allow me to come down and stay with you i shall be so glad to be of any use to my old friend and i am so utterly useless now what could she say but yes with a thousand thanks far more than she could express so he took up his quarters at the vicarage and helped her in the labour of love the sunday morning after he came to stay there he was going down stairs shortly after daybreak to take a walk in the fresh morning air when on the staircase he met miss thornton and she putting sixpence into his hand said my dear doctor i looked out of window just now and saw a tramper woman sitting on the doorstep she has black hair and a baby like a gipsy and i am so nervous about gipsies you know would you give her that and tell her to go away the doctor stepped down with the sixpence in his hand to do as he was bid miss thornton followed him he opened the front door and there sure enough sat a woman her hair wet with the last nights rain knotted loosely up behind her hatless head she sat upon the doorstep rocking herself to and fro partly it would seem from disquietude and partly to soothe the baby which was lying on her lap crying her back was towards him and the doctor only had time to notice that she was young when he began my good soul you musnt sit there you know its sunday morning and no more he had time to say no more mary rose from the step and looked at him you are right sir i have no business here but if you will tell him that i only came back for the childs sake he will hear me i couldnt leave it in the workhouse you know miss thornton ran forward laughing wildly and hugged her to her honest heart my darling she said my own darling i knew she would find her home at last in trouble and in sorrow i told her where she was to come oh happy trouble that has brought our darling back to us aunt aunt said mary dont kill me scold me a little aunt dear only a little scold you my darling never never scold you on this happy sabbath morn oh never my love and the foolishness of these two women was so great that the doctor had to go for a walk right down the garden round the cowyard and in by the back way to the kitchen where he met frank and told him what had happened and there they were at it again miss thornton kneeling wiping poor marys blistered feet before the fire while the maid foolishly giggling had got possession of the baby and was talking more affectionate nonsense to it than ever baby heard in this world before mary held out her hand to him and when he gave her his vast brown paw what does she do but put it to her lips and kiss itas if there was not enough without that and to make matters worse she quoted scripture and said forasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these ye have done it unto me so our good doctor had nothing left but to break through that cloak of cynicism which he delighted to wear lord knows why and to kiss her on the cheek and to tell her how happy she had made them by coming back let circumstances be what they might then she told them with bursts of wild weeping what those circumstances were and at last when they were all quieted miss thornton boldly volunteered to go up and tell the vicar that his darling was returned so she went up and mary and the doctor waited at the bedroom door and listened the poor old man was far gone beyond feeling joy or grief to any great extent when miss thornton raised him in his bed and told him that he must brace up his nerves to hear some good news he smiled a weary smile and mary looking in saw that he was so altered that she hardly knew him i know he said lisping and hesitating painfully what you are going to tell me sister she is come home i knew she would come at last please tell her to come to me at once but i cant see him yet i must get stronger first so mary went in to him and miss thornton came out and closed the door and when mary came downstairs soon afterwards she could not talk to them but remained a long time silent crying bitterly the good news soon got up to major buckleys and so after church they saw him striding up the path leading the pony carrying his wife and baby and while they were still busy welcoming her back came a ring at the door and a loud voice asking if the owner of it might come in who but tom troubridge who else was there to raise her four good feet off the ground and kiss her on both cheeks and call her his darling little sister who else was there who could have changed their tears into laughter so quick that their merriment was wafted up to the vicars room and made him ring his bell and tell them to send tom up to him and who but tom could have lit the old mans face up with a smile with the history of a new colt that my lords mare thetis had dropped last week that was her welcome home to the home she had dreaded coming to expecting to be received with scorn and reproaches to the home she had meant to come to only as a penitent to leave her child there and go forth into the world to die and here she found herself the honoured guesttreated as one who had been away on a journey whom they had been waiting and praying for all the time and who came back to them sooner than expected none hold the force of domestic affection so cheap as those who violate it most rudely how many proud unhappy souls are there at this moment voluntarily absenting themselves from all that love them in the world because they dread sneers and cold looks at home and how many of these going back would find only tears of joy to welcome them and hear that ever since their absence they had been spoken of with kindness and tenderness and loved perhaps above all the others after dinner when the women were alone together mrs buckley began now my dear mary you must hear all the news my husband has had a letter from stockbridge ah dear old jim said mary and how is he he and hamlyn are quite well said mrs buckley and settled he has written such an account of that country to major buckley that he half persuaded before is now wholly determined to go there himself i heard of this before said mary am i to lose you then at once we shall see said mrs buckley i have my ideas now who do you think is going beside half devonshire i should think said mary at least all whom i care about it would seem so indeed my poor girl said mrs buckley for your cousin troubridge has made up his mind to come there was a time when i could have stopped him she thought but that is gone by now and she answered mrs buckley aunt and i will stay here and think of you all shall we ever hear from you it is the other side of the world is it not it is a long way but we must wait and see how things turn out we may not have to separate after all see my dear are you fully aware of your fathers state i fear you have only come home to see the last of him he probably will be gone before this month is out you see the state he is in and when he is gone have you reflected what to do mary weeping bitterly said no only that she could never live in drumston or anywhere where she was known that is wise my love said mrs buckley under the circumstances have you made up your mind where to go miss thornton when you have to leave the vicarage for a new incumbent i have made up my mind answered miss thornton to go wherever mary goes if it be to the other end of the earth we will be ruth and naomi my dear you would never get on without me that is what i say said mrs buckley never leave her why not come away out of all unhappy associations and from the scorn and pity of your neighbours to live safe and happy with all the best friends you have in the world what do you mean said mary ah if we could only do so come away with us said mrs buckley with animation come away with us and begin a new life there is troubridge looking high and low for a partner with five thousand pounds why should not miss thornton and yourself be his partners ah me said miss thornton and think of the voyage but i shall not decide on anything mary shall decide scarcely more than a week elapsed from the day that mary came home when there came a third messenger for old john thornton and one so peremptory that he arose and followed it in the dead of night so when they came to his bedside in the morning they found his body there laid as it was when he wished them good night but cold and dead he himself was gone and nothing remained but to bury his body decently beside his wifes in the old churchyard and to shed some tears at the thought that never by the fireside or in the solemn old church they should hear that kindly voice again and then came the disturbance of household gods and the rupture of lifeold associations and although they were begged by the new comer not to hurry or incommode themselves yet they too wished to be gone from the house whence everything they loved had departed their kind true friend frank was presented with the living and they accepted mrs buckleys invitation to stay at their house till they should have decided what to do it was two months yet before the major intended to sail and long before those two months were past mary and miss thornton had determined that they would not rend asunder the last ties they had this side of the grave but would cast in their lot with the others and cross the weary sea with them towards a more hopeful land one more scene and we have done with the old world for many a year some of these our friends will never see it more and those who do will come back with new thoughts and associations as strangers to a strange land only those who have done so know how much effort it takes to say i will go away to a land where none know me or care for me and leave for ever all that i know and love and few know the feeling which comes upon all men after it is donethe feeling of isolation almost of terror at having gone so far out of the bounds of ordinary life the feeling of selfdistrust and cowardice at being alone and friendless in the world like a child in the dark a golden summers evening is fading into a soft cloudless summers night and doctor mulhaus stands upon mount edgecombe looking across the trees across the glassy harbour over the tall menofwar out beyond the silver line of surf on the breakwater to where a tall ship is rapidly spreading her white wings and speeding away each moment more rapidly for a fair wind towards the southwest he watches it growing more dim minute by minute in distance and in darkness till he can see no longer then brushing a tear from his eye he says aloud there goes my english microcosm all my new english friends with whom i was going to pass the rest of my life peaceful and contented as a village surgeon pretty dream two years long truly man hath no sure abiding place here i will go back to p and see if they are all dead or only sleeping so he turned down the steep path under the darkening trees towards where he could see the town lights along the quays among the crowded masts chapter xviii the first puff of the south wind a new heaven and a new earth tier beyond tier height above height the great wooded ranges go rolling away westward till on the lofty skyline they are crowned with a gleam of everlasting snow to the eastward they sink down breaking into isolated forests fringed peaks and rockcrowned eminences till with rapidly straightening lines they disappear gradually into broad grey plains beyond which the southern ocean is visible by the white reflection cast upon the sky all creation is new and strange the trees surpassing in size the largest english oaks are of a species we have never seen before the graceful shrubs the brightcoloured flowers ay the very grass itself are of species unknown in europe while flaming lories and brilliant parroquets fly whistling not unmusically through the gloomy forest and over head in the higher fields of air still lit up by the last rays of the sun countless cockatoos wheel and scream in noisy joy as we may see the gulls do about an english headland to the northward a great glen sinking suddenly from the saddle on which we stand stretches away in long vista until it joins a broader valley through which we can dimly see a fullfed river winding along in gleaming reaches through level meadow land interspersed with clumps of timber we are in australia three hundred and fifty miles south of sydney on the great watershed which divides the belloury from the maryburnong since better known as the snowyriver of gippsland as the sun was going down on the scene i have been describing james stockbridge and i geoffry hamlyn reined up our horses on the ridge abovementioned and gazed down the long gully which lay stretched at our feet only the tallest trees stood with their higher boughs glowing with the gold of the departing day and we stood undetermined which route to pursue and half inclined to camp at the next waterhole we should see we had lost some cattle and among others a valuable imported bull which we were very anxious to recover for five days we had been passing on from run to run making inquiries without success and were now fifty long miles from home in a southerly direction we were beyond the bounds of all settlement the last station we had been at was twenty miles to the north of us and the occupiers of it as they had told us the night before had only taken up their country about ten weeks and were as yet the furthest pioneers to the southward at this time stockbridge and i had been settled in our new home about two years and were beginning to get comfortable and contented we had had but little trouble with the blacks and having taken possession of a fine piece of country were flourishing and well to do we had never heard from home but once and that was from tom troubridge soon after our departure telling us that if we succeeded he should follow for that the old place seemed changed now we were gone we had neither of us left any near relations behind us and already we began to think that we were cut off for ever from old acquaintances and associations and were beginning to be resigned to it let us return to where he and i were standing alone in the forest i dismounted to set right some strap or another and instead of getting on my horse again at once stood leaning against him looking at the prospect glad to ease my legs for a time for they were cramped with many hours riding stockbridge sat in his saddle immoveable and silent as a statue and when i looked in his face i saw that his heart had travelled further than his eye could reach and that he was looking far beyond the horizon that bounded his earthly vision away to the pleasant old home which was home to us no longer jim said i i wonder what is going on at drumston now i wonder he said softly a pause below us in the valley a mob of jackasses were shouting and laughing uproariously and a magpie was chanting his noble vesper hymn from a lofty tree jim i began again do you ever think of poor little mary now yes old boy i do he replied i cant help it i was thinking of her theni am always thinking of her and whats more i always shall be dont think me a fool old friend but i love that girl as well now as ever i did i wonder if she has married that fellow hawker i fear there is but little doubt of it i said try to forget her james get in a rage with her and be proud about it youll make all your life unhappy if you dont he laughed thats all very well jeff but its easier said than donedo you hear that there are cattle down the gully there was some noise in the air beside the evening rustle of the south wind among the treetops now it sounded like a faroff hubbub of waters now swelled up harmonious like the booming of cathedral bells across some rich old english valley on a still summers afternoon there are cattle down there certainly i said and a very large number of them they are not ours depend upon it there are men with them too or they would not make so much noise can it be the blacks driving them off from the strangers we stayed with last night do you think if so we had best look out for ourselves blacks could hardly manage such a large mob as there are there said james ill tell you what i think it is old jeff its some new chums going to cross the watershed and look for new country to the south if so let us go down and meet them they will camp down by the river yonder james was right all doubt about what the new comers were was solved before we reached the river for we could hear the rapid detonation of the stockwhips loud above the lowing of the cattle so we sat and watched them debouche from the forest into the broad river meadows in the gathering gloom saw the scene so venerable and ancient so seldom seen in the old worldthe patriarchs moving into the desert with all their wealth to find new pastureground a simple primitive action the first and simplest act of colonization yet producing such great results on the history of the world as did the parting of lot and abraham in times gone by first came the cattle lowing loudly some trying to stop and graze on the rich pasture after their long days travel some heading noisily towards the river now beginning to steam with the rising evening mist now a lordly bull followed closely by two favourite heifers would try to take matters into his own hands and cut out a route for himself but is soon driven ignominiously back in a lumbering gallop by a quickeyed stockman now a silly calf takes it into his head to go for a small excursion up the range followed of course by his doting mother and has to be headed in again not without muttered wrath and lowerings of the head from madame behind the cattle came horsemen some six or seven in number and last four drays bearing the household gods came crawling up the pass we had time to notice that there were women on the foremost dray when it became evident that the party intended camping in a turn of the river just below one man kicked his feet out of the stirrups and sitting loosely in his saddle prepared to watch the cattle for the first few hours till he was relieved another lit a fire against a fallen tree and while the bullockdrivers were busy unyoking their beasts and the women were clambering from the dray two of the horsemen separated from the others and came forward to meet us both of them i saw were men of vast stature one rode upright with a military seat while his companion had his feet out of his stirrups and rode loosely as if tired with his journey further than this i could distinguish nothing in the darkening twilight but looking at james i saw that he was eagerly scanning the strangers with elevated eyebrow and opened lips ere i could speak to him he had dashed forward with a shout and when i came up with him wondering i found myself shaking hands talking and laughing everything in fact short of crying with major buckley and thomas troubridge range up alongside here jeff you rascal said tom and let me get a fair hug at you what do you think of this for a lark ehto meet you out here all promiscuous in the forest like prince arthur we could not go out of our way to see you though we knew where you were located for we must hurry on and get a piece of country we have been told of on the next river we are going to settle down close by you you see well make a new drumston in the wilderness this is a happy meeting indeed old tom i said as we rode towards the drays after the major and james we shall have happy times now we have got some of our old friends round us who is come with you how is mrs buckley mrs buckley is as well as ever and as handsome my pretty little cousin mary hawker and old miss thornton are with us the poor old vicar is dead mary hawker with you i said and her husband tom hardly old friend we travel in better company said he george hawker is transported for life alas poor mary i answered and what for coining he answered ill tell you the story another time tonight let us rejoice i could not but watch james who was riding before us to see how he would take this news the major i saw was telling him all about it but james seemed to take it quite quietly only nodding his head as the other went on i knew how he would feel for his old love and i turned and said to troubridge jim will be very sorry to hear of this i wish she had married him thats what we all say said tom i am sorry for poor jim he is about the best man i know take him all in all if that fellow were to die she might have him yet hamlyn we reached the drays there sat mrs buckley on a log a noble happy matron laughing at her son as he toddled about busy gathering sticks for the fire beside her was mary paler and olderlooking than when we had seen her last with her child upon her lap looking sad and worn but a sadder sight for me was old miss thornton silent and frightened glancing uneasily round as though expecting some new horror no child for her to cling to and strive for no husband to watch for and anticipate every wish a poor timid nervous old maid thrown adrift in her old age upon a strange sea of anomalous wonders every old favourite prejudice torn up by the roots all old formulas of life scattered to the winds she told me in confidence that evening that she had been in sad trouble all day at dinnertime some naked blacks had come up to the dray and had frightened and shocked her then the dray had been nearly upset and her hat crushed among the trees a favourite and precious bag which never left her had been dropped in the water and her prayerbook a parting gift from lady kate had been utterly spoiled a hundred petty annoyances and griefs which mary barely remarked and which brave mrs buckley in her strong determination of following her lord to the ends of the earth and of being as much help and as little incumbrance to him as she could had laughed at were to her great misfortunes why the very fact as she told me of sitting on the top of a swinging jolting dray was enough to keep her in a continual state of agony and terror so that when she alit at night and sat down she could not help weeping silently dreading lest any one should see her suddenly mary was by her side kneeling down aunt she said dearest aunt dont break down it is all my wicked fault you will break my heart auntie dear if you cry like that why did ever i bring you on this hideous journey how could i leave you in your trouble my love said miss thornton you did right to come my love we are among old friends we have come too far for trouble to reach us we shall soon have a happy home again now and all will be well so she who needed so much comforting herself courageously dried her tears and comforted mary and when we reached the drays she was sitting with her hands folded before her in serene misery mary said the major here are two old friends he had no time to say more for she recognising jim sprang up and running to him burst into hysterical weeping oh my good old friend she cried oh my dear old friend oh to meet you here in this lonely wilderness oh james my kind old brother i saw how his big heart yearned to comfort his old sweetheart in her distress not a selfish thought found place with him he could only see his old love injured and abandoned and nought more mary he said what happiness to see you among all your old friends come to live among us again it is almost too good to believe in believe me you will get to like this country as well as old devon soon though it looks so strange just now and what a noble boy too we will make him the best bushman in the country when he is old enough so he took the child of his rival to his bosom and when the innocent little face looked into his he would see no likeness to george hawker there he only saw the mothers countenance as he knew her as a child years gone by is nobody going to notice me or my boy i wonder said mrs buckley come here immediately mr stockbridge before we quarrel in a very short time all our party were restored to their equanimity and were laying down plans for pleasant meetings hereafter and long after the women had gone to bed in the drays and the moon was riding high in the heavens james and myself troubridge and the major sat before the fire and we heard for the first time of all that had gone on since we left england and of all poor marys troubles then each man rolled himself in his blanket and slept soundly under the rustling forestboughs in the bright cool morning ere the sun was up and the belated opossum had run back to his home in the hollow log james and i were afoot looking after our horses we walked silently side by side for a few minutes until he turned and said jeff old fellow of course you will go on with them and stay until they are settled jim old fellow i replied of course you will go on with them and stay till they are settled he pondered a few moments and then said well why not i suppose she can be to me still what she always was yes i will go with them when we returned to the dray we found them all astir preparing for a start mrs buckley with her gown tucked up was preparing breakfast as if she had been used to the thing all her life she had an imperial sort of way of manoeuvring a fryingpan which did one good to see it is my belief that if that woman had been called upon to groom a horse shed have done it in a ladylike way while james went among the party to announce his intention of going on with them i had an opportunity of looking at the son and heir of all the buckleys he was a sturdy handsome child about five years old and was now standing apart from the others watching a bullockdriver yokingup his beast i am very fond of children and take great interest in studying their characters so i stood not unamused behind this youngster as he stood looking with awe and astonishment at the man as he managed the great formidable beasts and brought each one into his place not however without more oaths than one would care to repeat suddenly the child turning and seeing me behind him came back and took my hand why is he so angry with them the child asked at once why does he talk to them like that he is swearing at them i said to make them stand in their places but they dont understand him said the boy that black and white one would have gone where he wanted it in a minute but it couldnt understand you know so he hit it over the nose why dont he find out how they talk to one another then hed manage them much better he is very cruel he does not know any better i said come with me and get some flowers will you take me up he said i musnt run about for fear of snakes i took him up and we went to gather flowers your name is samuel buckley i think said i how did you know that i remember you when you were a baby i said i hope you may grow to be as good a man as your father my lad see there is mamma calling for us and how far south are you going major i asked at breakfast no further than we can help said the major i stayed a night with my old friend captain brentwood by the way and there i found a man who knew of some unoccupied country down here which he had seen in some bush expedition we found the ground he mentioned taken up but he says there is equally good on the next river i have bought him and his information we saw good country away to the south yesterday i said but are you wise to trust this man do you know anything about him brentwood has known him these ten years and trusts him entirely though i believe he has been a convict if you are determined to come with us stockbridge i will call him up and examine him about the route william lee just step here a moment a swarthy and very powerfully built man came up no other than the man i have spoken of under that name before he was quite unknown either to james or myself although as he told us afterwards he had recognised us at once but kept out of our sight as much as possible till by the majors summons he was forced to come forward what route today william asked the major south and by east across the range we ought to get down to the river by night if were lucky so while the drays were getting under way the major tom james and myself rode up to the saddle where we had stood the night before and gazed southeast across the broad prospect in the direction that the wanderers were to go that said the major to the right there must be the great glen out of which the river comes and there please god we will rest our weary bodies and build our house odd isnt it that i should have been saved from shot and shell when so many better men were put away in the trench to come and end my days in a place like this well i think we shall have a pleasant life of it watching the cattle spread further across the plains year after year and seeing the boy grow up to be a good man at all events for weal or woe i have said good bye to old england for ever and a day the cattle were past and the drays had arrived at where we stood with many a hearty farewell having given a promise to come over and spend christmasday with them i turned my horses head homewards and went on my solitary way chapter xix i hire a new horsebreaker i must leave them to go their way towards their new home and follow my own fortunes a little for that afternoon i met with an adventure quite trifling indeed but which is not altogether without interest in this story i rode on till high noon till having crossed the valley of the belloury and followed up one of its tributary creeks i had come on to the water system of another main river and the rapid widening of the gully whose course i was pursuing assured me that i could not be far from the main stream itself at length i entered a broad flat intersected by a deep and tortuous creek and here i determined to camp till the noonday heat was past before i continued my journey calculating that i could easily reach home the next day having watered my horse i turned him loose for a graze and making such a dinner as was possible under the circumstances i lit a pipe and lay down on the long grass under the flowering wattletrees smoking and watching the manoeuvres of a little tortoise who was disporting himself in the waterhole before me getting tired of that i lay back on the grass and watched the green leaves waving and shivering against the clear blue sky given up entirely to the greatest of human enjoymentsthe after dinner pipe the pipe of peace which is the pleasantest pipe in the day we used to say at home that a man should smoke but four pipes aday the matutinal another i dont specify the postprandial and the symposial or convivial which last may be infinitely subdivided according to the quantity of drink taken but in australia this division wont obtain particularly when you are on the tramp just when you wake from a dreamless sleep beneath the forest boughs as the east begins to blaze and the magpie gets musical you dash to the embers of last nights fire and after blowing many firesticks find one which is alight and proceed to send abroad on the morning breeze the scent of last nights dottle then when breakfast is over and the horses are caught up and saddled and you are jogging across the plain with the friend of your heart beside you the burnt incense once more goes up and conversation is unnecessary at ten oclock when you cross the creek you always cross a creek about ten if you are in a good country you halt and smoke so after dinner in the lazy noontide one or perhaps two pipes are necessary with perhaps another about four in the afternoon and last and perhaps best of all are the three or four you smoke before the fire at night when the day is dying and the opossums are beginning to chatter in the twilight so that you find that a fig of barrets twist seventeen to the pound is gone in the mere hours of daylight without counting such a casualty as waking up cold in the night and going at it again so i lay on my back dreaming wondering why a locust who was in full screech close by took the trouble to make that terrible row when it was so hot and hoping that his sides might be sore with the exertion when to my great astonishment i heard the sound of feet brushing through the grass towards me black fellow i said to myself but no those were shodden feet that swept along so wearily i raised myself on my elbow with my hand on my pistol and reconnoitred there approached me from down the creek a man hardly reaching the middle size lean and activelooking narrow in the flanks thin in the jaws his knees well apart with a keen bright eye in his head his clothes looked as if they had belonged to ten different men and his gait was heavy and his face red as if from a long hurried walk but i said at once here comes a riding man at all events be it for peace or war good day lad said i good day sir youre rather off the tracks for a footman said i are you looking for your horse deuce a horse have i got to my name sirhave you got a feed of anything im nigh starved ay surely the teas cold put it on the embers and warm it a bit heres beef and damper too plenty i lit another pipe and watched his meal i like feeding a real hungry man its almost as good as eating oneselfsometimes better when the edge of his appetite was taken off he began to talk he said first got a station anywheres about here sir no im hamlyn of the durnongs away by maneroo oh ay i know you sir which way have you come this morning southward i crossed the belloury about seven oclock that indeed you havent seen anything of three bullock drays and a mob of cattle going south yes i camped with such a lot last night not major buckleys lot the same and how far were they on they crossed the range at daylight this morningtheyre thirty miles away by now he threw his hat on the ground with an oath i shall never catch them up i darent cross that range on foot into the new country and those black devils lurking round he shouldnt have left me like thatall my own fault though for staying behind no no hes true enoughall my own fault but i wouldnt have left him so neither but perhaps he dont think im so far behind i saw that the man was in earnest for his eyes were swimminghe was too dry for tears but though he looked a desperate scamp i couldnt help pitying him and saying you seem vexed you couldnt catch them up were you going along with the major then no sir i wasnt hired with him but an old mate of mine bill lee is gone along with him to show him some country and i was going to stick to him and see if the major would take me we havent been parted for many years not bill and i havent and the worst of it is that hell think ive slipped away from him instead of following him fifty mile on foot to catch him well it cant be helped now i must look round and get a job somewhere till i get a chance to join him were you travelling with them sir no im after some cattle ive lost a fine imported bull tooworse luck well never see him again im afraid and if i do find them how i am to get them home single handed i dont know do you mean a shorthorned durham bull with a key brand why if thats him i can lay you on to him at once hes up at jamiesons here to the west i was staying at watsons last night and one of jamiesons men staid in the huta young hand and talking about beasts he said that there was a fine shorthorned bull come on to their run with a mob of heifers and cows and they couldnt make out who they belonged to they were all different brands thats our lot for a thousand says i a lot of store cattle we bought this year from the hunter and havent branded yetmore shame to us if you could get a horse and saddle from jamiesons sir said he i could give you a hand home with them id like to get a job somehow and im well used to cattle done with you said i jamiesons isnt ten miles from here and we can do that tonight if we look sharp come along my lad so i caught up the horse and away we went starting at right angles with the sun which was nearly overhead and keeping to the left of him holding such a course as he got lower that an hour and half or thereabouts before setting he should be in my face and at sundown a little to the leftthe best direction i can give you for going about due west in november without a compasswhich by the way you always ought to have my companion was footsore so i went slowly he however shambled along bravely when his feet got warm he was a talkative lively man and chattered continually youve got a nice place up at the durnongs sir said he i stayed in your huts one night its the comfortablest bachelor station on this side youve got a smart few sheep i expect twentyfive thousand do you know these parts well i knew that country of yours long before any of it was took up youve been a long while in the country then i was sent out when i was eighteen spared as the old judge said on account of my youth thats eleven years ago spared eh it was something serious then trifling enough only for having a rope in my hand they wouldnt lag a man for that said i ay but he replied there was a horse at the end of the rope i was brought up in a training stable and somehow theres something in the smell of a stable is sure to send a man wrong if he dont take care i got betting and drinking too as young chaps will and lost my place and got from bad to worse till i shook a nag and got bowled out and lagged thats about my history sir will you give me a job now and he looked up laughing ay why not said i because you tried hard to go to the devil when you were young and foolish it dont follow that you should pursue that line of conduct all your life youve been in a training stable eh if you can break horses i may find you something to do ill break horses against any man in this countrythough thats not saying much for i aint seen not what i call a breaker since ive been here as for riding id ridden seven great winners before i was eighteen and thats what neer a man alive can say ah those were the rosy times ah for old newmarket are you a cambridgeshire man then me oh no im a devonshire man i come near from where major buckley lived some years did you notice a pale prettylooking woman was with himmrs hawker i grew all attention yes i said i noticed her i knew her husband well he said and an awful rascal he was he was lagged for coining though he might have been for halfadozen things besides indeed said i and is he in the colony no hes over the water i expect in van diemens land you mean just so he said he had better not show bill lee much of his face or therell be mischief lee owes him a grudge then not exactly that said my communicative friend but i dont think that hawker will show much where lee is i am very glad to hear it i thought to myself i hope mary may not have some trouble with her husband still what is the name of the place major buckley comes from i inquired drumston and you belong there too i knew very well however that he did not or i must have known him no he answered okehampton is my native place but you talk a little devon yourself sir the conversation came to a close for we heard the barking of dogs and saw the station where we were to spend the night in the morning i went home and my new acquaintance who called himself dick along with me finding that he was a firstrate rider and gentle and handy among horses i took him into my service permanently and soon got to like him very well chapter xx a warm christmas day all through november and part of december i and our scotch overseer georgy kyle were busy as bees among the sheep shearers were very scarce and the poor sheep got fearfully tomahawked by the new hands who had been a very short time from the barracks dick however my new acquaintance turned out a valuable ally getting through more sheep and taking off his fleece better than any man in the shed the prisoners of course would not work effectually without extra wages and thus gave a deal of trouble knowing that there was no fear of my sending them to the magistrate fifty miles off during such a busy time however all evils must come to an end some time or another and so did shearing though it was nearly christmas before our wool was pressed and ready for the drays then came a breathing time so i determined having heard nothing of james to go over and spend my christmas with the buckleys and see how they were getting on at their new station and about noon on the day before boxingday having followed the track made by their drays from the place i had last parted with them i reined up on the cliffs above a noble river and could see their new huts scarce a quarter of a mile off on the other side of the stream they say that christmasday is the hottest day in the year in those countries but some days in january are i think generally hotter today however was as hot as a salamander could wish all the vast extent of yellow plain to the eastward quivered beneath a fiery sky and every little eminence stood like an island in a lake of mirage used as i had got to this phenomenon i was often tempted that morning to turn a few hundred yards from my route and give my horse a drink at one of the broad glassy pools that seemed to lie right and left once the faint track i was following headed straight towards one of these apparent sheets of water and i was even meditating a bathe but lo when i was a hundred yards or so off it began to dwindle and disappear and i found nothing but the same endless stretch of grass burnt up by the midsummer sun for many miles i had distinguished the new huts placed at the apex of a great cape of the continent of timber which ran down from the mountains into the plains i thought they had chosen a strange place for their habitation as there appeared no signs of a watercourse near it it was not till i pulled up within a quarter of a mile of my destination that i heard a hoarse roar as if from the bowels of the earth and found that i was standing on the edge of a glen about four hundred feet deep through which a magnificent snowfed river poured ceaselessly here flashing bright among bars of rock there lying in dark deep reaches under tall whitestemmed trees the scene was so beautiful and novel that i paused and gazed at it across the glen behind the houses rolled up a dark mass of timbered ranges getting higher and steeper as far as the eye could reach while to the northeast the rivers course might be traced by the timber that fringed the waters edge and sometimes feathered some tributary gully almost to the level of the flat lofty tableland on either side of it down behind down folded one over the other and bordered by great forests led the eye towards the rivers source till the course of the valley could no longer be distinguished lost among the distant ranges but above where it had disappeared rose a tall blue peak with streaks of snow i rode down a steep pathway and crossed a broad gravelly ford as my horse stopped to drink i looked delighted up the vista which opened on my sight the river partly overshadowed by tall trees was hurrying and spouting through upright columns of basalt which stood in groups everywhere like the pillars of a ruined city in some places solitary in others clustered together like fantastic buildings while a hundred yards above was an island dividing the stream on which towering above the variety of low green shrubs which covered it three noble fern trees held their plumes aloft shaking with the concussion of the falling water i crossed the river a gully deep at first but getting rapidly shallower led up by a steep ascent to the tableland above and as i reached the summit i found myself at major buckleys front door they had with good taste left such trees as stood near the housea few deepshadowed lightwoods and black wattles which formed pretty groups in what i could see was marked out for a garden behind the land began to rise at first in parklike timbered forest glades and further back closing into dense deep woodlands what a lovely place they will make of this in time i said to myself but i had not much time for cogitation a loud cheerful voice shouted hamlyn you are welcome to baroona and close to me i saw the major carrying his son and heir in his arms advancing to meet me from the housedoor you are welcome to baroona echoed the boy and a merry christmas and a happy newyear to you i went into the house and was delighted to find what a change a few weeks of busy quiet and home had made in the somewhat draggletailed and disconsolate troop that i had parted with on their road miss thornton with her black mittens white apron and spectacles had found herself a cool corner by the empty fireplace and was stitching away happily at baby linen mrs buckley in the character of a duchess was picking raisins and mary was helping her and as i entered laughing loudly they greeted me kindly with all the old sacred good wishes of the season i very much pity you mr hamlyn said mrs buckley at having outlived the novelty of being scorched to death on christmasday my dear husband please refresh me with reading the thermometer one hundred and nine in the shade replied the major with a chuckle ah dear said mrs buckley if the dear old rheumatic creatures from the almshouse at clere could only spend tomorrow with us how it would warm their old bones fancy how they are crouching before their little pinched grates just now hardly that mrs buckley i said laughing they are all snug in bed now it is three oclock in the morning or thereabouts at home you must remember miss thornton i hope you have got over your journey yes and i can laugh at all my mishaps now she replied i have just got homely and comfortable here but we must make one more move and that will be the last for me mary and mr troubridge have taken up their country to the southwest and as soon as he has got our house built we are going to live there it is not far i hope said i a trifle not more than ten miles said miss thornton they call the place toonarbin marys run joins the majors on two sides and beyond again we already have neighbours the mayfords they are on the river again but we are on a small creek towards the ranges i should like to have been on the river but they say we are very lucky i am so glad to see you said mary james stockbridge said you would be sure to come otherwise we should have sent over for you what do you think of my boy she produced him from an inner room he was certainly a beautiful child though very small and with a certain painful likeness to his father which even i could see and i could not help comparing him unfavourably in my own mind with that noble sixyearold sam buckley who had come to my knee where i sat and was looking in my face as if to make a request what is it my prince i asked he blushed and turned his handsome gray eyes to a silverhandled ridingwhip that i had in my hand ill take such care of it he whispered and having got it was soon astride of a stick full gallop for banbury cross james and troubridge came in to the former i had much to tell that was highly satisfactory about our shearing and from the latter i had much to hear about the state of both the new stations and the adventures of a journey he had had back towards sydney to fetch up his sheep but these particulars will be but little interesting to an english reader and perhaps still less so to an australian i am writing a history of the people themselves not of their property i will only say once for all that the majors run contained very little short of acres of splendidly grassed plainland which he took up originally with merely a few cattle and about sheep but which in a few years carried sheep comfortably mrs hawker and troubridge had quite as large a run but a great deal of it was rather worthless forest badly grassed which tom in his wisdom like a great many other new chums had thought superior to the bleak plains on account of the shelter yet notwithstanding this disadvantage they were never after a year or two with less than sheep and a tolerable head of cattle in short in a very few years both the major and troubridge by mere power of accumulation became very wealthy people christmas morn rose bright but ere the sun had time to wreak his fury upon us every soul in the household was abroad under the shade of the lightwood trees to hear the major read the litany a strange group we were the major stood with his back against a treestem and all his congregation were ranged around him to his right stood miss thornton her arms folded placidly before her and with her mary and mrs buckley in front of whom sat the two boys sam the elder trying to keep charles the younger quiet next going round the circle stood the old housekeeper servant of the buckleys for thirty years who now looked askance off her prayerbook to see that the two convict women under her charge were behaving with decorum next and exactly opposite the major were two free servants one a broad brawny athleticlooking man with i thought not a bad countenance and the other a tall handsome foolishlooking devonshire lad the round was completed by five convict manservants standing vacantly looking about them and tom james and myself who were next the major the service which he read in a clear manly voice was soon over and we returned to the house in groups i threw myself in the way of the two free servants and asked pray which of you is william leefor i had forgotten him the short thickset man i had noticed before touched his hat and said that he was that touching of the hat is a very rare piece of courtesy from working men in australia the convicts are forced to do it and so the free men make it a point of honour not to do so oh said i i have got a groom who calls himself dick i found him sorefooted in the bush the day i met the major he was trying to pick you up he asked me to tell you that he was afraid to cross the range alone on account of the blacks or he would have come up with you he seemed anxious lest you should think it was his fault poor chap said lee what a faithful little fellow it is would it be asking a liberty if you would take back a letter for me sir i said no certainly not i am much obliged to you sir he said i am glad dick has got with a gentleman that letter was of some importance to me though i did not know it till after but i may as well say why now lee had been a favourite servant of my fathers and when he got into trouble my father had paid a counsel to defend him lee never forgot this and this letter to dick was shortly to the effect that i was one of the right sort and was to be taken care of which injunction dick obeyed to the very letter doing me services for pure good will which could not have been bought for a thousand ayear after breakfast arose the question what is to be done which troubridge replied to by saying what could any sensible man do such weather as this but get into the water and stop there shall it be all hands to bathe then said the major you wont be without company said mrs buckley for the black fellows are camped in the bend and they spend most of their time in the water such a day as this so james and troubridge started for the river with their towels the major and i promising to follow them immediately for i wanted to look at my horse and the major had also something to do in the paddock so we walked together major said i when we had gone a little way do you never feel anxious about mary hawkers husband appearing and giving trouble oh no said he the man is safe in van diemens land besides what could he gain i for one without consulting her should find means to pack him off again there is no fear by the bye major i said have you heard from our friend doctor mulhaus since your arrival i suppose he is at drumston still oh dear no said he he is gone back to germany he is going to settle there again he was so sickened of england when all his friends left that he determined to go home i understood that he had some sort of patrimony there on which he will end his days wherever he goes god go with him for he is a noble fellow amen i answered and soon after having got towels we proceeded to the river making for a long reach a little below where i had crossed the night before look there said the major theres a bit for one of your painters i wish wilkie or martin were here i agreed with him had etty been on the spot he would have got a hint for one of his finest pictures though i can give but little idea of it in writing however let me try before us was a long reach of deep still water unbroken by a ripple so hemmed in on all sides by walls of deep green black wattle teatree and delicate silver acacia that the water seemed to flow in a deep shoreless rift of the forest above which the taller forest trees towered up two hundred feet hiding the lofty cliffs which had here receded a little back from the river the picture had a centre and a strange one a little ledge of rock ran out into deep water and upon it rising from a heap of lightcoloured clothing like a white pillar in the midst of the sombre green foliage rose the naked carcass of thomas troubridge esq preparing for a header while at his feet were grouped three or four black fellows one of whom as we watched slid off the rock like an otter the reach was covered with black heads belonging to the savages who were swimming in all directions while groups of all ages and both sexes stood about on the bank in mother natures full dress we had a glorious bathe and then sat on the rock smoking talking and watching the various manoeuvres of the blacks an old lady apparently about eighty with a head as white as snow topping her black body a flourbag cobbler as her tribe would call her was punting a canoe along in the shallow water on the opposite side of the river she was entirely without clothes and in spite of her decrepitude stood upright in the cockleshell handling it with great dexterity when she was a little above us she made way on her barque and shot into the deep water in the middle of the stream evidently with the intention of speaking us as however she was just halfway across floating helplessly unable to reach the bottom with the spear she had used as a puntpole in the shallower water a mischievous black imp canted her over and souse she went into the river it was amazing to see how boldly and well the old woman struck out for the shore keeping her white head well out of the water and having reached dry land once more sat down on her haunches and began scolding with a volubility and power which would soon have silenced the loudest tongue in old billingsgate her anger so far from wearing out grew on what fed it so that her longdrawn yells which seemed like parentheses in her jabbering discourse were getting each minute more and more acute and we were just thinking about moving homewards when a voice behind us sang out hallo major having a little music eh what a sweet song that old girl is singing i must write it down from dictation and translate it as walter scott used to do with the old wives ballads in scotland i have no doubt it would be quite ossianicequal to any of the abusive scenes in homer but my dear harding how are you you are come to eat your christmas dinner with us i hope that same thing major answered the new comer troubridge and stockbridge how are you this i presume is your partner hamlyn we went back to the house harding i found was halfowner of a station to the northeast an oxford man a great hand at skylarking and an inveterate writer of songs he was goodlooking too and gentlemanlike in fact a very pleasant companion in every way dinner was to be at six oclock in imitation of home hours but we did not find the day hang heavy on our hands there was so much to be spoken of by all of us and when that important meal was over we gathered in the open air in front of the house bent upon making christmas cheer what is your last new song eh harding said the major now is the time to ventilate it ive been too busy shearing for songwriting major soon after this we went in and there we sat till nearly ten oclock laughing joking singing and drinking punch mary sat between james stockbridge and tom and they three spoke together so exclusively and so low that the rest of us were quite forgotten mary was smiling and laughing first at one and then at the other in her old way and now and then as i glanced at her i could hardly help sighing but i soon remembered certain resolutions i had made and tried not to notice the trio but to make myself agreeable to the others still my eyes wandered towards them again intuitively i thought mary had never looked so beautiful before her complexion was very full as though she were blushing at something one of them had said to her and while i watched i saw james rise and go to a jug of flowers and bring back a wreath of scarlet kennedia saying do us a favour on christmas night mary twine this in your hair she blushed deeper than before but she did it and tom helped her there was no harm in that you say for was he not her cousin but still i could not help saying to myself oh mary mary if you were a widow how long would you stay so what a gathering it is to be sure said mrs buckleyall the old drumstonians who are alive collected under one roof except the doctor said the major ah yes dear doctor mulhaus i am so sad sometimes to think that we shall never see him again i miss him more than any one said the major i have no one to contradict me now i shall have to take that duty upon me then said his wife hark there is lee come back from the sheep station yes that must be his horse call him in and give him a glass of grog i was sorry to send him out today he is coming to make his report said mrs buckley there is his heavy tramp outside the door the door was opened and the new comer advanced to where the glare of the candles fell full upon his face had the gentleman in black himself advanced out of the darkness at that moment with his blue bag on his arm and his bundle of documents in his hand we should not have leapt to our feet and cried out more suddenly than we did then for doctor mulhaus stood in the middle of the room looking around him with a bland smile chapter xxi jim stockbridge begins to take another view of matters he stood in the candlelight smiling blandly while we all stayed for an instant after our first exclamation speechless with astonishment the major was the first who showed signs of consciousness for i verily believe that one half of the company at least believed him to be a ghost you are the man said the major who in the flesh called himself maximilian mulhaus why are you come to trouble us o spiritnot that we shouldnt be glad to see you if you were alive you know butmy dear old friend how are you then we crowded round him all speaking at once and trying to shake hands with him still he remained silent and smiled i looking into his eyes saw that they were swimming and divined why he would not trust himself to speak no one hated a show of emotion more than the doctor and yet his brave warm heart would often flood his eyes in spite of himself he walked round to the fireplace and leaning against the board that answered for a chimneypiece stood looking at us with beaming eyes while we anxiously waited for him to speak ah he said at length with a deep sigh this does me good i have not made my journey in vain a man who tries to live in this world without love must if he is not a fool commit suicide in a year i went to my own home and my own dogs barked at me those i had raised out of the gutter and set on horseback splashed mud on me as i walked i will go back i said to the little english family who loved and respected me for my own sake though they be at the ends of the earth so i left those who should have loved me with an illconcealed smile on their faces and when i come here i am welcomed with tears of joy from those i have not known five years bah here is my home buckley let me live and die with you live said the majoray while theres a place to live in dont talk about dying yet thoughwell think of that presently i cant find words enough to give him welcome wife can you not i indeed she said and what need he can see a warmer welcome in our faces than an hours clumsy talk could give him i say doctor you are welcome now and for ever will that serve you husband i could not help looking at miss thornton she sat silently staring at him through it all with her hands clasped together beating them upon her knee now when all was quiet and mrs buckley and mary had run off to the kitchen to order the doctor some supper he seemed to see her for the first time and bowed profoundly she rose and looking at him intently sat down again the doctor had eaten his supper and mrs buckley had made him something to drink with her own hands the doctor had lit his pipe and we had gathered round the empty fireplace when the major said now doctor do tell us your adventures and how you have managed to drop upon us from the skies on christmasday soon told my friend he answered see here i went back to germany because all ties in england were broken i went to lord c i said i will go back and see the palingenesis of my country i will see what they are doing now the french are in the dust he said go and god speed you i went what did i find beggars on horseback everywhere riding posthaste to the devilnot as good horsemen either but as tailors of brentford and crowding one another into the mud to see who would be there first let me get out of this before they ride over me said i so i came forth to england took ship and here i am a most lucid and entirely satisfactory explanation of what you have been about i must say answered the major however i must be content at this moment little sam who had made his escape in the confusion came running in breathless papa papa said he lee has come home with a snake seven feet long lee was at the door with the reptile in his handa black snake with a deep salmoncoloured belly deadly venomous as i knew all the party went out to look at it except the doctor and miss thornton who stayed at the fireplace mind your hands lee i heard james say though the brute is dead you might prick your fingers with him i was behind all the others waiting to look at the snake which was somewhat of a large one and worth seeing so i could not help overhearing the conversation of miss thornton and the doctor and having heard the first of it my ears grew so unnaturally quickened that i could not for the life of me avoid hearing the whole though i was ashamed of playing eavesdropper my god sir i heard her say what new madness is this why do you persist in separating yourself from your family in this manner no madness at all my dear madam he answered you would have done the same under the circumstances my brother was civil but i saw he would rather have me away and continue his stewardship and so i let him miss thornton put another question which i did not catch and the sense of which i could not supply but i heard his answer plainly it was of course i did my dear lady and just as you may suppose when i walked up the ritter saal there was a buzz and giggle and not one held out his hand save noble von h long life to him but said miss thornton mentioning somebody whose name i could not catch i saw him bend over to m as i came up to the presence and they both laughed i saw a slight was intended made my devoirs and backed off the next day he sent for me but i was off and away i heard of it before i left england and will you never go back she said when i can with honour not before and that will never be till he is dead i fear and his life is as good as mine so hey for natural history and quiet domestic life and happiness with my english friends now am i wise or not i fear not she said the doctor laughed and taking her hand kissed it gallantly by this time we had all turned round and were coming in now doctor said the major if you have done flirting with miss thornton look at this snake a noble beast indeed said the doctor friend he added to lee if you dont want him i will take him off your hands for a sum of money he shall be pickled as i live he is very venomous sir said lee the blacks eat em its true but they always cut the head off first id take the head off sir before i ventured to taste him we all laughed at lees supposing that the doctor meant to make a meal of the deadly serpent and lee laughed as loudly as anybody you see sir he said ive always heard that you french gents ate frogs so i didnt know as snakes would come amiss pray dont take me for a frenchman my good lad said the doctor and as for frogs they are as good as chickens well ive eaten guaners myself said lee though i cant say much for them theyre uglier than snakes any way lee was made to sit down and take a glass of grog so very shortly the conversation flowed on into its old channel and after spending a long and pleasant evening we all went to bed james and i slept in the same room and when we were going to bed i said james if that fellow were to die there would be a chance for you yet with regard to what he asked you know well enough you old humbug i said with regard to mary hawkernee thornton i doubt it my lad he said i very much doubt it indeed and perhaps you have heard that there must be two parties to a bargain so that even if she were willing to take me i very much doubt if i would ask her no one could blame you for that i said after what has happened there are but few men who would like to marry the widow of a coiner you mistake me jeff you mistake me altogether he answered walking up and down the room with one boot off that would make but little difference to me ive no relations to sing out about a mesalliance you know no my dear old fellow not that butjeff jeff you are the dearest friend i have in the world jim my boy i answered i love you like a brother what is it i have no secrets from you jeff he said so i dont mind telling you another hesitation i grew rather anxious what the deuce is coming i thought what can she have been up to go on old fellow i added aloud lets hear all about it he stood at the end of the room looking rather sheepish why the fact is old fellow that i begin to suspect that i have outlived any little attachment i had in that quarter ive been staying in the house two months with her you see and in factin facthere he brought up short again james stockbridge i said sitting up in bed you atrocious humbug two months ago you informed me with a sigh like a groggy pair of bellows that her image could only be effaced from your heart by death you have seduced me whose only fault was loving you too well to part with you into coming sixteen thousand miles to a barbarous land far from kindred and country on the plea that your blighted affections made england less endurable thanfrance ill say for argumentand now having had two months opportunity of studying the character of the beloved one you coolly inform me that the whole thing was a mistake i repeat that you are a humbug if you dont hold your tongue and that quick he replied ill send this boot at your ugly head now then i ducked fully expecting it was coming and laughed silently under the bedclothes i was very happy to hear thisi was very happy to hear that a man whom i really liked so well had got the better of a passion for a woman who i knew was utterly incapable of being to him what his romantic highflown notions required a wife to be if this happy result i said to myself can be rendered the more sure by ridicule that shall not be wanting meanwhile i will sue for peace and see how it came about i rose again and saw he had got his other boot half off and was watching for me jim said i you aint angry because i laughed at you are you angry he answered i am never angry with you and you know it ive been a fool and i ought to be laughed at pooh said i no more a fool than other men have been before you from father adam downwards and he was a most con there i interrupted dont abuse your ancestors tell me why you have changed your mind so quick thats a precious hard thing to do mind you he answered a thousand trifling circumstances which taken apart are as worthless straws when they are bound up together become a respectable truss which is marketable and ponderable so it is with little traits in marys character which i have only noticed lately nothing separately yet when taken together to say the least different to what i had imagined while my eyes were blinded to take one instance among fifty theres her cousin tom one of the finest fellows that ever stepped but still i dont like to see her a married woman allowing him to pull her hair about and twist flowers in it this was very true but i thought that if james instead of tom had been allowed the privilege of decorating her hair he might have looked on it with different eyes james i saw cared too little about her to be very jealous and so i saw that there was no fear of any coolness between him and troubridge which was a thing to be rejoiced at as it would have been a terrible blow on our little society and which i feared at one time that evening would have been the case jim said i i have got something to tell you do you know i believe there is some mystery about doctor mulhaus he is a walking mystery said jim but he is a noble good fellow though unhappily a frogeater ah but i believe miss thornton knows it very like said jim yawning i told him all the conversation i overheard that evening are you sure she said the king he asked quite sure i said now what do you make of it i make this of it he said that it is no earthly business of ours or we should have been informed of it and if i were you i wouldnt breathe a word of it to any mortal soul or let the doctor suspect that you overheard anything secrets where kings are concerned are precious sacred things old jeff good night chapter xxii sam buckleys education this narrative which i am now writing is neither more nor less than an account of what befell certain of my acquaintances during a period extending over nearly or quite twenty years interspersed and let us hope embellished with descriptions of the country in which these circumstances took place and illustrated by conversations well known to me by frequent repetition selected as throwing light upon the characters of the persons concerned episodes there are too which i have thought it worth while to introduce as being more or less interesting as bearing on the manners of a country but little known out of which materials it is difficult to select those most proper to make my tale coherent yet such has been my object neither to dwell on the one hand unnecessarily on the more unimportant passages nor on the other hand to omit anything which may be supposed to bear on the general course of events now during all the time above mentioned i geoffry hamlyn have happened to lead a most uninteresting and with few exceptions prosperous existence i was but little concerned save as a hearer in the catalogue of exciting accidents and offences which i chronicle i have looked on with the deepest interest at the lovemaking and ended a bachelor i have witnessed the fighting afar off only joining the battle when i could not help it yet i am a steady old fogey with a mortal horror of a disturbance of any sort i have sat drinking with the winebibbers and yet at sixty my hand is as steady as a rock money has come to me by mere accumulation i have taken more pains to spend it than to make it in short all through my lifes drama i have been a spectator and not an actor and so in this story i shall keep myself as much as possible in the background only appearing personally when i cannot help it acting on this resolve i must now make my conge and bid you farewell for a few years and go back to those few sheep which james stockbridge and i own in the wilderness and continue the history of those who are more important than myself i must push on too for there is a long period of dull stupid prosperity coming to our friends at baroona and toonarbin which we must get over as quickly as is decent little sam buckley also though at present a most delightful child will soon be a mere uninteresting boy we must teach him to read and write and ride and what not as soon as possible and see if we cant find a young ladywell i wont anticipate but go on go on did i sayjump on rathertwo whole years at once see baroona now would you know it i think not that hut where we spent the pleasant christmasday you know of is degraded into the kitchen and seems moved backward although it stands in the same place for a new house is built nearer the river quite overwhelming the old slab hut in its grandeura long low wooden house with deep cool verandahs all round already festooned with passionflowers and young grapevines and fronted by a flower garden all ablaze with petunias and geraniums it was a summer evening and all the french windows reaching to the ground were open to admit the cool south wind which had just come up deliciously icily cold after a scorching day in the verandah sat the major and the doctor over their claret for the major had taken to dining late again now to his great comfort and in the garden were mrs buckley and sam watering the flowers attended by a man who drew water from a newmade reservoir near the house i think doctor said the major that the habit of dining in the middle of the day is a gross abuse of the gifts of providence and ill prove it to you what does a man dine foranswer me that to satisfy his hunger i should say answered the doctor pooh pooh stuff and nonsense my good friend said the major you are speaking at random i suppose you will say then that a black fellow is capable of dining highly capable as far as i can judge from what i have seen replied the doctor a fullgrown fighting black would be ashamed if he couldnt eat a leg of mutton at a sitting and you call that dining said the major i call it gorging why those fellows are more uncomfortable after food than before i have seen them sitting close before the fire and rubbing their stomachs with mutton fat to reduce the swelling ha ha hadining eh oh lord then if you dont dine to satisfy your hunger what the deuce do you eat dinners for at all asked the doctor why said the major spreading his legs out before him with a benign smile and leaning back in his chair i eat my dinner not so much for the sake of the dinner itself as for the afterdinnerish feeling which follows a feeling that you have nothing to do and that if you had youd be shot if youd do it that to return to where i started from is why i wont dine in in the middle of the day if that is the way you feel after dinner i certainly wouldnt all the most amiable feelings in the human breast continued the major are brought out in their full perfection by dinner if a fellow were to come to me now and ask me to lend him ten pounds id do it provided you know that he would fetch out the chequebook and pen and ink laziness is nothing said the doctor unless well carried out i only contradicted you however to draw you out i agree entirely do you know my friend i am getting marvellously fond of this climate so am i but then you know doctor that we are sheltered from the north wind here by the snowranges the summer in sydney now is perfectly infernal the dust is so thick you cant see your hand before you so i believe said the doctor by the bye i got a new butterfly today rather an event mind you here where there are so few what is he an hipparchia said the doctor sam saw him first and gave chase you seem to be making quite a naturalist of my boy doctor i am sincerely obliged to you if we can make him take to that sort of thing it may keep him out of much mischief he will never get into much said the doctor unless i am mistaken he is the most docile child i ever came across it is a pleasure to be with him what are you going to do with him he must go to school i am afraid said the major with a sigh i cant bring my heart to part with him but his mother has taught him all she knows so i suppose he must go to school and fight and get flogged and come home with a pipe in his mouth and an oath on his lips with his education completed i dont fancy his staying here among these convict servants when he is old enough to learn mischief hell learn as much mischief at a colonial school i expect said the doctor and more too all the evil he hears from these fellows will be like the water on a ducks back whereas if you send him to school in a town hell learn a dozen vices hell never hear of here get him a tutor that is easier said than done doctor it is very hard to get a respectable tutor in the colony here is one at your hand said the doctor take me my dear friend said the major jumping up i would not have dared to ask such a thing if you would undertake him for a short time i will undertake the boys education altogether potztausend and why not it will be a labour of love and therefore the more thoroughly done what shall he learn now that i must leave to you a weighty responsibility said the doctor no latin or greek i suppose they will be no use to him here wellno i suppose not but i should like him to learn his latin grammar you may depend upon it theres something in the latin grammar what use has it been to you major why the least advantage it has been to me is to give me an insight into the construction of languages which is some use but while i was learning the latin grammar i learnt other things besides of more use than the construction of any languages living or dead first i learnt that there were certain things in this world that must be done next that there were people in this world of whom the masters of eton were a sample whose orders must be obeyed without question third i found that it was pleasanter in all ways to do ones duty than to leave it undone and last i found out how to bear a moderate amount of birching without any indecent outcry all very useful things said the doctor teach a boy one thing well and you show him how to learn others history i suppose as much as you like doctor his mother has taught him his catechism and all that sort of thing and she is the fit person you know with the exception of that and the latin grammar i trust everything to your discretion there is one thing i leave to you major if you please and that is corporal chastisement i am not at all sure that i could bring myself to flog sam and if i did it would be very inefficiently done oh ill undertake it said the major though i believe i shall have an easy task he wont want much flogging at this moment mrs buckley approached with a basketful of freshgathered flowers the roses dont flower well here doctor she said but the geraniums run mad here is a salmoncoloured one for your buttonhole he has earned it well agnes said her husband he has decided the discussion we had last night by offering to undertake sams education himself and gods blessing on him for it said mrs buckley warmly you have taken a great load off my mind doctor i should never have been happy if that boy had gone to school come here sam sam came bounding into the verandah and clambered up on his father as if he had been a tree he was now eleven years old and very tall and wellformed for his age he was a goodlooking boy with regular features and curly chestnut hair he had too the large greyblue eye of his father an eye that never lost for a moment its staring expression of kindly honesty and the lads whole countenance was one which without being particularly handsome or even very intelligent won an honest mans regard at first sight my dear sam said his mother leave off playing with your fathers hair and listen to me for i have something serious to say to you last night your father and i were debating about sending you to school but doctor mulhaus has himself offered to be your tutor thereby giving you advantages for love which you never could have secured for money now the least we can expect of you my dear boy is that you will be docile and attentive to him i will try doctor dear said sam but i am very stupid sometimes you know so the good doctor whose head was stored with nearly as much of human knowledge as mortal head could hold took simple guileless little sam by the hand and led him into the garden of knowledge unless i am mistaken these two will pick more flowers than they will dig potatoes in the aforesaid garden but i dont think that two such honest souls will gather much unwholesome fruit the danger is that they will waste their time which is no danger at all but a certainty i believe that such an education as our sam got from the doctor would have made a slattern and a faineant out of half the boys in england if sam had been a clever boy or a conceited boy he would have ended with a superficial knowledge of things in general imagining he knew everything when he knew nothing and would have been left in the end without a faith either religious or political a useless careless man this danger the doctor foresaw in the first month and going to the major abruptly as he walked up and down the garden took his arm and said see here buckley i have undertaken to educate that boy of yours and every day i like the task better and yet every day i see that i have undertaken something beyond me his appetite for knowledge is insatiable but he is not an intellectual boy he makes no deductions of his own but takes mine for granted he has no commentary on what he learns but that of a dissatisfied idealist like me a man who has been thrown among circumstances sufficiently favourable to make a prime minister out of some men and yet who has ended by doing nothing another thing this is my first attempt at education and i have not the schoolmasters art to keep him to details every day i make new resolutions and every day i break them the boy turns his great eyes upon me in the middle of some humdrum work and asks me a question in answering i get off the turnpike road and away we go from lane to lane from one subject to another until lessontime is over and nothing done and if it were merely time wasted it could be made up but he remembers every word i say and believes in it like gospel when i myself couldnt remember half of it to save my life now my dear fellow i consider your boy to be a very sacred trust to me and so i have mentioned all this to you to give you an opportunity of removing him to where he might be under a stricter discipline if you thought fit if he was like some boys now i should resign my post at once but as it is i shall wait till you turn me out for two reasons the first is that i take such delight in my task that i do not care to relinquish it and the other is that the lad is naturally so orderly and gentle that he does not need discipline like most boys my dear doctor replied major buckley listen to me if we were in england and sam could go to eton which i take it you know is the best school in the world i would still earnestly ask you to continue your work he will probably inherit a great deal of money and will not have to push his way in the world by his brains so that close scholarship will be rather unnecessary i should like him to know history well and thoroughly for he may mix in the political life of this little colony by and by latin grammar you know he said laughing is indispensable doctor i trust my boy with you because i know that you will make him a gentleman as his mother with gods blessing will make him a christian so the doctor buckled to his task again with renewed energy to euclid latin grammar and fractions sams good memory enabled him to make light of the grammar and the fractions too were no great difficulty but the euclid was an awful trial he couldnt make out what it was all about he got on very well until he came nearly to the end of the first book and then getting among the parallelogram props as we used to call them may their fathers graves be defiled he stuck dead for a whole evening did he pore patiently over one of them till a b setting to c d crossed hands poussetted and whirled round in sahara waltz through his throbbing head bedtime but no rest whether he slept or not he could not tell who could sleep with that longbodied illtemperedlooking parallelogram a h standing on the bedclothes and crying out in tones loud enough to waken the house that it never had been nor never would be equal to the fat jolly square c k so in the morning sam woke to the consciousness that he was farther off from the solution than ever but having had a good cry went into the study and tackled to it again no good breakfast time and matters much worse that long peakednose vixen of a triangle a h c which yesterday sam had made out was equal to half the parallelogram and half the square now had the audacity to declare that she had nothing to do with either of them so what was to be done now after breakfast sam took his book and went out to his father who was sitting smoking in the verandah he clambered up on to his knee and then began father dear see here can you understand this youve got to prove you knowoh dear ive forgot that now lets see said the major i am afraid this is a little above me theres brentwood now could do it he was in the artillery you know and learnt fortification and that sort of thing i dont think i can make much hand of it sam but sam had put his head upon his fathers shoulder and was crying bitterly come come my old man said the major dont give way you know dont be beat i cant make it out at all said sam sobbing ive got such a buzzing in my head with it and if i cant do it i must stop because i cant go on to the next till i understand this oh dear me lay your head there a little my boy till it gets clearer then perhaps you will be able to make it out you may depend on it that you ought to learn it or the good doctor wouldnt have set it to you never let a thing beat you my son so sam cried on his fathers shoulder a little and then went in with his book and not long after the doctor looked in unperceived and saw the boy with his elbows on the table and the book before him even while he looked a big tear fell plump into the middle of a h so the doctor came quietly in and said cant you manage it sam sam shook his head just give me hold of the book will you sam sam complied without word or comment the doctor sent it flying through the open window halfway down the garden there said he nodding his head thats the fit place for him this day youve had enough of him at present go and tell one of the blacks to dig some worms and well make holiday and go a fishing sam looked at the doctor and then through the window at his old enemy lying in the middle of the flowerbed he did not like to see the poor book so lately his master crumpled and helpless fallen from its high estate so suddenly he would have gone to its assistance and picked it up and smoothed it the more so as he felt that he had been beaten the doctor seemed to see everything let it lie here my child he said you are not in a position to assist a fallen enemy you are still the vanquished party go and get the worms he went and when he came back he found the doctor sitting beside his father in the verandah with a penknife in one hand and the ace of spades in the other he cut the card into squares triangles and parallelograms while sam looked on and demonstrating as he went fitted them one into the other till the boy saw his bugbear of a proposition made as clear as day before his eyes why said sam thats all as clear as need be i understand it now may i pick the book up doctor history was the pleasantest part of all sams tasks for they would sit in the little room given up for a study with the french windows open looking on the flowergarden sam reading aloud and the doctor making discursive commentaries at last one day the doctor said my boy we are making too much of a pleasure of this you must really learn your dates now tell me the date of the accession of edward the sixth no returns ah i thought so we must not be so discursive well learn the dates of the grecian history as being an effort of memory you not having read it yet but this plan was rather worse than the other for one morning sam having innocently asked at halfpast eleven what the battle of thermopylae was mrs buckley coming in at one to call them to lunch found the doctor who had begun the account of that glorious fight in english and then gone on to german walking up and down the room in a state of excitement reciting to sam who did not know delta from psi the soulmoving account of it from herodotus in good sonorous greek she asked laughing what language are you talking now my dear doctor greek madam greek and the very best of greek and what does sam think of it i should like you to learn greek my boy if you can i thought he was singing mother said sam but after that the lad used to sit delighted by the river side when they were fishing while the doctor with his musical voice repeated some melodious ode of pindars and so the intellectual education proceeded with more or less energy and meanwhile the physical and moral part was not forgotten though the two latter like the former were not very closely attended to and left a good deal to providence and having done your best for a boy in what better hands can you leave him but the major as an old soldier had gained a certain faith in the usefulness of physical training so when sam was about twelve you might have seen him any afternoon on the lawn with his father the major patiently teaching him singlestick and sam as patiently learning until the boy came to be so marvellously active on his legs and to show such rapidity of eye and hand that the major on one occasion having received a more than usually agonizing cut on the forearm remarked that he thought he was not quite so active on his pins as formerly and that he must hand the boy over to the doctor doctor said he that day i have taught my boy ordinary sword play till by jove sir he is getting quicker than i am i wish you would take him in hand and give him a little fencing who told you i could fence said the doctor why i dont know no one i think i have judged i fancy more by seeing you flourish your walkingstick than anything else you are a fencer are you not the doctor laughed he was in fact a consummate maitre darmes and captain brentwood before spoken of no mean fencer coming to baroona on a visit found that our friend could do exactly as he liked with him to the captains great astonishment and sam soon improved under his tuition not indeed to the extent of being a master of the weapon he was too large and loosely built for that but at all events so far as to gain an upright and elastic carriage and to learn the use of his limbs the major issued an edict giving the most positive orders against its infringement that sam should never mount a horse without his special leave and licence he taught him to ride indeed but would not give him much opportunity for practising it once or twice aweek he would take him out but seldom oftener sam who never dreamt of questioning the wisdom and excellence of any of his fathers decisions rather wondered at this pondering in his own mind how it was that while all the lads he knew around now getting pretty numerous lived as it were on horseback never walking a quarter of a mile on any occasion he alone should be discouraged from it perhaps he said to himself one day he doesnt want me to make many acquaintances its true charley delisle smokes and swears which is very ungentlemanly but cecil mayford dad says is a perfect little gentleman and i ought to see as much of him as possible and yet he wouldnt give me a horse to go to their muster well i suppose he has some reason for it one holiday the doctor and the major were sitting in the verandah after breakfast when sam entered to them and clambering on to his father as his wont was said see here father harry is getting in some young beasts at the stockyard hut and cecil mayford is coming over to see if any of theirs are among them may i go out and meet him to be sure my boy why not may i have bronsewing father he is in the stable it is a nice cool day and only four miles why not walk out my boy sam looked disappointed but said nothing i know all about it my child said the major cecil will be there on blackboy and you would like to show him that bronsewing is the superior pony of the two thats all very natural but still i say get your hat sam and trot through the forest on your own two legs and bring cecil home to dinner sam still looked disappointed though he tried not to show it he went and got his hat and meeting the dogs got such a wild welcome from them that he forgot all about bronsewing soon his father saw him merrily crossing the paddock with the whole kennel of the establishment kangaroo dogs cattle dogs and colleys barking joyously around him theres a good lesson manfully learnt doctor said the major he has learnt to sacrifice his will to mine without argument because he knows i have always a reason for things i want that boy to ride as little as possible but he has earned an exception in his favour todayjerry after a few calls the stableman appeared put mr samuels saddle on bronsewing and mine on ricochette and bring them round so sam walking cheerily forward singing under the light and shadow of the old forest surrounded by his dogs hears horses feet behind him and looking back sees his father riding and leading bronsewing saddled jump up my boy said the major cecil shall see what bronsewing is like and how well you can sit him the reason i altered my mind was that i might reward you for acting like a man and not arguing now i dont want you to ride much yet for a few years i dont want my lad to grow up with a pair of bow legs like a groom and probably something worse from living on horseback before his bones are set you see i have a good reason for what i do but i think that the lessons sam liked best of all were the swimming lessons and at a very early age he could swim and dive like a black and once when disporting himself in the water when not more than thirteen poor sam nearly had a stop put to his bathing for ever and that in a very frightful manner his father and he had gone down to bathe one hot noon the major had swum out and was standing on the rock wiping himself while sam was still disporting in the midriver as he watched the boy he saw what seemed a stick upon the water and then as he perceived the ripple around it the horrible truth burst on the affrighted father it was a large black snake crossing the river and poor little sam was swimming straight towards it all unconscious of his danger the major cried out and waved his hand the boy seeing something was wrong turned and made for the shore and the next moment his father bending his body back hurled himself through the air and alighted in the water alongside of him clutching him round the body and heading down the river with furious strokes dont cling sam or get frightened make for the shore the lad although terribly frightened at he knew not what with infinite courage seconded his fathers efforts although he felt sinking in a few minutes they were safe on the bank in time for them to see the reptile land and crawling up the bank disappear among the rocks god has been very good to us my son you have been saved from a terrible death mind you dont breathe a word to your mother about this that night sam dreamt that he was in the coils of a snake but waking up found that his father was laid beside him in his clothes with one arm round his neck so he went to sleep again and thought no more of the snake my son if sinners entice thee consent thou nota saying which it is just possible you have heard before i can tell you where it comes from it is one of the apothegms of the king of a little eastern nation who at one time were settled in syria and whose writings are not much read nowadays in consequence of the vast mass of literature of a superior kind which this happy century has produced i can recommend the book however as containing some original remarks and being generally worth reading the meaning of the above quotation and the man who said it mind you had at one time a reputation for shrewdness is as i take it that a mans morals are very much influenced by the society he is thrown among and although in these parliamentary times we know that kings must of necessity be fools yet in this instance i think that the man shows some glimmerings of reason for his remark tallies singularly with my own personal observation so acting on this while i am giving you the history of this little wild boy of the bush i cannot do better than give some account of the companions with whom he chiefly assorted out of schoolhours with broad intelligent forehead with large loving hazel eyes with a frill like queen elizabeth with a brush like a fox deep in the brisket perfect in markings of black white and tan in sagacity a pitt in courage an anglesey rover stands first on my list and claims to be king of colleydogs in politics i should say conservative of the high protectionist sort let us have no strange dogs about the place to grub up sacred bones or we will shake out our frills and tumble them in the dust domestic cats may mioul in the garden at night to a certain extent but a line must be drawn after that they must be chased up trees and barked at if necessary all night opossums and native cats are unfit to cumber the earth and must be hunted into holes wherever possible cows and other horned animals must not come into the yard or even look over the garden fence under penalties black fellows must be barked at and their dogs chased to the uttermost limits of the habitable globe such were the chief points of the creed subscribed to by sams dog rover all the love that may be between dog and man and man and dog existed between sam and rover never a fresh cheery morning when the boy arose with the consciousness of another happy day before him but that the dog was waiting for him as he stepped from his window into clear morning air never a walk in the forest but that rover was his merry companion and what would lessons have been without rover looking in now and then with his head on one side and his ears cocked to know when he would be finished and come out to play oh memorable day when sam got separated from his father in the yass and looking back saw a cloud of dust in the road and dimly descried rover fighting valiantly against fearful odds with all the dogs in the township upon him he rode back and prayed for assistance from the men lounging in front of the publichouse who pitying his distress pulled off all the dogs till there were only left rover and a great white bulldog to do battle the fight seemed going against sams dog for the bulldog had him by the neck and held him firm so that he could do nothing nevertheless mind yourself master bulldog youve only got a mouthful of long hair there and when you do let go i think there is danger for you in those fierce gleaming eyes and terrible grinning fangs sam was crying and the men round were saying oh take the bulldog off the colleys no good to himwhen a man suddenly appeared at sams side and called out ill back the colley for five pounds and heres my money halfadozen fivepound notes were ready for him at once and he had barely got the stakes posted before the event proved he was right in an evil moment for him the bulldog loosed his hold and ere he had time to turn round rover had seized him below the eye and was dragging him about the road worrying him as he would worry an opossum so the discomfited owner had to remove his bulldog to save his life rover after showing his teeth and shaking himself came to sam as fresh as a daisy and the new comer pocketed his five pounds i am so much obliged to you said sam turning to him for taking my dogs part they were all against me im much obliged to your dog sir for winning me five pound so easy but there aint a many bad dogs or bad men either about major buckleys house then you know us said sam ought to it sir an old devonshire man mr hamlyns studgroom sirdick well as i am going to write rovers life in three volumes post octavo i wont any further entrench on my subject matter save to say that while on the subject of sams education i could not well omit a notice of the aforesaid rover for i think that all a man can learn from a dog sam learnt from him and that is something now let us go on to the next of his notable acquaintances who is this glorious blueeyed curlyheaded boy who bursts into the house like a whirlwind making it ring again with merry laughter this is jim brentwood of whom we shall see much anon at waterloo when the french cavalry were coming up the hill and our artillerymen were running for the squares deftly trundling their gunwheels before them it happened that there came running towards the square where major buckley stood like a tower of strength the tallest man in the regiment an artillery officer begrimed with mud and gunpowder and dragging a youth by the collar or rather what seemed to be the body of a youth some cried out to him to let go but he looked back seeming to measure the distance between the cavalry and the square and then never loosing his hold held on against hope every one thought he would be too late when some one ran out of the square men said it was buckley and throwing the wounded lad over his shoulder ran with him into safety and a cheer ran along the line from those who saw him do it small time for cheering then for neither could recover his breath before there came a volley of musketry and all around them outside the bayonets was a wild sea of fierce mens faces horses heads gleaming steel and french blasphemy a strange scene for the commencement of an acquaintance and yet it throve for that same evening buckley talking to his colonel saw the artillery officer coming towards them and asked who he might be that said the colonel is brentwood of the artillery who ran away with lady kate bingley and they havent a rap to bless themselves with sir it was her brother that you and he fetched into the square today and so began a friendship which lasted the lives of both men and i doubt not will last their sons lives too for brentwood lived within thirty miles of the major and their sons spent much of their time together having such a friendship for one another as only boys can have captain brentwoods son jim was a very different boy to sam though a very fine fellow too mischief and laughter were the apparent objects of his life and when the doctor saw him approaching the house he used to put away sams lessonbooks with a sigh and wait for better times the captain had himself undertaken his sons education and being a somewhat dreamy man excessively attached to mathematics jim had got altogether a very remarkable education indeed which however is hardly to our purpose just now brentwood i must say was a widower and a kindhearted easygoing man he had besides a daughter who was away at school enough of them at present the next of sams companions who takes an important part in this history is cecil mayforda delicate clever little dandy and courageous withal with more brains in his head i should say than sam and jim could muster between them his mother was a widow who owned the station next down the river from the buckleys distant about five miles and which since the death of her husband doctor mayford she had managed with the assistance of an overseer she had besides cecil a little daughter of great beauty also i must here mention that the next station below mrs mayfords on the river distant by the windings of the valley fifteen miles and yet in consequence of a bend scarcely ten from major buckleys at baroona was owned and inhabited by yahoos by name donovan with whom we had nothing to do but this aforesaid station which is called garoopna will shortly fall into other hands when you will see that many events of deep importance will take place there and many pleasant hours spent there by all our friends more particularly oneby name sam there is one other left of whom i must say something here and more immediately the poor puling little babe born in misery and disaster mary hawkers boy charles toonarbin was but a short ten miles from baroona and of course the two families were as one there was always a hostage from the one house staying as a visitor in the other and under such circumstances of course charles and sam were much together and as time went on got to be firm friends charles was two years younger than sam the smallest of all the lads and perhaps the most unhappy for the truth must be told he was morose and uncertain in his temper and although all the other boys bore with him most generously as one whom they had heard was born under some great misfortune yet he was hardly a favourite amongst them and the poor boy sometimes perceiving this would withdraw from his play and sulk alone resisting all the sober kind inducements of sam and the merry impetuous persuasions of jim to return but he was a kind goodhearted boy nevertheless his temper was not under control but after one of his fierce volcanic bursts of illhumour he would be acutely miserable and angry with himself for days particularly if the object of it had been jim or sam his two especial favourites on one occasion after a causeless fit of anger with jim while the three were at major buckleys together he got his pony and rode away home secretly speaking to no one the other two lamented all the afternoon that he had taken the matter so seriously and were debating even next morning going after him to propitiate him when charles reappeared having apparently quite recovered his temper but evidently bent upon something he had a bird a white corrella which could talk and whistle surprisingly probably in fact the most precious thing he owned this prodigy he had now brought back in a basket as a peaceoffering and refused to be comforted unless jim accepted it as a present but see charley said jim i was as much in the wrong as you were which was not fact for jim was perfectly innocent i wouldnt take your bird for the world but charles said that his mother approved of it and if jim didnt take it hed let it fly well if you will old fellow said jim ill tell you what i would rather have give me flys dun pup instead and take the bird home so this was negotiated after a time and the corrella was taken back to toonarbin wildly excited by the journey and calling for strong liquor all the way home those who knew the sad circumstances of poor charless birth the major the doctor and mrs buckley treated him with such kindness and consideration that they won his confidence and love in any of his berserk fits if his mother were not at hand he would go to mrs buckley and open his griefs and her motherly tact and kindness seldom failed to still the wild beatings of that poor sensitive silly little heart so that in time he grew to love her as only second to his mother such is my brief and imperfect and i fear tedious account of sams education and of the companions with whom he lived until the boy had grown into a young man and his sixteenth birthday came round on which day as had been arranged he was considered to have finished his education and stand up young as he was as a man happy morning and memorable for one thing at leastthat his father coming into his bedroom and kissing his forehead led him out to the front door where was a groom holding a horse handsomer than any sam had seen before which pawed the gravel impatient to be ridden and ere sam had exhausted half his expressions of wonder and admirationthat his father told him the horse was his a birthdaypresent from his mother chapter xxiii toonarbin but i think i hear you say what has become of mary hawker all this time you raised our interest about her somewhat at first as a young and beautiful woman villainbeguiled who seemed too to have a temper of her own and promised under circumstances to turn out a bit of a bmstne what is she doing all this time has she got fat or had the smallpox that you neglect her like this we had rather more than we wanted of her and her villanous husband in the first volume and now nothing let us at all events hear if she is dead or alive and her husband tooalthough we hope under providence that he has left this wicked world yet we should be glad to hear of it for certain make inquiries and let us know the result likewise be so good as inform us how is miss thornton to all this i answer humbly that i will do my best if you will bring a dull chapter on you duller even than all the rest at least read it and exonerate me the fact is my dear sir that women like mary hawker are not particularly interesting in the piping times of peace in volcanic and explosive times they with their wild animal passions become tragical and remarkable like baronesses of old but in tranquil times as i said they fall into the background and show us the value and excellence of such placid noble helpmates as the serene highbred mrs buckley a creek joined the river about a mile below the buckleys station falling into the main stream with rather a pretty cascade which even at the end of the hottest summer poured a tiny silver thread across the black rocks above the cascade the creek cut deep into the table land making a charming glen with precipitous blue stone walls some eighty or ninety feet in height fringed with black wattle and lightwood and here and there among the fallen rocks nearest the water a fern tree or so which last i may say are no longer there dr mulhaus having cut the hearts out of them and eaten them for cabbage should you wander up this little gully on a hot summers day you would be charmed with the beauty of the scenery and the shady coolness of the spot till coming upon a black snake coiled away among the rocks like a rope on the deck of a man of war you would probably withdraw not without a strong inclination to shy at every black stick you saw for the rest of the day for this lower part of the moira creek was i am sorry to say the most troubled locality for snakes diamond black carpet and other which i ever happened to see but following this creek you would find that the banks got rapidly less precipitous and at length it swept in long curves through open forest glades spreading too into deep dark waterholes only connected by gravelly fords with a slender stream of clear water running across the yellow pebbles these waterholes were the haunts of the platypus and the tortoise here too were flocks of black duck and teal and as you rode past the merry little snipe would rise from the waters edge and whisk away like lightning through the trees altogether a pleasant woodland creek alongside of which under the mighty boxtrees ran a sandy road bordered with deep beds of bracken fern which led from baroona of the buckleys to toonarbin of the hawkers a pleasant road indeed winding through the old forest straight towards the mountains shifting its course so often that every minute some new vista opened upon you till at length you came suddenly upon a clear space beyond which rose a picturesque little granite cap at the foot of which you saw a charming house covered with green creepers and backed by huts sheepyards a woolshed and the usual concomitants of a flourishing australian sheep station behind all again towered lofty dark hanging woods closing the prospect this is toonarbin where mary hawker with her leal and trusty cousin tom troubridge for partner has pitched her tent after all her spasmodic tragical troubles and here she is leading as happy and by consequence as uninteresting an existence as ever fell to the lot of a handsome woman yet mary and miss thornton had stayed with the buckleys until good cousin tom had got a house ready to receive them and then they moved up and took possession mary and tom were from the first copartners and latterly miss thornton had invested her money about pounds in the station matters were very prosperous and after a few years tom began to get weighty and didactic in his speech and to think of turning his attention to politics to mary the past seemed like a dreamas an old dream wellnigh forgotten the scene was so changed that at times she could hardly believe that all those dark old days were real could she now so busy and happy be the same woman who sat worn and frightened over the dying fire with poor captain saxon is she the same woman whose husband was hurried off one wild night and transported for coining or is all that a hideous imagination no here is the pledge and proof that it is all too terribly real this boy whom she loves so wildly and fiercely is that mans son and his father for aught she knows is alive and only a few poor hundred miles off never mind let it be forgotten as though it never was so she forgot it and was happy but not always sometimes she could not but remember what she was in spite of the many kind friends who surrounded her and the new and busy life she led then would come a fit of despondency almost of despair but the natural elasticity of her temper soon dispersed these clouds and she was her old self again her very old self indeed that delicateminded intellectual old maid miss thornton used to remark with silent horror on what she called marys levity of behaviour with men but more especially with honest tom troubridge many a time when the old lady was sitting darning she was always darning she used to begin darning the things before they were a week out of the drapers shop would her tears fall upon her work as she saw mary sitting with her child in her lap smiling while the audacious tom twisted a flower in her hair in the way that pleased him best to see anything wrong and to say nothing was a thing impossible she knew that speaking to mary would only raise a storm and so knowing the man she had to deal with she determined to speak to tom she was not long without her opportunity duly darning one evening while mary was away putting her boy to bed tom entered from his wine him with a combination of valour and judgment she immediately attacked acting upon a rule once laid down to marymy dear if you want to manage a man speak to him after dinner mr troubridge said miss thornton may i speak a few words to you on private affairs madam said tom drawing up a chair i am at your service night or day a younger woman said miss thornton might feel some delicacy in saying what i am going to say but old age has its privileges and so i hope to be forgiven dear miss thornton said tom you must be going to say something very extraordinary if it requires forgiveness from me nay my dear kinsman said miss thornton if we begin exchanging compliments we shall talk all night and never get to the gist of the matter after all here is what i want to say it seems to me that your attentions to our poor mary are somewhat more than cousinly and it behoves me to remind you that she is still a married woman is that too blunt have i offended you nayno said tom you could never offend me i think you are right too it shall be amended madam and after this mary missed many delicate little attentions that tom had been used to pay her she thought he was sulky on some account at first but soon her good sense showed her that if they two were to live together she must be more circumspect or mischief would come for after all tom had but small place in her heart heart filled almost exclusively with this poor sulky little lad of hers who seemed born to trouble as the sparks went upward in teething even aggravating beyond experience and afterwards suffering from the whole list of juvenile evils in such a way as boy never did before coming out of these troubles too with a captious disagreeable temper jealous in the extremenot a member who on the whole adds much to the pleasure of the little householdyet with the blindest passionate love towards some folks instance his mother thomas troubridge and sam buckley for these three the lad had a wild hysterical affection and yet none of them had much power over him once by one unconsidered word arouse the boys obstinacy and all chance of controlling him was gone then your only chance was to call in miss thornton who had a way of managing the boy more potent than marys hysterics and toms indignant remonstrances or sams quiet persuasions for instanceonce when he was about ten years old his mother set him to learn some lesson or another when he had been petitioning to go off somewhere with the men he was furiously naughty and threw the book to the other end of the room all the threats and scoldings of his mother proving insufficient to make him pick it up again so that at last she went out leaving him alone triumphant with miss thornton who said not a word but only raised her eyes off her work from time to time to look reproachfully on the rebellious boy he could stand his mothers anger but he could not stand those steady wondering looks that came from under the old ladys spectacles so that when mary came in again she found the book picked up and the lesson learned moreover it was a fortnight before the lad misbehaved himself again in sickness and in health in summer and in winter for ten long years after they settled at toonarbin did this noble old lady stand beside mary as a rock of refuge in all troubles great or small always serene patient and sensible even to the last for the time came when this true and faithful servant was removed from among them to receive her reward one morning she confessed herself unable to leave her bed that was the first notice they had doctor mayford sent for secretly visited her break up of the constitution said heno organic diseasebut shook his head she will go he added with the first frost i can do nothing and dr mulhaus being consulted said he was but an amateur doctor but concurred with dr mayford so there was nothing to do but to wait for the end as patiently as might be during the summer she got out of bed and sat in a chair which tom used to lift dexterously into the verandah there she would sit very quietly sometimes getting mrs buckley who came and lived at toonarbin that summer to read a hymn for her and during this time she told them where she would like to be buried on a little knoll she said which lay to the right of the house barely two hundred yards from the window here the grass grew shorter and closer than elsewhere and here freshened more rapidly beneath the autumn rains here on winters evenings the slanting sunbeams lingered longest and here at such times she had been accustomed to saunter listening to the sighing of the wind in the dark funeral sheoaks and cypresses like the faroff sea upon a sandy shore here too came oftener than elsewhere a flock of lories making the dark low trees gay with flying living blossoms and here she would lie with her feet towards the east her sightless eyes towards that dreary ocean which she would never cross again one fresh spring morning she sat up and talked serenely to mrs buckley about matters far higher and more sacred than one likes to deal with in a tale of this kind and after a time expressed a wish for a blossom of a great amaryllis which grew just in front of her window mrs buckley got the flower for her and so holding the crimsonstriped lily in her delicate wasted fingers the good old lady passed from this world without a struggle as decently and as quietly as she had always lived in it this happened when charles was about ten years old and for some time the lad was subdued and sad he used to look out of the window at night towards the grave and wonder why they had put her they all loved so well to lie out there under the wildsweeping winter rain but by degrees he got used to the little square white railing on the sheoak knoll and ere half a year was gone the memory of his aunt had become very dim and indistinct poor mary too though a long while prepared for it was very deeply and sincerely grieved at miss thorntons death but she soon recovered from it it came in the course of nature and although the house looked blank and dull for a time yet there was too much life all around her too much youthful happy life to make it possible to dwell very long on the death of one who had left them full of years and honour but lord frederick before spoken of incidentally in this narrative playing billiards at gibraltar about a year after this had put into his hand a letter from which when opened there fell a lock of silver grey hair on the green cloth which he carefully picked up and leaving his game went home to his quarters his comrades thought it was his father who was dead and when they heard it was only his sisters old governess they wondered exceedingly for fred said they is not given to be sentimental and now in a year or two it began to be very difficult to keep master charley in order when he was about thirteen there was a regular guerillawar between him and his mother on the subject of learning which ended ultimately in the boy flatly refusing to learn anything his natural capacities were but small and under any circumstances knowledge would only have been acquired by him with infinite pains but as it was with his selfishness fostered so excessively by his mothers indulgence and toms goodhumoured carelessness it became totally impossible to teach him anything in vain his mother scolded and wept in vain tom represented to him the beauties and excellences of learninglearn the boy would not so that at fourteen he was given up in despair by his mother having learnt nearly enough of reading writing and ciphering to carry on the most ordinary business of life a most lamentable state of things for a lad who in after life would be a rich man and who in a young and rapidlyrising country might become by the help of education politically influential i think that when samuel buckley and james brentwood were grown to be young men of eighteen or nineteen and he was about seventeen or so a stranger would have seen a great deal of difference between the two former and the latter and would probably have remarked that james and sam spoke and behaved like two gentlemen but that charles did not but seemed as though he had come from a lower grade in societywith some truth too for there was a circumstance in his bringing up which brought him more harm than all his neglect of learning and all his mothers foolish indulgences both major buckley and captain brentwood made it a law of the medes and persians that neither of their sons should hold any conversation with the convict servants save in the presence of competent authorities and indeed they both as soon as increased emigration enabled them removed their old household servants and replaced them by free men newly arrived a lazy independent class certainly with exaggerated notions of their own importance in this new phase of their life but without the worse vices of the convicts this rule even in such wellregulated households was a very hard one to get observed even under flogging penalties and indeed formed the staple affliction of poor thoughtless jims early life as this little anecdote will show one day going to see captain brentwood when jim was about ten years old i met that young gentleman looking i thought a little out of sorts about two hundred yards from the house he turned with me to go back and after the first salutations i said well jim my boy i hope youve been good since i saw you last oh dear no was the answer with a shake of the head that meant volumes im sorry to hear that what is the matter ive been catching it said jim in a whisper coming close alongside of me a teastick as thick as my forefinger all overhere he entered into particulars which however harmless in themselves were not of a sort usually written in books thats a bad job i said what was it for why i slipped off with jerry to look after some colts on the black swamp and was gone all the afternoon and so dad missed me and when i got home didnt i catch it oh lord im all over blue wales but that aint the worst whats the next misfortune i inquired why when he got hold of me he said is this the first time you have been away with jerry sir and i said yes which was the awfullest lie ever you heard for i went over to barkers with him two days before then he said well i must believe you if you say so i shall not disgrace you by making inquiries among the men and then he gave it to me for going that time and since then ive felt like cain and abel for telling him such a lie what would you doeh i should tell him all about it i said ah but then i shall catch it again dont you see hadnt i better wait till these wales are gone down i wouldnt if i were you i answered id tell him at once i wonder why he is so particular said jim the delisles and the donovans spend as much of their time in the huts as they do in the house and fine young blackguards theyll turn out i said in which i was right in those two instances and although i have seen young fellows brought up among convicts who have turned out respectable in the end yet it is not a promising school for good citizens but at toonarbin no such precautions as these were taken with regard to charles tom was too careless and mary too indulgent it was hard enough to restrain the boy during the lesson hours falsely so called after that he was allowed to go where he liked and even his mother sometimes felt relieved by his absence so that he was continually in the mens huts listening to their yarnssometimes harmless bush adventures sometimes perhaps ribald stories which he could not understand but one day tom troubridge coming by the hut looked in quietly and saw master charles smoking a black pipe he was not more than fourteen and heard such a conversation going on that he advanced suddenly upon them and ordered the boy home in a sterner tone than he had ever used to him before and looked out of the door till he had disappeared then he turned round to the men there were three of them all convicts one of whom the one he had heard talking when he came in was a large desperatelooking fellow when these men mean to deprecate your anger i have remarked they always look you blankly in the face but if they mean to defy you and be impudent they never look at you but always begin fumbling and fidgetting with something so when tom saw that the big man before mentioned daniel harvey by name was stooping down before the fire he knew he was going to have a row and waited so boss began the ruffian not looking at him we aint fit company for the likes of that kinchineh youre not fit company for any man except the hangman said tom looking more like sixfootsix than sixfootthree oh my colonial oath said the other oh my cabbage tree so theres going to be a coil about that scrubby little myrnonger eh dont you fret your bingy boss hell be as good a man as his father yet for an instant a dark shadow passed over toms face so he thought these fellows know all about george hawker eh well never mind what odds if they do and then he said aloud turning round on harvey look you here you dog if i ever hear of your talking in that style before that boy or any other boy by george ill twist your head off he advanced towards him as if to perform that feat on the spot in a moment the convict had snatched his knife from his belt and rushed upon him very suddenly indeed but not quite quick enough to take the champion of devon by surprise ere he was well within reach tom had seized the hand that held the knife and with a backward kick of his left foot sent the embryo assassin sprawling on his back on the top of the fire whence tom dragged him by his heels far more astonished than burnt the other two men had meanwhile sat taking no notice or seeming to take none of the disturbance now however one of them spoke and said im sure sir you didnt hear me say nothing wrong to the young gent and so on in a whining tone till tom cut him short by saying that if he had any more nonsense among them he would send em all three over to captain desborough to the tune of fifty lashes apiece after this little emeute charles did not dare to go into the huts and soon after these three men were exchanged but there remained one man whose conversation and teaching though not perhaps so openly outrageously villanous as that of the worthy harvey still had a very unfortunate effect on his character this was a rather small wiry active man by name jackson a native colonially convicted very clever among horses a capital lightweight boxer and in running superb a pupil and protege of the immortal flying pieman may his shadow never be less a capital cricketer and a supreme humbug this man by his various accomplishments and great tact had won a high place in tom troubridges estimation and was put in a place of trust among the horses consequently having continual access to charles to whom he made himself highly agreeable as being heir to the property giving him such insights into the worst side of sporting life and such truthful accounts of low life in sydney as would have gone far to corrupt a lad of far stronger moral principle than he and so between this teaching of evil and neglect of good mary hawkers boy did not grow up all that might be desired and at seventeen i am sorry to say he got into a most disreputable connexion with a highland girl at one of the donovans outstation huts which caused his kindly guardian tom troubridge a great deal of vexation and his mother the deepest grief which was much increased at the same time by something i will relate in the next chapter so sixteen years rolled peacefully away chequered by such trifling lights and shadows as i have spoken of the new generation the children of those whom we knew at first are now ready to take their places and bear themselves with more or less credit in what may be going on and now comes a period which in the memory of all those whom i have introduced to you ranks as the most important of their lives to me looking back upon nearly sixty years of memory the events which are coming stand out from the rest of my quiet life well defined and remarkable above all others as looking on our western moors one sees the long straight skyline broken only once in many miles by some fantastic tor chapter xxiv in which mary hawker loses one of her oldest sweethearts sixteen years of peace and plenty had rolled over the heads of james stockbridge and myself and we had grown to be rich our agent used to rub his hands and bow whenever our high mightinesses visited town there was money in the bank there was claret in the cellar there were racehorses in the paddock in short we were wealthy prosperous menjames a magistrate november set in burning hot and by the tenth the grass was as dry as stubble still we hoped for a thunderstorm and a few days rain but none came december wore wearily on and by christmas the smaller creeks except those which were snowfed were reduced to a few muddy pools and vast quantities of cattle were congregated within easy reach of the river from other peoples runs miles away of course feed began to get very scarce yet we were hardly so bad off yet as our neighbours for we had just parted with every beast we could spare at high prices to port phillip and were only waiting for the first rains to start after store cattle which were somewhat hard to get near the new colony no rain yet and we were in the end of january the fountains of heaven were dried up but now all round the northern horizon the bush fires burn continually a pillar of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night nearer night by night like an enemy creeping up to a beleaguered town the weather had been very still for some time and we took precaution to burn great strips of grass all round the paddocks to the north but in spite of all our precautions i knew that should a strong wind come on from that quarter nothing short of a miracle would save us but as yet the weather was very still not very bright but rather cloudy and a dense haze of smoke was over everything making the distances look ten times as far as they really were and rendering the whole landscape as grey and melancholy as you can conceive there was nothing much to be done but to sit in the verandah drinking claretandwater and watching and hoping for a thunderstorm on the third of february the heat was worse than ever but no wind and as the sun went down among the lurid smoke red as blood i thought i made out a few brushshaped white clouds rising in the north jim and i sat there late not talking much we knew that if we were to be burnt out our loss would be very heavy but we thanked god that even were we to lose everything it would not be irreparable and that we should still be wealthy our brood mares and racing stock were our greatest anxiety we had a good stack of hay by which we might keep them alive for another month supposing all the grass was burnt but if we lost that our horses would probably die i said at last jim we may make up our minds to have the run swept the fire is burning up now yes it is brightening said he but it must be twenty miles off still and if it comes down with a gentle wind we shall save the paddocks and hay there is a good deal of grass in the lower paddock i am glad we had the forethought not to feed it down well fire or no fire i shall go to bed we went to bed and in spite of anxiety mosquitoes and heat i feel asleep in the grey morning i was awakened nearly suffocated by a dull continuous roar it was the wind in the chimney the north wind so long imprisoned had broke loose and the boughs were crashing and the trees were falling before the majesty of his wrath i ran out and met james in the verandah its all up i said get the women and children into the river and let the men go up to windward with the sheepskins note sheepskins on sticks used for beating out the fire when in short grass ill get on horseback and go out and see how the morgans get on that obstinate fellow will wish he had come in now morgan was a stockman of ours who lived with a wife and two children about eight miles to the northward we always thought it would have been better for him to move in but he had put it off and now the fire had taken us by surprise i rode away deadup wind our station had a few large trees about it and then all was clear plain and short grass for two miles after that came scrubby ranges in an open glade of which the morgans hut stood i feared from the density of the smoke that the fire had reached them already but i thought it my duty to go and see for i might meet them fleeing and help them with the children i had seen many bushfires but never such a one as this the wind was blowing a hurricane and when i had ridden about two miles into scrub high enough to brush my horses belly i began to get frightened still i persevered against hope the heat grew more fearful every moment but i reflected that i had often ridden up close to a bushfire turned when i began to see the flame through the smoke and cantered away from it easily then it struck me that i had never yet seen a bushfire in such a hurricane as this then i remembered stories of men riding for their lives and others of burnt horses and men found in the bush and now i saw a sight which made me turn in good earnest i was in lofty timber and as i paused i heard the mighty cracking of fire coming through the wood at the same instant the blinding smoke burst into a million tongues of flackering flame and i saw the firenot where i had ever seen it beforenot creeping along among the scrubbut up aloft a hundred and fifty feet overhead it had caught the dry bituminous tops of the higher boughs and was flying along from treetop to treetop like lightning below the wind was comparatively moderate but up there it was travelling twenty miles an hour i saw one tree ignite like guncotton and then my heart grew small and i turned and fled i rode as i never rode before there were three miles to go ere i cleared the forest and got among the short grass where i could save myselfthree miles ten minutes nearly of intolerable heat blinding smoke and mortal terror any death but this drowning were pleasant glorious to sink down into the cool sparkling water but to be burnt alive fool that i was to venture so far i would give all my money now to be naked and penniless rolling about in a cool pleasant river the maddened terrified horse went like the wind but not like the hurricanethat was too swift for us the fire had outstripped us overhead and i could see it dimly through the infernal choking reek leaping and blazing a hundred yards before me among the feathery foliage devouring it as the south wind devours the thunder clouds then i could see nothing was i clear of the forest thank the lord yesi was riding over grass i managed to pull up the horse and as i did so a mob of kangaroos blundered by blinded almost against me noticing me no more in their terror than if i had been a stump or a stone soon the fire came hissing along through the grass scarcely six inches high and i walked my horse through it then i tumbled off on the blackened ground and felt as if i should die i lay there on the hot black ground my head felt like a block of stone and my neck was stiff so that i could not move my head my throat was swelled and dry as a sandhill and there was a roaring in my ears like a cataract i thought of the cool waterfalls among the rocks far away in devon i thought of everything that was cold and pleasant and then came into my head about dives praying for a drop of water i tried to get up but could not so lay down again with my head upon my arm it grew cooler and the atmosphere was clearer i got up and mounting my horse turned homeward now i began to think about the station could it have escaped impossible the fire would fly a hundred yards or more such a day as this even in low plain no it must be gone there was a great roll in the plain between me and home so that i could see nothing of our placeall around the country was black without a trace of vegetation behind me were the smoking ruins of the forest i had escaped from where now the burntout trees began to thunder down rapidly and before to the south i could see the fire raging miles away so the station is burnt then no for as i top the ridge there it is before me standing as of olda bright oasis in the desert of burnt country round ay the very haystack is safe and the paddocksall rightglory be to god i got home and james came running to meet me i was getting terribly frightened old man said he i thought you were caught lord save us you look ten years older than you did this morning i tried to answer but could not speak for drought he ran and got me a great tumbler of claretandwater and in the evening having drunk about an imperial gallon of water and taken afterwards some claret i felt pretty well revived men were sent out at once to see after the morgans and found them perfectly safe but very much frightened they had however saved their hut for the fire had passed before the wind had got to its full strength so we were delivered from the fire but still no rain all day for the next month the hot north wind would blow till five oclock and then a cool southerly breeze would come up and revive us but still the heavens were dry and our cattle died by hundreds on the eighteenth of march we sat in the verandah looking still over the blackened unlovely prospect but now cheerfully and with hope for the eastern sky was piled up range beyond range with the scarlet and purple splendour of cloudland and as darkness gathered we saw the lightning not twinkling and glimmering harmlessly about the horizon as it had been all the summer but falling sheer in violetcoloured rivers behind the dark curtain of rain that hung from the black edge of a teeming thundercloud we had asked our overseer in that night being saturday to drink with us he sat very still and talked but little as was his wont i slapped him on the back and said do you remember geordie that muff in thalaba who chose the wrong cloud he should have got you or me to choose for him we wouldnt have made a mistake i know we would have chosen such a one as yon glorious bigbellied fellow see how grandly he comes growling up its just come said he without the praying for when the fire came owre the hill the other day i just put up a bit prayer to the lord that hed spare the haystack and he spared it i didna stop working ye ken i worked the harder if ye dinna mean to work ye should na pray but i never prayed for raini didna ye see like to ask the lord to upset all his gran laws of electricity and evaporation just because it would suit us i thocht hed likely ken better than mysel hech sirs but that chiels riding hard a horseman appeared making for the station at full speed when he was quite close jim called out by jove it is doctor mulhaus and we ran out into the yard to meet him before any one had time to speak he shouted out my dear boys im so glad i am in time we are going to see one of the grandest electrical disturbances it has ever been my lot to witness i reined up just now to look and i calculated that the southern point of explosion alone is discharging nine times in the minute how is your barometer havent looked doctor careless fellow he replied you dont deserve to have one never mind sir we have got you safe and snug out of the thunderstorm it is going to be very heavy i think i only hope we will have plenty of rain not much doubt of it said he now come into the verandah and let us watch the storm we went and sat there the highest peaks of the great cloud alps lately brilliant red were now cold silver grey harshly defined against a faint crimson background and we began to hear the thunder rolling and muttering all else was deadly still and heavy mark the lightning said the doctor that which is before the rainwall is white and that behind violetcoloured here comes the thundergust a fierce blast of wind came hurrying on carrying a cloud of dust and leaves before it it shook the four corners of the house and passed away and now it was a fearful sight to see the rainspouts pouring from the black edge of the lower cloud as from a pitcher nearly overhead and lit up by a continuous blaze of lightning another blast of wind now a few drops and in ten minutes you could barely distinguish the thunder above the rattle of the rain on the shingles it warred and banged around us for an hour so that we could hardly hear one another speak at length the doctor bawled we shall have a crack closer than any yet youll see we always have one particular oneour atmosphere is not restored to its balance yetthere the curtains were drawn and yet for an instant the room was as bright as day simultaneously there came a crack and an explosion so loud and terrifying that used as i was to such an event i involuntarily jumped up from my seat are you all right here said the doctor and running out into the kitchen shouted any one hurt the kitchen girl said that the lightning had run all down her back like cold water and the housekeeper averred that she thought the thunder had taken the roof of the house off so we soon perceived that nothing was the matter and sat down again to our discourse and our supper well began i heres the rain come at last in a fortnight there will be good grass again we ought to start and get some store cattle but where replied james we shall have to go a long way for them everyone will be wanting the same thing now we must push a long way north and make a depot somewhere westward then we can pick them up by sixes and sevens at a time when shall we go the sooner the better i think i will come with you said the doctor i have not been a journey for some time your conversation sir i said will shorten the journey by onehalfwhich was sincerely said away we went northward with the mountains on our left leaving snowstreaked kosciusko nearly behind us till a great pass through the granite walls opened to the westward up which we turned mount murray towering up the south soon we were on the murrumbidgee sweeping from side to side of his mountain valley in broad curves sometimes rushing hoarse swollen by the late rains under belts of high timber and sometimes dividing broad meadows of rich grass growing green once more under the invigorating hand of autumn all nature had awakened from her deep summer sleep the air was brisk and nimble and seldom did three happier men ride on their way than james the doctor and i good doctor how he beguiled the way with his learningin ecstasies all the time enjoying everything animate or inanimate as you or i would enjoy a new play or a new opera how i envied him he was like a man always reading a new and pleasant book at first the stockmen rode behind talking about beasts and horses and what notoften talking about nothing at all but riding along utterly without thought if such a thing could be but soon i noticed they would draw up closer and regard the doctor with some sort of attention till toward the evening of the second day one of them our old acquaintance dick asked the doctor a question as to why if i remember right certain trees should grow in certain localities and there only the doctor reined up alongside him directly and in plain forcible language explained the matter how that some plants required more of one sort of substance than another and how they get it out of particular soils and how in the lapse of years they had come to thrive best on the soil that suited them and had got stunted and died out in other parts see said he how the turkey holds to the plains and the pheasant lyrebird to the scrub because each one finds its food there trees cannot move but by time and by positively refusing to grow on unkindly soils they arrange themselves in the localities which suit them best so after this they rode with the doctor always both hearing him and asking him questions and at last won by his blunt kindliness they grew to like and respect him in their way even as we did so we fared on through bad weather and rough country enjoying a journey which but for him would have been a mere trial of patience northward ever through forest and plain over mountain and swamp across sandstone limestone granite and rich volcanic land each marked distinctly by a varying vegetation sometimes we would camp out but oftener managed to reach a station at night we got well across the dry country between the murrumbidgee and the lachlan now abounding with pools of water and having crossed the latter river held on our course toward crokers range which we skirted and after having been about a fortnight out arrived at the lowest station on the macquarrie late in the afternoon this was our present destination the owner was a friend of ours who gave us a hearty welcome and on our inquiries as to store cattle thought that we might pick up a good mob of them from one station or another we might said he make a depot for them as we collected them on some unoccupied land down the river it was poor country but there was grass enough to keep them alive he would show us a good place in a fork where it was impossible to cross on two sides and where they would be easily kept together that was if we liked to risk it risk what we asked blacks said he they are mortal troublesome just now down the river i thought we had quieted them but they have been up to their old games lately spearing cattle and so on i dont like in fact to go too far down there alone i dont think they are macquarrie blacks i fancy they must have come up from the darling through the marshes we thought we should have no reason to be afraid with such a strong party as ours and owen our host having some spare cattle we were employed for the next three days in getting them in we got nearly a hundred head from him the first morning we got there the doctor had vanished but the third evening as we were sitting down to supper in he came dead beat with a great bag full of stones when we had drawn round the fire i said have you got any new fossils for us to see not one said he only some minerals do not you think sir said owen our host that there are some ores of metals round this country the reason i ask you is we so often pick up curiouscoloured stones like those we get from the miners at home in wales where i come from i think you will find some rich mines near here soon stay it can do you no harm i will tell you something three days ago i followed up the river and about twenty miles above this spot i became attracted by the conformation of the country and remarked it as being very similar to some very famous spots in south america here i said to myself maximilian you have your volcanic disturbance your granite your clay slate and sandstone upheaved and seamed with quartzwhy should you not discover here what is certainly here more or lessi looked patiently for two days and i will show you what i found he went to his bag and fetched an angular stone about as big as ones fist it was white stained on one side with rustcolour but in the heart veined with a bright yellow metallic substance in some places running in delicate veins into the stone in others breaking out in large shining lumps thats ironpyrites said i as pat as you please goose said the doctor look again i looked again it was certainly different to ironpyrites it was brighter it ran in veins into the stone it was lumpy solid and clean i said it is very beautiful tell us what it is gold said he triumphantly getting up and walking about the room in an excited way that little stone is worth a pound there is a quarter of an ounce in it give me ten tons only ten cartloads such stone as that and i would buy a principality every one crowded round the stone openmouthed and james said are you sure it is gold doctor he asks me if i know gold when i see itme you understand who have scientifically examined all the best mines in peru not to mention the minas geraes in the brazils my dear fellow to a man who has once seen it native gold is unmistakeable utterly so there is nothing at all like it but this is a remarkable discovery sir said owen what are you going to do i shall go to the government said he and make the best bargain i can i had better mention here that he afterwards did go to the government and announce his discovery rather to the doctors disgust however though he acknowledged the wisdom of the thing the courteous and able gentleman who then represented his majesty informed him that he was perfectly aware of the existence of gold but that he for one should assert the prerogative of the crown and prevent any one mining on crownlands as he considered that were the gold abundant the effects on the convict population would be eminently disastrous to which obvious piece of good sense the doctor bowed his head and the whole thing passed into oblivionso much so that when i heard of hargreaves discovery in i had nearly forgotten the doctors gold adventure and i may here state my belief that the knowledge of its existence was confined to very few and those welleducated men who never guessed how could they without considerable workings how abundant it was as for the stories of shepherds finding gold and selling it to the jews in sydney they are very mythical and i for one entirely disbelieve them in time we had collected about head of cattle from various points into the fork of the river which lay further down some seven miles than his house as yet we had not been troubled by the blackfellows those we had seen seemed pretty civil and we had not allowed them to get familiar but this pleasant state of things was not to last james and the doctor with one man were away for the very last mob and i was sitting before the fire at the camp when dick who was left behind with me asked for my gun to go and shoot a duck i lent it him and away he went while i mounted my horse and rode slowly about heading back such of the cattle as appeared to be wandering too far i heard a shot and almost immediately another then i heard a queer sort of scream which puzzled me extremely i grew frightened and rode towards the quarter where the shots came from and almost immediately heard a loud call i replied and then i saw dick limping along through the bushes peering about him and holding his gun as one does when expecting a bird to rise suddenly he raised his gun and fired out dashed a black fellow from his hiding place running across the open and with his second barrel dick rolled him over then i saw halfadozen others rise shaking their spears but seeing me riding up and supposing i was armed they made off how did this come about dick my lad said i this is a bad job well he said i just fired at a duck and the moment my gun was gone off up jumped halfadozen of them and sent a shower of spears at me and one has gone into my leg they must a thought that i had a singlebarrel gun and waited till id fired it but they found their mistake the devils for i gave one of them a charge of shot in his stomach at twenty yards and dropped him they threw a couple more spears but both missed and i hobbled out as well as i could loading as i went with a couple of tallow cartridges i saw this other beast skulking and missed him first time but he has got something to remember me by now do you think you can ride to the station and get some help said i i wish the others were back yes he replied i will manage it but i dont like to leave you alone one must stay i said and better the sound man than the wounded one come start off and let me get to the camp or they will be plundering that next i started him off and ran back to the camp everything was safe as yet and the ground round being clear and having a doublebarrel gun and two pistols i was not so very much frightened it is no use to say i was perfectly comfortable because i wasnt a frenchman writing this would represent himself as smoking a cigar and singing with the greatest nonchalance i did neither being an englishman i may be allowed to confess that i did not like it i had fully made up my mind to fire on the first black who showed himself but i did not get the opportunity in about two hours i heard a noise of men shouting and whips cracking and the doctor and james rode up with a fresh lot of cattle i told them what had happened and we agreed to wait and watch till news should come from the station and then to start there was as we thought but little danger while there were four or five together but the worst of it was that we were but poorly armed however at nightfall owen and one of his men came down reporting that dick who had been speared was getting all right and bringing also three swords and a brace of pistols james and i took a couple of swords and began fencing in play i see said the doctor that you know the use of a sword you two lord bless you i said we were in the yeomanry landwehr you call it werent we jim i was a corporal i wish said owen that now we are together five of us you would come and give these fellows a lesson they want it badly indeed i said i think they have had lesson enough for the present dick has put down two of them beside we could not leave the cattle i am sorry said james that any of our party has had this collision with them i cannot bear shooting the poor brutes let us move out of this homeward tomorrow morning just before dark who should come riding down from the station but dickevidently in pain but making believe that he was quite comfortable why dick my boy i said i thought you were in bed you ought to be at any rate oh theres nothing much the matter with me mr hamlyn he said you will have some trouble with these fellows unless i am mistaken i was told to look after you once and i mean to do it he referred to the letter that lee had sent him years before that night owen stayed with us at the camp we set a watch and he took the morning spell everything passed off quietly but when we came to examine our cattle in the morning the lot that james had brought in the night before were gone the river flooded when we first came had now lowered considerably so that the cattle could cross if they really tried these last being wild and restless had gone over and we soon found the marks of them across the river the doctor james dick and i started off after them having armed ourselves for security we took a sword apiece and each had a pistol the ground was moist and the beasts easily tracked so we thought an easy job was before us but we soon changed our minds following on the trail of the cattle we very soon came on the footsteps of a black fellow evidently more recent than the hoofmarks then another footstep joined in and another and at last we made out that above a dozen blacks were tracking our cattle and were between us and them still we followed the trail as fast as we could i was uneasy for we were insufficiently armed but i found time to point out to the doctor what he had never remarked before the wonderful difference between the naked footprint of a white man and a savage the white man leaves the impression of his whole sole every toe being distinctly marked while your black fellow leaves scarce any toemarks but seems merely to spurn the ground with the ball of his foot i felt very ill at ease the morning was raw and a dense fog was over everything one always feels wretched on such a morning but on that one i felt miserable there was an indefinable horror over me and i talked more than any one glad to hear the sound of my own voice once the doctor turned round and looked at me fixedly from under his dark eyebrows hamlyn he said i dont think you are well you talk fast and are evidently nervous we are in no danger i think but you seem as if you were frightened so i am doctor but i dont know what at jim was riding first and he turned and said i have lost the black fellows track entirely here are the hoofmarks safe enough but no footprints and the ground seems to be rising the fog was very thick so that we could see nothing above a hundred yards from us we had come through forest all the way and were wet with pushing through low shrubs as we paused came a puff of air and in five minutes the fog had rolled away and a clear blue sky and a bright sun were overhead now we could see where we were we were in the lower end of a precipitous mountaingully narrow where we were and growing rapidly narrower as we advanced in the fog we had followed the cattletrack right into it passing unobserved two great heaps of tumbled rocks which walled the glen they were thickly fringed with scrub and it immediately struck me that they stood just in the place where we had lost the tracks of the black fellows i should have mentioned this but at this moment james caught sight of the lost cattle and galloped off after them we followed and very quickly we had headed them down the glen and were posting homeward as hard as we could go i remember well there was a young bull among them that took the lead as he came nearly opposite the two piles of rock which i have mentioned i saw a black fellow leap on a boulder and send a spear into him he headed back and the other beasts came against him before we could pull up we were against the cattle and then all was confusion and disaster two hundred black fellows were on us at once shouting like devils and sending down their spears upon us like rain i heard the doctors voice above all the infernal din crying viva swords my boys take your swords i heard two pistol shots and then with deadly wrath in my heart i charged at a crowd of them who were huddled together throwing their spears wildly and laid about me with my cutlass like a madman i saw them scrambling up over the rocks in wild confusion then i heard the doctor calling me to come on he had reined up and a few of the discomfited savages were throwing spears at him from a long distance when he saw me turn to come he turned also and rode after james who was two hundred yards ahead reeling in his saddle like a drunken man grinding his teeth and making fierce clutches at a spear which was buried deep in his side and which at last he succeeded in tearing out he went a few yards further and then fell off his horse on the ground we were both off in a moment but when i got his head on my lap i saw he was dying the doctor looked at the wound and shook his head i took his right hand in mine and the other i held upon his true and faithful heart until i felt it flutter and stop for ever then i broke down altogether oh good old friend oh dear old friend could you not wait for me shall i never see you again yes i think that i shall see him again when i have crossed the dark river which we must all cross i think he will be one of those who come down to meet me from the gates of the everlasting city a man said the doctor to me two days after when we were sitting together in the station parlour who approached as nearly the model which our great master has left us as any man i know i studied and admired him for many years and now i cannot tell you not to mourn i can give you no comfort for the loss of such a man save it be to say that you and i may hope to meet him again and learn new lessons from him in a better place than this chapter xxv in which the new dean of b makes his appearance and astonishes the major out of his propriety one evening towards the end of that winter mrs buckley and sam sat alone before the fire in the quicklygathering darkness the candles were yet unlighted but the cheerful flickering light produced by the combustion of three or four logs of sheoak topped by one of dead gum shone most pleasantly on the wellordered diningroom on the closedrawn curtains on the nicelypolished furniture on the dinnertable laid with fair array of white linen silver and glass but above all on the honest quiet face of sam who sat before his mother in an easy chair with his head back fast asleep while she is alternately casting glances of pride and affection towards her sleeping son and keen looks on the gum log in search of centipedes let us take a look at her ourselves and see how sixteen years have behaved to that handsome face there is change here but no deterioration it is a little rounder perhaps and also a little fuller in colour but there are no lines there yet happiness and ceaseless good temper dont make many wrinkles even in a warmer climate than old england says the major and says also confidentially to brentwood put a red camelia in her hair and send her to the opera even now and see what a sensation she would make though she is nearer fifty than fortywhich was strictly true although said by her husband for the raven hair is as black as it was when decorated with the mossroses of clere and the eye is as brilliant as when it flashed with the news of trafalgar now the beautiful profile is turned again towards the sleeper as he moves poor boy she said he is quite knocked up he must have been twentyfour hours in the saddle however he had better be after cattle than in a billiardroom i wonder if his father will be home tonight suddenly sam awoke heigho said he im nice company mother have i been asleep only for an hour or so my boy said she see ive been defending you while you slumbered i have killed three centipedes which came out of that old gum log i cut this big one in half with the fireshovel and the head part walked away as if nothing had happened i must tell the man not to give us rotten wood or some of us will be getting a nip its a long fifty miles from captain brentwoods said mrs buckley after a time and thats a very good days work for little bronsewing carrying your father and what has been the news since i have been awayeh mother why the greatest news is that the donovans have sold their station and are off to port phillip all the world is moving there said sam who has he sold it to that i cant find outtheres your father my love there was the noise of horses feet and merry voices in the little gravelled yard behind the house heard above a joyous barking of dogs sam ran out to hold his fathers horse and soon came into the room again accompanied by his father and captain brentwood after the first greetings were over candles were lighted and the three men stood on the hearthrug togethera very remarkable group as you would have said had you seen them you might go a long while in any country without seeing three such men in company captain brentwood of artillery renown was a square powerfully built man say fivefootten in height his face at first sight appeared rather a stupid one beside the majors expressing rather determination than intelligence but once engage him in a conversation which interested him and you would be surprised to see how animated it could become then the man usually so silent would open up the storehouse of his mind speaking with an eloquence and a force which would surprise one who did not know him and which made the doctor often take the losing side of an argument for the purpose of making him speak add to this that he was a thoroughly amiable man and as jim would tell you in spite of a certain severe whipping you wot of a most indulgent and excellent father major buckleys shadow had grown no lessnay rather greater since first we knew him in other respects very little alteration except that his curling brown hair had grown thinner about the temples and was receding a little from his forehead but what cared he for that he was not the last of the buckleys one remarks now as the two stand together that sam though but nineteen is very nearly as tall as his father and promises to be as broad across the shoulders some day being an exception to coloniallybred men in general who are long and narrow he is standing and talking to his father well sam said the major so youre back safeeh my boy a rough time i dont doubt strange storecattle are queer to drive at any time particularly such weather as you have had and such a lot too said sam tell you what father its lucky youve got them cheap for the half of them are off the ranges scrubbers eh said the major well we must take what we can catch with this port phillip rush lets sit down to dinner ive got some news that will please you fish eh see there brentwood what do you think of that for a blackfish what was his weight my dear seven pounds and a half as the black fellows brought him in said mrs buckley a very pretty fish said the major my dear what is the news why the donovans have sold their station ha ha laughed the major why we have come from there today why we were there last night at a grand party all the irishmen in the country side such a turmoil i havent seen since i was quartered at cove so thats your newseh and so you stepped on there without calling at home did you said mrs buckley and perhaps you know who the purchaser is dont you know my love no indeed said mrs buckley i have been trying to find out these two days it would be very pleasant to have a good neighbour therenot that i wish to speak evil of the donovans but really they did go on in such terrible style you know that one could not go there now tell me who has bought garoopna one brentwood captain of artillery nonsense said mrs buckley is he not joking now captain brentwood that is far too good news to be true it is true nevertheless madam said captain brentwood i thought it would meet with your approval and i can see by sams face that it meets with his you see my dear lady buckley has got to be rather necessary to me i miss him when he is absent and i want to be more with him again i am very fond of my son jim and my son jim is very fond of your son sam and is always coming here after him when he ought to be at home so i think i shall see more of him when we are ten miles apart than when we are fifty and once more my daughter alice now completing her education in sydney comes home to keep house for me in a few months and i wish her to have the advantage of the society of the lady whom i honour and respect above all others so i have bought garoopna if that courtly bow is intended for me my dear captain said mrs buckley as i cannot but think it is believe me that your daughter shall be as my daughter teach her to be in some slight degree like yourself mrs buckley said the captain and you will put me under obligations which i can never repay altogether wife said the major it is the most glorious arrangement that ever was come to let us take a glass of sherry all round on it sam my lad your hand brentwood we have none of us ever seen your daughter she should be handsome you remember her mother said the captain who could ever forget lady kate who had once seen her said the major well alice is more beautiful than her mother ever was there went across the table a bright electric spark out of mrs buckleys eye into her husbands as rapid as those which move the quivering telegraph needles and yet not unobserved i think by captain brentwood for there grew upon his face a pleasant smile which rapidly broadening ended in a low laugh by no means disagreeable to hear though sam wondered what the joke could be until the captain said an altogether comical party that last night at the donovans buckley the most comical i ever was at nevertheless i dont believe that it was that which made him laugh at all a capital party said the major laughing do you know brentwood i always liked those donovans under the rose and last night i liked them better than ever they were not such very bad neighbours although old donovan wanted to fight a duel with me once at all events the welcome i got last night will make me remember them kindly in future i must go down and call there before they go said mrs buckley people who have been our neighbours so many years must not go away without a kind farewell was desborough there indeed he was dont you know he is related to the donovans impossible fact my dear i assure you according to mrs donovan who told me that the de novans and the desboroughs were cognate norman families who settled in ireland together and have since frequently intermarried i suppose said mrs buckley laughing that desborough did not deny it not at all my dear as he said to me privately buckley never deny a relationship with a man worth forty thousand pounds the least penny though your ancestors bones should move in their graves i suppose said mrs buckley that he made himself as agreeable as usual as usual my dear he made even brentwood laugh he danced all the evening with that giddy girl lesbia burke who let slip that she remembered me at naples in when she was there with that sad old set and who consequently must be nearly as old as myself i hope you danced with her said mrs buckley indeed i did my dear and she wore a wreath of yellow chrysanthemum no other flowers being obtainable i assure you we kept the flure in splendid style they were all laughing at the idea of the major dancing when sam exclaimed good lord whats the matter my boy said the major i must cry peccavi said sam father you will never forgive me i forgot till this moment a most important message i was rather knocked up you see and went to sleep and that sent it out of my head you are forgiven my boy be it what it may i hope it is nothing very serious well it is very serious said sam as i was coming by hanging rock i rode up to the door a minute to see if cecil was at homeand mrs mayford came out and wanted me to get off and come in but i hadnt time and she said the dean is coming here tonight and hell be with you tomorrow night i expect so dont forget to tell your mother tomorrow night said mrs buckley aghast why my dear boy that is tonight what shall i do nothing at all my love said the major but make them get some supper ready he cant have expected us to wait dinner till this time i thought said captain brentwood that the dean was gone back to england so he is said the major but this is a new one the good old dean has resigned what is the new ones name said the captain i dont know said the major desborough said it was a doctor maypole and that he was very like one in appearance but you cant trust desborough you know he never remembers names i hope he may be as good a man as his predecessor i hope he may be no worse said captain brentwood but i hope in addition that he may be better able to travel and look after his outlying clergy a little more it looks like it said the major to be down as far as this before he has been three months installed mrs buckley went out to the kitchen to give orders and after that they sat for an hour or more over their wine till at length the major said we must give him up in another hour then as if they had heard him the dogs began to bark rover who had against rules sneaked into the house and lain perdu under the sofa discovered his retreat by low growling as though determined to do his duty let the consequences be what they might every now and then too when his feelings overpowered him he would discharge a woof like a minute gun at sea that must be him father said sam youll catch it mr rover he ran out a tall black figure was sitting on horseback before the door and a pleasant cheery voice said pray is this major buckleys yes sir said sam we have been expecting you he called for the groom and held the strangers horse while he dismounted then he assisted him to unstrap his valise and carried it in after him the major mrs buckley and the captain had risen and were standing ready to greet the church dignitary as he came in in the most respectful manner but when the major had looked for a moment on the tall figure in black which advanced towards the fire instead of saying sir i am highly honoured by your visit or sir i bid you most heartily welcome he dashed forward in the most undignified fashion upsetting a chair and seizing the reverend dean by both hands exclaimed god bless my heart and soul frank maberly it was he the mad curate now grown into a colonial deansobered apparently but unchanged in any material point still elastic and upright looking as if for twopence he would take off the black cutaway coat and the broadbrimmed hat and row seven in the university eight at a moments notice there seems something the matter with him though as he holds the majors two hands in his and looks on his broad handsome face something like a shortness of breath prevented his speech and strange the major seems troubled with the same complaint but frank gets over it first and says my dear old friend i am so glad to see you and mrs buckley says laying her hand upon his arm it seems as if all things were arranged to make my husband and myself the happiest couple in the world if we had been asked tonight whom of all people in the world we should have been most glad to see as the new dean we should have answered at once frank maberly and here he is then you did not know whom to expect said frank not we indeed said the major desborough said the new dean was a doctor maypole and i pictured to myself an old schoolmaster with a birch rod in his coat tailpocket and we have been in such a stew all the evening about giving the great man a proper reception ha ha ha and will you introduce me to this gentleman said the dean moving towards sam who stood behind his mother this said the major with a radiant smile is my son samuel whom i believe you have seen before so the pretty boy that i knew at drumston said the dean laying his hands on sams shoulders has grown into this noble gentleman it makes me feel old but i am glad to feel old under such circumstances let me turn your face to the light and see if i can recognise the little lad whom i used to carry pickaback across hatherleigh water sam looked in his facesuch a kindly good placid face that it seemed beautiful though by some rules it was irregular and ugly enough the dean laid his hand on sams curly head and said god bless you samuel buckley and won sams heart for ever all this time captain brentwood had stood with his back against the chimneypiece perfectly silent having banished all expression from his countenance now however major buckley brought up the dean and introduced him my dear brentwood the dean of b not dean to us though so much as our dear old friend frank maberly involved grammar said the captain to himself but added aloud a churchman of your position sir will do me an honour by using my house but the mr maberly of whom i have so often heard from my friend buckley will do me a still higher honour if he will allow me to enrol him among the number of my friends frank the dean thought that captain brentwoods speech would have made a good piece to turn into greek prose in the style of demosthenes but he didnt say so he looked at the captains stolid face for a moment and said as sam thought a little abruptly i think sir that you and i shall get on very well together when we understand one another the captain made no reply in articulate speech but laughed internally till his sides shook and held out his hand the dean laughed too as he took it and said i met a young lady at the bishops the other day a miss brentwood my daughter sir said the captain so i guessedpartly from the name and partly from a certain look about the eyes rather unmistakeable allow me to say sir that i never remember to have seen such remarkable beauty in my life they sat frank down to supper and when he had done the conversation was resumed bythebye major buckley said he i miss an old friend who i heard was living with you a very dear old friendwhere is doctor mulhaus dear doctor said mrs buckley this is his home indeed but he is away at present on an expedition with two old devon friends hamlyn and stockbridge oh said frank i have heard of those men they came out here the year before the vicar died i never knew either of them but i well remember how kindly stockbridge used to be spoken of by everyone in drumston i must make his acquaintance you will make the acquaintance of one of the finest fellows in the world dean said the major i know no worthier man than stockbridge i wish mary thornton had married him and i hear said frank that the pretty mary is your next door neighbour in partnership with that excellent giant troubridge i must go and see them tomorrow i will produce one of those great roaring laughs of his by reminding him of our first introduction at the palace through a rat i am sorry to say said the major that tom is away at port phillip with cattle port phillip again said frank i have heard of nothing else throughout my journey i am getting bored with it will you tell me what you know about it for certain well said the major it lies about miles south of this though we cannot get at it without crossing the mountains in consequence of some terribly dense scrub on some low ranges close to it which they call i believe the dandenong it appears however when you are there that there is a great harbour about forty miles long surrounded with splendid pastures which stretch west further than any man has been yet take it all in all i should say it was the best watered and most available piece of country yet discovered in new holland any good rivers asked the dean plenty of small ones only one of any size apparently which seems to rise somewhere in this direction and goes in at the head of the bay they tried years ago to form a settlement on this bay but collins the man entrusted with it could find no fresh water which seems strange as there is according to all accounts a fine fullflowing river running by the town they have formed a town there then said the dean there are a few wooden houses gone up by the river side i believe they are going to make a town there and call it melbourne we may live to see it a thriving place the major has lived to see his words fulfilledfulfilled in such marvellous sort that bald bare statistics read like the wildest romance at the time he spoke twentytwo years ago from this present year the yarra rolled its clear waters to the sea through the unbroken solitude of a primeval forest as yet unseen by the eye of a white man now there stands there a noble city with crowded wharves containing with its suburbs not less than inhabitants a thousand vessels have lain at one time side by side off the mouth of that little river and through the low sandy heads that close the great port towards the sea thirteen millions sterling of exports is carried away each year by the finest ships in the world here too are waterworks constructed at fabulous expense a service of steamships between this and the other great cities of australia vieing in speed and accommodation with the coasting steamers of great britain noble churches handsome theatres in short a great city which in its amazing rapidity of growth utterly surpasses all human experience i never stood in venice contemplating the decay of the grand palaces of her old merchant princes whose time has gone by for ever i never watched the slow downfal of a great commercial city but i have seen what to him who thinks aright is an equally grand subject of contemplationthe rapid rise of one i have seen what but a small moiety of the world even in these days has seen and what save in this generation has never been seen before and will i think never be seen again i have seen melbourne five years in succession did i visit that city and watch each year how it spread and grew until it was beyond recognition every year the press became denser and the roar of the congregated thousands grew louder till at last the scream of the flying engine rose above the hubbub of the streets and two thousand miles of electric wire began to move the clicking needles with ceaseless intelligence unromantic enough but beyond all conception wonderful i stood at the east end of bourke street not a year ago looking at the black swarming masses which thronged the broad thoroughfare below all the town lay at my feet and the sun was going down beyond the distant mountains i had just crossed from the front of the new houses of legislature and had nearly been run over by a great omnibus partly to recover my breath and partly being not used to large cities to enjoy the really fine scene before me i stood at the corner of the street in contemplative mood i felt a hand on my shoulder and looked roundit was major buckley this is a wonderful sight hamlyn said he when you think of it i said really think of it you know how wonderful it is brentwood said the major has calculated by his mathematics that the progress of the species is fortyseven decimal eight more rapid than it was thirtyfive years ago so i should be prepared to believe i said where will it all end will it be a grand universal republic think you in which war is unknown and universal prosperity has banished crime i may be too sanguine but such a state of things is possible this is a sight which makes a man look far into the future prosperity said the major has not done much towards abolishing crime in this town at all events and it would not take much to send all this back into its primeval state how so major said i i see here the cradle of a new and mighty empire two rattling good thumps of an earthquake said the major would pitch melbourne into the middle of port phillip and bury all the gold far beyond the reach even of the ballarat deepsinkers come down and dine with me at the club chapter xxvi white heathens captain brentwood went back to garoopna next morning but frank maberly kept to his resolution of going over to see mary and soon after breakfast they were all equipped ready to accompany him standing in front of the door waiting for the horses frank was remarking how handsome mrs buckley looked in her hat and habit when she turned and said to him my dear dean i suppose you never jump over fivebarred gates nowadays do you remember how you used to come over the white gate at the vicarage i suppose you are getting too dignified for any such thing there was a threerailed fence dividing the lower end of the yard from the paddock he rammed his hat on tight and took it flying with his black coattails fluttering like wings and coming back laughing said theres a bit of the old adam for you mrs buckley be careful how you defy me again the sun was bright overhead and the land in its full winter verdure as they rode along the banks of the creek that led to toonarbin frank maberly was as humorous as ever and many a merry laugh went ringing through the woodland solitudes sending the watchman cockatoo screaming aloft to alarm the flock or startling the brilliant thickclustered lories richest coloured of all parrots in the world as they hung chattering on some silverleaved acacia bending with their weight the fragile boughs down towards the clear still water lighting up the dark pool with strange bright reflections of crimson and blue startling too the feeding doekangaroo who skipped slowly away followed by her young oneso slowly that the watching travellers expected her to stop each moment and could scarcely believe she was in full flight till she topped a low ridge and disappeared that is a strange sight to a european mrs buckley said frank a real wild animal it seems so strange to me now to think that i could go and shoot that beast and account to no man for it that is you know supposing i had a gun and powder and shot and also that the kangaroo would be fool enough to wait till i was near enough which you see is presupposing a great deal are they easily approached easily enough on horseback said sam but very difficult to come near on foot which is also the case with all wild animals and birds worth shooting in this country a footman you see they all mistake for their hereditary enemy the blackfellow but as yet they have not come to distinguish a man on horseback from a fourfooted beast and this seems to show that animals have their traditions like men pray sam are not these pretty beasts these kangaroos becoming extinct on sheepruns very nearly so sheep drive them off directly but on cattleruns so far from becoming extinct they are becoming so numerous as to be a nuisance consuming a most valuable quantity of grass how can you account for that very easily said sam their enemies are all removed the settlers have poisoned in wellsettled districts the native dogs and eaglehawks which formerly kept down their numbers the blacks prefer the beef of the settlers to bad and hardearned kangaroo venison and lastly the settlers never go after them but leave them to their own inventions so that the kangaroo has better times of it than ever that is rather contrary to what one has heard though said frank but sam is right dean said the major people judge from seeing none of them on the plains from which they have been driven by the sheep but there are as many in the forest as ever the emu now said frank are they getting scarce they will soon be among the things of the past said the major and i am sorry for it for they are a beautiful and harmless bird major said frank how many outlying huts have you five said the major four shepherds huts and one stockkeepers in the range which we call the heifer station you have no church here i know said frank but do these men get any sort of religious instruction none whatever said the major i have service in my house on sunday but i cannot ask them to come to it though sometimes the stockmen do come the shepherds you know are employed on sunday as on any other day sheep must eat are any of these men convicts all the shepherds said the major the stockman and his assistant are free men but their hutkeeper is bond are any of them married two of the shepherds the rest single but i must tell you that on our run we keep up a regular circulation of books among the huts and my wife sticks them full of religious tracts which is really about all that we can do without a clergyman do you find they read your tracts mrs buckley asked frank no said mrs buckley with the exception perhaps of black giles the poacher which always comes home very dirty narrative tracts they will read when there is nothing more lively at hand but such treatises as are you ready and the sinners friend fall dead one copy lasts for years one copy of either of them said frank would last then these fellows major are entirely godless i suppose well ill tell you dean said the major stopping short its about as bad as bad can be it cant be worse sir if by any means you could make it worse it would be by sending such men round here as the one who was sent here last he served as a standing joke to the hands for a year or more and i believe he was sincere enough too i must invade some of these huts and see what is to be done said frank i have had a hard spell of work in london since old times but i have seen enough already to tell me that that work was not so hopeless as this will be i think however that there is more chance here than among the little farmers in the settled districts here at all events i shant have the rumbottle eternally standing between me and my man what a glorious independent happy set of men are those said small freeholders major what a happy exchange an english peasant makes when he leaves an old wellordered society the ordinances of religion the various giveandtake relations between rank and rank which make up the sum of english life for independence godlessness and rum he gains say you yes he gains meat for his dinner every day and voila tout contrast an english workhouse schoolboyi take the lowest class for example a class which should not existwith a small farmers son in one of the settled districts which will make the most useful citizen give me the workhouse lad oh but you are overstating the case you know dean said the major you must have a class of small farmers wherever the land is fit for cultivation it must be sold to agriculturists or otherwise in case of a war we shall be dependent on europe and america for the bread we eat i know some excellent and exemplary men who are farmers i assure you of course of course said frank i did not mean quite all i said but i am angry and disappointed i pictured to myself the labourer english scotch or irisha man whom i know and have lived with and worked for some years emigrating and after a few years of honest toil which compared to his old hard drudgery was childsplay saving money enough to buy a farm i pictured to myself this man accumulating wealth happy honest godly bringing up a family of brave boys and good girls in a country where theoretically the temptations to crime are all but removed this is what i imagined i come out here and what do i find my friend the labourer has got his farm and is prospering after a sort he has turned to be a drunken godless impudent fellow and his wife little better than himself his daughters dowdy hussies his sons lanky lean pastyfaced blaspheming blackguards drinking rum before breakfast and living by cheating one another out of horses can you deny this picture yes said the major i can disprove it by many happy instances and yet to say the truth it is fearfully true in as many more there is no social influence in the settled districts there are too many men without masters let us wait and hope this is not to the purpose at present though said mrs buckley see what you can do for us in the bush my dear dean you have a very hopeless task before you i fear the more hopeless the greater glory madam said frank taking off his hat and waving it called chosen and faithful there is a beautiful house that is toonarbin said the major and theres mary hawker in the verandah let us see said mrs buckley if she will know him if she does not recognise him let no one speak before me when they had ridden up and dismounted mrs buckley presented frank my dear said she the dean is honouring us by staying at baroona for a week and proposes to visit round at the various stations tomorrow we go to the mayfords and next day to garoopna mary bowed respectfully to frank and said that she felt highly honoured and so forth my partner is gone on a journey and my son is away on the run or they would have joined with me in bidding you welcome sir frank would have been highly honoured at making their acquaintance mary started and looked at him again mr maberly mr maberly she said your face is changed but your voice is unchangeable you are discovered sir and are you glad to see me no said mary plainly now said mrs buckley to herself she is going to give us one of her tantrums i wish she would behave like a reasonable being she is always bent on making a scene but she kept this to herself and only said aloud mary my dear mary i am sorry to hear you say so mrs hawker said frank but it is just and natural natural said mary and just you are connected in my mind with the most unhappy and most degraded period of my life can you expect that i should be glad to see you you were kind to me then as is your nature to be kind and good above all men whom i know i thought of you always with love and admiration as one whom i deeply honoured but would not care to look upon again as the one of all whom i would have forget me in my disgrace and now today of all days just when i have found the fathers vices confirmed in the son you come before me as if from the bowels of the earth to remind me of what i was mrs buckley was very much shocked and provoked by this but held her tongue magnanimously and what do you think my dear reader was the cause of all this hysteric tragic nonsense on the part of mary simply this the poor soul had been put out of temper her son charles as i mentioned before had had a scandalous liason with one meg macdonald daughter of one of the donovans now brentwoods shepherds that morning this brazen hussy as mary very properly called her had come coolly up to the station and asked for charles and on marys shaking her fist at her and bidding her be gone had then and there rated poor mary in the best of gaelic for a quarter of an hour and mary instead of venting her anger on the proper people had taken her old plan of making herself disagreeable to those who had nothing to do with it which naturally made mrs buckley very angry and even ruffled the placid major a little so that he was not sorry when he saw in his wifes face the expression of which he knew so well that mary was going to catch it i wish mary hawker said mrs buckley that you would remember that the dean is our guest and that on our account alone there is due to him some better welcome than what you have given him now you are angry with me for speaking truth too abruptly said mary crying well i am angry with you said mrs buckley if that was the truth you should not have spoken it now you have no right to receive an old friend like this you are very unkind to me said mary just when after so many years peace and quietness my troubles are beginning again you are all turning against me and so she laid down her head and wept dear mrs hawker said frank coming up and taking her hand if you are in trouble i know well that my visit is well timed where trouble and sorrow are there is my place there lies my work in prosperity my friends sometimes forget me but my hope and prayer is that when affliction and disaster come i may be with them you do not want me now but when you do god grant i may be with you remember my words she remembered them well frank made an excuse to go out and mary crying bitterly went into her bedroom when she was gone the major who had been standing by the window said my dear wife that boy of hers is aggravating her dont be too hard upon her my dear husband said mrs buckley i have no patience with her to welcome an old friend whom she has not seen for nearly twenty years in that manner it is too provoking you see my love said the major that her nerves have been very much shaken by misfortune and at times she is really not herself and i tell you what mother dear said sam charles hawker is going on very badly i tell you in the strictest confidence mind that he has not behaved in a very gentlemanlike way in one particular and if he was anyone else but who he is i should have very little to say to him well my dear husband and son said mrs buckley i will go in and make the amende to her sam go and see after the dean sam went out and saw frank across the yard playing with the dogs he was going towards him when a man entering the yard suddenly came up and spoke to him it was william leegrown older and less wildlooking since we saw him first at midnight on dartmoor but a striking person still his hair had become grizzled but that was the only sign of age he showed there was still the same vigour of motion the same expression of enormous strength about him as formerly the principal change was in his face eighteen years of honest work among people who in time finding his real value had got to treat him more as a friend than a servant had softened the old expression of reckless ferocity into one of goodhumoured independence and tom troubridge no careless observer of men had said once to major buckley that he thought his face grew each year more like what it must have been when a boy a bold flight of fancy for tom but like all else he said true such was william lee as he stopped sam in the yard and with a bold honest look of admiration said it makes me feel young to look at you mr buckley you are a great stranger here lately some young lady to run after i suppose well never mind i hope it aint miss blake a man may not marry his grandmother lee said sam laughing true for you sir said lee that was wrote up in drumston church i mind and some other things alongside of it which i could say by heart once on a timeall on black boards with yellow letters and also i remember a spick and span new board about how anthony hamlyn thats mr geoffry hamlyns father repaired and beautified this church which meant that he built a handsome new pew for himself in the chancel lord i think i see him asleep in it now but never mind that ive kept a pup of flys for you sir and got it through the distemper flys pup by rollicker you know oh thank you said sam i am really much obliged to you but you must let me know the price you know lee the dog should be a good one well mr buckley said lee i have been cosseting this little beast up in the hopes youd accept it as a present and then says i to myself when he takes a new chum out to see some sport and the dog pulls down a flying doe and the dust goes up like smoke and the dead sticks come flying about his ears he will say to his friends thats the dog lee gave me wheres his equal so dont be too proud to take a present from an old friend not i indeed lee said sam i thank you most heartily who is this long gent in black sir said lee looking towards frank who was standing and talking with the major a parson i reckon the dean of b answered sam ah sosaid leecome to give us some good advice well we want it bad enough i hope some on us may foller it seems a man too and not a monkey my father says said sam that he was formerly one of the best boxers he ever saw any further discussion of franks physical powers was cut short by his coming up to sam and saying i was thinking of riding out to one of the outlying huts to have a little conversation with the men will you come with me if you will allow me i shall be delighted beyond all measure i beg your pardon sir said lee but i understood you to say that you were going to one of our huts to give the men a discourse would you let me take you out to one of them id like well to hear what youd got to say myself sir and i promise you the lads ill show you want good advice as well as any you will do me infinite service said frank sam if you will excuse me let me ask you to stay behind i have a fancy for going up alone let me take these men in the rough and see what i can do unassisted you will be apt to find them uncivil sir said sam i am known and my presence would ensure you outward respect at all events just what i thought said frank but i want to see what i can do alone and unassisted no stay and let me storm the place singlehanded so lee and he started toward the ranges riding side by side you will find sir said lee that these men in this here hut are a rougher lot than you think for very like theyll be cheeky i would almost have wished youd a let mr buckley come hes a favourite round here you see and youd have gone in as his friend you see said frank turning confidentially to lee i am not an ordinary parson i am above the others and what i want is not so much to see what i can do myself but what sort of a reception any parson coming haphazard among these men will get that is why i left mr buckley behind do you understand me i understand you sir said lee but im afeard what are you afraid of said frank laughing why if youll excuse me sir that youll only get laughed at that all said frank laughter breaks no bones what are these men that we are going to see why one said lee is a young jimmy i beg your pardon sir an emigrant the other two are old prisoners now see here these prisoners hate the sight of a parson above all mortal men and for why because when theyre in prison all their indulgences and half their hopes of liberty depend on how far they can manage to humbug the chaplain with false piety and so when they are free again they hate him worse than any man i am an old prisoner myself and i know it have you been a prisoner then said frank surprised i was transported sir for poaching that all said frank then you were the victim of a villanous old law do you know he added laughing that i rather believe i have earned transportation myself i have a horrible schoolboy recollection of a hare who would squeak in my pocket and of a keeper passing within ten yards of where i lay hidden if that is all give me your hand lee shook his head that is what i was sent out for said he but since then there are precious few villanies i have not committed you hadnt ought to shake hands with me sir frank laid his hand kindly on his shoulder i am not a judge he said i am a priest we must talk together again now we have no time for if i mistake not there is our destination they had been riding through splendid open forest growing denser as they approached the ranges they had followed a creek all the way or nearly so and now came somewhat suddenly on a large reedy waterhole walled on all sides by dense stringy barktimber thickly undergrown with scrub behind them opened a long vista formed by the gully through which they had been approaching down which the black burnt stems of the stringy bark were agreeably relieved by the white stems of the red and blue gum growing in the moister and more open space near the creek in front of them was a slab hut of rich mahogany colour by no means an unpleasing object among the dull unbroken green of the forest in front of it was a trodden space littered with the chips of firewood a pile of the last article lay a few yards in front of the door and against the walls of the tenement was a long bench on which stood a calabash with a lump of soap and a coarse towel a lamp oven and a pair of black topboots and underneath which lay a noble cattle dog who as soon as he saw them burst out into furious barking and prepared to give battle will you take my horse for me said frank to lee while i go inside certainly sir said lee but mind the dog frank laughed and jumped off the dog was unprepared for this it was irregular the proper and usual mode of proceeding would have been for the stranger to have stayed on horseback and for him the dog to have barked himself hoarse till some one came out of the hut and pacified him by throwing billets of wood at him no conversation possible till his barking was turned into mourning he was not up to the emergency he had never seen a man clothed in black from head to foot before he probably thought it was the d his sense of duty not being strong enough to outweigh considerations of personal safety he fled round the house and being undecided whether to bark or to howl did both while frank opened the door and went in the hut was like most other bush huts consisting of one undivided apartment formed of split logs called slabs set upright in the ground the roof was of bark and the whole interior was stained by the smoke into a rich dark brown such as teniers or our own beloved cattermole would delight in you entered by a door in one of the long sides and saw that the whole of the end on your right was taken up by a large fireplace on which blazed a pile of timber round the walls were four bed places like the bunks on board ship each filled with a heap of frouzy blankets and in the centre stood a rough table surrounded by logs of wood sawn square off which served for seats the living occupants of the hut were scarcely less rude than the hut itself one of the bed places was occupied by a sleepy not badlooking young fellow clad in greasy red shirt greasy breeches and boots and whose shabby plated spurs were tangled in the dirty blankets he was lying on his back playing with a beautiful little parrot opposite him sitting up in his bunk was another young fellow with a singularly coarse repulsive countenance long yellow hair halfway down his back clothed like the other in greasy breeches this last one was puffing at a short black pipe in an affected way making far more noise than was necessary in that operation and seemed to be thinking of something insolent to say to the last speaker whoever he may have been another man was sitting on the end of the bench before the fire with his legs stretched out before it at the first glance frank saw that this was a superior person to the others he was dressed like the others in black topboots but unlike the others he was clean and neat in fact the whole man was clean and neat and had a cleanshaved face and looked respectable so far as outward appearances were concerned the fourth man was the hutkeeper a wickedlooking old villain who was baking bread frank looked at the sleepy young man with the parrot and said to himself theres a bad case he looked at the flash yellowhaired young snob who was smoking and said theres a worse he looked at the villanous greyheaded old hutkeeper and said theres a hopeless case altogether but when he looked at the dry neatlydressed man who sat in front of the fire he said that seems a more likely person there is some sense of order in him at all events see what i can do with him he stood with his towering tall black figure in the doorway the sleepy young man sat up and looked in wonder while his parrot whistled and chattered loudly the yellowhaired young man looked round to see if he could get the others to join him in a laugh the hutkeeper said oh h and attended once more to the cooking but the neatlooking man rose up and gave frank courteously good day i am a clergyman said frank come to pay you a visit if you will allow me blackhair looked as if astonishment were a new sensation to him and he was determined to have the most of it meanwhile little parrot taking advantage of his absence of mind clambers up his breast and nips off a shirtbutton which he holds in his claw pretending it is immensely good to eat hutkeeper clatters pots and pans while yellow hair lies down whistling insolently these last two seem inclined to constitute themselves his majestys opposition in the present matter while blackhair and the neat man are evidently inclined towards frank there lay a boot in front of the fire which the neat man without warning seized and hurled at yellowhair with such skill and precision that the young fellow started upright in bed and demanded with many verbs and adjectives what he meant by that ill teach you to whistle when a gentleman comes into the hutyou possumguts lie down now will you yellowhair lay down and there was no more trouble with him hutkeeper too seeing how matters were going left off clattering his pots and frank was master of the field very glad to see you sir says the neat man very seldom we get a visit from a gentleman in a black coat i assure you frank shook hands with him and thanked him and then turning suddenly upon blackhair who was sitting with his bird on his knee one leg out of his bunk and his great black vacant eyes fixed on frank said what an exceedingly beautiful bird you have got there pray what do you call it now it so happened that blackhair had been vacantly wondering to himself whether franks black coat would meet across his stomach or whether the lower buttons and buttonholes were dummies so that when frank turned suddenly upon him he was as it were caught in the fact and could only reply in a guilty whisper mountain blue will he talk asked frank whistle says blackhair still in a whisper and then clearing his throat continued in his natural tone whistle beautiful black fellows gets em young out of the dead trees ill give you this one if youve a mind frank couldnt think of it but could blackhair get him a young cockatoo and leave it with mr sam buckley for transmissionwould be exceedingly obliged yes blackhair could thinks too what a pleasant sort of chap this parson was will get him a cockatoo certainly then frank asks may he read them a bit out of the bible and neat man says they will be highly honoured and blackhair gets out of his bunk and sits listening in a decently respectful way opposition are by no means won over the old hutkeeper sits sulkily smoking and the yellowhaired man lies in his bunk with his back towards them lee had meanwhile come in and after recognitions from those inside sat quietly down close to the door frank took for a text servants obey your masters and preached them a sermon about the relations of master and servant homely plain sensible and interesting and had succeeded in awakening the whole attention and interest of the three who were listening when the door was opened and a man looked in lee was next the door and cast his eyes upon the new comer no sooner had their eyes met than he uttered a loud oath and going out with the stranger shut the door after him what can be the matter with our friend i wonder asked frank he seems much disturbed the neat man went to the door and opened it lee and the man who had opened the door were standing with their backs towards them talking earnestly lee soon came back without a word and having caught and saddled his horse rode away with the stranger who was on foot he was a large shabbilydressed man with black curly hair this was all they could see of him for his back was always towards them never saw bill take on like that before said the neat man thats one of his old pals i reckon he aint very fond of meeting any of em you see since he has been on the square the best friends in prison sir are the worst friends out were you ever in prison then said frank lord bless you said the other laughing i was lagged for forgery i will make you another visit if i can said frank i am much obliged to you for the patience with which you heard me the other ran out to get his horse for him and had it saddled in no time if you will send a parson round he said when frank was mounted i will ensure him a hearing and good bye sir and god speed you says frank but lo as he turned to ride away blackhair the sleepyheaded comes to the hutdoor looking important and says hi frank is glad of this for he likes the stupidlooking young fellow better than he fancied he would have done at first and says to himself theres the making of a man in that fellow unless i am mistaken so he turns politely to meet him and as he comes towards him remarks what a fine goodhumoured young fellow he is blackhair ranges alongside and putting his hand on the horses neck says mysteriously would you like a native companion too big to carry isnt it says frank ill tie his wings together and send him down on the ration dray says blackhair youll come round and see us again will you so frank fares back to toonarbin wondering where lee has gone but blackhair goes back into the hut and taking his parrot from the bedplace puts it on his shoulder and sits rubbing his knees before the fire yellowhair and the hutkeeper are now in loud conversation and the former is asking in a loud authoritative tone the neat man being outside whether a chap is to be hunted and badgered out of his bed by a parcel of parsons to which the hutkeeper says no by a man might as well be in barracks again yellowhair morally comforted and sustained by this opinion is proceeding to say that for his part a parson is a useless sort of animal in general who gets his living by frightening old women but that this particular parson is an unusually offensive specimen and that there is nothing in this world that he yellowhair would like better than to have him out in front of the house for five minutes and see who was best manwhen blackhair usually a taciturn peaceable fellow astonishes the pair by turning his black eyes on the other and saying with lowering eyebrows you dd humbug talk about fighting him always talking about fighting a chap when he is out of the way when you know youve no more fight in you than a bronsewing why hed kill you if you only waited for him to hit you and see here if you dont stop your jaw about him youll have to fight me and thats a little more than youre game for im thinking this last was told me by the man distinguished above as the neat man who was standing outside and heard the whole but frank arrived in due time at toonarbin and found all there much as he had left it save that mary hawker had recovered her serenity and was standing expecting him with charles by her side sam asked him where was lee and frank thinking more of other things said he had left him at the hut not thinking it worth while to mention the circumstance of his having been called outa circumstance which became of great significance hereafter for though we never found out for certain who the man was we came in the end to have strong suspicions however as i said all clouds had cleared from the toonarbin atmosphere and after a pleasant meal frank major and mrs buckley sam and charles hawker rode home to baroona under the forest arches and reached the house in the gathering twilight the boys were staying behind at the stable as the three elders entered the darkened sittingroom a figure was in one of the easy chairs by the firea figure which seemed familiar there though the major could not make out who it was until a wellknown voice said is that you buckley it was the doctor they both welcomed him warmly home and waited in the gloom for him to speak but only saw that he had bent down his head over the fire are you ill doctor said mrs buckley sound in wind and limb my dear madam but rather sad at heart we have had some very severe black fighting and we have lost a kind old friendjames stockbridge is he wounded then said mrs buckley dead dead speared in the side rolled off his horse and was gone in five minutes oh poor james cried mrs buckley he of all men the man who was their champion to think that he of all men should end in that way charles hawker rode home that night and went into the room where his mother was she was sitting sewing by the fire and looked up to welcome him home mother said he there is bad news to tell we have lost a good friend james stockbridge is killed by the blacks on the macquarrie she answered not a word but buried her face in her hands and very shortly rose and left the room when she was alone she began moaning to herself and saying some more fruit of the old cursed tree if he had never seen me he would have died at home among his old friends in a ripe honoured old age chapter xxvii the golden vineyard on a summers morning almost before the dew had left the grass on the north side of the forest or the belated opossum had gone to his nest in fact just as the east was blazing with its brightest fire sam started off for a pleasant canter through the forest to visit one of their outstation huts which lay away among the ranges and which was called from some old arrangement now fallen into disuse the heifer station there was the hut seen suddenly down a beautiful green vista in the forest the chimney smoking cheerily what a pretty contrast of colours says sam in a humour for enjoying everything dark brown hut among the green shrubs and blue smoke rising above all prettily too that smoke hangs about the foliage this still morning quite in festoons theres matt at the door a lean longlegged cleverlooking fellow rather wide at the knees with a brown complexion and not unpleasant expression of face stood before the door plaiting a cracker for his stockwhip he looked pleased when he saw sam and indeed it must be a surly fellow indeed who did not greet sams honest phiz with a smile never a dog but wagged his tail when he caught sams eye youre abroad early this morning sir said the man nothing the matter is there sir nothing said sam save that one of captain brentwoods bulls is missing and i came out to tell you to have an extra look round ill attend to it sir hi matt said sam you look uncommonly smart matt bent down his head and laughed in a rather sheepish sort of way well you see sir i was coming into the home station to see if the major could spare me for a few days what going a courting eh well ill make that all right for you who is the ladyeh why its elsy macdonald i believe elsy macdonald said sam ay yes sir i know what you mean but she aint like her sister and that was more mr charles hawkers fault than her own no elsy is good enough for me and im not very badly off and begin to fancy i would like some better sort of welcome in the evening than what a cranky old brute of a hutkeeper can give me so i think i shall bring her home i wish you well matt said sam i hope you are not going to leave us though no fear sir major buckley is too good a master for that well ill get the hut coopered up a bit for you and you shall be as comfortable as circumstances will permit good morning good morning sir i hope i may see you happily married yourself some of these days sam laughed that would be a fine joke he thought but why shouldnt it be eh i suppose it must come some time or another i shall begin to look out i dont expect i shall be very easily suited heigh ho i expect however mr sam that you are just in the state of mind to fall headlong in love with the first girl you meet with a nose on her face let us hope therefore that she may be eligible but here is home again and here is the father standing majestic and broad in the verandah and the mother with her arm round his neck both waiting to give him a hearty mornings welcome and there is doctor mulhaus kneeling in spectacles before his new grevillea victoria the first bud of which is just bursting into life and the dogs catch sight of him and dash forward barking joyfully and as the ready groom takes his horse and the fat housekeeper looks out all smiles and retreats to send in breakfast sam thinks to himself that he could not leave his home and people not for the best wife in broad australia but then you see he knew no better what makes my boy look so happy this morning asked his mother has the bay mare foaled or have you negotiated james brentwoods young dog tell us that we may participate none of these things have happened mother but i feel in rather a holiday humour and im thinking of going down to garoopna this morning and spending a day or two with jim i will throw a shoe after you for luck said his mother see the doctor is calling you sam went to the doctor who was intent on his flower look here my boy here is something new the handsomest of the grevilleas as i live it has opened since i was here ah said sam this is the one that came from the quartz ranges last year is it not it has not flowered with you before if linnaeus wept and prayed over the first piece of english furze which he saw said the doctor what everlasting smellingbottle hysterics he would have gone into in this country i dont sympathise with his tears much though myself though a new flower is a source of the greatest pleasure to me and so you are going to garoopna sam said his father at breakfast have you heard my dear when the young lady is to come home next month i understand my dear said mrs buckley when she does come i shall go over and make her a visit what is her name bythebye asked the doctor alice so behold sam starting for his visit the very brummel of bushdandies hunt might have made his wellfitting cord breeches hoby might have made those black topboots and chifney might have worn them before royalty and not been shamed it is too hot for coat or waistcoat so he wears his snowwhite shirt topped by a blue birdseyehandkerchief and keeps his coat in his valise to be used as occasion shall require his costume is completed with a cabbagetree hat neither too new nor too old light shady well ventilated and three pounds ten the production after months of labour of a private in her majestys fortieth regiment of foot not with long streaming ribands down his back like a pitt street bully but with short and modest ones as became a gentlemanaltogether as fine a looking young fellow as well dressed and as well mounted too as you will find on the country side let me say a word about his horse too horse widderin none ever knew what that horse had cost sam the major even had a delicacy about asking i can only discover by inquiry that at one time about a year before this there came to the majors a traveller an irishman by nation who bored them all by talking about a certain highflyer colt which had been dropped to a happy proprietor by his mare larkspur among the shoalhaven gullies described by him as a colt the like of which was never seen before as indeed he should be for his sire highflyer as all the world knows was bought up by a great hunterriver horsebreeder from the duke of c while his dam larkspur had for grandsire the great bombshell himself what more would you have than that unless you would like to drive veno in your dogcart however it so happened that soon after the irishmans visit sam went away on a journey and came back riding a new horse which when the major saw he whistled but discreetly said nothing a very large colt it was with a neck like a rainbow set into a splendid shoulder and a marvellous way of throwing his legs outvery dark chestnut in colour almost black with longish ears and an eye so full honest and impudent that it made you laugh in his face widderin sam said was his name price and history being suppressed called after mount widderin to the northward there whose loftiest sublime summit bends over like a horses neck with two peaked crags for ears and the major comes somehow to connect this horse with the highflyer colt mentioned by our irish friend and observes that sam takes to wearing his old clothes for a twelvemonth and never seems to have any ready money we shall see some day whether or no this horse will carry sam ten miles if required on such direful emergency too as falls to the lot of few men however this is all to come now in holiday clothes and in holiday mind the two noble animals cross the paddock and so down by the fence towards the river towards the old gravel ford you may remember years ago here is the old flood spouting and streaming as of yore through the basalt pillars there stand the three fern trees too above the dark scrub on the island now up the rock bank and away across the breezy plains due north brushing through the long grass tussocks he goes his way singing his dog rover careering joyously before him the horse is clearly for a gallop but it is too hot today the tall flattopped volcanic hill which hung before him like a grey faint cloud when he started now rears its fluted columns overhead and now is getting dim again behind him but ere noon is high he once more hears the brawling river beneath his feet and garoopna is before him on the opposite bank the river as it left major buckleys at baroona made a sudden bend to the west a great arc including with its minor windings nearly twentyfive miles over the chord of which arc sam had now been riding making from point to point ten miles or thereabouts the mayfords station also lay to the left of him being on the curved side of the arc about five miles from baroona the reader may if he please remember this garoopna was an exceedingly pretty station in fact one of the most beautiful i have ever seen it stood at a point where the vast forests which surround the mountains in a belt from ten to twenty miles broad run down into the plains and touch the river as at baroona the stream runs in through a deep cleft in the table land which here though precipitous on the eastern bank on the western breaks away into a small natural amphitheatre bordered by fine hanging woods just in advance of which about two hundred yards from the river stood the house a long low building densely covered with creepers of all sorts and fronted by a beautiful garden right and left of it were the woolsheds sheepyards stockyards mens huts etc giving it almost the appearance of a little village and behind the wooded ranges begin to rise in some places broken beautifully by sheer scarps of grey rock the forest crosses the river a little way so sam gradually descending from the plains to cross went the last quarter of a mile through a shady sandy forest tract fringed with bracken which leads down to a broad crossing place where the river sparkles under tall overarching red gums and boxtrees and then following the garden fence found himself before a deep coollooking porch in a broad neatlykept courtyard behind the house a groom came out and took his horse rover has enough to do for there are three or four sheep dogs in the yard who walk round him on tiptoe slowly with their frills out and their tails arched growling rover also walks about on tiptoe arches his tail and growls with the best of them he knows that the slightest mistake would be disastrous and so manoeuvres till he gets to the porch where a deal of gravel having been kicked backwards in the same way as the ancients poured out their wine when they drank a toast or else as i think is more probable as a symbol that animosities were to be buried rover is admitted as a guest and sam feels it safe to enter the house a cool shady hall hung round with coats hats stockwhips a gun in the corner and on a slab the most beautiful nosegay you can imagine remarkable that for a bachelors establishmentbut there is no time to think about it for a tall comfortablelooking housekeeper whom sam has never seen before comes in from the kitchen and curtseys captain brentwood not at home is he said sam no sir away on the run with mr james oh very well says sam i am going to stay a few days very well sir will you take anything before lunch nothing thank you miss alice is somewhere about sir i expect her in every minute miss alice says sam astonished is she come home came home last week sir will you walk in and sit down sam got his coat out of his valise and went in he wished that he had put on his plain blue necktie instead of the blue one with white spots he would have liked to have worn his new yellow ridingtrousers instead of breeches and boots he hoped his hair was in order and tried to arrange his handsome brown curls without a glass but in the end concluded that things could not be mended now so he looked round the room what a charming room it was a couple of good pictures and several fine prints on the walls over the chimneypiece a sword and an old goldlaced cap on which sam looked with reverence three french windows opened on to a dark cool verandah beyond which was a beautiful flower garden the floor of the room uncarpeted shone dark and smooth and the air was perfumed by vases of magnificent flowers a hundred pounds worth of them i should say if you could have taken them to coventgarden that december morning but what took sams attention more than anything was an open piano in a shady recess and on the keys a little fairy white glove white kid gloves eh my lady says sam that dont look well so he looked through the bookshelves and having lighted on boswells johnson proceeded into the verandah a colley shedog was lying at one end who banged her tail against the floor in welcome but was too utterly prostrated by the heat and by the persecution of her puppy to get up and make friends the pup however a ball of curly black wool with a brownstriped face who was sitting on the top of her with his head on one side seemed to conclude that a game of play was to be got out of sam and came blundering towards him but sam was by this time deep in a luxurious rockingchair so the puppy stopped half way and did battle with a great black tarantula spider who happened to be abroad on business sam went to the club with his immortal namesake bullied bennet langton argued with beauclerk put down goldsmith and extinguished boswell but it was too hot to read so he let the book fall on his lap and lay adreaming what a delicious verandah is this to dream in through the tangled passionflowers jessamines and magnolias what a soft gleam of bright hazy distance over the plains and far away the deep riverglen cleaves the tableland which here and there swells into breezy downs beyond miles away to the north is a great forestbarrier above which there is a blaze of late snow sending strange light aloft into the burning haze all this is seen through an arch in the dark mass of verdure which clothed the trelliswork only broken through in this one place as though to make a frame for the picture he leans back and gives himself up to watching trifles see here a magpie comes furtively out of the house with a key in his mouth and seeing sam stops to consider if he is likely to betray him on the whole he thinks not so he hides the key in a crevice and whistles a tune now enters a cockatoo waddling along confortably and talking to himself he tries to enter into conversation with the magpie who however cuts him dead and walks off to look at the prospect flop flop a great foolishlooking kangaroo comes through the house and peers round him the cockatoo addresses a few remarks to him which he takes no notice of but goes blundering out into the garden right over the contemplative magpie who gives him two or three indignant pecks on his clumsy feet and sends him flying down the gravel walk two brighteyed little kangaroo rats come out of their box peering and blinking the cockatoo finds an audience in them for they sit listening to him now and then catching a flea or rubbing the backs of their heads with their forepaws but a buck possum who stealthily descends by a pillar from unknown realms of mischief on the top of the house evidently discredits cockys stories and departs down the garden to see if he can find something to eat an old cat comes up the garden walk accompanied by a wicked kitten who ambushes round the corner of the flowerbed and pounces out on her mother knocking her down and severely maltreating her but the old lady picks herself up without a murmur and comes into the verandah followed by her unnatural offspring ready for any mischief the kangaroo rats retire into their box and the cockatoo rather nervous lays himself out to be agreeable but the puppy born under an unlucky star who has been watching all these things from behind his mother thinks at last here is some one to play with so he comes staggering forth and challenges the kitten to a lark she receives him with every symptom of disgust and abhorrence but he regardless of all spitting and tail swelling rolls her over spurring and swearing and makes believe he will worry her to death her scratching and biting tell but little on his woolly hide and he seems to have the best of it out and out till a new ally appears unexpectedly and quite turns the tables the magpie hops up ranges alongside of the combatants and catches the puppy such a dig over the tail as sends him howling to his mother with a flea in his ear sam lay sleepily amused by this little drama then he looked at the bright green arch which separated the dark verandah from the bright hot garden the arch was darkened and looking he saw something which made his heart move strangely something that he has not forgotten yet and never will under the arch between the sunlight and the shade bareheaded dressed in white stood a girl so amazingly beautiful that sam wondered for a few moments whether he was asleep or awake her hat which she had just taken off hung on her left arm and with her delicate right hand she arranged a vagrant tendril of the passionflower which in its luxuriant growth had broken bounds and fallen from its place abovea girl so beautiful that i in all my life never saw her superior they showed me the other day in a carriage in the park one they said was the most beautiful girl in england a descendant of i know not how many noblemen but looking back to the times i am speaking of now i said at once and decidedly alice brentwood twenty years ago was more beautiful than she a norman style of beauty i believe you would call it light hair deep brilliant blue eyes and a very fair complexion beauty and highbred grace in every limb and every motion she stood there an instant on tiptoe with the sunlight full upon her while sam buried in gloom had time for a delighted look before she stepped into the verandah and saw him she floated towards him through the deep shadow i think she said in the sweetest most musical little voice that you are mr buckley if so you are a very old friend of mine by report so she held out her little hand and with one bold kind look from the happy eyes finished sam for life father and mother retire into the chimney corner and watch your day is done doctor mulhaus put your good advice into your pocket and smoke your pipe here is one who can exert a greater power for good or evil than all of you put together it was written of olda man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his hallo i am getting on rather fast i am afraid he had risen to meet her and you miss brentwood he said are tolerably well known to me do you know now that i believe by an exertion of memory i could tell you the year and the month when you began to learn the harp my dear old friend jim has kept me quite au fait with all your accomplishments i hope you are not disappointed in me said alice laughing no said sam i think rather the contrary are you i have not had time to tell yet she said i will see how you behave at lunch which we shall have in half an hour teteatete you have been often here before i believe do you see much change not much i noticed a new piano and a little glove that i had never seen before jims menagerie o wild beasts is as numerous as ever i see he would have liked to be in noahs ark and so would you and i mr buckley she answered laughing if we had been caught in the flood good gracious think of being in noahs ark with her you find them a little troublesome dont you miss brentwood well it requires a good deal of administrative faculty to keep the kitten and the puppy from open collision and to prevent the magpie from pecking out the cockatoos eye and hiding it in the flower bed last sunday morning he the magpie got into my fathers room and stole thirtyone shillings and sixpence we got it all back but half a sovereign and that we shall never see the bird thus alluded to broke into a gush of melody so rich full and metallic that they both turned to look at him having attracted attention he began dancing crooning a little song to himself as though he would say i know where it is and lastly he puffed out his breast put back his bill and swore two or three oaths that would have disgraced a london scavenger with such remarkable distinctness too that there was no misunderstanding him so sams affectation of not having caught what the bird said was a dead failure mr buckley said she if you will excuse me i will go and see about lunch can you amuse yourself there for half an hour well he would try so he retired again to the rockingchair about ten years older than when he rose from it for he had grown from a boy into a man he had fallen over head and ears in love and all in five minutes fallen deeply seriously in love to the exclusion of all other sublunary matters before he had well had time to notice whether she spoke with an irish brogue or a scotch happily she did neither sudden you say well yes but in lat degrees and lower whether in the southern or northern hemisphere these sort of affairs come on with a rapidity and violence only equalled by the thunderstorms of those regions and utterly surprising to you who perhaps read this book in degrees north or perhaps higher i once went to a ball with as free and easy heartwhole a young fellow as any i know and agreed with him to stay half an hour and then come away and play pool in twentyfive minutes by my watch which keeps time like a ships chronometer that man was in the tragic or cutthroat stage of the passion with a pretty little thing of forty a cattledealers widow who stopped his poolplaying for a time until she married the great ironmonger in george street romeo and juliets little matter was just as sudden and very australian in many points only mind that romeo had he lived in australia instead of taking poison would probably have took to drinking ratafia and thought of poor miss baily for full twentyfour hours after the catastrophe at least such would have been the case in many instances but not in all with some men these suddenlyconceived passions last their lives and i should be inclined to say longer were there not strong authority against it but sam he saw the last twinkle of her white gown disappear and then leant back and tried to think he could only say to himself by jove i wonder if i can ever bring her to like me i wish i had known she was here id have dressed myself better she is a precious superior girl she might come to like me in time heigh ho the idea of his having a rival or of any third person stepping in between him and the young lady to whom he had thrown his handkerchief never entered into his sultanships head also when he came to think about it he really saw no reason why she should not be brought to think well of him as well me as another said he to himself thats where it is she must marry somebody you know why was she gone so long he begins to doubt whether he has not after all been asleep and dreaming there she comes again however for the arch under the creepers is darkened again and he looks up with a pleasant smile upon his face to greet her god save us what imps trick is this there in the porch in the bright sun where she stood not an hour ago in all her beauty and grace stands a hideous old savage black as tophet grinning showing the sharp gapteeth in her apish jaws her lean legs shaking with old age and rheumatism the colley shakes out her frill and raising the hair all down her back stands grinning and snarling while her puppy barks potvaliantly between her legs the little kangaroo rats ensconce themselves once more in their box and gaze out amazed from their bright little eyes the cockatoo hooks and clambers up to a safe place in the trellis and sam after standing thunderstruck for a moment asks what she wants make a light note see says the old girl in a pathetic squeak further answer she makes none but squats down outside and begins a petulant whine sure sign that she has a tale of woe to unfold and is going to ask for something can that creature thinks sam be of the same species as the beautiful alice brentwood surely not there seems as much difference between them as between an angel and an ordinary good woman hard to believe truly sam but perhaps in some of the great european cities or even nearer home in some of the prison barracks you may chance to find a white woman or two fallen as low as that poor starved illtreated filthy old savage alice comes out once more and brings sunshine with her she goes up to the old lubra with a look of divine compassion on her beautiful face the old womans whine grows louder as she rocks herself to and fro yah marah yah boorah oh boora yah yah ma what old sally says the beautiful girl what is the matter have you been getting waddy again baal says she with a petulant burst of grief what is it then says alice where is the gown i gave you alice had evidently vibrated the right chord the yarah moorah coronach was begun again and then suddenly as if her indignation had burst bounds she started off with a shrillness and rapidity astonishing to one not accustomed to blackfellows into something like the following oh yah very loud oh mah barkmaburrawurrah barkmamurrahwurrah oh ya barkmanurrawah yee in a scream then a pause oh mooroo pause oh hinaray pause oh barknamurrwurrah yee alice looked as if she understood every word of it and waited till the poor old soul had blown off the steam and then asked again and what has become of the gown sally oh dear young lubra betty big thief that one tear it up and stick it along a fire oh plenty cold this old woman oh plenty hungry this old woman oh yarah moorah c there go round to the kitchen said alice and get something to eat is it not abominable mr buckley i cannot give anything to this old woman but the young lubras take it from her however i will put the screw on them they shall have nothing from me till they treat her better it goes to my heart to see a woman of that age with nothing to look forward to but kicks and blows i have tried hard to make her understand something of the next world but i cant get it out of her head that when she dies she will go across the water and come back a young white woman with plenty of money mr sandford the missionary says he has never found one who could be made to comprehend the existence of god however i came to call you to lunch will you give me your arm such a selfpossessed intrepid little maiden not a bit afraid of him but seeming to understand and trust him so thoroughly not all the mockmodesty and blushing in the world would have won him half so surely as did her bold quiet honest look although a very young man and an inexperienced sam could see what a candid honest gentle soul looked at him from those kind blue eyes and she too saw something in sams broad noble face which attracted her marvellously and in all innocence she told him so plump and plain as they were going into the house i fancy i shall like you very much mr buckley we ought to be good friends you know your father saved the lives of my father and uncle i never heard of that before said sam i dare say not said alice your father is not the man to speak of his own noble deeds yet he ran out of his square and pulled my father and uncle almost from under the hoofs of the french cavalry at waterloo it makes my cheeks tingle to tell of it now indeed it did sam thought that if it brought such a beautiful flush to her face and such a flash from her eyes whenever she told it that he would get her to tell it again more than once but lunch dont let us starve our new pair of turtledoves in the outset sam is but a growing lad and needs carbon for his muscles lime for his bones and all that sort of thing a glass of wine wont do him any harm either and let us hope that his new passion is not of such lamentable sort as to prevent his using a knife and fork with credit and satisfaction to himself here in the dark cool parlour stands a banquet for the gods white damask pretty bright china and clean silver in the corner of the table is a frosted claretjug standing with freezing politeness upright his hand on his hip waiting to be poured out in the centre the grandfather of watermelons halfhidden by peaches and pomegranates the whole heaped over by a confusion of ruby cherries oh for lance to paint it are you hungry though if so here is a mould of pottedhead and a cold wild duck while on the sideboard i see a bottle of pale ale my brother let us breakfast in scotland lunch in australia and dine in france till our lives end and the banquet being over she said as pleasantly as possible now i know you want to smoke in the verandah for my part i should like to bring my work there and sit with you but if you had rather not have me you have only to say that you could not think c c and i will obediently take myself off but sam didnt say that he said that he couldnt conceive anything more delightful if she was quite sure she did not mind not she indeed so she brought her work out and they sat together a cool wind came up bending the flowers swinging the creepers to and fro and raising a rushing sound like the sea from the distant forest the magpie having been down the garden when the wind came on and having been blown over soon joined them in a very captious frame of mind and when alice dropped a ball of red worsted he seized it as lawful prize and away in the house with a hop and a flutter so both sam and alice had to go after him and hunt him under the sofa and the bird finding that he must yield dropped the ball suddenly and gave sam two vicious digs on the fingers to remember him by but when alice just touched his hand in taking it from him he wished it had been a whipsnake instead of a magpie so the ball of worsted was recovered and they sat down again he watched her nimble fingers on the delicate embroidery he glanced at her quiet face and downturned eyelids wondering who she was thinking of suddenly she raised her eyes and caught him in the fact you could not swear she blushed it might only be a trifling reflection from one of the red china roses that hung between her and the sun yet when she spoke it was not quite with her usual selfpossession a little hurriedly perhaps are you going to be a soldier as your father was sam had thought for an instant of saying yes and then to prove his words true of going to sydney and enlisting in the half hundred truth however prompting him to say no he compromised the matter by saying he had not thought of it i am rather glad of that do you know she said unless in india now a man had better be anything than a soldier i am afraid my brother jim will be begging for a commission some day i wish he would stay quietly at home that was comforting he gave up all thoughts of enlisting at once but now the afternoon shadows were beginning to slant longer and longer and it was nearly time that the captain and jim should make their appearance so alice proposed to walk out to meet them and as sam did not say no they went forth together down the garden faint with the afternoon scents of the flowers before the western sun among petunias and roses oleander and magnolia here a towering indian lily there a thicket of scarlet geranium and fuschia by shady young orange trees covered with fruit and blossom between rows of trellissed vines bearing rich promise of a purple vintage among fig trees and pomegranates and so leaving the garden along the dry slippery grass towards the hoarse rushing river both silent till they reached it there is a silence that is golden they stood gazing on the foaming tide an instant and then alice said my father and sam will come home by the track across there shall we cross and meet them we can get over just below a little lower down all the river was collected into one headlong race and a giant tree undermined by winter floods had fallen from one bank to the other offering a giddy footway across the foaming water now said alice if you will go over i will follow you so he ran across and then looked back to see the beautiful figure tripping fearlessly over with outstretched arms and held out his great brown hand to take her tiny fingers as she stepped down from the upturned roots on to the soft white sand he would like to have taken them again to help her up the bank but she sprang up like a deer and would not give him the opportunity then they had a merry laugh at the magpie who had fluttered down all this way before them to see if they were on a foraging expedition and if there were any plunder going and now could not summon courage to cross the river but stood crooning and cursing by the brink then they sauntered away side by side along the sandy track among the knolls of braken with the sunlit boughs whispering knowingly to one another in the evening breeze as they passed beneathan evening walk long remembered by both of them oh see ye not that pleasant road that winds along the ferny brae oh thats the road to fairy land where thou and i this een must gae and so you cannot remember england mr buckley says alice oh dear no stay though i am speaking too fast i can remember some few places i remember a steep red road that led up to the church and have some dim recollection of a vast grey building with a dark porch which must have been the church itself i can see too at this moment a broad green flat beside a creek which was covered with yellow and purple flowers which mother and i made into nosegays that must be the place my father speaks of as the hatherleigh meadows where he used to go fishing and although i must have been there often yet i can only remember it on one occasion when he emptied out a basket of fish on the grass for me to look at my impression of england is that everything was of a brighter colour than here and they tell me i am right a glorious country said alice what would i give to see itso ancient and venerable and yet so amazingly young and vigorous it seems like a waste of existence for a man to stay here tending sheep when his birthright is that of an englishman the right to move among his peers and find his fit place in the greatest empire in the world never had any woman such a noble destiny before her as this young lady who has just ascended the throne but the conversation changed here and her majesty escaped criticism for the time they came to an open space in the forest thickly grown with thickets of bracken fern prickly acacia and here and there a solitary darkfoliaged lightwood in the centre rose a few blackened posts the supports of what had once been a hut and as you looked you were surprised to see an english rose or two flowering among the dullcoloured prickly shrubs which were growing around a place as any casual traveller would have guessed which had a history and sam seeing alice pause asked her what old hut was this this she said is the donovans old station where they were burnt out by the blacks sam knew the story well enough but he would like to hear her tell it so he made believe to have heard some faint reports of the occurrence and what could she do but give him the particulars they had not been here a year she said and mrs donovan had been confined only three days there was not a soul on the station but herself her son murtagh and miss burke all day the blackfellows were prowling about and getting more and more insolent and at night just as murtagh shut the door they raised their yell and rushed against it murtagh donovan and miss burke had guessed what was coming all day but had kept it from the sick woman and now when the time came they were cool and prepared they had two doublebarrelled guns loaded with slugs and with these they did such fearful execution from two loopholes they had made in the slabs that the savages quickly retired but poor miss burke incautiously looking out to get a shot received a spear wound on her shoulder which she bears the mark of to this day but the worst was to come the blackfellows mounted on the roof tried to take off the bark and throw their spears into the hut but here they were foiled again wherever a sheet of bark was seen to move they watched and on the first appearance of an enemy a charge of shot at a few yards distance told with deadly effect mrs donovan who lay in bed and saw the whole told my father that lesbia burke loaded and fired with greater rapidity and precision than her cousin a noble woman i say good old lesbia said sam and how did it end why the foolish blacks fired the woolshed and brought the delisles upon them they tried to fire the roof of the hut but it was raining too hard otherwise it would have gone hard with poor miss burke see here is a peachtree they planted covered with fruit let us gather some it is pretty good for the donovans have kept it pruned in memory of their escape but the hut was not burnt said sam where did it stand that pile of earth there is the remains of the old turf chimney they moved across the river after it happened but peaches when they grow on a high tree must be climbed for particularly if a young and pretty girl expresses a wish for them and so it fell out that sam was soon astride of one of the lower boughs throwing the fruit down to alice who put them one by one into the neatest conceivable little basket that hung on her arm and so they were employed busy and merry when they heard a loud cheery voice which made both of them start quite a scene from paradise lost i declare only eve ought to be up the tree handing down the apples to adam and not vice versa i miss a carpet snake too who would represent the d and make the thing completesam buckley how are you it was captain brentwood who had come on them so inaudibly along the sandy track on horseback and beside him was son jim looking rather mischievously at sam who did not show to the best of advantage up in the peachtree but having descended and greetings being exchanged father and son rode on to dress for dinner the hour for which was now approaching leaving sam and alice to follow at leisure which they did for captain brentwood and jim had time to dress and meet in the verandah before they saw the pair come sauntering up the garden father said jim taking the captains hand how would that do marvellous well i should say replied the captain and so i think too said jim hallo you two dinner is ready so look sharp after dinner the captain retired silently to the chimneycorner and read his book leaving the three young people to amuse themselves as they would nothing the captain liked so much as quiet while he read some abstruse work on gunnery or some scientific voyage but i am sorry to say he had got very little quiet of an evening since alice came home and jim had got some one to chatter to this evening however seemed to promise well for alice brought out a great book of coloured prints and the three sat down to turn them over jim of course you know being in the middle the book was wild sports of the east a great volume of coloured lithographs worth some fiveandtwenty guineas one never sees such books as that nowadays somehow people i fancy would not pay that price for them what modern travels have such plates as the old editions of cooks voyages the number of illustrated books is increased tenfold but they are hardly improved in quality but sam i think would have considered any book beautiful in such company this said alice is what we call the tiger bookwhy you will see directlyyou turn over jim and dont crease the pages so jim turned over and kept them laughing by his simple remarks more often affected than real i suspect now they went through the tangled jungle and seemed to hear the last mad howl of the dying tiger as the elephant knelt and pinned him to the ground with his tusks now they chased a lordly buffalo from his damp lair in the swamp now they saw the english officers flying along on their arabs through the high grass with wellpoised spears after the snorting hog they have come unexpectedly on a terrible old tiger one of the horses swerves and a handsome young man losing his seat seems just falling into the monsters jaws while the pariah dogs scud away terrified through the grass that chap will be eaten immediately says jim he has been in that position ever since i can remember says alice so i think he is pretty safe now they are with the british army on the march a scarlet bar stretches across the plain of which the further end is lost in the white mirageall in order walking irresistibly on to the conquest of an empire greater than haroun al raschids so naturally done that as you look you think you see the columns swing as they advance and hear the heavy weary tramp of the troops above the din and shouting of the cloud of campfollowers on camels and elephants which surrounds them beyond the plain the faint blue hills pierce the grey air barred with a few long white clouds and far away a gleaming river winds through a golden country spanned with long bridges and fringed with many a fantastic minaret how i should like to see that said alice would you like to be a countess said jim and ride on an elephant in a howitzer howdah you goose said alice besides that is not a countess that is one of the soldiers wives countesses dont go to india they stay at home to mind the queens clothes what a pleasant job for them said jim when her most gracious majesty has got the toothache i wonder whether she wears her crown under her bonnet or over it captain brentwood looked up my dear boy he said does it not strike you that you are talking nonsense did you ever see the old king father said jim i saw king george the third many times ah but i mean to speak to him once only and then he was mad he was sitting up with her majesty waiting for intelligence which i brought his royal highness took the despatches from me but the king insisted on seeing me and what did he say father do tell us said alice eagerly little enough my love said the captain leaning back he asked is this the officer who brought the despatches york and his royal highness said yes then the king said you bring good news sir i was going to ask you some questions but they are all gone out of my head go and get your supper get your supper sir poor old gentleman he was a kindly old man and i had a great respect for him alice sing us a song my love she sang them the burial of sir john moore with such perfect taste and pathos that sam felt as if the candle had gone out when she finished then she turned round and said to him you ought to like that song your father was one of the actors in it he has often told me the story said sam but i never knew what a beautiful one it was till i heard you sing it all pleasant evenings must end and at last she rose to go to bed but sam before he went off to the land of happy dreams saw that the little white glove which he had noticed in the morning was lying neglected on the floor so he quietly secured and kept it and last year opening his family bible to refer to certain entries now pretty numerous in the beginning i found a little white glove pinned to the flyleaf which i believe to be the same glove here spoken of chapter xxviii a gentleman from the wars i need hardly say that sam was sorry when the two days which he had allowed himself for his visit were over but that evening when he mentioned the fact that he was going away in the morning the captain alice and jim all pressed him so eagerly to stay another week that he consented the more as there was no earthly reason he knew of why he should go home and the second morning from that on which he should have been at home going out to the stable before breakfast he saw his father come riding over the plain and going to meet him found that he too meditated a visit to the captain i thought you were come after me father said sam by the bye do you know that the captains daughter miss alice is come home indeed said the major and what sort of a body is she oh she is well enough something like jim plays very well on the piano and all that sort of thing you know sings too is she pretty asked the major oh well i suppose she is said sam yes i should say that a great many people would consider her pretty they had arrived at the door and the groom had taken the majors horse when alice suddenly stepped out and confronted them the major had been prepared to see a pretty girl but he was by no means prepared for such a radiant lovely blushing creature as stepped out of the darkness into the fresh morning to greet him clothed in white bareheaded with a single rose in her hair as he told his wife a few days after he was struck all of a heap and sam heard him whisper to himself by jove before he went up to alice and spoke my dear young lady you and i ought not to be strangers for i recognise you from my recollections of your mother can you guess who i am i recognise you from my recollections of your son sir said alice with a sly look at sam i should say that you were major buckley the major laughed and taking her hand carried it to his lips a piece of oldfashioned courtesy she had never experienced before and which won her heart amazingly come come buckley said the quiet voice of captain brentwood from the dark passage what are you at there with my daughter i shall have to call out and fight some of you young fellows yet i see alice went in past her father stopping to give him a kiss and disappeared into the breakfastroom the captain came out and shook hands warmly with the major and said what do you think of hereh i never saw such beauty before answered the major never by jove i tell you what brentwood i wish she could come out this season in london why she might marry a duke let us get her a rougepot and a french governess and send her home by the next ship eh buckley said the captain with his most sardonic smile she would be the better for a little polishing wouldnt she eh too hoydenish and forward i am afraid too fond of speaking the truth lets have her taught to amble and mince and bah come to breakfast the major laughed heartily at this tirade of the captains he was fond of teasing him and i believe the captain liked to be teased by him and what are you three going to do with yourselves today eh asked the captain at breakfast it is a matter of total indifference to me so long as you take yourselves off somewhere and leave me in peace alice was spokesmanwe are going up to the limestone gates mr samuel buckley has expressed a desire to see them and so jim and i thought of taking him there this was rather a jesuitical speech the expedition to the limestone gates involved a long ride through very pretty scenery which she herself had proposed as for sam bless you he didnt care whether they rode east west north or south so long as he rode beside her however having got his cue he expressed a strong wish to examine geologically the great band of limestone which alternated with the slate towards the mountains the more particularly as he knew that the captain and the major intended to ride out in another direction to examine some new netting for sheepyards which the captain had imported if major buckley thought alice beautiful as he had seen her in the morning he did not think her less so when she was seated on a beautiful little horse which she rode gracefully and courageously in a blue ridinghabit and a sweet little grey hat with a plume of companions feathers hanging down on one side the cockatoo was on the doorstep to see her start and talked so incessantly in his excitement that even when the magpie assaulted him and pulled a feather out of his tail he could not be quiet sams horse widderin capered with delight and sams dog rover coursed far and wide before them with joyful bark so they three went off through the summers day as happy as though all life were one great summers holiday and there were no storms below the horizon to rise and overwhelm them through the grassy flat where the quail whirred before them and dropped again as if shot across the low rolling forest land where a million parrots fled whistling to and fro like jewels in the sun past the old stockyard past the sheepwash hut and then through forest which grew each moment more dense and lofty along the faint and narrow track which led into one of the most abrupt and romantic gullies which pierce the australian alps all this became classic ground to them afterwards and the causes which made it so were now gathering to their fulfilment even now while these three were making happy holiday together little dreaming of what was to come afterwards years after they three came and looked on this valley again not as now with laughter and jokes but silently speaking in whispers as though they feared to wake the dead the road they followed suddenly rising from the forest took over the shoulder of a rocky hill and then plunging down again followed a little running creek up to where a great ridge of slate crossing the valley hemmed them in on either side leaving only room for the creek and the road following it further the glen opened out sweeping away right and left in broad curves while straight before them a quarter of a mile distant there rose out of the low scrub and fern a mighty wall of limestone utterly barring all further progress save in a single spot to the left where the vast grey wall was split giving a glimpse of another glen beyond this great natural cleft was the limestone gate which they had come to see and which was rendered the more wonderful by a tall pinnacle of rock which stood in the centre of the gap about feet in height not unlike one of the same kind in dovedale i dont think i ever saw anything so beautiful said alice how fine that spire of rock is shooting up from the feathered shrubs at the base i will come here some day and try to draw it wait a minute said jim you have not seen half yet he led them through the narrow pass among the great boulders which lined the creek the instant they came beyond a wind icy cold struck upon their cheeks and alice dropping her reins uttered a cry of awe and wonder and sam too exclaimed aloud for before them partly seen through crowded tree stems and partly towering above the forest lay a vast level wall of snow flecked here and there by the purple shadow of some flying summer cloud a sight so vast and magnificent held them silent for a little then suddenly jim looking at alice saw that she was shivering what is the matter alice my dear he said let us come away the snowwind is too much for you oh it is not that she said somebody is walking over my grave oh thats all said jim they are always at it with me in cold weather let em it wont hurt that i know of but they turned homeward nevertheless and coming through the rock walls again jim said sam what was that battle the doctor and you were reading about one day and you told me all about it afterwards you know malplacquet no something like that though where they got bailed up among the rocks you know and fought till they were all killed thermopylae ah this must be just such another place i should think thermopylae was by the seashore said alice now i should imagine said sam pointing to the natural glacis formed by the decay of the great wall which they had seen fronting them as they came up that a few determined men with rifles posted among those ferntrees could make a stand against almost any force but sam said jim they might be cut up by cavalry horses could travel right up the face of the slope there now suppose a gang of bushrangers in that fernscrub do you think an equal number of police could not turn them out of it why i have seen the place where moppys gang turned and fought desborough on the macquarrie it was stronger than this and yetyou know what he did with them only kept one small one for hanging as he elegantly expressed it but i aint talking of bushrangers said sam i mean such fellows as the americans in the war of independence see what a dance they led our troops with their bushfighting i wonder if there will ever be a war of independence here said alice i know which side i should be on if there was said sam which would that be asked jim my dear friend said sam testily how can you an officers son ask me an officers son such a question the kings i beg pardon the queens side of course and so would i said jim if it came to that you know you would never have the honour of speaking to your sweet sister again if you were not said alice but i dont think those americans were in the wrong do you miss brentwood said sam why no i dont suppose that such a man as general washington for instance would have had much to do with them if they had been however said sam we are talking of what will never occur here to begin with we could never stand alone against a great naval power they would shut us up here to starve we have everything to lose and nothing to gain by a separation i would hardly like myself for the sake of a few extra pounds taxes to sell my birthright as an englishman conceive said alice being in some great european city and being asked if you were british having to say no they were coming through the lower pass and turned to look back on the beautiful rockwalled amphitheatre sleeping peaceful and still under the afternoon sun the next time so it happened that sam and jim looked at that scene together was under very different circumstances now the fronds of the ferntrees were scarce moved in the summers breeze and all was silent as the grave they saw it againwhen every fern tuft blazed with musketry and the ancient cliffs echoed with the shouts of fighting and the screams of dying men and horses it is very early said alice let us ride to the left and see the great waterfall you speak of jim it was agreed instead of going home they turned through the forest and debouched on the plains about two miles above garoopna and holding their course to the river came to it at a place where a great trap dike crossing formed a waterfall over which the river now full with melting snow fell in magnificent confusion they stood watching the grand scene with delight for a short time and then crossing the river by a broad shallow ford held their way homeward along the eastern and more level bank sometimes reining up their horses to gaze into the tremendous glen below them and watch the river crawling on through many impediments and beginning to show a golden light in its larger pools beneath the sloping westering sun just as they sighted home on the opposite side of the river they perceived two horsemen before them evidently on the track between major buckleys and garoopna they pushed on to overhaul them and found that it was doctor mulhaus whom they received with boisterous welcome and a tall handsome young gentleman a stranger a young gentleman sam said the doctor mr halbert by name who arrived during your fathers absence with letters of introduction i begged him to follow your father over here and as his own horse was knocked up i mounted him at his own request on jezebel he preferring her to all the horses in the paddock on account of her beauty after having been duly warned of her wickedness but mr halbert seems of the centaur species and rather to enjoy an extra chance of getting his neck broke politeness to strangers was one of the first articles of faith in the buckley and brentwood families so the young folks were soon on the best of terms are you from sydney way mr halbert said sam indeed said the young man i have only landed in the country six weeks i have got three years leave of absence from my regiment in india and if i can see a chance i shall cut the army and settle here oh said alice are you a soldier mr halbert i have that honour miss brentwood i am a lieutenant in the bengal horse artillery that is delightful i am a soldiers daughter and mr buckley here also as you know i suppose a soldiers daughter is he said impudent jim a very fine girl too sam and jim too had some disrespectful ideas about soldiers riding qualities sam could not help saying i hope you will be careful with that mare mr halbert i should not like a guest of ours to be damaged shes a desperate bruteim afraid of her myself i think i know the length of her ladyships foot said halbert laughing goodnaturedly as they were speaking they were passing through a narrow way in a wattle scrub suddenly a blundering kangaroo with rover in full chase dashed right under the mares nose and set her plunging furiously she tried to wheel round but finding herself checked reared up three or four times and at last seemed to stand on her hind legs almost overbalancing herself halbert sat like a statue till he saw there was a real chance of her falling back on him then he slipped his right foot quickly out of the stirrup and stood with his left toe in the iron balancing himself till she was quieter then he once more threw his leg across the saddle and regained his seat laughing jim clapped his hands by jove sam we must get some of these army men to teach us to ride after all we must do so said sam if that had been you or i jim with our rough clumsy hands we should have had the mare back atop of us indeed said alice you are a splendid rider mr halbert but dont suppose from mr buckleys account of himself that he cant ride well i assure you we are all very proud of him he can sit some bucking horses which very few men will attempt to mount and that same bucking miss brentwood said halbert is just what puzzles me utterly i got on a bucking horse in sydney the other day and had an ignominious tumble in the saleyard to everybodys great amusement we must give one another lessons then mr halbert said sambut i can see already that you have a much finer hand than i soon after they got home where the rest of the party were watching for them wondering at their late absence halbert was introduced to the major by the doctor who said i deliver over to you a guest a young conqueror from the himalayas and son of an old brotherwarrior if he now breaks his neck horseriding his death will not be at my door i can now eat my dinner in peace after dinner the three young ones sam alice and jim gathered round the fire leaving halbert with the major and the captain talking military and the doctor looking over an abstruse mathematical calculation with which captain brentwood was not altogether satisfied alice and sam sat in chairs side by side like christians but jim lay on the floor between the two like a blackfellow they talked in a low voice about the stranger i say said jim aint he a handsome chap and cant he ride i dare say hes a devil to fight toohear him tell how they pounded away at those indians in that battle i expect theyd have made a general of him before now only hes too young dad says hes a very distinguished young officer alice my dear you should see the wound hes got a great seam all down his side i saw it when he was changing his shirt in my room before dinner poor fellow said alice i like him very much dont you mr buckley i like him exceedinglyi hope hell stop with us continued jim and i also said sam but what shall we do tomorrow lets have a hunt said jim halbert have you ever been kangaroo hunting neveri want to go well we can have a capital hunt tomorrow sam has got his dog fly here and ill take one of my best dogs and well have a good run i dare say i shall come too said alice that is added she looking shyly at sam if you would be kind enough to take care of me and let mr halbert and jim do the riding but im afraid i shall be sadly in your way if you dont go said sam i shall stay at home now then at this minute the housekeeper came in bearing jugs and glasses eleanor said jim is jerry round yes sir hes coiled somewhere in the woodhouse said she just rouse him out and send him in who is this jerry who coils in woodhouses said halbert a tame black belonging to us he is great at all sorts of hunting i want to see if he can find us a flying doe for tomorrow jerry entered and advanced with perfect selfpossession towards the fire he was a tall savage with a big black beard and wavy hair like a cornishman he was dressed in an old pair of dandy riding breeches of jims which reached a short way below the knees fitting closely and a blue check shirt rolled up above the elbow showing his lean wiry forearm seamed and scarred with spear wounds and bruises he addressed nobody but kept his eyes wandering all over the room at length he said looking at the ceiling cobbon thirsty this fellow you got a drop of brandy jerry said jim having produced the brandy you make a light kangaroo all about plenty kangaroo said jerry yowi but mine want it big one flying doe ahhh mine make a light flying doe along a stockyard this morning close by along a fent you see thatll do says jim well be up round the old stockyard after breakfast tomorrow you jerry come with us it was a fresh breezy autumn morning in april when the four sallied forth about nine oclock for their hunt the old stockyard stood in the bush a hundred yards from the corner of the big paddock fence and among low rolling ranges and gullies thickly timbered with gum cherry and sheoak a thousand parrots flew swiftly in flocks whistling and screaming from tree to tree while wattledbirds and numerous other honeyeaters clustered on the flowering basksias the spurwinged plover and the curlew ran swiftly among the grass and on a tall dead tree white cockatoos and blue cranes watched the intruders curiously alice and sam rode together soberly and before them were halbert and jim just up ready for the chase before them again was the active blackfellow holding the dogs in a leashtwo tall hounds bred of foxhound and greyhound with a dash of colley a mob of kangaroos crosses their path but they are all small so the dogs though struggling fiercely are still held tight by jerry now he crosses a little ridge before them and looks down into the gully beyond holding up his hand the two young men gather up their reins and settle themselves in their seats now halbert says jim sit fast and mind the trees they ride up to the blackfellow through the low wattles they can see what is in the gully before them though the dogs cannot baal flying doe this one says jerry in a whisper old man this fellow cobbon matong mine think it a great sixfoot kangaroo was standing about two hundred yards from them staring stupidly about him let go jerry said jim the dogs released sprang forward and in an instant saw their quarry which with a loud puff of alarm bounded away up the opposite slope at full speed taking twenty feet at each spring halbert and jim dashed off after the dogs who had got a good start of them and were laying themselves out to their work right gallantly sams dog fly slightly leading both dogs were close on the game and halbert said we are going to have a short run im afraid talk about that twenty minutes hence said jim settling to his work over range after range they hold their headlong course now a bandicoot scuttles away from under their feet to hide in his hollow log now a mob of terrified cattle huddle together as they sweep by now they are flying past a shepherds hut and the mother runs out to snatch up a child and bear him out of harms way after they are safe past a puppy three weeks old joins the chase with heart and soul but eaves in at about fifty yards and sits him down to bark now they are rushing on through a broad flat with another great range before them still always the grey bounding figure holds on through sunlight and shadow with the dogs grim and steadfast close in his wake the work begins to tell on the horses fat jezebel who could hardly be held at first now is none the worse for a little spur and jims lean longlegged horse seems to consider that the entertainment ought to conclude shortly well done fly he shouts bravely tried my girl she had drawn herself ahead and made a bold strike at the kangaroo but missed him now the other dog bolt tries it but without luck and now they have both dropped a little back and seem in for another mile or so well done lassthere she goes again with a furious effort she pushes ahead and seizes the flying beast by the hockthis time with some luck for down he goes in a cloud of dust and broken sticks and both the dogs are on him at once now he is up again and running but feebly and see what is the matter with the young dog he runs on but keeps turning snapping fiercely at his side and his footsteps are marked with blood poor lad he has got a bad wound in that last tumblethe kangaroo has ripped up his flank with a kick from his hind foot but now the chase is overthe hunted beast has turned and is at bay against a tree fly standing before him waiting for assistance snarling fiercely they pulled up jim took out a pistol and presented it to halbert thank you said he hair trigger yes he balanced it for a second and in another the kangaroo was lying quivering on the ground shot through the heart well done said jim now i must look to this dog all his flank along the ribs was laid open and jim producing a needle and thread proceeded to sew it up will you let me do that for you said halbert i wish you would im fond of the poor thing and my hand shakes youve seen the surgeons at work i expect yes indeed and he tenderly and carefully stitched up the dogs side while jim held him what do we do with the game said he oh jerry will be along on our tracks presently said jim he brings me the tail and does what he likes with the rest i wonder where sam and alice are oh they are right enough said halbert laughing i dare say they are not very anxious about the kangaroo or anything else thats a case i suppose well i hope it is said jim but you see i dont know girls are so odd perhaps he has never asked her no i dont think he has i wish he would you are not married are you my godno said halbert nor ever shall be never never jim let me tell you a story as we ride home you and i shall be good friends i know i like you already though we have only known one another two days i can see well what you are made of they say it eases a mans mind to tell his grief i wish it would mine well before i left england i had secretly engaged myself to marry a beautiful girl very much like your sister a governess in my brotherinlaws family i went off to join my regiment and left her there with my sister and her husband lord carstone who treated her as if she was already one of the familygod bless them two years ago my father died and i came into twenty thousand pounds not much but enough to get married on in india particularly as i was getting on in my profession so i wrote to her to come out to me she sailed in the assam for calcutta but the ship never arrived she was spoken off the mauritius but never seen after the underwriters have paid up her insurance and everyone knows now that the assam went down in a typhoon with all hands god bless you said jim im very sorry for that thank you i have come here for change of scene more than anything but i think i shall go back soon i shall come with you said jim i have determined to be a soldier and i know the governor has interest enough to get me into some regiment in india i dont believe he had ever thought of it before that morning if you are determined he might his services in india were too splendid to have been forgotten yet i wonder said jim if he will let me go id like to see alice married first they jogged on in silence for a little and slowly on account of the wounded dogs then jim said well and how did you like your sport very much indeed but i thought bushriding was harder work we have only had one or two leaps over fallen logs altogether there aint much leaping thats a fact i suppose you have been foxhunting my father was a master of hounds replied halbert on the first day of the season when the hounds met at home there would be two hundred horsemen on our terrace fifty of them at least in pink it was a regular holiday for all the country round such horses too my fathers horse the elk was worth three hundred pounds and there were better horses than him to be seen in the field i promise you and all after a poor little fox you dont know charley i can see said halbert poor little fox indeed why its as fair a match between the besttried pack of hounds in england and an old dogfox as one would wish to see and as hard work as it is to ride up to them even without a stiff fence at every two hundred yards to roll you over on your head if your horse is blown or clumsy just consider how many are run and how few are killed i consider a fox to be the noblest quarry in the world his speed courage and cunning are wonderful i have seen a fox run fifteen miles as the crow flies and only three of us in at the death thats what i call sport so do i by jove said jim you have some good sport in india too yes pigsticking is prettyvery pretty i may say if you have two or three of the right sort with you all the griffins ought to hunt together though there was a young fellow a kingsofficer and a nobleman too came out with us the other day and rode well forward but as the pig turned he contrived to spear my horse through the pastern he was full of apologies and i was outwardly highly polite and indifferent but internally cursing him up hill and down dale i went home and had the horse shot but when i got up next morning there was a syce leading up and down a magnificent australian a far finer beast than the one which i had lost which my lord had sent up to replace my unfortunate nag i went down to his quarters and refused to accept it but he forced me in the end and it gave me a good lesson about keeping my temper over an unavoidable accident which i dont mean to forget dont you think it was prettily done yes i do said jim but you see these noblemen are so rich that they can afford to do that sort of thing where you or i couldnt but i expect they are very good fellows on the whole there are just as large a proportion of good noblemen as there are of any other classmore than that you have no right to expect im a liberal as my father was before me and a pretty strong one too but i think that a man with sixty thousand acres and a seat in the house of lords is entitled to a certain sort of respect a grand seigneur is a very capital institution if he will only stay on his estates some part of the year ay said jim who was a shrewd fellow in his way they know that here well enough look at our macarthurs and wentworthsbut then they must be men and not snobs as the governor says when they got home they found sam and alice sitting in the verandah as comfortable as you please well said jim you are a nice lot this is what you call kangaroohunting oh you went too fast for us have you killed yes out by the big swamp you have taken your time to get home then poor bolt is cut up and we couldnt go out of a walk now give us something to eat will you alice well ring the bell and we will have lunch but just as jim rang the bell there was a loud voice outside and the three young men went out to see who it was and found two horsemen in front of the door one who was still sitting on his horse was a darkhaired slight young man charles hawker in fact whom we know already but the other who had dismounted and was leaning against his horse was a highbred delicate little fellow to whom we have yet to be introduced he was a slight lad perhaps not more than eighteen with one of the pleasantest handsomest faces of his own that you could wish to see and also a very intellectual look about him which impressed you at once with the idea that if he lived he would have made some sort of figure in life he was one of the greatest dandies also in those parts and after the longest ride used to look as if he had been turned out of a bandbox on the present occasion he had on two articles of dress which attracted jims attention amazingly the first was a new white hat which was a sufficiently remarkable thing in those parts at that time and the second a pair of yellow leather ridingtrousers why cecil mayford said sam how do you do charley how are you just in time for lunch come in jim was walking round and round cecil without speaking a word at last the latter said how do you do james brentwood how do your breeches do cecil answered jim that is a much more important question bythebye let me introduce you to mr halbert also allow me to have the honour to inform you that my sister alice is come home from school i am aware of that and am come over to pay my respects sam leave me alone if i were to disarrange my dress before i was presented to miss brentwood i would put a period to my existence jim my dear soul come in and present me dont all you fellows come mobbing in you know so jim took cecil in and the other young fellows lounged about the door in the sun where have you come from charley asked sam i have been staying at the mayfords and this morning hearing that you and your father were here we thought we would come over and stay a bit bythebye said sam ellen mayford was to have come home from sydney the same time as alice brentwood or thereabouts pray is she come oh yes said charles she is come this fortnight or more what sort of a girl has she grown to be well i call her an uncommonly pretty girl a very nice girl indeed i should say have you heard the news from the north no bushrangers nine or ten devils loose on the upper macquarrie caught the publican at marryong alone in the bush he had been an overlooker or some such thing in old times so they stripped him tied him up gave him four dozen and left him to the tender mercies of the blowflies in consequence of which he was found dead next day with the cords at his wrists cutting down to the bone with the struggles he made in his agony whew said sam we are going to have some of the oldfashioned work over again let us hope desborough will get hold of them before they come this way some of our fellowcountrymen said halbert are it seems to me more detestably ferocious than savages when they once get loose much of a muchnessno better and perhaps no worse said sam all men who act entirely without any law in their actions arrive at much the same degree whether white or black and will this captain desborough whom you speak of have much chance of catching these fellows asked halbert they will most likely disperse on his approach if he takes any force against them said sam i heard him say myself that the best way was to tempt them to stay and show fight by taking a small force against them as our admirals used to do to the french in the war bythebye how is tom troubridge he is quite a stranger to me i have only seen him twice since he was back from port phillip he is off again now after some rams up to the north i hope he wont fall in with the bushrangers anybody with him william lee answered charles a good escort there is lunch going income along chapter xxix sam meets with a rival and how he treated him that week one of those runs upon the captains hospitality took place which are common enough in the bush and although causing a temporary inconvenience are generally as much enjoyed by the entertainer as entertained everybody during this next week came to see them and nobody went back again so by the end of the week there were a dozen or fourteen guests assembled all uninvited and apparently bent on making a good long stay of it alice who had expected to be rather put out conducted everything with such tact and dignity that mrs buckley remarked to mrs mayford when they were alone together that she had never seen such beauty and such charming domestic grace combined and that he would be a lucky young fellow who got her for a wife well yes i should be inclined to say so too answered mrs mayford rather much of the boardingschool as yet but that will wear off i dare say i dont think the young lady will go very long without an offer pray have you remarked anything my dear madam yes mrs buckley had remarked something on her arrival the day before yesterday she had remarked sam and alice come riding over the paddock and sam by way of giving a ridinglesson holding the little white hand in his teaching it the dog to hold the reins properly and on seeing alice she had said to herself that will do but all this was not what mrs mayford meantin fact these two good ladies were at crosspurposes well i thought i did replied mrs buckley referring to sam but one must not be premature they are both very young and may not know their own minds they seem as if they did said mrs mayford look there outside the window they saw something which gave mrs buckley a sort of pang and made mrs mayford laugh there was no one in the garden visible but cecil mayford and alice and she was at that moment busily engaged in pinning a rose into his buttonhole the audacious girl thought mrs buckley i am afraid she will be a daughter of debate among us i wish she had not come home while mrs mayford continued i am far from saying mind you my dear mrs buckley that i dont consider cecil might do far better for himself the girl is pretty very pretty and will have money but she is too decided my dear fancy a girl of her age expressing opinions why if i had ventured to express opinions at her age ii dont know what my father would have said depend very much on what sort of opinions they were wouldnt it said mrs buckley no i mean any opinions girls ought to have no opinions at all there last night when the young men were talking all together she must needs get red in the face and bridle up and say she thought an englishman who wasnt proud of oliver cromwell was unworthy of the name of an englishman her very words i assure you why if my daughter ellen had dared to express herself in that way about a murderous papist id have slapped her face i dont think cromwell was a papist was he said mrs buckley a dissenter then or something of that sort said mrs mayford but that dont alter the matter what i dont like to see is a young girl thrusting her oar in in that way however i shall make no opposition i can assure you cecil is old enough to choose for himself and a mothers place is to submit oh no i assure you whatever my opinions may be i shall offer no opposition i shouldnt think you would said mrs buckley as the other left the room rather a piece of luck for your boy to marry the handsomest and richest girl in the country however madam if you think i am going to play a game of chess with you for that girl or any other girl why you are mistaken and yet it was very provoking ever since she had begun to hear from various sources how handsome and clever alice was she had made up her mind that sam should marry her and now to be put out like this by people whom they had actually introduced into the house it would be a great blow to sam too she wished he had never seen her she would sooner have lost a limb than caused his honest heart one single pang but after all it might be only a little flirtation between her and cecil girls would flirt but then there would be mrs mayford manoeuvring and scheming her heart out while she agnes buckley was constrained by her principles only to look on and let things take their natural course now there arose a coolness between agnes buckley and the mayfords mother and son which was never made upnever oh never not very many months after this she would have given ten thousand pounds to have been reconciled to the kindhearted old busybody but then it was too late but now going out into the garden she found the doctor busy planting some weeds he had found in the bush in a quiet corner with an air of stealth intending to privately ask the gardener to see after them till he could fetch them away the magpie having seen from the window a process of digging and burying going on had attended in his official capacity standing behind the doctor and encouraging him every now and then with a dance or a few flutelike notes of music i need hardly mention that the moment the doctors back was turned the bird rooted up every one of the plants and buried them in some secret spot of his own where they lie i believe till this day to the doctor she told the whole matter omitting nothing and then asked his advice i suppose she said you will only echo my own determination of doing nothing at all quite so my dear madam if she loves sam she will marry him if she dont he is better without her that is true said mrs buckley i hope she will have good taste enough to choose my boy i hope so too i am sure said the doctor but we must not be very furious if she dont little cecil mayford is both handsomer and cleverer than sam we must not forget that you know that evening was the first thoroughly unhappy evening i think that sam ever passed in his life i am inclined to imagine that his digestion was out of order if any of my readers ever find themselves in the same state of mind that he was in that night let them be comforted by considering that there is always a remedy at hand before which evil thoughts and evil tempers of all kinds fly like mist before the morning sun how many serious family quarrels marriages out of spite alterations of wills and secessions to the church of rome might have been prevented by a gentle dose of blue pill what awful instances of chronic dyspepsia are presented to our view by the immortal bard in the characters of hamlet and othello i look with awe on the digestion of such a man as the present king of naples banish dyspepsia and spirituous liquors from society and you would have no crime or at least so little that you would not consider it worth mentioning however to return to sam he halbert charles hawker and jim had been away riding down an emu and had stayed out all day but cecil mayford having made excuse to stay at home had been making himself in many ways agreeable to alice and at last had attended her on a ride and on his return had been rewarded with a rose as we saw the first thing sam caught sight of when he came home was alice and cecil walking up and down the garden very comfortably together talking and laughing he did not like to see this he dreaded cecils powers of entertainment too much and it made him angry to hear how he was making alice laugh then when the four came into the house this offending couple took no notice of them at all but continued walking up and down in the garden till jim who not being in love didnt care twopence whether his sister came in or not went out to the verandah and called out hi what now said alice turning round why were come home said jim and i want you then you wont get me impudence said alice and began walking up and down again but not long after having to come in she just said how do mr halbert and passed on never speaking to sam now there was no reason why she should have spoken to him but good evening mr buckley would not have hurt anybody and now in came cecil with that unlucky rose and jim immediately began hallo cis where did you get your flower ah thats a secret said cecil with an affected look no secret at all said alice coming back i gave it to him he had the civility to stay and take me out for a ride instead of going to run down those poor pretty emus and that is his reward i pinned it into his coat for him and out she went again sam was very sulky but he couldnt exactly say with whom with himself more than anybody i believe like cecils consummate impudence was his first thought but after he had gone to his room to dress his better nature came to him and before dinner came on he was his old self again unhappy still but not sulky and determined to be just what right have i to be angry even suppose she does come to care more for him than for me what can be more likely he is more courtly amusing betterlooking they say and certainly cleverer oh decidedly cleverer he might as well make me his enemy as i make him mine no dash it all he has been like a brother to me ever since he was so high and ill be dd if there shant be fair play between us two though i should go into the army through it but ill watch and see how things go so he watched at dinner and afterwards but saw little to comfort him saw one thing nay two things most clearly one was that cecil mayford was madly in love with alice and the other was that poor cecil was madly jealous of sam he treated him differently to what he had ever done before as though on that evening he had first found his rival nay he became almost rude so that once jim looked suddenly up casting his shrewd blue eyes first on one and then on the other as though to ask what the matter was but sam only said to himself let him go on let him say what he will he is beside himself now and some day he will be sorry he shall have fair play come what will but it was hard for our lad to keep his temper sometimes it was hard to see another man sitting alongside of her all the evening paying her all those nameless little attentions which somehow however unreasonably he had brought himself to think were his right and no one elses to pay hard to wonder and wonder whether or no he had angered her and if so how halbert good heart saw it all and sitting all the evening by sam made himself so agreeable that for a time even alice herself was forgotten but then when he looked up and saw cecil still beside her and her laughing and talking so pleasantly while he was miserable and unhappy the old chill came on his heart again and he thoughtwas the last happy week only a deceitful gleam of sunshine and should he ever take his old place beside her again once or twice more during the evening cecil was almost insolent to him but still his resolution was strong if he is a fool why should i be a fool i will wait and see if he can win her if he does why there is india for me if he does not i will try again only i will not quarrel with cecil because he is blinded little cecil who used to bathe with me and ride pickaback round the garden no he shall have fair play by jove he shall have fair play if i die for it and he had some little comfort in the evening when they had all risen to go to bed and were standing about in confusion lighting candles he suddenly found alice by his side who said in a sweet low musical tone can you forgive me what have i to forgive my dear young lady he said softly i was thinking of asking your forgiveness for some unknown fault i have behaved so ill to you today she said the first of my new friends i was angry at your going out after our poor emus and i was cross to you when you came home do let us be friends again there was a chance for a reconciliation but here was cecil mayford thrusting between them with a lit candle just at the wrong moment and she gave him such a sweet smile and such kind thanks that sam felt nearly as miserable as ever and next morning everything went wrong again whether it was merely coquetry or whether she was angry at their hunting the emus or whether she for a time preferred cecils company i know not but she during the next week neglected sam altogether and refused to sit beside him making a most tiresome show of being unable to get on without cecil mayford who squired her here there and everywhere in the most provoking fashion but it so happened that the doctor and the major sat up later than the others that night taking a glass of punch together before the fire and the major said abruptly there will be mischief among the young fellows about that girl it is a long while since i saw one man look at another as young mayford did at our sam tonight i wish she were out of the way sam and mayford are both desperately in love with her and one must go to the wall i wish that boy of mine was keener he stayed aloof from her all tonight dont you see his intention said the doctor i am very much mistaken if i do not he is determined to leave the field clear for all comers unless she herself makes some sort of advances to him if she prefers mayford says sam to himself in the way she appears to why she is welcome to him and i can go home as soon as i am assured of it and go home he would too and never say one word of complaint to any living soul what a clear brave honest soul that lad has said the major truly said the doctor i only know one man who is his equal and who is he his father good night good dreams so sam kept to his resolution of finding out whether or no alice was likely to prefer cecil to him and for all his watching and puzzling he couldnt he had never confided one word of all this to his mother and yet she knew it all as well as he meanwhile cecil was quite changed he almost hated sam and seldom spoke to him and at the same time hated himself for it he grew pale too and never could be persuaded to join any sport whatever while sam being content to receive only a few words in the day from my lady worked harder than ever both in the yards and riding all day he and jim would be working like horses with halbert for their constant companion and half an hour before dinner would run whooping down to the river for their bathe and then come in clean happy hungryso full of life and youth that in these sad days of deficient grinders indigestion and liver i can hardly realize that once i myself was as full of blood and as active and hearty as any of them there was much to do the week that alice and sam had their little tiff the captain was getting in the scrubbers cattle which had been left under the not very careful rule of the donovans to run wild in the mountains these beasts had now to be got in and put through such processes as cattle are born to undergo the captain and the major were both fully stiff for working in the yards but their places were well supplied by sam and jim the two fathers with the assistance of the stockman and sometimes of the sons used to get them into the yards and then the two young men would go to work in a style i have never seen surpassed by any two of the same age halbert would sometimes go into the yard and assist or rather hinder but he had to give up just when he was beginning to be of some use as the exertion was too violent for an old wound he had meanwhile cecil despised all these things and though a capital hand among cattle was now grown completely effeminate hanging about the house all day making in fact rather a fool of himself about that girl as halbert thought and thought besides what a confounded fool she will make of herself if she takes that little dandynot that he isnt a very gentlemanlike little fellow but that sam is worth five hundred of him one day it so happened that every one was out but cecil and alice and alice who had been listening to the noises at the stockyard a long while suddenly proposed to go there i have never been she said i should so like to go i know i am not allowed but you need not betray me and i am sure the others wont i should so like to see what they are about i assure you miss brentwood that it is not a fit place for a lady why not cecil blushed scarlet if women only knew what awkward questions they ask sometimes in this instance he made an ass of himself for he hesitated and stammered come along said she you are going to say that it is dangerousnothing was further from his thoughts i must learn to face a little danger you know come along i am afraid said cecil that jim will be very angry with me which was undoubtedly very likely never mind jim she said come along so they went and in the rush and confusion of the beasts feet got to the yard unnoticed sam and jim were inside and halbert was perched upon the rails she came close behind him and peeped through she was frightened close before her was sam hatless in shirt and breeches only almost unrecognisable grimed with sweat dust and filth beyond description he had been nearly horned that morning and his shirt was torn from his armpit downwards showing rather more of a lean muscular flank than would have been desirable in a drawingroom he stood there with his legs wide apart and a stick about eight feet long and as thick as ones wrist in his hand while before him crowded into a corner of the yard were a mob of infuriated terrified cattle as she watched one tried to push past him and get out of the yard he stepped aside and let it go the next instant a lordly young bull tried the same game but he was wanted so just as he came nearly abreast of sam he received a frightful blow on the nose from the stick which turned him but only for a moment the maddened beast shaking his head with a roar rushed upon sam like a thunderbolt driving him towards the side of the yard he stepped on one side rapidly and then tumbled himself bodily through the rails and fell with his fine brown curls in the dust right at the feet of poor alice who would have screamed but could not find the voice jim and halbert roared with laughter and sam picking himself up was beginning to join as loud as anybody when he saw alice looking very white and pale and went towards her i hope you havent been frightened by that evildisposed bull miss brentwood he said pleasantly you must get used to that sort of work hallo sister shouted jim what the deuce brings you here i thought you were at home at your worsted work you should have seen what we were at cecil before you brought her up now miss just mount that rail alongside of halbert and keep quiet oh do let me go home jim dear i am so frightened then you must learn not to be frightened he said jump up now but meanwhile the bull had the best of it and had got out of the yard a long lithe lad stationed outside on horseback was in full chase and jim leaping on one of the horses tied to the rails started off to his assistance the two chased the unhappy bull as a pair of greyhounds chase a hare with their whips cracking as rapidly and as loudly as you would fire a revolver after an excursion of about a mile into the forest the beast was turned and brought towards the yard twice he turned and charged the lad with the same success the cunning old stockhorse wheeled round or sprang aside and the bull went blundering into empty space with two fourteenfoot stockwhips playing on his unlucky hide like rain at length he was brought in again and one by one those entitled to freedom were passed out by sam and others reserved unto a day of wrathall but one cow with her calf all this time alice had sat by halbert cecil had given no assistance for jim would have done anything rather than press a guest into the service halbert asked her what she thought of the sport oh it is horrible she said i should like to go home i hope it is all over nearly said halbert that cow and calf have got to go out dont get frightened now watch your brother and buckley it was a sight worth watching sam and jim advanced towards the maddened beasts to try and get the cow to bolt the cattle were huddled up at the other end of the yard and having been so long in hand were getting dangerous once or twice young beasts had tried to pass but had been driven back by the young men with a courage and dexterity which the boldest matador in spain could not have surpassed cecil mayford saw with his wellaccustomed eye that matters were getting perilous and placed himself at the rails holding one ready to slip if the beasts should break in a moment how or why none could tell they made a sudden rush jim was borne back dealing blows about him like a paladin and sam was down rolled over and over in the dust just at alices feet halfadozen passed right over him as he lay jim had made good his retreat from the yard and cecil had quietly done just the right thing put up the rail he held and saved the days work the cattle were still safe but sam lay there in the dust motionless before any of them had appreciated what had happened alice was down and seizing sam by the shoulders had dragged him to the fence halbert horrified to see her actually in the presence of the cattle leaped after her put sam through the rails and lifted her up to her old post on the top in another instant the beasts swept furiously round the yard just over the place where they had been standing they gathered round sam and for an instant thought he was dead but just as jim hurriedly knelt down and raising his head began to untie his handkerchief sam uprose and shaking himself and dusting his clothes said if it had been any other beast which knocked me down but that poley heifer i should have been hurt and then said that it was bathingtime and they must look sharp to be in time for dinner three undeniable facts showing that although he was a little unsteady on his legs his intellect had in nowise suffered and halbert glancing at alice saw something in her face that made him laugh and dressing for dinner in jims room he said to that young gentleman unless there are family reasons against it jim which of course i cant speak about you know i should say that you would have sam for your brotherinlaw in a very short time do you really think so now said jim i rather fancied she had taken up with cecil i like sams fist mind you better than cecils whole body though he is a good little fellow too she has been doing that i think rather to put sam on his mettle for i think he was taking things too easy with her at first but now if cecil has any false hopes he may give them up the sooner the better no woman who was fancy free could stand seeing that noble head of sams come rolling down in the dust at her feet and what courage and skill he exhibited too talk of bullfights i have seen one bah it is like this nailbrush to a gold watch to what i saw today sam sir has won a wife by cattledrafting if that is the case said jim pensively brushing his hair i am very glad that cecils care for his fine clothes prevented his coming into the yard for he is one of the bravest coolest hands among cattle i know he beats me then he beats a precious good fellow jim a man who could make such play as you did today with a stick ought to have nothing but a big threefoot of blue steel in his hand and her majestys commission to use it against her enemies that will come said jim the day after sam has got the right to look after alice not before the governor is too fond of his logarithms when sam came to dress for dinner he found that he was bruised all over and had to go to the captain for shin plaster as he called it captain brentwood had lately been trying homeopathy which in his case there being nothing the matter with him was a decided success he doctored sam with arnica externally and gave him the fivehundredth of a grain of something to swallow but what made sam forget his bruises quicker than these dangerous and violent remedies was the delightful change in alices behaviour she was so agreeable that evening that he was in the seventh heaven the only drawback to his happiness being poor cecil mayfords utter distraction and misery next morning too after a swim in the river he handled such a singularly good knife and fork that halbert told jim privately that if he sam continued to sport such a confoundedly good appetite he would have to be carried halfamile on a heifers horns and left for dead to keep up the romantic effect of his tumble the day before they were sitting at breakfast when the door opened and there appeared before the assembled company the lithe lad i spoke of yesterday who said beg your pardon sir child lost sir they all started up whose child asked the captain james grewers child sir at the wattle hut oh said alice turning to sam it is that pretty little boy up the river that we were admiring so last week when was he lost asked major buckley two days now sir said the lad but the hut is on the plain side of the river said the major he cant be lost on the plains the river is very low sir said the lad hardly ancle deep just there he may have crossed the black fellows may have found him suggested mrs buckley they would have been here before now to tell us if they had i am afraid said captain brentwood let us hope they may have got him however we had better start at once two of us may search the river between this and the hut and two may follow it towards the mayfords sam you have the best horse go down to the hut and see if you can find any trace across the river on this side and follow it up to the ranges take some one with you and bythebye take your dog rover they were all quickly on the alert sam was going to ask jim to come with him but as he was putting the saddle on widderin he felt a hand on his arm and turning saw cecil mayford sam buckley said cecil let me ride with you will you who sooner old friend answered sam heartily let us come together by all means and if we are to go to the ranges we had better take a blanket apiece and a wedge of damper so if you will get them from the house i will saddle your horse chapter xxx how the child was lost and how he got found againwhat cecil said to sam when they found himand how in casting lots although cecil won the lot he lost the prize four or five miles up the river from garoopna stood a solitary hut snug sheltered by a lofty bare knoll round which the great river chafed among the boulders across the stream was the forest sloping down in pleasant glades from the mountain and behind the hut rose the plain four or five hundred feet over head seeming to be held aloft by the bluestone columns which rose from the river side in this cottage resided a shepherd his wife and one little boy their son about eight years old a strange wild little bush child able to speak articulately but utterly without knowledge or experience of human creatures save of his father and mother unable to read a line without religion of any sort or kind as entire a little savage in fact as you could find in the worst den in your city morally speaking and yet beautiful to look on as active as a roe and with regard to natural objects as fearless as a lion as yet unfit to begin labour all the long summer he would wander about the river bank up and down the beautiful rockwalled paradise where he was confined sometimes looking eagerly across the water at the waving forest boughs and fancying he could see other children far up the vistas beckoning to him to cross and play in that merry land of shifting lights and shadows it grew quite into a passion with the poor little man to get across and play there and one day when his mother was shifting the hurdles and he was handing her the strips of green hide which bound them together he said to her mother what country is that across the river the forest child theres plenty of quantongs over there eh mother and raspberries why maynt i get across and play there the river is too deep child and the bunyip lives in the water under the stones who are the children that play across there black children likely no white children pixies dont go near em child theyll lure you on lord knows where dont get trying to cross the river now or youll be drowned but next day the passion was stronger on him than ever quite early on the glorious cloudless midsummer day he was down by the river side sitting on a rock with his shoes and stockings off paddling his feet in the clear tepid water and watching the million fish in the shallows black fish and graylingleaping and flashing in the sun there is no pleasure that i have ever experienced like a childs midsummer holiday the time i mean when two or three of us used to go away up the brook and take our dinners with us and come home at night tired dirty happy scratched beyond recognition with a great nosegay three little trout and one shoe the other one having been used for a boat till it had gone down with all hands out of soundings how poor our derby days our greenwich dinners our evening parties where there are plenty of nice girls are after that depend on it a man never experiences such pleasure or grief after fourteen as he does before unless in come cases in his first lovemaking when the sensation is new to him but meanwhile there sits our child barelegged watching the forbidden ground beyond the river a fresh breeze was moving the trees and making the whole a dazzling mass of shifting light and shadow he sat so still that a glorious violet and red kingfisher perched quite close and dashing into the water came forth with a fish and fled like a ray of light along the winding of the river a colony of little shell parrots too crowded on a bough and twittered and ran to and fro quite busily as though they said to him we dont mind you my dear you are quite one of us never was the river so low he stepped in it scarcely reached his ancle now surely he might get across he stripped himself and carrying his clothes waded through the water never reaching his middle all across the long yellow gravelly shallow and there he stood naked and free in the forbidden ground he quickly dressed himself and began examining his new kingdom rich beyond his utmost hopes such quantongs such raspberries surpassing imagination and when tired of them such fern boughs six or eight feet long he would penetrate this region and see how far it extended what tales he would have for his father tonight he would bring him here and show him all the wonders and perhaps he would build a new hut over here and come and live in it perhaps the pretty young lady with the feathers in her hat lived somewhere here too there there is one of those children he had seen before across the river ah ah it was not a child at all but a pretty grey beast with big ears a kangaroo my lad he wont play with you but skips away slowly and leaves you alone there is something like the gleam of water on that rock a snake now a sounding rush through the wood and a passing shadow an eagle he brushes so close to the child that he strikes at the bird with a stick and then watches him as he shoots up like a rocket and measuring the fields of air in everwidening circles hangs like a motionless speck upon the sky though measure his wings across and you will find he is nearer fifteen feet than fourteen here is a prize though a wee little native bear barely eight inches longa little grey beast comical beyond expression with broad flapped ears sits on a tree within reach he makes no resistance but cuddles into the childs bosom and eats a leaf as they go along while his mother sits aloft and grunts indignant at the abstraction of her offspring but on the whole takes it pretty comfortably and goes on with her dinner of peppermint leaves what a short day it has been here is the sun getting low and the magpies and jackasses beginning to tune up before roosting he would turn and go back to the river alas which way he was lost in the bush he turned back and went as he thought the way he had come but soon arrived at a tall precipitous cliff which by some infernal magic seemed to have got between him and the river then he broke down and that strange madness came on him which comes even on strong men when lost in the forest a despair a confusion of intellect which cost many a bold man his life think what it must be with a child he was fully persuaded that the cliff was between him and home and that he must climb it alas every step he took aloft carried him further from the river and the hope of safety and when he came to the top just at dark he saw nothing but cliff after cliff range after range all around him he had been wandering through steep gullies all day unconsciously and had penetrated far into the mountains night was coming down still and crystalclear and the poor little lad was far away from help or hope going his last long journey alone partly perhaps walking and partly sitting down and weeping he got through the night and when the solemn morning came up again he was still tottering along the leading range bewildered crying from time to time mother mother still nursing his little bear his only companion to his bosom and holding still in his hand a few poor flowers he had gathered the day before up and on all day and at evening passing out of the great zone of timber he came on the bald thundersmitten summit ridge where one ruined tree held up its skeleton arms against the sunset and the wind came keen and frosty so with failing feeble legs upward still towards the region of the granite and the snow towards the eyrie of the kite and the eagle brisk as they all were at garoopna none were so brisk as cecil and sam charles hawker wanted to come with them but sam asked him to go with jim and long before the others were ready our two had strapped their blankets to their saddles and followed by sams dog rover now getting a little grey about the nose cantered off up the river neither spoke at first they knew what a solemn task they had before them and while acting as though everything depended on speed guessed well that their search was only for a little corpse which if they had luck they would find stiff and cold under some tree or crag cecil began sam depend on it that child has crossed the river to this side if he had been on the plains he would have been seen from a distance in a few hours i quite agree said sam let us go down this side till we are opposite the hut and search for marks by the river side so they agreed and in half an hour were opposite the hut and riding across to it to ask a few questions found the poor mother sitting on the doorstep with her apron over her head rocking herself to and fro we have come to help you mistress said sam how do you think he is gone she said with frequent bursts of grief that some days before he had mentioned having seen white children across the water who beckoned him to cross and play that she knowing well that they were fairies or perhaps worse had warned him solemnly not to mind them but that she had very little doubt that they had helped him over and carried him away to the forest and that her husband would not believe in his having crossed the river why it is not kneedeep across the shallow said cecil let us cross again said sam he may be drowned but i dont think it in a quarter of an hour from starting they found slightly up the stream one of the childs socks which in his hurry to dress he had forgotten here brave rover took up the trail like a bloodhound and before evening stopped at the foot of a lofty cliff can he have gone up here said sam as they were brought up by the rock most likely said cecil lost children always climb from height to height i have heard it often remarked by old bush hands why they do so god who leads them only knows but the fact is beyond denial ask rover what he thinks the brave old dog was halfway up looking back for them it took them nearly till dark to get their horses up and as there was no moon and the way was getting perilous they determined to camp and start again in the morning they spread their blankets and lay down side by side sam had thought from cecils proposing to come with him in preference to the others that he would speak of a subject nearly concerning them both but cecil went off to sleep and made no sign and sam ere he dozed said to himself by jove if he dont speak this journey i will it is unbearable that we should not come to some understanding poor cecil at early dawn they caught up their horses which had been hobbled with the stirrup leathers and started afresh both were more silent than ever and the dog with his nose to the ground led them slowly along the rocky rib of the mountain ever going higher and higher it is inconceivable said sam that the poor child can have come up here there is tuckerimbid close to our right five thousand feet above the river dont you think we must be mistaken the dog disagrees with you said cecil he has something before him not very far off watch him the trees had become dwarfed and scattered they were getting out of the region of trees the real forest zone was now below them and they saw they were emerging towards a bald elevated down and that a few hundred yards before them was a dead tree on the highest branch of which sat an eagle the dog has stopped said cecil the end is near see said sam there is a handkerchief under the tree that is the boy himself said cecil they were up to him and off in a moment there he lay dead and stiff one hand still grasping the flowers he had gathered on his last happy playday and the other laid as a pillow between the soft cold cheek and the rough cold stone his midsummer holiday was over his long journey was ended he had found out at last what lay beyond the shining river he had watched so long both the young men knelt beside him for a moment in silence they had found only what they had expected to find and yet now that they had found it they were far more touched and softened than they could have thought possible they stayed in silence a few moments and then cecil lifting up his head said suddenly sam buckley there can be no debate between us two with this lying here between us let us speak now there has never been any debate cecil said he and there never would be though this little corpse was buried fathoms deep it takes two to make a quarrel cecil and i will not be one sam said cecil i love alice brentwood better than all the world besides i know it and you love her too as well were it possible as i do i know that too why resumed cecil hurriedly has this come to pass why has it been my unlucky destiny that the man i love and honour above all others should become my rival are there no other women in the world tell me sam why is it forced on me to choose between my best friend and the woman i love dearer than life why has this terrible emergency come between us i will tell you why said sam speaking very quietly as though fearing to awaken the dead to teach us to behave like men of honour and gentlemen though our hearts break that is why cecil what shall we do said cecil easily answered said sam let her decide for herself it may be mind you that she will have neither of us there has been one living in the house with her lately far superior in every point to you or i how if she thought fit to prefer him halbert yes halbert what more likely let you and i find out the truth cecil like men and abide by it let each one ask her in his turn what chance he has who first see here said sam draw one of these pieces of grass out of my hand if you draw the longest piece ask her at once will you abide by this he said yes and drewthe longest piece that is well said sam and now no more of this at present i will sling this poor little fellow in my blanket and carry him home to his mother see cecil what is rover at rover was on his hind legs against the tree smelling at something when they came to look there was a wee little grey bear perched in the hollow of the tree what a very strange place for a young bear said cecil depend on it said sam that the child had caught it from its dam and brought it up here take it home with you cecil and give it to alice cecil took the little thing home and in time it grew to be between three and four feet high a grandfather of bears the magpie protested against his introduction to the establishment and used to pluck billfulls of hair from his stomach under pretence of lining a nest which was never made but in spite of this the good gentle beast lived nigh as long as the magpielong enough to be caressed by the waxen fingers of little children who would afterwards gather round their father and hear how the bear had been carried to the mountains in the bosom of the little boy who lost his way on the granite ranges and went to heaven in the year that the bushrangers came down sam carried the little corpse back in his blanket and that evening helped the father to bury it by the river side under some fern trees they buried him on a knoll which looked across the river into the treacherous beautiful forest which had lured him to his destruction alice was very sad for a day or two and thought and talked much about this sad accident but soon she recovered her spirits again and it fell out that a bare week after this the party being all out in one direction or another that cecil saw alice alone in the garden tending her flowers and knew that the time was come for him to keep his bargain with sam and speak to her he felt like a man who was being led to execution but screwed his courage to the highest point and went down to where she was tying up a rosetree miss brentwood he said i am come to petition for a flower you shall have a dozen if you will she answered help yourself will you have a peony or a sunflower if you have not made up your mind let me recommend a good large yellow sunflower here was a pretty beginning miss brentwood dont laugh at me but listen to me a moment i love you above all earthly things besides i worship the ground you walk on i loved you from the first moment i saw you i shall love you as well ay better if that could be on the day my heart is still and my hand is cold for ever can you tell me to hope dont drive me by one hasty halfconsidered word to despair and misery for the rest of my life say only one syllable of encouragement and i will bide your time for years and years alice was shocked and stunned she saw he was in earnest by his looks and by his hurried confused way of speaking she feared she might have been to blame and have encouraged him in her thoughtlessness more than she ought i will make him angry with me she said to herself i will treat him to ridicule it is the only chance poor fellow mr mayford she said if i thought you were in jest i should feel it necessary to tell my father and brother that you had been impertinent i can only believe that you are in earnest and i deeply regret that your personal vanity should have urged you to take such an unwarrantable liberty with a girl you have not yet known for ten days he turned and left her without a word and she remained standing where she was half inclined to cry and wondering if she had acted right on the spur of the momentsometimes half inclined to believe that she had been unladylike and rude when a thing of this kind takes place both parties generally put themselves in immediate correspondence with a confidant miss smith totters into the apartments of her dearest friend and falls weeping on the sofa while jones rushes madly into browns rooms in the temple and shying his best hat into the coalscuttle announces that there is nothing now left for him but to drown the past in debauchery whereupon brown if he is a good fellow as all the browns are produces the whisky and hears all about it so in the present instance two people were informed of what had taken place before they went to bed that night and those two were jim and doctor mulhaus alice had stood where cecil had left her thinking could she confide it to mrs buckley and ask for advice but mrs buckley had been a little cross to her that week for some reason and so she was afraid and not knowing anybody else well enough began to cry there was a noise of horses feet just beyond the fence and a voice calling to her to come it was jim and drying her eyes she went out and he dismounting put his arm round her waist and kissed her why my beauty he said who has been making you cry she put her head on his shoulder and began sobbing louder than ever cecil mayford she said in a whisper well and what the dl has he been at said jim in a rather startling tone wants to marry me she answered in a whisper and hid her face in his coat the deuce doubt he does said jim who does not what did you tell him i told him that i wondered at his audacity sent him off with a flea in his ear in fact said jim well quite right i suppose you would do the same for any man certainly i should she said looking up if doctor mulhaus noweh id box his ears jim she said laughing i would indeed or sam buckley would you box his ears if he were toyou know yes she said but there spread over her face a sudden crimson blush like the rosy arch which heralds the tropical sun which made jim laugh aloud if you dared to say a word jim she said i would never never poor cecil had taken his horse and had meant to ride home but came back again at night just he thought to have one more look at her before he entered on some line of life which would take him far away from garoopna and its temptations the doctor who has been rather thrust aside lately in the midst of all this lovemaking and so on saw that something had gone very wrong with cecil who was a great friend of his and as he could never bear to see a man in distress without helping him he encouraged cecil to stroll down the garden with him and then kindly and gently asked him what was wrong cecil told him all from beginning to end and added that life was over for him as far as all pleasure and excitement went and in short said what we have all said and had said to us in our time after a great disappointment in love which the doctor took for exactly what it was worth although poor little cecils distress was very keen and remembering some old bygone day when he had suffered so himself he cast about to find some comfort for him you will get over this my boy said he if you would only believe it never never said cecil let me tell you a story as we walk up and down if it does not comfort you it will amuse you how sweet the orange bloom smells listenhad not the war broke out so suddenly i should have been married two months to a day before the battle of saarbruck catherine was a distant cousin beautiful and talented about ten years my junior before heaven sir on the word of a gentleman i never persecuted her with my addresses and if either of them ay i did tell them from me sir that they lie and i will prove it on their bodies bah i was forgetting i as head of the family was her guardian and although my younger brother was nearer her age i courted her in all honour and humility proposed to her and was accepted with even more willingness than most women condescend to show on such occasions and received the hearty congratulations of my brother few women were ever loved better than i loved catherine conceive cecil that i loved her as well as you love miss brentwood and listen to what follows the warcloud burst so suddenly that leaving my bride that was to be to the care of my brother and putting him in charge over my property i hurried off to join the landsturm two regiments of which i had put into a state of efficiency by my sole exertions you know partly what followedin one day an army of men destroyed the king in flight to konigsberg and prussia a province of france i fled wounded badly desperate and penniless from that field i learnt from the peasants that what i had thought to be merely a serious defeat was an irretrievable disaster and in spite of wounds hunger and want of clothes i held on my way towards home the enemy were in possession of the country so i had to travel by night alone and beg from such poor cottages as i dared to approach sometimes got a nights rest but generally lay abroad in the fields but at length after every sort of danger and hardship i stood above the broad sweeping maine and saw the towers of my own beloved castle across the river perched as of old above the vineyards looking protectingly down upon the little town which was clustered on the riverbank below and which owned me for its master i crossed at dusk i had to act with great caution for i did not know whether the french were there or no i did not make myself known to the peasant who ferried me over further than as one from the war which my appearance was sufficient to prove i landed just below a long high wall which separated the town from the river and ere i had time to decide what i should do first a figure coming out of an archway caught me by the hand and i recognised my own major domo my fosterbrother i knew you would come back to me he said if it was only as a pale ghost though i never believed you dead and have watched here for you night and day to stop you are the french in my castle then there are worse than the french there he said worse than the devil bonaparte himself treason treachery adultery who has proved false i cried your brother false to his king to his word to yourself he was in correspondence with the french for six months past and now that he believes you dead he is living in sin with her who was to have been your wife i did not cry out or faint or anything of that sort i only said i am going to the castle fritz and he came with me my brother had turned him out of the house when he usurped my property but by a still faithful domestic we were admitted and i knowing every secret passage in my house came shoeless from behind some arras and stood before them as they sat at supper i was a ghastly sight i had not shaved for a fortnight and my uniform hung in tatters from my body round my head was the same bloody white handkerchief with which i had bound up my head at jena i was deadly pale from hunger too and from my entering so silently they believed they had seen a ghost my brother rose and stood pale and horrified and catherine fell fainting on the floor this was all my revenge and ere my brother could speak i was goneaway to england where i had money in the funds accompanied by my faithful max whom mary hawkers father buried in drumston churchyard so in one day i lost a brother a mistress a castle a king and a fatherland i was a ruined desperate man and yet i lived to see old blucher with his dirty boots on the silken sofas at the tuileries and to become as stout and merry a middleaged man as any prussian subject in her young majestys dominions chapter xxxi how tom troubridge kept watch for the first time human affairs are subject to such an infinite variety of changes and complications that any attempt to lay down particular rules for individual action under peculiar circumstances must prove a failure hence i consider proverbs generally speaking to be a failure only used by weakminded men who have no opinion of their own thus if you have a chance of selling your station at fifteen shillings and buying in close to a new goldfield on the same terms where fat sheep are going to the butcher at from eighteen shillings to a pound butter eggs and garden produce at famine prices some dolt unsettles you and renders you uncertain and miserable by saying that rolling stone gathers no moss as if you wanted moss again having worked harder than the colonial secretary all the week and wishing to lie in bed till eleven oclock on sunday a man comes into your room at halfpast seven on a hot morning when your only chance is to sleep out an hour or so of the heat and informs you that the early bird gets the worms i had a partner who bought in after jim stockbridge was killed who was always flying this early bird when he couldnt sleep for musquitoes i have got rid of him now but for the two years he was with me the dearest wish of my heart was that my tame magpie joshua could have had a quiet two minutes with that early bird before any one was up to separate them i rather fancy he would have been spoken of as the late early bird after that in short i consider proverbs as the refuge of weak minds the infinite sagacity of the above remarks cannot be questioned their application may i will proceed to give it i have written down the above tirade nearly as far as i can guess a printed pageful may be a little more looking at it again in order to call down the wrath of all wise men if any such have done me the honour of getting so far in these volumes on the most trashy and false proverb of the whole coming events cast their shadows before now they dont you know they never did and never will i myself used to be a strong believer in prewhats the wordprevarications predestinationsnopresentiments until i found by experience that although i was always having presentiments nothing ever came of them sometimes somebody would walk over my grave and give me a creeping in the back which as far as i can find out proceeded from not having my braces properly buttoned behind sometimes i have heard the deathwatch produced by a small spider may the deuce confound him not to mention many other presentiments and depressions of spirit which i am now firmly persuaded proceed from indigestion i am far from denying the possibility of a coincidence in point of time between a fit of indigestion and a domestic misfortune i am far from denying the possibility of more remarkable coincidences than that i have read in books novels by the very best french authors how a man not heard of for twenty years having in point of fact been absent during that time in the interior of africa may appear at paris at a given moment only in time to save a young lady from dishonour and rescue a property of ten million francs but these great writers of fiction dont give us any warning whatever the door is thrown heavily open and he stalks up to the table where the will is lying quite unexpectedly stalks up always or else strides how would it be my dear monsieur dumas if in your next novel he were to walk in or run in or hop in or say come in on allfours like a doganything for a change you know and these masters of fiction are rightcoming events do not cast their shadows before if they did how could it happen that mary hawker sat there in her verandah at toonarbin singing so pleasantly over her work and why did her handsome kindly face light up with such a radiant smile when she saw her son charles come riding along under the shadow of the great trees only two days after cecil mayford had proposed to alice and had been refused he came out of the forest shadow with the westering sunlight upon his face riding slowly she as she looked was proud to see what a fine seat he had on his horse and how healthy and handsome he looked he rode round to the back of the house and she went through to meet him there was a square court behind round which the house huts and store formed a quadrangle neat and bright with white quartz gravel bythebye there was a prospecting party who sank two or three shafts in the flat before the house last year and i saw about eighteen pennyweights of gold which they took out but it did not pay and is abandoned this in passing a propos of the quartz is tom troubridge come home mother said he as he leaned out of the saddle to kiss her not yet my boy she said i am all alone i should have had a dull week but i knew you were enjoying yourself with your old friend at garoopna a great party there i believe i am glad to get home mother he said we were very jolly at first but latterly sam buckley and cecil mayford have been looking at one another like cat and dog stay though let me be just the fierce looks were all on cecil mayfords side what was the matter alice brentwood was the matter i rather suspect he said getting off his horse hold him for me mother while i take the saddle off she did as requested and so they two are at loggerheads eh about miss brentwood of course and what sort of a girl is she oh very pretty deuced pretty in fact but there is one there takes my fancy better who is she ellen mayford the sweetest little mousedash it all look at this horses back that comes of that infernal flash military groom of jims putting on the saddle without rubbing his back down where is the bluestone she went in and got it for him as naturally as if it was her place to obey and his to command she always waited on him as a matter of course save when tom troubridge was with them who was apt to rap out something awkward about charles being a lazy young hound and about his waiting on himself whenever he saw mary yielding to that sort of thing i wonder when tom will be back resumed charles i have been expecting him this last week he may come any night i hope he will not meet any of those horrid bushrangers hope not either said charles they would have to go a hundred or two of miles out of their way to make it likely driving rams is slow work they may not be here for a week a nice price he has paid it will pay in the end in the quality of the wool said charles they sat in silence a little after charles had turned his horse out when at once without preparation he said to her mother how long is it since my father died she was very much startled he had scarcely ever alluded to his father before but she made shift to answer him quietly how old are you eighteen he said then he has been dead eighteen years he died just as you were born never mention him lad he was a bad man and by gods mercy you are delivered from him she rose and went into the house quite cheerfully why should she not why should not a handsome still young wealthy widow be cheerful for she was a widow for years after settling at toonarbin she had contrived once in two or three years to hear some news of her husband after about ten years she heard that he had been reconvicted and sentenced to the chaingang for life and lastly that he was dead about his being sentenced for life there was no doubt for she had a piece of newspaper which told of his crimeand a frightful piece of villany it wasand after that the report of his death was so probable that no one for an instant doubted its truth men did not live long in the chaingang in van diemens land in those days brother men would knock out one anothers brains in order to get hung and escape it men would cry aloud to the judge to hang them out of the way it was the most terrible punishment known for it was hopeless penal servitude for life as it is now gives the very faintest idea of what it used to be in old times with a little trouble i could tell you the weight of iron carried by each man i cannot exactly remember but it would strike you as being incredible they were chained two and two together a horrible association to lessen the chances of escape there was no chance of mitigation for good conduct there was hard mechanical uninteresting work out of doors in an inclement climate in all weathers what wonder if men died off like rotten sheep and what wonder too if sometimes the slightest accidentsuch as a blow from an overseer returned by a prisoner produced a sudden rising unpreconcerted objectless the result of which were half a dozen murdered men as many lunatic women and five or six stations lighting up the hillside night after night while the whole available force of the colony was unable to stop the ruin for months but to the point mary was a widow when she heard of her husbands death she had said to herself thank god but when she had gone to her room and was sat athinking she seemed to have had another husband before she was bound up with that desperate coining forging george hawkeranother husband bearing the same name but surely that handsome curlyheaded young fellow who used to wait for her so patiently in the orchard at drumston was not the same george hawker as this desperate convict she was glad the convict was dead and out of the way there was no doubt of that but she could still find a corner in her heart to be sorry for her poor old loverher handsome old loverah me but that even was passed now and george hawker was as one who had never lived now on this evening we speak of his memory came back just an instant as she heard the boy speak of the father but it was gone again directly she called her servants and was telling them to bring supper when charles looked suddenly in and saidhere they are there they were sure enough putting the rams into the sheepyard tom troubridge as upright bravelooking a man as ever and thanks to bushwork none the fatter william lee one of our oldest acquaintances was getting a little grizzled but otherwise looked as broad and as strong as ever they rode into the yard and lee took the horses well cousin said tom i am glad to see you again you are welcome home tom you have made good speed tom and charles went into the house and mary was about following them when lee said in so low a tone that it did not reach the othersmrs hawker she turned round and looked at him she had welcomed him kindly when he came into the yard with tom and yet he stood still on horseback holding toms horse by the bridle a stern squarelooking figure he was and when she looked at his face she was much troubled atshe knew not what mrs hawker he said can you give me the favour of ten minutes conversation alone this evening surely william now not nowmy story is pretty long and what is more maam somebody may be listening and what i have got to tell you must be told in no ear but your own you frighten me lee you frighten me to death dont get frightened mrs hawker remember if anything comes about that you have good friends about you and that i william lee am not the worst of them lee went off with the horses and mary returned to the house what mystery had this man to tell her that no one might hear but shevery strange and alarming was he drunkno he was evidently quite sober as she looked out once more she could see him at the stable cool and selfpossessed ordering the lads about something very strange and terrifying to one who had such a dark blot in her life but she went in and as she came near the parlour she heard charles and tom roaring with laughter as she opened the door she heard tom saying and by jove i sat there like a great snipe face to face with him as cool and unconcerned as you like i took him for a flash overseer sporting his salary and i was as thick as you like with him and matey says i you see i was familiar he seemed such a jolly sort of bird matey what station are you on maraganoa says he so says i youre rather young there aint you i was by there a fortnight ago he saw hed made a wrong move and made it worse i mean says he maraganoa on the clarence side ah says i in the cedar country precisely says he and there we sat drinking together and i had no more notion of its being him than you would have had she sat still listening to him eating nothing lees words outside had she knew not why struck a chill into her heart and as she listened to toms story although she could make nothing of it she felt as though getting colder and colder she shivered although the night was hot through the open window she could hear all those thousand commingled indistinguishable sounds that make the nightlife of the bush with painful distinctness she arose and went to the window the night was dark and profoundly still the stars were overhead though faintly seen through a haze and beyond the narrow enclosures in front of the house the great forest arose like a black wall tom and charles went on talking inside and yet though their voices were loud she was hardly conscious of hearing them but found herself watching the high dark wood and listening to the sound of the frogs in the creek and the rustle of a million crawling things heard only in the deep stillness of night deep in the forest somewhere a bough cracked and fell crashing then all was silent again soon arose a wind a partial wandering wind which came slowly up and rousing the quivering leaves to life for a moment passed away then again a silence deeper than ever so that she could hear the cattle and horses feeding in the lower paddock a quarter of a mile off then a low wail in the wood then two or three wild weird yells as of a devil in torment and a pretty white curlew skirled over the housetop to settle on the sheepwash dam the stillness was awful it boded a storm for behind the forest blazed up a sheet of lightning showing the shape of each fantastic elevated bough then she turned round to the light and said my dear partner i had a headache and went to the window what was the story you were telling charles just now who was the man you met in the publichouse who seems to have frightened you so no less a man than captain touan my dear cousin said tom leaning back with the air of a man who has made a point and would be glad to hear what you have to say to that sir touan repeated mary why thats the great bushranger that is out to the north is it not the same man cousin and there i sat hob and nob with him for half an hour in the lake george publichouse if desborough had come in hed have hung me for being found in bad company ha ha ha my dear partner she said what a terrible escape suppose he had risen on you why id have broken his back cousin said tom unless my right hand had forgot her cunning he is a fine man of his weight but lord in a struggle for life and death i could break his neck and have one more claim on heaven for doing so for he is the most damnable villain that ever disgraced gods earth and that is the truth that man cousin in one of his devils raids tore a baby from its mothers breast by the leg dashed its brains out against a tree and theni darent tell a woman what happened note tom was confusing touan with michael howe the latter actually did commit this frightful atrocity but i never heard that the former actually combined the two crimes in this way tom tom said mary how can you talk of such things to show you what we have to expect if he comes this way cousin that is all and is there any possibility of such a thing asked mary why not why should he not pay us the compliment of looking round this way why do they call him touan tom asked charles cant you see said tom the touan the little grey flying squirrel only begins to fly about at night and slides down from his bough sudden and sharp this fellow has made some of his most terrible raids at night and so he got the name of touan god deliver us from such monsters said mary and left the room she went into the kitchen lee sat there smoking when she came in he rose and knocking the ashes out of his pipe touched his forehead and stood looking at her now then old friend she said come here he followed her out she led the way swiftly through the silent night across the yard over a small paddock up to the sheepyard beside the woolshed there she turned shortly round and leaning on the fence said abruptly no one can hear us here william lee now what have you to say he seemed to hesitate a moment and then began mrs hawker have i been a good servant to you honest faithful kindly active who could have been a better servant than you william lee a friend and not a servant god is my witness now then i am glad to hear you say so he answered i did you a terrible injury once i have often been sorry for it since i knew you but it cannot be mended now since you knew me she said why you have known me ever since i have been in the country and you have never injured me since then surely ay but at home he said in england in devonshire my god i was your husbands companion in all his earlier villanies i suggested them to him and egged him on and now mind you after twenty years my punishment is coming she could only say still my god while her throat was as dry as a kiln listen to what i have got to tell you now hear it all in order and try to bear up and use your common sense and courage as i said before you have good friends around you and you at least are innocent guilty guilty she cried guilty of my fathers death read me this horrible riddle lee wait and listen said lee unable to forego even in her terror the great pleasure that all his class have of spinning a yarn and using as many words as possible see here we came by lake george you know and heard everywhere accounts of a great gang of bushrangers being out so we didnt feel exactly comfortable you see we came by a bush publichouse and mr troubridge stops and says he well lad suppose we yard these rams an hour and take drink in the parlour all right i says with a wink but the tap for me if you please thats my place and id like to see if i can get any news of the whereabouts of the lads as are sticking up all round because if theyre one way id as lief be another all right says he so in i goes and sits down there was nobody there but one man drunk under the bench and i has two noblers of brandy and one of old tom no two old toms it was and a brandy when in comes an old chap as i knew for a lag in a minute well he and i cottoned together and found out that we had been prisoners together fiveandtwenty years agone and so i shouted for him and he for me and at last i says butty says i who are these chaps round here on the lay meaning who are the bushrangers and he says young unsno one as we know and i says not likely matey ive been on the square this twenty year same here says the old chap give us your flipper and now says he what sort of a cove is your boss meaning mr troubridge one of the real right sort says i then see here says he ill tell you something the head man of that there gang is at this minute asitting yarning with your boss in the parlour the devil says i is so says he and no flies so i sings out mr troubridge those sheep will be out and out he came running and i whispers to him mind the man youre sitting with and leave me to pay the score so he goes back and presently he sings out will have you got any money and i says yes thirty shillings then says he pay for this and come along and thinks i ill go in and have a look at this great new captain of bushrangers so i goes to the parlour door and now who do you think i saw i know she said it was that horrible villain they call touan the same man he answered do you know who he is she found somehow breath to say how can i how is it possible i will tell you said lee there sitting in front of mr troubridge hardly altered in all these long years sat george hawker formerly of drumstonyour husband she gave a low cry and beat the hard rail with her head till it bled then turning fiercely round she said in a voice hoarse and strangely altered have you anything more to tell me you croaking raven he had something more to tell but he dared not speak now so he said nothing at present but if laying down my life she did not wait to hear him but with her hands clasped above her head she turned and walked swiftly towards the house she could not cry or sob or rave she could only say let it fall on me o god on me over and over again also she was far too crushed and stunned to think precisely what it was she dreaded so it seemed afterwards as frank maberly told me that she had an indefinable horror of charles meeting his father and of their coming to know one another she half feared that her husband would appear and carry away her son with him and even if he did not the lad was reckless enough as it was without being known and pointed at through the country as the son of hawker the bushranger these were afterthoughts however at present she leaned giddily against the houseside trying in the wild hurrying nightrack of her thoughts to distinguish some tiny star of hope or even some glimmer of reason impossible nothing but swift confused clouds everywhere driving wildly onwhither but a desire came upon her to see her boy again and compare his face to his fathers so she slid quietly into the room where tom and charles were still talking together of toms adventure and sat looking at the boy pretending to work as she came in he was laughing loudly at something and his face was alive and merry he is not like what his father was at his age she said but they continued their conversation and now what sort of man was he tom said charles was he like any one you ever saw why no stay lets see do you know he was something like you in the face thank you said charles laughing wait till i get a chance of paying you a compliment old fellow a powerful felloweh why yesa toughlooking subject said tom i shouldnt have much chance with him i suppose no hed be too powerful for you charley a change came over his face a dark fierce look mary could see the likeness now plain enough and even tom looked at him for an instant with a puzzled look nevertheless continued charles i would have a turn with him if i met him id try what six inches of cold steel between forbear boy would you have the roof fall in and crush you dead said mary in a voice that appalled both of them stop such foolish talk and pray that we may be delivered from the very sight of these men and suffered to get away to our graves in peace without any more of these horrors and surprises i would sooner she said increasing in rapidity as she went on i would far sooner live like some one i have heard of with a sword above his head than thus if he comes and looks on me i shall die she had risen and stood in the firelight deadly pale somehow one of the bands of her long black hair had fallen down and half covered her face she looked so unearthly that coupling her appearance with the wild senseless words she had been uttering tom had a horrible suspicion that she was gone mad cousin he said let me beseech you to go to bed charles run for mrs barker mary he added as soon as he was gone come away or youll be saying something before that boy youll be sorry for youre hysterical thats what is the matter with you i am afraid we have frightened you by our talk about bushrangers yes that is it that is it she said and then suddenly oh my dear old friend you will not desert me never mary but why ask such a question now ask lee she said and the next moment mrs barker the housekeeper came bustling in with smelling salts and so on to minister to a mind diseased and mary was taken off to bed what on earth can be the matter with her cousin tom said charles when she was gone she is out of sorts and got hysterical thats what it is said tom what odd things she said women do when they are hysterical its nothing more than that but mrs barker came in with a different opinion she said that mary was very hot and restless and had very little doubt that a fever was coming on terribly shaken she had been said mrs barker hoped nothing was wrong theres something decidedly wrong if your mistress is going to have a fever said tom charley do you think doctor mulhaus is at baroona or garoopna up at the majors said charles shall i ride over for him there will be a good moon in an hour yes said tom and fetch him over at once tell him we think its a fever and he will know what to bring ride like hl charley as soon as he was alone he began thinking what the doose is the matter was his first exclamation and after halfanhours cogitation only had arrived at the same point what the doose is the matter then it flashed across him what did she mean by ask lee had she any meaning in it or was it nonsense there was an easy solution for it namely to ask lee and so arising he went across the yard to the kitchen lee was bending low over the fire smoking william said tom i want to see you in the parlour i was thinking of coming across myself said lee in fact i should have come when i had finished my pipe bring your pipe across then said tom girl take in some hot water and tumblers now lee said tom as soon as lee had gone through the ceremony of well heres my respex sir now lee you have heard how ill the mistress is i have indeed sir said he and very sorry i am as i am partly the cause of it all that simplifies matters will considerably said tom i must tell you that when i asked her what put her in that state she said ask lee shows her sense sir what she means is that you ought to hear what she and i have heard and i mean to tell you more than i have her if she knew everything i am afraid it would kill her ay i know nothing as yet you know lee in the first place put him in possession of what we already knowthe fact of hawkers reappearance and his identity with the touan then he paused this is very astonishing and very terrible lee said he is there anything further yes the worst that man has followed us home tom had exhausted all his expressions of astonishment and dismay before this so now he could only give a long whistle and say followed us home followed us home said lee as we were passing the black swamp not two miles from here this very morning i saw that man riding parallel with us through the bush why did not you tell me before because i had not made up my mind how to act first i resolved to tell the mistress that i did then after i had smoked a pipe i resolved to tell you and that i did and now here we are you see that was undeniable there they were with about as pretty a complication of mischief to unravel as two men could wish to have tom felt so foolish and nonplussed that he felt inclined to laugh at lee when he said here we are it so exactly expressed the state of the case as if he had said all so and so has happened and a deuce of a job it is and here sit you and i to deliberate whats to be done with regard to so and so he did not laugh however he bit his lip and stopped it then he rose and leaning his great shoulders against the mantelpiece stood before the fireless grate and looked at lee lee also looked at him and i think that each one thought what a splendid specimen of his style the other was if they did not think so they ought to it as the londoners say but neither spoke a few minutes then tom said lee will lee though you came to me a free man and have served me twenty years or thereabouts as free man i dont conceal from myself the fact that you have been convict pish man dont let us mince matters nowa lag lee looked him full in the face without changing countenance and nodded convicted more than once too continued tom three times said lee ah said tom and if a piece of work was set before me to do which required pluck honesty courage and cunning and one were to say to me who will you have to help you i would answer out boldly give me will lee the lag my old friend who has served me so true and hearty these twenty years and youd do right sir said lee quietly and rising up he stood beside tom with one foot on the fender bending down and looking into the empty grate now will said tom turning round and laying his hand on his shoulder this fellow has followed us home having found out who we were why has he done so evident said lee to work on the fears of the mistress and get some money from her good said tom well answered we shall get to the bottom of our difficulty like this only answer the next question as well and i will call you a poly poly dn the greek not such a bad name as that i hope sir said lee smiling who might she have been a bad un i expect you dont happen to refer to hobarttown polly did you sir hold your tongue you villain said tom or youll make me laugh and these are not laughing times well what is your question sir asked lee why simply this what are we to do ill tell you said lee speaking in an animated whisper watch watch and watch again till you catch him tie him tight and hand him over to captain desborough he may be about the place tonight he will be sure to be let us watch tonight you and i and for many nights till we catch him but whispered tom he will be hung he has earned it said lee let him be hung but he is her husband urged tom in a whisper he is that boys father i cannot do it cant we buy him off yes answered lee in the same tone till his money is gone then you will have a chance of doing it again and again all your life this is a terrible dilemma said tom and added in a perplexity almost comical drat the girl why didnt she marry poor old jim stockbridge or sleepy hamlyn or even your humble servant though in all honour i must confess that i never asked her as those two others did no ill tell you what lee we will watch for him and catch him if we can after that we will think what is to be done bythebye i have been going to ask youdo you think he recognised you at the publichouse there that puzzles me said lee he looked me in the face but i could not see that he did i wonder if he recognised you i never saw him in my life before said tom it is very likely that he knew me though i was champion of devon and cornwall you know before little abraham cann kicked my legs from under me that unlucky easter monday the deuce curl his hair for doing it i never forgave him till i heard of that fine bit of play with polkinghorn yes he must have known me lee lit the fire while tom blowing out the candles drew the curtains so that any one outside could not see into the room nevertheless he left the french window open and then went outside and secured all the dogs in the doghouse the night was wonderfully still and dark as he paused before entering the house he could hear the bark falling from the trees a quarter of a mile off and the opossums scratching and snapping little twigs as they passed from bough to bough somewhere apparently at an immense distance a morepork was chanting his monotonous cry the frogs in the creek were silent even so hot was the night a good night for watching said he to lee when he came in lie you down ill take the first watch they blew out the candle and lee was in the act of lying down when he arrested himself and held up his finger to tom they both listened motionless and in silence until they could hear the spiders creeping on the ceiling there it was again a stealthy step on the gravel troubridge and lee crouched down breathless one minute two five but it did not come again at length they both moved as if by concert and lee said possum not a bit said troubridge and then lee lay down again and slept in the light of the flickering fire one giant arm was thrown around his head and the other hung down in careless grace the great chest was heaved up and the head thrown back the seamed and rugged features seemed more stern and marked than ever in the chiaroscuro and the whole man was a picture of reckless strength such as one seldom sees tom had dozed and had awoke again and now sat thinking what a terrible tough customer that fellow would be when suddenly he crouched on the floor and reaching out his hand touched lee who woke and silently rolled over with his face towards the window there was no mistake this timethat was no opossum there came the stealthy step again and now as they lay silent the glassdoor was pushed gently open showing the landscape beyond the gibbous moon was just rising over the forest all blurred with streaky clouds and between them and her light they could see the figure of a man standing inside the room tom could wait no longer he started up and fell headlong with a crash over a little table that stood in his way they both dashed into the garden but only in time to hear flying footsteps and immediately after the gallop of a horse the echoes of which soon died away and all was still missed him by george said lee it was a precious close thing though what could he mean by coming into the houseeh just as i expected trying to get an interview with the mistress he will be more cautious in future i take it i wonder if he will try again dont know said troubridge he might not tonight however they went in and lay down again and troubridge was soon asleep and very soon that sleep was disturbed by dreadful dreams at one time he thought he was riding madly through the bush for his bare life spurring on a tired horse which was failing every moment more and more but always through the treestems on his right he saw glancing a ghost on a white horse which kept pace with him do what he would now he was among the precipices on the ranges on his left a lofty inaccessible cliff on the right a frightful blue abyss while the slaty soil kept sliding from beneath his horses feet behind him unseen came a phantom always gaining on him and driving him along the giddiest wallaby tracks if he could only turn and face it he might conquer but he dare not at length the path grew narrower and narrower and he turned in desperation and awokewoke to see in the dim morning light a dark figure bending over him he sprang up and clutched it by the throat a most excellent fellow this said the voice of doctor mulhaus he sends a frantic midnight message for his friend to come to him regardless of personal convenience and horseflesh and when this friend comes quietly in and tries to wake him without disturbing the sick folks he seizes him by the throat and nearly throttles him i beg a thousand pardons doctor said tom i had been dreaming and i took you for the devil i am glad to find my mistake you have good reason said the doctor but now how is the patient asleep at present i believe the housekeeper is with her what is the matter with her she has had a great blow it has shaken her intellect i am afraid what sort of a blow asked the doctor tom hesitated he did not know whether to tell him or not nay said the doctor you had better let me know i can help then you know now for instance has she heard of her husband she has doctor how on earth came you to guess that a mere guess though i have always thought it quite possible as the accounts of his death were very uncertain tom then set to work and told the doctor all that we know he looked very grave this is far worse than i had thought he said and remained thoughtful mary awoke in a fever and delirious they kept charles as much from her as possible lest she should let drop some hint of the matter to the boy but even in her delirium she kept her secret well and towards the evening the doctor finding her quieter saddled his horse and rode away ten miles to a township where resided a drunken surgeon one of the greatest blackguards in the country the surgeon was at home he was drunk of course he always was but hardly more so today than usual so the doctor hoped for success in his object which was to procure a certain drug which was neither in the medicinechest at the buckleys nor at toonarbin and putting on his sweetest smile when the surgeon came to the door he made a remark about the beauty of the weather to which the other very gruffly responded i come to beg a favour said doctor mulhaus can you let me have a littleso and so see you dd first was the polite reply a man comes a matter of fourteen thousand miles makes a pretty little practice and then gets it cut into by a parcel of ignorant foreigners whose own country is too hot to hold them and not content with this they have the brass to ask for the loan of a mans drugs as i said before ill see you dd first and then i wont and so saying he slammed the door doctor mulhaus was beside himself with rage for the first and last time since i have known him he forgot his discretion and instead of going away quietly and treating the man with contempt he began kicking at the door calling the man a scoundrel c and between the intervals of kicking roaring through the keyhole bring out your diploma do you hear you impostor and then fell to work kicking again bring out your forged diploma will you you villain this soon attracted the idlers from the publichouse a couple of sawyers a shepherd or two all tipsy of course except one of the sawyers who was drunk the drunken sawyer at length made out to his own complete satisfaction that doctor mulhaus wife was in labour and that he was come for the surgeon who was probably drunk and asleep inside so being able to sympathize having had his wife in the straw every thirteen months regularly for the last fifteen years he prepared to assist and for this purpose took a stone about half a hundredweight and coming behind the doctor when he was in full kick he balanced himself with difficulty and sent it at the lock with all the force of his arm and of course broke the door in in throwing the stone he lost his balance came full butt against dr mulhaus propelled him into the passage into the arms of the surgeon who was rushing out infuriated to defend his property and down went the three in the passage together the two doctors beneath and the drunken sawyer on the top of them the drunken surgeon if to use parliamentary language he will allow me to call him so was of course underneath the others but being a londoner and consequently knowing the use of his fists ere he went down delivered a one two straight from the shoulder in our poor dear doctors face and gave him a most disreputable black eye besides cutting his upper lip open this our doctor being you must remember a foreigner and not having the rules of the british ring before his eyes resented by getting on the top of him taking him round the throat and banging the back of his head against the brick floor of the passage until he began to goggle his eyes and choke meanwhile the sawyer exhilarated beyond measure in his drunken mind at having raised a real good promising row having turned on his back lay procumbent upon the twain and kicking everything soft or human he came across with his heels struck up the bay of biscay oh until he was dragged forth by two of his friends and being in a state of wild excitement ready to fight the world hit his own mate a violent blow in the eye and was only quieted by receiving a sound thrashing and being placed in a sitting posture in the verandah of the public house from which he saw doctor mulhaus come forth from the surgeons with rumpled feathers but triumphant i am deeply grieved to have recorded the above scene but i could not omit it having undertaken to place the character of that very noble gentleman doctor mulhaus before my readers i was forced not to omit this as a general rule he was as selfcontained as calm and as frigid as the best englishman among us but under all this there was to speak in carefullyselected scientific language a substratum of pepperbox which has been apparent to me on more than one occasion i have noticed the above occasion per force let the others rest in oblivion a man so true so wise so courteous and so kindly needs not my poor excuses for having once in a way made a fool of himself he will read this and he will be angry with me for a time but he knows well that i like all who knew him say heartily god bless you old doctor but the consequences of the above were i am sorry to say eminently disastrous the surgeon got a warrant against doctor mulhaus for burglary with violence and our doctor got a warrant against him for assault with intent to rob so there was the deuce to pay the affair got out of the hands of the bench in fact they sent both parties for trial what do you think of that my lord campbell in order to ge rid of the matter and at sessions the surgeon swore positively that doctor mulhaus had assisted by a convict battered his door down with stones in open day and nearly murdered him then in defence doctor mulhaus called the sawyer who as it happened had just completed a contract for fencing for mrs mayford the proceeds of which bargain he was spending at the publichouse when the thing happened and had just undertaken another for one of the magistrates having also a large family dependent on him being too a man who prided himself in keeping an eye to windward and being slightly confused by a trifling attack of delirium tremens diddleums he called it he i say to our doctors confusion and horror swore positively that he never took a stone in his hand on the day in question that he never saw a stone for a week before or after that date that he did not deny having rushed into the passage to assist the complainant drunken surgeon seeing him being murdered by defendant and lastly that he was never near the place on the day specified so it would have gone hard with our doctor had not his honour called the jurys attention to the discrepancies in this witnesss evidence and when dr mulhaus was acquitted delivered a stinging reproof to the magistrates for wasting public time by sending such a trumpery case to a jury but on the other hand dr mulhaus charge of assault with intent fell dead so that neither party had much to boast of the night or so after the trial was over the doctor came back to toonarbin in what he intended for a furious rage but having told tom troubridge the whole affair and having unluckily caught toms eye they two went off into such hearty fits of laughter that poor mary now convalescent but still in bed knocked at the wall to know what the matter was chapter xxxii which is the last chapter but one in the second volume the state of terror and dismay into which poor mary hawker was thrown on finding that her husband now for many years the bete noir of her existence was not only alive but promising fairly to cause her more trouble than ever he did before superadded let me say for mere truths sake to a slight bilious attack brought on by good living and want of exercise threw her into a fever from which after several days delirium she rose much shattered and looking suddenly older all this time the doctor like a trusty dog had kept his watch and done more and with a better will than any paid doctor would have been likely to do he was called away a good deal by the prosecution arising out of that unhappy affair with the other doctor and afterwards with a prosecution for perjury which he brought against the sawyer but he was generally back at night and was so kind so attentive and so skilful that mary took it into her head and always affirmed afterwards that she owed her life to him she was not one to receive any permanent impression from anything so now as day by day she grew stronger she tried to undervalue the mischief which had at first so terrified her and caused her illnesstried and with success in broad daylight but in the silent dark nights as she lay on her lonely bed she would fully appreciate the terrible cloud that hung over her and would weep and beat her pillow and pray in her wild fantastic way to be delivered from this frightful monster cut off from communion with all honest men by his unutterable crimes but who nevertheless she was bound to love honour and obey till death should part her from him mrs buckley on the first news of her illness had come up and taken her quarters at toonarbin acting as gentle a nurse as man or woman could desire to have she took possession of the house and managed everything mrs barker the housekeeper the only one who did not submit at once to her kindly rule protested obstructed protocolled presented an ultimatum and at last was so ill advised as to take up arms there was a short campaign lasting only one morninga decisive battleand mrs barker was compelled to sue for peace had mr troubridge been true to himself she said she would never have submitted but having given tom warning and tom in a moment of irritation having told her without hesitation or disguise to go to the devil no less she bowed to the circumstances and yielded agnes buckley encouraged dr mulhaus too in his legal affairs and i fear was the first person who proposed the prosecution for perjury against the sawyer a prosecution however which failed in consequence of his mate and another friend who was present at the affair coming forward to the sawyers rescue and getting into such a labyrinth and mist of perjury that the bench this happened just after quarter sessions positively refused to hear anything more on either side altogether agnes buckley made herself so agreeable and kept them all so alive that tom wondered how he had got on so long without her at the end of three weeks mary was convalescent and one day when she was moved into the verandah mrs buckley beside her tom and the doctor sitting on the step smoking and charles sleepily reading aloud hamlet with a degree of listlessness and want of appreciation unequalled i should say by any reader before at such time i say there entered suddenly to them a littlecattle dealer as brimful of news as an egg of meat little burnside it was a man about eight stone nothing who always wore topboots and other peoples clothes as he came in charles recognised on his legs a pair of cord breeches of his own with a particular grease patch on the thigh a pair of breeches he had lent burnside and which burnside had immediately got altered to his own size a good singer was burnside a man who could finish his bottle of brandy and not go to bed in his boots a man universally liked and trusted an honest hearty little fellow yet one who always lent or spent his money as fast as he got it and was as poor as job the greatest vehicle of news in the district too snowy river times he used to be called after the usual greetings tom seeing he was bursting with something asked him whats the news burnside was in the habit of saying that he was like the lord mayors foolfond of everything that was good but his greatest pleasure the one to which he would sacrifice everything was retailing a piece of news this was so great an enjoyment with him that he gloried in dwelling on it and making the most of it he used to retail a piece of news as a perfect novel in three volumes in his first he would take care to ascertain that you were acquainted with the parties under discussion and if you were not make you so throwing in a few anecdotes illustrative of their characters in in his second he would grow discursive giving an episode or two and dealing in moral reflections and knowledge of human nature rather largely and in his third he would come smash crash down on you with the news itself and leave you gasping he followed this plan on the present occasion he answered toms question by asking do you know desborough of course i do said tom and a noble good fellow he is exactly said burnside super of police distinguished in indian wars nephew of my lord covetown an irishman is desborough but far from objectionable this by way of first volume now comes his second now sir i although a scotchman born and naturally proud of being so consider that until these wretched national distinctions between the three great nations are obliterated we shall never get on sir never that the scotch sir are physically and intellectually superior physically and intellectually the devil burst in tom pick out any dozen scotchmen and ill find you a dozen londoners who will fight them or deal with them till theyd be glad to get over the borders again as for the devon and cornish lads find me a scotchman who will put me on my back and ill write you a cheque for a hundred pounds my boy we english opened the trade of the world to your little two millions and ahalf up in the north there and you being pretty well starved out at home have had the shrewdness to take advantage of it and now by jove you try to speak small of the bridge that carried you over what did you do towards licking the spaniards eh and where would you be now if they had not been licked in eh not in australia my boy a frenchman is conceited enough but by george he cant hold a candle to a scotchman tom spoke in a regular passion but there was some truth in what he said i think burnside didnt like it and merely saying you interrupt me sir went on to his third volume without a struggle you are aware ladies that there has been a gang of bushrangers out to the north headed by a miscreant whom his companions call touan but whose real name is a mystery mrs buckley said yes and tom glanced at mary she had grown as pale as death and tom said courage cousin dont be frightened at a name well sir continued burnside putting the forefinger and thumb of each hand together as if he was making windows with soapsuds captain desborough has surprised that gang in a gully sir and spreading his hands out right and left obliterated them the devil said tom while the doctor got up and stood beside mary smashed them sir continued burnside extinguished them utterly he had six of his picked troopers with him and they came on them suddenly and brought them to bay you see two troopers have been murdered lately and so our men when they got face to face with the cowardly hounds broke discipline and wouldnt be held they hardly fired a shot but drew their sabres and cut the dogs down almost to a man three only out of twelve have been captured alive and one of them is dying of a wound in the neck and having finished little burnside folded his arms and stood in a military attitude with the air of a man who had done the thing himself and was prepared to receive his meed of praise with modesty courage mary said tom dont be frightened at shadowshe felt something sticking in his throat but spoke out nevertheless and their redoubted captain he asked what has become of him what touan himself said burnside well i am sorry to say that that chivalrous and highminded gentleman was found neither among the dead nor the living not to mince matters sir he has escaped the doctor saw marys face quiver but she bore up bravely and listened escaped has he said tom and do they know anything about him desborough who told me this himself said burnside says no that he is utterly puzzled he had made sure of the archrascal himself but with that remarkable faculty of saving his own skin which he has exhibited on more than one occasion he has got off for the time with one companion a companion eh yes said burnside whereby hangs a bit of romance if i may profane the word in speaking of such men his companion is a young fellow described as being more like a beautiful woman than a man and bearing the most singular likeness in features to the great captain touan himself who as you have heard is a handsome dog in short there is very little doubt that they are father and son tom thought to himself who on earth can this be what son can george hawker have and we not know of it he turned to burnside what age is the young man you speak of he asked twenty or thereabouts by all description said the other tom thought again this gets very strange he could have no son of that age got in van diemens land it was eight years before he was free it must be some one we know of he had some byeblows in devon by all accounts if this is one of them how the deuce did he get here but he could not think we shall see presently who it was now we must leave these good folks for a time and just step over to garoopna and see how affairs go there chapter xxxiii in which james brentwood and samuel buckley esquires combine to disturb the rest of captain brentwood ra and succeed in doing so the morning after cecil mayford had made his unlucky offer to alice he appeared at sams bedside very early as if he had come to draw priams curtains and told him shortly that he had spoken and had been received with contempt that he was a miserable brute and that he was going back home to attend to his businessunder the circumstances the best thing he could possibly do so the field was clear for sam but he let matters stay as they were being far too pleasant to disturb lightly being also to tell the truth a little uncertain of his ground after poor cecil had suffered so severely in the encounter the next day too his father and mother went home and he thought it would be only proper for him to go with them but on proposing it jim quietly told him he must stay where he was and work hard for another week and halbert although a guest of the buckleys was constrained to remain still at the brentwoods in company with sam but at the end of a week they departed and jim went back with them leaving poor alice behind alone with her father sam turned when they had gone a little way and saw her white figure still in the porch leaning in rather a melancholy attitude against the doorpost the audacious magpie had perched himself on the top of her head from which proud elevation he hurled wrath scorn and mortal defiance against them as they rode away sam took off his hat and as he went on kept wondering whether she was thinking of him at all and hoping that she might be sorry that he was gone probably however he thought she is only sorry for her brother they three stayed at baroona a week or more one of them riding up every day to ask after mary hawker otherwise they spent their time shooting and fishing and speculating how soon the rains would come for it was now march and autumn was fairly due but at the end of this week as the three were sitting together one of those longlegged slabsided lean sunburnt cabbagetreehatted lads of whom captain brentwood kept always say halfadozen and the major four or five i should fancy no relation to one another and yet so exactly alike that captain brentwood never called them by their right names by any chance lads who were employed about the stable and the paddock always in some way with the horses one of those representatives of the rising australian generation i say looked in and without announcing himself or touching his hat an australian never touches his hat if he is a free man because the prisoners are forced to came up to jim across the drawingroom as quiet and as selfpossessed as if he was quite used to good society and putting a letter into his hand said merely miss alice and relapsed into silence amusing himself by looking round mrs buckleys drawingroom the like of which he had never seen before sam envied jim the receipt of that little threecornered note he wondered whether there was anything about him in it jim read it and then folded it up again and said hallo the ladi always call that sort of individual a lad there is no other word for them though they are of all ages from sixteen to twentythe lad i say was so taken up with the contemplation of a blownglass pressepapier on the table that jim had to say hallo there john the lad turned round and asked in a perfectly easy manner what the deuce is this thing for now that said jim is the button of a chinese mandarins hat who was killed at the battle of waterloo in the united states by major buckley is it now said the lad quite contented its very pretty may i take it up of course you may said jim now whats the foal like rather leggy i should say he returned is there any answer jim wrote a few lines with a pencil on half his sisters note and gave it him he put it in the lining of his hat and had got as far as the door when he turned again he looked wistfully towards the table where the pressepapier was lying it was too much for him he came back and took it up again what he wanted with it or what he would have done with it if he had got it i cannot conceive but it had taken his simple fancy more probably than an emerald of the same size would have done at last he put it to his eye why darn my cabbagetree he said if you cant see through it he wouldnt sell it i suppose now jim pursed his lips and shook his head as though to say that such an idea was not to be entertained and the lad with a sigh laid it down and departed then jim with a laugh threw his sisters note over to sam i discovered this very same note only last week while searching the buckley papers for information about the family at this period i have reason to believe that it has never been printed before and as far as i know there is no other copy extant so i proceed to give it in full what a dear disagreeable old jim you are it begins to stay away there at baroona leaving me moping here with our daddy who is calculating the explosive power of shells under water at various temperatures i have a good mind to learn the differential calculus myself only on purpose to bore you with it when you come home by the bye corrella has got a foal such a dear little duck of a thing with a soft brown nose and sweet long ears like leaves do come back and see it i am so very very lonely i hope mr halbert is pretty well and that his wound is getting quite right again dont let him undertake cattledrafting or anything violent i wish you could bring him back with you he is such a nice agreeable creature your magpie has attacked cocky and pulled a yellow feather out of his crest which he has planted in the flowerbed either as a trophy or to see if it will grow now this letter is historically important when taken in connexion with certain dates in my possession it was written on a monday and halbert jim and sam started back to garoopna the next day rather a memorable day for sam as you will see directly now i wish to call attention to the fact that sam far from being invited is never once mentioned in the whole letter therefore what does miss burke mean by her audacious calumnies what does she mean by saying that alice made love to sam and never gave the poor boy a chance of escape can she lesbia put her hand on her heart and say that she wasnt dying to marry sam herself though she was and is still very likely thirty years his senior the fact is lesbia gave herself the airs and received the privileges of being the handsomest woman in those parts till alice came and put her nose out of joint for which she never forgave her however to return to this letter i wonder now as i am looking at the agestained paper and faded writing whether she who wrote it contemplated the possibility of its meeting sams eye i rather imagine that she did from her provoking silence about him at any rate jim was quite justified in showing him the letter for you know he said as there is nothing at all about you in it there can be no breach of confidence well said sam when he had read it well said jim let us all three ride over and look at the foal so they went and were strictly to be home at dinner time whereas not one of them came home for a week when they came to the door at garoopna there was alice most bewitchingly beautiful papa was away on the run and dr mulhaus with him so the three came in alice was very glad to see halbertwas glad also to see sam but not so glad or at all events did not say so much about it alice have you seen the newspaper said jim no why there is a great steamer gone down at sea and three hundred persons drowned what a horrible thing i should never have courage to cross the sea you would soon get accustomed to it i think said halbert i have never even seen it as yet she said save at a distance strange neither have i said sam i have dim recollections of our voyage here but i never stood upon the shore in my life i have beat you there said jim i have been down to cape chatham and seen the great ocean itself a very different thing from sydney harbour i promise you you see the great cape running out a mile into the sea and the southern rollers tumbling in over the reefs like cascades let us go and see ithow far is it said alice about thirty miles the barkers station is about half a mile from the cape and we could sleep there you know it strikes me as being a most brilliant idea said sam and so the arrangement was agreed to and the afternoon went on pleasantly alice walked up and down with sam among the flowers while jim and halbert lay beneath a mulberry tree and smoked they talked on a subject which had engaged their attention a good deal lately jims whim for going soldiering had grown and struck root and become a determination he would go back to india when halbert did supposing that his father could be tempted to buy him a commission surely he might manage to join some regiment in india he thought india was the only place worth living in just now i hope halbert he said that the governor will consent i wouldnt care when i went the sooner the better i am tired of being a cattledealer on a large scale i want to get at some mans work if one thing were settled i would go tomorrow and what is that said halbert jim said nothing but looked at the couple among the flowerbeds is that all said halbert what will you bet me that that affair is not concluded tonight ill bet you five pounds to one it aint said jim nor any time this twelvemonth theyll go on shillyshallying half their lives i believe nevertheless ill bet with you five to one it comes off tonight now there goes your sister into the house just go in after her jim sauntered off and sam came and laid his great length down by the side of halbert they talked on indifferent matters for a few minutes till the latter said you are a lucky fellow sam with regard to what said sam with regard to miss buckley i mean what makes you think so are you blind sam cant you see that she loves you better than any man in the world he answered nothing but turning his eyes upon halbert gazed at him a moment to see whether he was jesting or no no he was in earnest so he looked down on the grass again and tearing little tufts up said what earthly reason have you for thinking that what reasonfifty thousand reasons can you see nothing in her eyes when she speaks to you which is not there at other times hey bati can if you cant if i could think so said sam if i could find out when i want to find out anything i generally ask said halbert sam gave him the full particulars of cecils defeat all the better for you said halbert depend upon it i dont know much about women it is true but i know more than you do i wish i knew as much as you do said sam and i wish i knew as little as you do said halbert dinnertime came but the captain and the doctor were not to the fore after some speculations as to what had become of them and having waited an hour jim said that in the unexplained absence of the crowned head he felt it his duty to the country to assume the reins of government and order dinner prime minister alice having entered a protest offered no further opposition and dinner was brought in young folks dont make so much of dinner as old ones at any time and this dinner was an unusually dull one sam was silent and thoughtful and talked little alice too was not quite herself jim as usual ate like a hero but talked little so the conversation was principally carried on by halbert in the narrative style who really made himself very useful and agreeable and i am afraid they would have been a very slow party without him soon after the serious business of eating was over jim said alice i wonder what the governor will say about what brother about my going soldiering save us what new crotchet is this only that im going to bother the governor till he gets me a commission in the army are you really serious jim i never was more so in my life so mr halbert said alice looking round at him you are only come to take my brother away from me i assure you miss brentwood that i have only aided and abetted the idea was his own well well i see how it iswe were too happy i suppose but alice said jim wont you be proud to see your brother a good soldier proud i was always proud of you but i wish the idea had never come into your head if it was in war time i would say nothing but now it is very different well gentlemen i shall leave you to your wine mr halbert i like you very much but i wish you hadnt turned jims head she left them and walked down the garden through the twilight among the vines which were dropping their yellow leaves lightly on the turf before the breath of the autumn evening so jim was goinggoing to be killed probably or only coming back after ten years absence full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard she knew well how her father would jump at his first hint of being a soldier and would move heaven and earth to get him a commissionyes he would goher own darling funny handsome jim and she would be left all alone no not quite there is a step on the path behind her that she knows there is an arm round her waist which was never there before and yet she starts not as a low voice in her ear says alice my love my darling i have come after you to tell you that you are dearer to me than my life and all the world besides can you love me half as well as i love you alice will you be my wife what answer her hands pressed to her face with flood of happy tears she only says oh im so happy sam so glad so glad pipe up there goldenvoiced magpie give us one song more before you go to roost laugh out old jackass till you fetch an echo back from the foggy hollow up on your bare boughs it is dripping dreary autumn but down here in the vineyard are bursting the first green buds of an immortal spring there are some scenes which should only be undertaken by the hand of a master and which attempted by an apprentice like myself would only end in disastrous failure calling down the wrath of all honest men and true critics upon my devoted headnot undeservedly three men in a century or thereabouts could write with sufficient delicacy and purity to tell you what two such young lovers as sam buckley and alice brentwood said to one another in the garden that evening walking up and down between the yellow vines i am not one of those three where charles dickens has failed i may be excused from being diffident i am an old bachelor tooa further excuse but no one can prevent my guessing and i guess accordinglythat they talked in a very low tone and when after an hour alice said it was time to come in that sam was quite astonished to find how little had been said and what very long pauses there had been they came in through the window into the sittingroom and there was dr mulhaus captain brentwood and also of all people major buckley whom the other two had picked up in their ride and brought home my information about this period of my history is very full and complete it has come to my knowledge on the best authority that when sam came forward to the light halbert kicked jims shins under the table and whispered you have lost your money old fellow and that jim answered i wish it was ten pounds instead of five but old folks are astonishingly obtuse neither of the three seniors saw what had happened but entered con amore into the proposed expedition to cape chatham and when bedtime came captain brentwood honest gentleman went off to rest and having said his prayers and wound up his watch prepared for a comfortable nights rest as if nothing was the matter he soon found his mistake he had got his boots off and was sitting pensively at his bedside meditating further disrobements when jim entered mysteriously and quietly announced that his whole life in future would be a weary burden if he didnt get a commission in the army or at least a cadetship in the east india companys service him the captain settled by telling that if he didnt change his mind in a month hed see about it and so packed him off to bed secondly as he was taking off his coat wondering exceedingly at jims communication sam appeared and humbly and respectfully informed him that he had that day proposed to his daughter and been acceptedprovisionally hoping that the captain would not disapprove of him as a soninlaw he was also rapidly packed off to bed by the assurance that he brentwood had never felt so happy in his life and had been sincerely hoping that the young folks would fall in love with one another for a year past so sam dismissed the captain got into bed but as soon as the light was blown out two native cats began grunting under the washingstand and he had to get out and expel them in his shirt and finally he lost his temper and began swearing is a man never to get to sleep said he the devil must be abroad tonight if ever he was in his life no sleep that night for captain brentwood his son asking for a commission in the army and his daughter going to be married both desirable enough in their way but not the sort of facts to go to sleep over particularly when fired off in his ear just as he was lying down so he lay tossing about more or less uncomfortable all night but dozed off just as the daylight began to show more decidedly in the window he appeared to have slept from thirty to thirtyfive seconds when jim awoke him with its time to get up father if you are going to cape chatham today dn cape chatham was his irreverent reply when jim was gone which sentiment has been often reechoed by various coasting skippers in later times why i havent been to sleep ten minutesand a frosty morning too i wish it would rain i am not vindictive but i do indeed cant the young fools go alone i wonder no hang it ill make myself agreeable today at all events chapter xxxiv how they all went hunting for sea anemones at cape chathamand how the doctor got a terrible frightand how captain blockstrop showed that there was good reason for it and presently the captain half dressed working away at his hair with two very stiff brushes betook himself to major buckleys room whom he found shaving ill wait till youre done said he i dont want you to cut yourself and then he resumed buckley your son wants to marry my daughter shows his good taste said the major what do you think of it i am very much delighted said the captain and what does she say to it she is very much delighted and i am very much delighted and i suppose sam is too so there you are you see all agreed and that was the way the marriage negotiations proceeded indeed it was nearly all that was ever said on the subject but one day the major brought two papers over to the captain who signed them which were supposed to refer to settlements and after that all the arrangements were left to alice and mrs buckley they started for cape chatham about nine oclock in the day halbert and jim first then sam and alice and lastly the three elders this arrangement did not last long however for very soon sam and alice called aloud to halbert and jim to come and ride with them for that they were boring one another to death this they did and now the discreet and sober conversation of the oldsters was much disturbed by loud laughter of the younger folks in which however they could not help joining it was a glorious crystal clear day in autumn all nature aroused from her summers rest had put off her suit of hodden grey and was flaunting in gaudiest green the atmosphere was so amazingly pure that miles away across the plains the travellers could distinguish the herds of turkeys bustards stalking to and fro while before them that noble maritime mountain cape chatham towered up sharply defined above the gleaming haze which marked the distant sea for a time their way lay straight across the broad wellgrassed plains marked with ripples as though the retiring sea had but just left it then a green swamp through the tall reeds the native companion king of cranes waded majestic the brilliant porphyry water hen with scarlet bill and legs flashed like a sapphire among the emerald green watersedge a shallow lake dotted with wild ducks here and there a group of wild swan black with red bills floating calmly on its bosom a long stretch of grass as smooth as a bowlinggreen a sudden rocky rise clothed with native cypress exocarpusoh my botanical readers honeysuckle banksia sheoak casuarina and here and there a stunted gum cape chatham began to show grander and nearer topping all and soon they saw the broad belt of brown sandy heath that lay along the shore here said the doctor riding up we leave the last limit of the lava streams from mirngish and the organhill now immediately you shall see how we pass from the richlygrassed volcanic plains into the barren sandstone heaths from a productive pasture land into a useless flowergarden nature here is economical as she always is she makes her choicest ornamental efforts on spots otherwise useless you will see a greater variety of vegetation on one acre of your sandy heath than on two square miles of the thicklygrassed country we have been passing over it was as he said they came soon on to the heath a dark dreary expanse dull to look upon after so long a journey upon the bright green grass it stretched away right and left interminably only broken here and there with islands of dullcoloured trees as melancholy a piece of country as one could conceive yet far more thickly peopled with animal as well as vegetable life than the rich pastoral downs further inland now they began to see the little red brush kangaroo and the grey forester skipping away in all directions and had it been summer they would have been startled more than once by the brown snake and the copper snake deadliest of their tribe the painted quail and the brush quail the largest of australian game birds i believe whirred away from beneath their horses feet and the ground parrot green with mottlings of gold and black rose like a partridge from the heather and flew low here too the doctor flushed a whites thrush close to an outlying belt of forest and got into a great state of excitement about it the only known bird he said which is found in europe america and australia alike then he pointed out the emu wren a little tiny brown fellow with long hairy tailfeathers flitting from bush to bush and then leaving ornithology called their attention to the wonderful variety of low vegetation that they were riding through hakeas acacias grevilleas and what not in spring this brown heath would have been a brilliant mass of flowers but now nothing was to be seen save a few tall crimson spikes of epacris and here and there a bunch of lemoncoloured correas altogether he kept them so well amused that they were astonished to come so quickly upon the station placed in a snug cove of the forest where it bordered on the heath beside a sluggish creek then seeing the mountain towering up close to them and hearing as they stayed at the door a low continuous thunder behind a high roll in the heath which lay before them they knew that the old ocean was close at hand and their journey was done the people at the station were very glad to see them of course barker the paterfamilias was an old friend of both the major and the captain and they found so much to talk about that after a heavy middaymeal excellent in kind though that kind was coarse and certain libations of pale ale and cold claret and water the older of the party with the exception of dr mulhaus refused to go any farther so the young people started forth to the cape under the guidance of george barker the fourth or fifth son who happened to be at home doctor said alice as they were starting do you remark what beautiful smooth grass covers the cape itself while here we have nothing but this scrubby heath the mountain is i suppose some different formation granite my dear young lady said the doctor a cap of granite rising through and partly overlying this sandstone you can always tell one exactly what one wants to know said alice and as they walked forwards somehow got talking to halbert which i believe most firmly had been arranged beforehand with sam for he falling back ranged alongside of the doctor and managing to draw him behind the others turned to him and said suddenly my dear old friend my good old tutor the doctor stopped short pulled out a pair of spectacles wiped them put them on and looked at sam through them for nearly a minute and then said my dear boy you dont mean to say i do doctorlast nightand oh if you could only tell how happy i am at this moment if you could guess at it pooh pooh said the doctor i am not so old as that my dear boy why i am a marrying man myself sam i am so very very glad you have won her and now wear her like a pearl beyond all price i think that she is worthy of you more than that she could not be they shook hands and soon sam was at her side again toiling up the steep ascent they soon distanced the others and went forwards by themselves there was such a rise in the ground seawards that the broad ocean was invisible till they were half way up the grassy down then right and left they began to see the nether firmament stretching away infinitely but the happy lovers paused not till they stood upon the loftiest breezy knoll and seemed alone together between the blue cloudless heaven and another azuresphere which lay beneath their feet a cloudless sky and a sailless sea far beneath them they heard but saw not the eternal surges gnawing at the mountain a few white albatrosses skimmed and sailed below and before seaward the sheets of turf falling away stretched into a shoreless headland fringed with black rock and snowwhite surf she stood there flushed and excited with the exercise her bright hair dishevelled waving in the free seabreeze the most beautiful object in that glorious landscape her noble mate beside her awe wonder and admiration kept both of them silent for a few moments and then she spoke do you know any of the choruses in the messiah asked she no i do not said sam i am rather sorry for it she said because this is so very like some of them i can quite imagine that said sam i can quite imagine music which expresses what we see now something infinitely broad i should say is that nonsense now not to me said alice i imagined said sam that the sea would be much rougher than this in spite of the ceaseless thunder below there it is very calm calm eh said the doctors voice behind them god help the ship that should touch that reef this day though a nautilus might float in safety see how the groundswell is tearing away at those rocks you can just distinguish the long heave of the water before it breaks there is the most dangerous groundswell in the world off this coast should this country ever have a large coasttrade they will find it out in calm weather with no anchorage a great coasting trade has arisen and the doctors remark has proved terribly true let the monumental city and the schomberg the duncan dunbar and the catherine adamson bear witness to it let the drowning cries of hundreds of good sailors who have been missed and never more heard of bear witness that this is the most pitiless and unprotected and even in calm weather the most dangerous coast in the world but jim came panting up and throwing himself on the short turf said so this is the great southern ocean eh how far can one see now halbert about thirty miles and how far to india eh about seven thousand a long way said jim however not so far as to england fancy said halbert one of those old dutch voyagers driving on this unknown coast on a dark night what a sudden end to their voyage yet that must have happened to many ships which have never come home perhaps when they come to explore this coast a little more they may find some old ships ribs jammed on a reef the ribs of some ship whose name and memory has perished the very thing you mention is the case said the doctor down the coast here under a hopeless black basaltic cliff is to be seen the wreck of a very very old ship now covered with coral and seaweed i waited down there for a spring tide to examine her but could determine nothing save that she was very old whether dutch or spanish i know not you english should never sneer at those two nations they were before you everywhere and the chinese before any of us in australia replied halbert if you will just come here said alice where those black rocks are hid by the bend of the hill you get only three colours in your landscape blue sky grey grass and purple sea but look there is a man standing on the promontory he makes quite an eyesore there i wish he would go away i suppose he has as good a right there as any of us answered the doctor but he certainly does not harmonise very well with the rest of the colouring what a strange place he has chosen to stand in looking out over the sea as though he were a shipwrecked marinerthe last of the crew a shipwrecked mariner would hardly wear breeches and boots my dear doctor said jim that man is a stockman not one of ours however said george barker even at this distance i can see that see hes gone strange i know of no way down the cliff thereabouts would you like to come down to the shore so they began their descent to the shore by a winding path of turf among tumbled heaps of granite down towards the rockwalled cove a horseshoe of smooth white sand lying between two long black reefs among whose isolated pinnacles the groundswell leapt and spouted ceaselessly halbert remarked this granite coast is hardly so remarkable as our cornish one there are none of those queer pinnacles and tors one sees there just ready to topple down into the sea this granite is not half so fantastic earthquakes of which you have none in cornwall said the doctor will just account for the difference i have felt one near here quite as strong as your famous lieutenant who capsized the logan stone but now getting on the level sands they fell to gathering shells and seaweeds like children jim trying to see how near he could get to a wave without being caught got washed up like jetsam alice took sams pockethandkerchief and filled it indiscriminately with everything she could lay her hand on principally trochuses as big as ones fist and venusears scarlet outside and after an hour wetfooted and happy dragging a yard or so of seatang behind her she looked round for the doctor and saw him far out on the reef lying flat on his stomach and closely examining a large still pool of salt water contained in the crevices of the rocks he held up his hand and beckoned sam and alice advanced towards him over the slippery beds of seaweed sam bravely burying his feet in the wet clefts and holding out his hand to help her along once there was a break in the reef too broad to be jumped and then for the first time he had her fairly in his arms and swung her across which was undoubtedly very delightful but unfortunately soon over at length however they reached the doctor who was seated like a cormorant on a wet rock lighting a pipe what have you collected he asked show me alice proudly displayed the inestimable treasures contained in sams handkerchief rubbish rubbish said the doctor do you believe in mermaidens of course i do if you wish it said alice have you seen one no but here is one of their flowergardens bend down and look into this pool she bent and looked the first thing she saw was her own exquisite face and sams brown phiz peering over her shoulder a golden tress of hair loosened by the sea breeze fell down into the water and had to be looped up again then gazing down once more she saw beneath the crystal water a bed of flowers dahlias ranunculuses carnations chrysanthemums of every colour in the rainbow save blue she gave a cry of pleasure what are they doctor what do you call them sea anemones in english i believe said the doctor actinias serpulas and sabellas you may see something like that on the european coasts on a small scale but there is nothing i ever have seen like that great crimson fellow with creamcoloured tentacles i do not know his name i suspect he has never been described the common european anemone they call crassicornis is something like him but not half as fine is there any means of gathering and keeping them doctor asked sam we have no flowers in the garden like them no possible means said the doctor they are but lumps of jelly let us come away and get round the headland before the tide comes in they wandered on from cove to cove under the dark cliffs till rounding a little headland the doctor called out here is something in your cornish style halbert a thin wall of granite like a vast buttress ran into the sea pierced by a great arch some sixty feet high aloft all sharp grey stone below wherever the salt water had reached a mass of dark clinging weed while beyond as though set in a dark frame was a soft glimpse of blue sky and snowwhite seabirds there is nothing so grand as that in cornwall doctor said halbert can we pass under it mr barker said alice i should like to go through we have been into none of the caves yet oh yes said george barker you may go through for the next two hours the tide has not turned yet ill volunteer first said the doctor and if theres anything worth seeing beyond ill come for you it was as i said a thin wall of granite which ran out from the rest of the hill seaward and was pierced by a tall arch the blocks which had formerly filled the void now lay weedgrown half buried in sand forming a slippery threshold over these the doctor climbed and looked beyond a little sandy cove reefbound like those they had seen before lay under the dark cliffs and on a waterwashed rock not a hundred yards from him stood the man they had seen on the downs above looking steadily seaward the doctor slipped over the rocks like an otter and approached the man across the smooth sand unheard in the thunder of the surf when he was close upon him the stranger turned and the doctor uttered a low cry of wonder and alarm it was george hawker the doctor knew him in a moment but whether the recognition was mutual he never found out for hawker stepping rapidly from stone to stone disappeared round the headland and the thunderstruck doctor retraced his steps to the arch there were all the young people gathered wondering and delighted but alice came to meet him and said who was that with you just now a mermaid replied he that indeed said alice and what did she say she said go home to your supper you have seen quite enough go home in good time doctor there is something wrong said alice i see it in your face can you trust me and tell me what it is i can trust you so far as to tell you that you are right i dont like the look of things at all i fear there are evil times coming for some of our friends further than this i can say nothing say your prayers and trust god dont tell sam anything about this tomorrow i shall speak to him we wont spoil a pleasant holiday on mere suspicion they rejoined the others and the doctor said come away home now we have seen enough some future time we will come here again you might see this fifty times and never get tired of it after a good scramble they stood once more on the down above and turned to take a last look at the broad blue sea before they descended inland at the first glance seaward halbert exclaimed see there doctor see there a boat its only a whale i think said george barker there was a black speck far out at sea but no whale it was too steady for that all day the air had been calm if anything the breeze was from the north but now a strong wind was coming up from the southeast freshening every moment and bringing with it a pent bank of dark clouds and as they watched the mysterious black speck was topped with white and soon they saw that it was indeed a boat driving before the wind under a spritsail which had just been set that is very strange said george barker can it be a shipwrecked party more likely a mob of escaped convicts from van diemens land said jim if so look out for squalls you george and keep your guns loaded i dont think it can be that jim said sam what could bring them so far north they would have landed more likely somewhere in the straits about the big lakes they may have been driven off shore by these westerly winds which have been blowing the last few days replied jim and kept their boats head northward to get nearer the settlements they will be terribly hungry when they do land for certain whats your opinion doctor i think that wise men should be always prepared we should communicate with captain desborough and set the police on the alert i wonder said sam if that mysterious man we saw today watching on the cliff could have had any connexion with this equally mysterious boat not likely though however if they are going to land tonight they had better look sharp for it is coming on to blow the great bank of cloud which they had been watching away to the southeast was growing and spreading rapidly sending out little black avantcouriers of scud which were hurrying fanlike across the heavens telling the news of the coming storm landward in the west the sun was going down in purple and scarlet splendours but seaward all looked dark and ominous the young folks stood together in the verandah before they went into dinner listening to the wind which was beginning to scream angrily round the corners of the house the rain had not yet gathered strength to fall steadily but was whisked hither and thither by the blast in a few uncertain drops they saw that a great gale was coming up and knew that in a few hours earth and sky would be mingled in furious war how comfortable it is to think that all the animals are under shelter tonight said sam jim my boy i am glad you and i are not camped out with cattle this evening we have been out on nights as bad as this though eh oh lord fancy sitting the saddle all tonight under the breaking boughs wet through no more of that for me old sam no more jolly gallops after cattle or horses for me but i was always a good hand at anything of that sort and i mean to be a good soldier now youll see at dark while they were sitting at dinner the storm was raging round the house in full fury but there in the welllighted room before a good fire they cared little for it when dinner was over the doctor called the captain and the major aside and told them in what manner he had seen and recognised george hawker on the beach that day and raised their fears still more by telling them of that mysterious boat which the doctor thought hawker had been watching for none of them could understand it but all agreed that these things boded no good and so having called their host into their confidence with regard to the boat they quietly loaded all the firearms in the place and put them together in the hall this done they returned to the sittingroom and having taken their grog retired to bed it must be remembered that hitherto major buckley knew nothing of george hawkers previous appearance but the doctor now let him into the secret the majors astonishment and wrath may be conceived at finding that his old protegee mary instead of being a comfortable widow was the persecuted wife of one of the greatest bushrangers known at first he was stunned and confused but ere he slept his clear straightforward mind had come to a determination that the first evil was the worst and that god give him grace he would hand the scoundrel over to justice on the first opportunity sure that he was serving mary best by doing so that night jim and sam lay together in a little room to the windward of the house they were soon fast asleep but in the middle of the night jim was woke by a shake on the shoulder and rousing himself saw that sam was sitting up in the bed my god jim said hei have had such an awful dream i dreamed that those fellows in the boat were carrying off alice and i stood by and saw it and could not move hand or foot i am terribly frightened that was something more than a dream jim you ate too much of that pie at dinner said jim and youve had the nightmarethats what is the matter with you lord bless you i often have the nightmare when i have eaten too much at supper and lie on my back why i dreamed the other night that the devil had got me under the woolpress screwing me down as hard as he could and singing the hundredth psalm all the time that was a much worse dream than yours sam was obliged to confess that it was but still said he i think mine was something more than a dream im frightened still oh nonsense lie down again you are pulling all the clothes off me they lay down and jim was soon asleep but not so sam his dream had taken such hold of his imagination that he lay awake listening to the storm howling around the house now and then he could hear the unearthly scream of some curlew piercing the din and above all he could hear the continuous earthshaking thunder of the surf upon the beach soon after daylight getting halbert to accompany him he went out to have a look at the shore and forcing their way against the driving cutting rain they looked over the low cliff at the furious waste of waters beneath them and saw mountain after mountain of water hurl itself in a cloud of spray upon the shore what terrible waves now said sam yes replied halbert theres no land to windward for six thousand miles or more i never saw heavier seas than those i enjoy this sam it reminds me of a good roaring winters day in old cornwall i like it too said sam it freshens you up how calm the water is to the leeward of the cape yes a capital harbour of refuge that let us go home to breakfast he turned to go but was recalled by a wild shout from sam a ship a ship he ran back and looked over into the seething hell of waters helow was it only a thicker spot in the driving mist or was it really a ship if so god help her small time to deliberate ere he could think twice about it a fullrigged ship about five hundred tons with a closereefed topsail and a rag of a foresail upon her came rushing rolling diving and plunging on apparently heading for the deadly white line of breakers which stretched into the sea at the end of the promontory a queens ship sam a queens ship the tartar for a thousand pounds oh what a pity what a terrible pity only a merchant ship surely said sam did you ever see a merchant ship with six such guns as those on her upper deck and a hundred bluejackets at quarters that is the tartar sam and in three minutes there will be no tartar they had run in their excitement out to the very end of the cape and now the ship was almost under their feet an awful sight to see she was rolling fearfully going dead before the wind now and then she would slop tons of water on her deck and her mainyard would almost touch the water but still the dark clusters of men along her bulwarks held steadfast and the ships head never veered half a point now it became apparent that she would clear the reef by a hundred yards or more and halbert waving his hat cried out well done blockstrop bravely done indeed he is running under the lee of the cape for shelter her majesty has one more shipofwar than i thought she would have had five minutes ago as he spoke she had passed the reef the yards as if by magic swung round and for a moment she was broadside on to the sea one wave broke over her and nought but her masts appeared above a sheet of white foam but ere the water had well done pouring from her open deck ports she was in smooth water her anchor was down and the topsail yard was black with men let us come down sam said halbert very likely they will send a boat ashore as they were scrambling down the leeward side of the cliff they saw a boat put off from the ship and gained the beach in time to meet a midshipman coming towards them he seeing two welldressed gentlemen before him bowed and said good morning very rough weather very indeed said halbert is that the tartar pray that is the tartar yes we were caught in the gale last night and we layto this morning as soon as we recognised the cape we determined to run for this cove where we have been before we had an anxious night last night i assure you we have been terribly lucky if the wind had veered a few more points to the east we should have been done for we never could have beaten off in such a sea as this are you going to sydney no we are in chase of a boat full of escaped convicts from launceston cunning dogs they would not land in the straits we missed them and got across to port phillip and put captain d and his black police on the alert and they have got scent of it and coasted up north we have examined the coast all along but i am afraid they have given us the slip there is such a system of intelligence among them however if they had not landed before last night they have saved us all trouble and if they are ashore we wash our hands of them and leave them to the police halbert and sam looked at one another then the former said last night about an hour before it came on to blow we saw a boat making for this very headland which puzzled us exceedingly and what was stranger still we saw a man on the cape who seemed to be on the lookout that is quite possible replied the midshipman these fellows have a queer system of communication the boat you saw must certainly have been them and if they landed at all they must have landed here i must change the scene here if you please my dear reader and get you to come with me on board his i beg pardon her majestys ship tartar for a few minutes for on the quarterdeck of that noble sloop there are at this moment two men worth rescuing from oblivion the first is a stoutish upright middleaged man in a naval uniform with a brickdust complexion and very light scanty whiskers the jolliest cheeriestlooking fellow you are likely to meet in a years journey such a bright merry blue eye as he has too this is captain blockstrop now i am happy to say cb a right valiant officer as the despatches of lyons and peel will testify the other is a very different sort of mana long wiry brownfaced man with a big forehead and a comical expression about his eyes this is no less a person than the colonial secretary of one of our three great colonies of which i decline to mention those who know the honourable abiram pollifex do not need to be told and those who do not must find out for themselves i may mention that he has been known to retain office seven years in succession and yet he seldom threatens to resign his office and throw himself upon the country fewer than three times and sometimes four per annum latterly i am sorry to say a miserable faction taking advantage of one of his numerous resignations have assumed the reins of government and in spite of three votes of want of confidence persist in retaining the seals of office let me add to this that he is considered the best hand at quiet chaff in the house and is allowed both by his supporters and opponents to be an honourable man and a right good fellow such were the two men who now stood side by side on the quarterdeck looking eagerly at sam and halbert through a pair of telescopes pollifex said the captain what do you make of these gentlemen said the secretary curtly so i make out said the captain and apparently in good condition too a very well fed man that biggest i should say yees well yees said the secretary he does look wellfed enough he must be a stranger to these parts probably from the maneroo plains or thereabout what makes you think so dear me said the secretary have you been stationed nearly three years on this coast and ask how a man could possibly be in good condition living in those scrubby heaths badlooking country eh said the captain small cattlestations sir said the secretary i can see at a glance salt beef very tough and very little of it i shall run a bill through the house for the abolition of small cattlestations next session better get your estimates through first old fellow the bagpipes will play quite loud enough over them to last for some time i know it but tremble not replied the undaunted secretary i have got used to it i fancy i hear callaghan beginning now the unbridled prodigality sir and the reckless profligacy sir of those individuals who have so long under the name of government thatll do now said the captain you are worse than the reality i shall go ashore and take my chance of getting breakfast will you come not if i know it sir with pork chops for breakfast in the cabin blockstrop have you duly reflected what you are about to do you are about to land alone unarmed unprovisioned among the offscourings of white society scarcely superior in their habits of life to the nomadic savages they have unjustly displaced pause and reflect my dear fellow what guarantee have you that they will not propose to feed you on damper or some other nameless abomination of the same sort it was only the other day in the house said the captain that you said the small squatters and freehold farmers represented the greater part of the intelligence and education of the colony and now sir sir said the secretary you dont know what you are talking about sir we are not in the house now are you determined then the captain was quite determined and they went down to the waist they were raising a bag of potatoes from somewhere and the colonial secretary seizing two handfuls of them presented them to the captain if you will go he said take these with you and teach the poor benighted white savages to plant them so if you fall a victim to indigestion we will vote a monument to you on the summit of the cape and writehe did not live in vain he introduced the potato among the small cattle stations around cape chatham he held out his potatoes towards the retiring captain with the air of burke producing the dagger his humour i perceive reads poor enough when written down but when assisted by his comical impassible face and solemn drawling delivery i never heard anything much better good old pollifex my heart warms towards him now when i think what the men were whose clamour put him out of office in i have the conviction forced upon me that the best among them was not worth his little finger he left the colony in a most prosperous state and retiring honourably to one of his stations set to work as he said to begin life again on a new principle he is wealthy honoured and happy as he deserves to be i cannot help although somewhat in the wrong place telling the reader under what circumstances i saw him last only two years ago fifteen after he had left office i happened to be standing with him at the door of a certain club in a certain capital just after lunch time when we saw the then colonial secretary the man who had succeeded pollifex come scurrying round the corner of the street fresh from his office his face was flushed and perspiring his hat was on wrongside before with his veil hanging down his back in the one hand he held papers in the other he supported over his fevered brow his white cotton umbrella altogether he looked harassed beyond the bounds of human endurance but when he caught sight of the open clubdoors he freshened a bit and mended his pace his troubles were not over for ere he reached his haven two irishmen with two different requests rose as if from the earth and confronted him we saw him make two promises contradictory to each other and impossible of fulfilment and as he came up the steps i looked into the face of exsecretary pollifex and saw there an expression which is beyond description say that of the ghost of a man who has been hanged attending an execution or say the expression of a catholic converted by torture watching the action of the thumbscrews upon another heretic the air in short of a man who had been through it all before and as the then secretary came madly rushing up the steps pollifex confronted him and said dont you wish you were me t sir said the secretary dipping his umbrella and dropping his papers for the purpose of rhetorically pointing with his left hand at nothing sir flesh and blood cant stand it i resign tomorrow and so he went in to his lunch and is in office at this present moment i must apologize most heartily for this long digression the captains gig impelled by the might of englands pride was cleverly beached alongside of the other boat and the captain stepped out and confronted the midshipman got any news mr vang yes sir said the midshipman these gentlemen saw the boat yesterday afternoon sam and halbert who were standing behind him came forward the captain bowed and looked with admiration at the two highbredlooking men that this unpromising desert had produced they told him what they had told the midshipman and the captain saidit will be a very serious thing for this country side if these dogs have succeeded in landing let us hope that the sea has done good service in swallowing fourteen of the vilest wretches that ever disgraced humanity pray are either of you gentlemen magistrates my father major buckley is a magistrate said sam this gentleman is lieutenant halbert of the bengal artillery the captain bowed to halbert and turning to sam saidso you are the son of my old friend major buckley i was midshipman in the phlegethon when she took him and part of his regiment to portugal in i met him at dinner in sydney the other day is he in the neighbourhood he is waiting breakfast for us not a quarter of a mile off said sam will you join us i shall be delighted but duty first if these fellows have succeeded in landing you will have to arm and prepare for the worst now unless they were caught by the gale and drowned which i believe to be the case they must have come ashore in this very bay about five oclock last night there is no other place where they could have beached their boat for many miles consequently the thing lies in a nutshell if we find the boat prepare yourselvesif not make yourselves easy let us use our wits a little they would round the headland as soon as possible and probably run ashore in that furthest cove to our right just inside the reef i have examined the bay through a telescope and could make out nothing of her let us come and examine carefully downhaul to his coxswain come with me they passed three or four indentations in the bay examining as they went finding nothing but when they scrambled over the rocks which bounded the cover the captain had indicated he waved his hat and laughing said ha ha just as i thought there she is where captain blockstrop said halbert i dont see her nor i either said the captain but i see the heap of seaweed that the cunning dogs have raked over herdownhaul heave away at this weed and show these gentlemen what is below it the coxswain began throwing away a pile of seatang heaped against a rock bit by bit was disclosed the clean run of a beautiful white whaleboat which when turned over discovered her oars laid neatly side by side with a small spritsail the captain stood by with the air of a man who had made a hit while sam and halbert stared at one another with looks of blank discomfiture and alarm chapter xxxv a council of war this is a very serious matter for us captain blockstrop said sam as they were walking back to the boats an exceedingly serious matter i have only one advice to give you mr buckley said the captain which is unnecessary as it is just what your father will do fight sirhunt em down shoot em they will give you no quarter be sure you dont give them any a wild discordant bellow was here heard from the ship on which the captain slapped his leg and said dash my buttons if he hasnt got hold of my speakingtrumpet the midshipman came up with a solemn face and touching his cap reported colonial secretary hailing sir bless my soul mr vang i can hear that said the captain i dont suppose any of my officer would dare to make such an inarticulate no sailorlike bellow as that on her majestys quarterdeck can you make out what he says that would be more to the purpose again the unearthly bellow came floating over the water happily deadened by the wind which was roaring a thousand feet over head can you make out anything mr vang said the captain i make out porkchops sir said the midshipman take one of the boats on board mr vang my compliments and will be much obliged if he will come ashore immediately on important business say tell him the convicts have landed will you also tell the lieutenant of the watch that i want either mr tacks or mr sheets either will do the boat was soon seen coming back with the colonial secretary in a statesmanlike attitude in the stern sheets and beside him that important officer mr tacks a wee little dot of a naval cadet apparently about ten years old what were you bellowing about porkchops pollifex asked the captain the moment the boat touched the shore a failure sir said the colonial secretary burnt sir disgracefully burnt up to a cinder sir i have been consulting the honourable member for the crossjackyard i allude to mr tacks nc my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so as to the propriety of calling a courtmartial on the cooks mate he informs me that such a course is not usual in naval jurisprudence i am however of opinion that in one of the civil courts of the colony an action for damages would lie surely i have the pleasure of seeing mr buckley of baroona sam and he had met before and the secretary finding himself on shore and where he was known dropped his king cambyses vein and appeared in his real character of a shrewd experienced man they walked up together and when they arrived at the summit of the ridge and saw the magnificent plains stretching away inland beyond the narrow belt of heath along the shore the secretary whispered to the captain i have been deceived we shall get some breakfast after all as fine a country as i ever saw in my life the party who were just sitting down to breakfast at the station were sufficiently astonished to see captain blockstrop come rolling up the garden walk with that small shipofwar tacks sailing in his wake convoying the three civilians but on going in and explaining matters and room having been made for them at the table sam was also astonished on looking round to see that a new arrival had taken place since that morning it was that of a handsome singularlooking man his hair was light his whiskers a little darker and his blonde moustache curled up towards his eyes like corkscrews or a rams horns congratulate me on my simile a very merry laughing eye he had too blue of course with that coloured hair altogether a very pleasantlooking man and yet whose face gave one the idea that it was not at all times pleasant but on occasions might look terribly tigerish and fierce a man who won you at once and yet one with whom one would hardly like to quarrel add to this also that when he opened his mouth to speak he disclosed a splendid set of white teeth and the moment hed uttered a word a stranger would remark to himself that is an irishman sam who had ensconced himself beside alice looked up the long table towards him with astonishment why good gracious captain desborough he said can that be you i have been waiting said desborough with the greatest patience to see how long you would have the audacity to ignore my presence how do you do my small child sam my dear if ever i get cashiered for being too handsome to remain in the service ill carry you about and exhibit you as the biggest and ugliest boy in the australian colonies captain desborough has been mentioned before in these pages he was an officer in the army at the present time holding the situation of inspector of police in this district he was a very famous hunterdown of bushrangers and was heartily popular with every one he was thrown against except the aforesaid bushrangers sam and he were very old friends and were very fond of one another desborough was sitting now at the upper end of the table with the colonial secretary major buckley captain blockstrop captain brentwood and doctor mulhaus they looked very serious indeed it was a very lucky thing desborough said the major that you happened to meet captain blockstrop he has now you perceive handed over the care of these rascals to you it is rather strange that they should have landed here i believe that they were expected said the doctor i believe that there is a desperate scheme of villany afloat and that some of us are the objects of it if you mean said desborough that that man you saw on the cape last night was watching for the boat i dont believe it possible it was possibly some stockman or shepherd having a look at the weather the doctor had it on the tip of his tongue to speak and astound them by disclosing that the lonely watcher was none other than the ruffian touan alias george hawker but the major pressed his foot beneath the table and he was silent well said desborough and thats about all thats to be said at present except that the settlers must arm and watch and if necessary fight if they will only do that said the colonial secretary if they will only act boldly in protecting their property and lives the evil is reduced by onehalf but when brallagan was out nothing that i or the governor could do would induce the majority of them to behave like men look here now said barker the host i was over the water when brallagan was out and when howe was out too and what could a lonely squatter do against halfadozen of em answer me that i dont mean that said the colonial secretary what i refer to is the cowardly way in which the settlers allowed themselves to be prevented by threats from giving information i speak the more boldly mr barker because you were not one of those who did so barker was appeased theres five long guns in my hall and theres five long lads can use em he said bythebye captain desborough let me congratulate you on the short work you made with that gang to the north the other day i am sorry to hear that the principal rascal of the lot captain touan gave you the slip the doctor had been pondering and had made up his mind to a certain course he bent over the table and said i think on the whole that it is better to let you all know the worst that man whom we saw on the cliff last night i met afterwards alone down on the shore and that man is no other than the one you speak of captain touan any one watching desboroughs face as the doctor spoke would have seen his eyebrows contract heavily and a fierce scowl settle on his face the name the doctor mentioned was a very unwelcome one he had been taunted and laughed at at governmenthouse for having allowed hawker to outwit him his hot irish blood couldnt stand that and he had vowed to have the fellow somehow here he had missed him again and by so little too he renewed his vow to himself and in an instant the cloud was gone and the merry irishman was there again my dear doctor he said i am aware that you never speak at random or i should ask you were you sure of the man are you not mistaken mistaken in himeh said the doctor no i was not mistaken you seem to know too much of a very suspicious character doctor said desborough i shall have to keep my eye on you i see meanwhile at the other end of the table more agreeable subjects were being talked of there sat our young coterie laughing loudly grouping themselves round some exceedingly minute object which apparently was between sam and alice and which on close examination turned out to be little tacks who was evidently making himself agreeable in a way hardly to be expected in one of his tender years and this is the way he got there when captain blockstrop came in alice was duly impressed by the appearance of that warrior but when she saw little tacks slip in behind him and sit meekly down by the door and when she saw how his character was appreciated by the cattledogs one of whom had his head in the lads lap while the other was licking his facewhen she saw i say the little blue and gold apparition her heart grew pitiful and turning to halbert she said why good gracious me you dont mean to tell me that they take such a child as that to sea do you oh dear yes said halbert and younger too dont you remember the story about collingwood offering his cake to the first lieutenant he became remember a greater man than nelson in all except worldly honour would you ask him to come and sit by me if you please said alice so halbert went and fetched him in and he sat and had his breakfast between alice and sam they were all delighted with him such a child and yet so bold and selfhelpful making himself quietly at home and answering such questions as were put to him modestly and well would that all midshipmen were like him but it became time to go on board and captain blockstrop coming by where alice sat said laughing i hope you are not giving my officer too much marmalade miss brentwood he is overyoung to be trusted with a jampoteh tacks too young to go to sea i should say said alice not too young to be a bravehearted boy however said the captain the other day in sydney harbour one of my marines who couldnt swim went overboard and this boy soused in after him and carried the lifebuoy to him in spite of sharks what do you think of that for a tenyearold the boys face flushed scarlet as the captain passed on and he held out his hand to alice to say goodbye she took it looked at him hesitated and then bent down and kissed his cheeka tender sisterly kisssomething as jim said to carry on board with him poor little tacks he was a great friend of mine so i have been tempted to dwell on him he came to me with letters of introduction and stayed at my place six weeks or more he served brilliantly and rose rapidly and last year only i heard that lieutenant tacks had fallen in the dust and never risen again just at the moment that the gates of delhi were burst down and our fellows went swarming in to vengeance chapter xxxvi an earthquake a colliery explosion and an adventure so the captain the colonial secretary and the small midshipman left the station and went on board again disappearing from this history for evermore the others all went home and grew warlike arming themselves against the threatened danger but still weeks nay months rolled on and winter was turning into spring and yet the country side remained so profoundly tranquil that every one began to believe that the convicts must after all have been drowned and that the boat found by sagacious blockstrop had been capsized and thrown bottom upwards on the beach so that before the brown flocks began to be spotted with white lambs all alarm had gone by only four persons besides mary hawker herself were conversant of the fact that the bushranger and george hawker were the same man of these only three the doctor major buckley and captain brentwood knew of his more recent appearance on the shore and they after due consultation took honest tom troubridge into their confidence but as i said all things went so quietly for two months that at the end of that time no one thought any more of bushrangers than they would of tigers and just about this time i geoffry hamlyn having finished my last consignment of novels from england and having nothing to do determined to ride over and spend a day or two with major buckley but when i rode up to the door at baroona having pulled my shirt collar up and rapped at the door with my whip out came the housekeeper to inform me there was not a soul at home this was deeply provoking for i had got on a new pair of riding trousers which had cost money and a new white hat with a blue net veil rather a neat thing too and i had ridden up to the house under the idea that fourteen or fifteen persons were looking at me out of window i had also tickled my old horse chanticleer to make him caper and show the excellency of my seat but when i came to remember that the old horse had nearly bucked me over his head instead of capering and to find that my hat was garnished with a large cobweb of what is called by courtesy native silk with halfadozen dead leaves sticking in it i felt consoled that no one had seen me approach and asked the housekeeper with tolerable equanimity where they were all gone they were all gone she said over to captain brentwoods and goodness gracious knew when they would be back again mrs hawker and mr charles were gone with them for her part she should not be sorry when mr sam brought miss brentwood over for good and all the house was terrible lonesome when they were all away i remarked oho and asked whether she knew if mr troubridge was at toonarbin no she said he was away again at port phillip with store cattle making a deal of money she understood and laying out a deal for the major in land she wished he would marry mrs hawker and settle down for he was a pleasant gentleman and fine company in a house wouldnt i get off and have a bit of cold wild duck and a glass of sherry certainly i would so i gave my horse to the groom and went in i had hardly cut the first rich red slice from the breast of a fat teal when i heard a light step in the passage and in walked my man dick you remember him reader the man we saw five and twenty years ago on dartmoor combining with william lee to urge the unhappy george hawker on to ruin and forgery which circumstance remember i knew nothing of at this time the same man i had picked up footsore and penniless in the bush sixteen years ago and who had since lived with me a most excellent and clever servantthe best i ever had this man now came into major buckleys parlour hat in hand looking a little foolish and when i saw him my knife and fork were paralyzed with astonishment why what the dickens i used that strong expression brings you here my lad i went up to hipsleys about the colt he said and when i got home i found you were gone off unexpectedly so i thought it better to come after you and tell you all about it he wont take less than thirtyfive man man i said do you mean to say that you have ridden fifty miles to tell me the price of a leggy beast like that after i had told you that twentyfour was my highest offer he looked very silly and i saw very well he had some other reason for coming than that but with a good servant i never ask too many questions and when i went out a short time after and found him leaning against a fence and talking earnestly to our old acquaintance william lee i thought he wanted an excuse to come up and see his old friend lee that is quite just and proper and fully accounts for it lee always paid me the high compliment of touching his hat to me for old devon sake i suppose hows all at toonarbin lee i asked well and hearty sir how is yourself sir getting older lee nothing worse than that dick i am going on to captain brentwoods if you like to go back to toonarbin and stay a day or two with lee you can do so i would rather come on with you sir he said eagerly are you sure i said quite sure sir and lee said you go on with mr hamlyn dick and do your duty mind i thought this odd but knowing it was useless to ask questions of an old hand or try to get any information which was not volunteered i held my tongue and departed taking dick with me i arrived at captain brentwoods about three oclock in the afternoon i flatter myself that i made a very successful approach and created rather a sensation among the fourteen or fifteen people who were sitting in the verandah they took me for a distinguished stranger but when they saw who it was they all began calling out to me at once to know how i was and to come in as if i wasnt coming in and when at last i got among them i nearly had my hand shaken off and the doctor putting on his spectacles and looking at me for a minute asked what i had given for my hat let me see who was there that day there was mary hawker looking rather older and a little worn and there was her son charles sitting beside pretty ellen mayford and carrying on a terrible flirtation with that young lady in spite of her fat jollylooking mother who sat with folded hands beside her next to her sat her handsome brother cecil looking poor lad as miserable as he well could look although i did not know the cause then came sam beside his mother whose noble happy face was still worth riding fifty miles to see and then standing beside her chair was alice brentwood i had never seen this exquisite creature before and i immediately fell desperately and hopelessly in love with her and told her so that same evening in the presence of sam finding that my affection was not likely to be returned i enrolled myself as one of her knights and remain so to this present time the major sat beside his wife and the doctor and captain brentwood walked up and down talking politics there were also present certain hawbucks leggy youths with brown faces and limp hair in appearance and dress not unlike english steeplechaseriders who had been treated on the face and hands with walnutjuice they never spoke and the number of them then present i am uncertain about but one of them i recollect could spit a great deal farther than any of his brothers and proved it beyond controversy about twice in every three minutes i missed my old friend jim brentwood and was informed that he had gone to sydney on the spree as sam expressed it along with a certain lieutenant halbert who was staying on a visit with major buckley first i sat down by mary hawker and had a long talk with her about old times she was in one of her gay moods and laughed and joked continuously then i moved up by invitation to a chair between the major and his wife and had a long private and confidential conversation with them how i began is tom troubridge tom is perfectly well said the major he still carries on his old chronic flirtation with mary and she is as ready to be flirted with as ever why dont they marry i asked peevishly why on earth dont they marry one another what is the good of carrying on that old folly so long they surely must have made up their minds by now she knows she is a widow and has known it for years good god hamlyn are you so ignorant said the major and then he struck me dumb by telling me of all that had happened latterly of george hawkers reappearance of his identity with the great bushranger and lastly of his second appearance not two months before i tell you this in strict confidence hamlyn as one of my oldest and best friends i know how deeply your happiness is affected by all this i remained silent and thunderstruck for a time and then i tried to turn the conversation have you had any alarm from bushrangers lately i heard a report of some convicts having landed on the coast all a false alarm said the major they were drowned and the boat washed ashore bottom upwards here the doctor broke in hamlyn is not this very queer weather when he called my attention to it i remarked that the weather was really different from any i had seen before and said so the sky was grey and dull the distances were clear and to the eye it appeared merely a soft grey autumnal day but there was something very strange and odd in the deadly stillness of all nature not a leaf moved not a bird sang and the air seemed like lead at once mrs buckley remarked i cant work and i cant talk i am so wretchedly nervous that i dont know what to do with myself and you know my dear she said appealing to her husband that i am not given to that sort of thing each man looked at his neighbour for there was a sound in the air now a weird and awful sound like nothing else in nature to the south arose upon the ear a hollow quivering hum which swelled rapidly into a roar beneath our feet there was a sickening shake a thump a crash and away went the earthquake groaning off to the northward the women behaved very well though some of them began to cry and hearing a fearful row in the kitchen i dashed off there followed by the doctor the interior was a chaos of pots and kettles in the centre of which sat the cook eleanor holding on by the floor every now and then she would give a scream which took all the breath out of her so she had to stop and fetch breath before she could give another the doctor stepped through the saucepans and campovens and trying to raise her said come get up my good woman and give over screaming all the danger is over and you will frighten the ladies at this moment she had got her second wind and as he tried to get her up she gave such a yell that he dropped her again and bolted stopping his ears bolted over a teakettle which had been thrown down and fell prostrate resounding like an homeric hero on to a heap of kitchen utensils at the feet of alice who had come in to come see what the noise was about good lord said he picking himself up what lungs she has got i shall have a singing in my ears to my dying day yar it went through my head like a knife sam picked up the cook and she after a time picked up her pots giving however an occasional squall and holding on by the dresser under the impression that another earthquake was coming we left her however getting dinner under way and went back to the others whom we soon set laughing by telling poor eleanors misadventures we were all in good spirits now a brisk cool wind had come up from the south following the earthquake making a pleasant rustle as it swept across the plain or tossed the forest boughs the sky had got clear and the nimble air was so inviting that we rose as one body to stroll in groups about the garden and wander down to the river the brave old river was rushing hoarsely along clear and full between his ruined templecolumns of basalt as of old what a grand salmonriver this would be major said i what pools and stickles are here ah if we only could get the salmonspawn through the tropics without its germinatingcan you tell me doctor why these rocks should take the form of columns is there any particular reason for it that you know you have asked a very puzzling question he replied and i hardly know how to answer it nine geologists out of ten will tell you that basalt is lava cooled under pressure but i have seen it in places where that solution was quite inapplicable however i can tell you that the same cause which set these pillars here to wall the river piled up yon organhill produced the caves of widderin the great craterhollow of mirngish and accommodated us with that brisk little earthquake which we felt just now for you know that we mortals stand only on a thin crust of cooled matter but beneath our feet is all molten metal i wish you could give us a lecture on these things doctor i said tomorrow said he let us ride forth to mirngish and have a picnic there i will give you a little sketch of the origin of that hill in front of the brentwoods house the plains stretched away for a dozen miles or so a bare sheet of grass with no timber grey in summer green in winter about five miles off it began to roll into great waves and then heaved up into a high bald hill a lofty down capped with black rocks bearing in its side a vast round hollow at the bottom of which was a little swamp perfectly circular fringed with a ring of white gumtrees standing in such an exact circle that it was hard to persuade oneself that they were not planted by the hand of man this was the crater of the old volcano had you stood in it you would have remarked that one side was a shelving steep bank of short grass while the other reared up some five hundred feet a precipice of fireeaten rock at one end the lip had broken down pouring a torrent of lava now fertile grassland over the surrounding country which little gap gave one a delicious bit of blue distance all else as i said was a circular wall of grass rock and tumbled slag this was mirngish and the day after the earthquake there was a fresh eruption in the crater an eruption of horsemen and horsewomen an eruption of talk laughter pinkbonnets knives and forks and champagne many a pleasant echo came ringing back from the old volcanowalls overhead only used for so many ages to hear the wild rattle of the thunder and the scream of the hungry eagle was ever a poor old wornout grassgrown volcano used so badly here into the very pit of tophet had the audacious captain that very morning sent on a springcart of all eatables and drinkables and then had followed himself with a dozen of his friends to eat and drink and talk and laugh just in the very spot where of old roared and seethed the fire and brimstone of erebus yet the good old mountain was civil for we were not blown into the air to be a warning to all people picnicing in high places but when we had eaten and drunk and all the ladies had separately and collectively declared that they were so fond of the smell of tobacco in the open air we followed the doctor who led the way to the summit of the hill i arrived last having dragged dear fat old mrs mayford up the slippery steep the doctor had perched himself on the highest flameworn crag and when we all had grouped ourselves below him and while the wind swept pleasantly through the grass and rushed humming through the ancient rocks he in a clear melodious voice thus began of old the great sea heaved and foamed above the ground on which we stand ay above this and above yon farthest snowy peak which the westering sun begins to tinge with crimson but in the lapse of ten thousand changing centuries the lower deeps acted on by some plutonic agency began to grow shallow and the imprisoned tides began to foam and roar as they struggled to follow the moon their leader angry to find that the stillness of their ancient domain was year by year invaded by the everrising land at that time had man been on the earth to see it those towering alps were a cluster of lofty islands each mountain pass which divides them was a tideswept fiord in and out of which twice in the day age after age rushed the sea bringing down those vast piles of waterworn gravel which you see accumulated and now covered with dense vegetation at the mouth of each great valley so twenty thousand years went on and all this fair champagne country which we overlook became first a sandbank then a dreary stretch of salt saturated desert and then as the roar of the retiring ocean grew fainter and fainter began to sustain such vegetation as the lord thought fit a thousand years are but as yesterday to him and i can give you no notion as to how many hundred thousand years it took to do all this or what productions covered the face of the country it must have been a miserably poor region nothing but the debris of granite sandstone and slate perhaps here and there partially fertilized by rotting seaweed dead fish and shells things which would we may assume have appeared and flourished as the water grew shallower new elements were wanting to make the country available for man so soon to appear in his majesty and new elements were forthcoming the internal fires so long imprisoned beneath the weight of the incumbent earth having done their duty in raising the continent began to find vent in every weak spot caused by its elevation here where we stand in this great crack between the granite and the sandstone they broke out with all their wildest fury hurling stones high in the air making midday dark with clouds of ashes and pouring streams of lava far and wide so the country was desolated by volcanoes but only desolated that it might grow greener and richer than ever with a new and hitherto unknown fertility for as the surface of the lava disintegrated a new soil was found containing all the elements of the old one and many more these are your black clay and your red burnt soil which i take it are some of the richest in the world then our old volcano our familiar mirngish in whose crater we have been feasting grew still for a time for many ages probably but after that i see the traces of another eruption the worst perhaps that he ever accomplished he had exhausted himself and gradually subsided leaving a perfect cup or crater the accumulation of the ashes of a hundred eruptions nay even this may have been filled with water as is mount gambier which you have not seen forming a lake without a visible outlet the water draining off at that level where the looser scoriae begin but he burst out again filling this great hollow with lava till the accumulation of the molten matter broke through the weaker part of the wall and rolled away there out of that gap to the northward and forming what you now call the stony risesturning yon creek into steam which by its explosive force formed that fantastic cap of rocks and swelling into great bubbles under the hot lava made those long underground hollows which we now know as the caves of barcanah is he asleep for ever i know not he may arise again in his wrath and fill the land with desolation for that earthquake we felt yesterday was but a wild throe of the giant struggling to be free let us hope that he may not break his chains for as i stand here gazing on those crimson alps the spirit of prophecy is upon me and i can see far into the future and all the desolate landscape becomes peopled with busy figures i see the sunny slopes below me yellow with trellissed vines they have gathered the vintage and i hear them singing at the winepress they sing that the exhausted vineyards of the old world yield no wine so rare so rich as the fresh volcanic slopes of the southern continent and that the princes of the earth send their wealth that their hearts may get glad from the juice of the australian grapes beyond i see fat black ridges grow yellow with a thousand cornfields i see a hundred happy homesteads halfhidden by clustering wheatstacks what do they want with all that corn say you where is their market there is their market away there on the barren forest ranges see the timber is gone and a city stands there instead what is that on the crest of the hill a steamengine nay see there are five of them working night and day fast and busy their cranks gleam and flash under the same moon that grew red and lurid when old mirngish vomited fire and smoke twenty thousand years ago as i listen i can hear the grinding of the busy quartzmill what are they doing you ask they are goldmining they have found gold here and gold in abundance and hither have come by ship and steamship all the unfortunate of the earth the english factory labourer and the farmerridden peasant the irish pauper the starved scotch highlander i hear a grand swelling chorus rising above the murmur of the evening breeze that is sung by german peasants revelling in such plenty as they never knew before yet still regretting fatherland and then i hear a burst of italian melody replying hungarians are not wanting for all the oppressed of the earth have taken refuge here glorying to live under the free government of britain for she warned by american experience has granted to all her colonies such rights as the british boast of possessing i did not understand him then but since i have seen the living wonder of ballarat i understand him well enough he ceased but the major cried out go on doctor go on look farther yet and tell us what you see give us a bit more poetry while your hand is in he faced round and i fancied i could detect a latent smile about his mouth i see said he a vision of a nation the colony of the greatest race on the earth who began their career with more advantages than ever fell to the lot of a young nation yet war never looked on them not theirs was the lot to fight like the americans through bankruptcy and inexperience towards freedom and honour no freedom came to them heavensent redtapebound straight from downingstreet millions of fertile acres gold in bushels were theirs and yet go on said the major i see a vision of broken railway arches and ruined farms i see a vision of a people surfeited with prosperity and freedom grown factious so that now one party must command a strong majority ere they can pass a law the goodness of which no one denies i see a bankrupt exchequer a drunken governor an irish ministry a come down out of that roared the major before i pull you down youre a pretty fellow to come out for a days pleasure jeremiah was a saint to him he added turning appealingly to the rest of us hear my opinion per contra doctor ill be as near right as you go on then said the doctor i see began the major the anglosaxon race dont forget the irish jews germans chinese and other barbarians interrupted the doctor asserting continued the major scornfully as they always do their right to all the unoccupied territories of the earth blackfellows claims being ignored interpolated the doctor and filling all the harbours of this magnificent country want to see them with their steamships and their sailing vessels say there be gold here as i believe there is the time must come when the mines will be exhausted what then with our coals we shall supply newcastle said the doctor again the british fleets in the east indies and compete with borneo said the doctor quietly which contains more coal than ever india will burn at onetenth the distance from her that we are if that is a specimen of your prophecies major you are but a micaiah after all well said the major laughing i cannot reel it off quite so quick as you but think we shall hardly have time for any more prophesying the sun is getting very low we turned and looked to westward the lofty rolling snowdowns had changed to dull lead colour as the sun went down in a red haze behind them only here and there some little elevated pinnacle would catch the light below the mountain lay vast black sheets of woodland and nearer still was the river marked distinctly by a dense and rapidlyrising line of fog we are going to have a fog and a frost said the major we had better hurry home behind all the others rode alice sam and myself i was fearful of being de trop but when i tried to get forward to the laughing chattering crowd in front these two young lovers raised such an outcry that i was fain to stay with them which i was well pleased to do behind us however rode three mounted servants two of captain brentwoods and my man dick we were almost in sight of the river nearly home in fact when there arose a loud lamentation from alice oh my bracelet my dear bracelet i have lost it have you any idea where you dropped it i inquired oh yes she said i am sure it must have been when i fell down scrambling up the rocks just before the doctor began his lecture just as i reached the top you know i fell down and i must have lost it there i will ride back and find it then in no time i said no indeed uncle jeff said sam i will go back i use an uncles authority i replied and i forbid you that miserable old pony of yours which you have chosen to bring out today has had quite work enough without ten miles extra i condescend to no argument here i go i turned with a kind look from both of them but ere i had gone ten yards my servant dick was alongside of me where are you going sir said he i am going back to mirngish i replied miss alice has dropped her bracelet and i am going back for it i will come with you sir he said indeed no dick there is no need go back to your supper lad i shant be long away i am coming with you sir he replied company is a good thing sometimes well boy i said if you will come i shall be glad of your company so come along i had noticed lately that dick never let me go far alone but would always be with me it gave rise to no suspicion in my mind he had been tried too often for that but still i thought it strange on this occasion we had not ridden far before he asked me a question which rather surprised me he said mr hamlyn do you carry pistols why dick boy i said why should i look you here mr hamlyn said he have you tried me i have tried you for twenty years dick and have not found you wanting ah said he thats good hearing youre a magistrate sir though only just made but you know that coves like me that have been in trouble get hold of information which you beaks cant and i tell you sir theres bad times coming for this country side you carry your pistols sir and whats more you use em see here he opened his shirt and showed me a long sharp knife inside thats what i carries sir in these times and you ought to carry ditto and a brace of barkers besides we shant get back to the captains tonight we were rising on the first shoulder of mirngish and daylight was rapidly departing i looked back nothing but a vast sea of fog one snow peak rising from it like an iceberg from a frozen sea piercing the clear frosy air like a crystal of lead and silver we must hurry on i said or we shall never have daylight to find the bracelet we shall never find our way home through that fog without a breath of wind to guide us what shall we do i noticed today sir said dick a track that crossed the hill to the east if we can get on that and keep on it we are sure to get somewhere it would be better to follow that than go blundering across the plain through such a mist as that as he was speaking we had dismounted and commenced our search in five minutes so well did our recollection serve us dick had got the bracelet and having mounted our horses we deliberated what was next to be done a thick fog covered the whole country and was rapidly creeping up to the elevation on which we stood to get home over the plains without a compass seemed a hopeless matter so we determined to strike for the track which dick had noticed in the morning and get on it before it was dark we plunged down into the sea of fog and by carefully keeping the same direction we found our road the moon was nearly full which enabled us to distinguish it though we could never see above five yards in front of us we followed the road above an hour then we began to see ghostly treestems through the mist they grew thicker and more frequent then we saw a light and at last rode up to a hutdoor cheered by the warm light emanating from a roaring fire within which poured through every crack in the houseside and made the very fog look warm i held dicks horse while he knocked the door was opened by a wee feeble old man about sixty with a sharp clever face and an irongrey rough head of hair night daddy said dick can me and my master stay here tonight were all abroad in this fog the governor will leave something handsome behind in the morning old party i know this latter was in a whisper canst thou stay here sayst thou replied the old fellow in course thou canst but thy masters money may bide in as pouch get thy saddles off lad and come in tis a smittle night for rheumatics i helped dick to take off the saddles and having hobbled our horses with stirrupleathers we went in our little old friend was the hutkeeper as i saw at a glance the shepherd was sitting on a block before the fire in his shirt smoking his pipe and warming his legs preparatory to turning in i understood him in a moment as i then thought though i was much deceived a short wiry blackheaded man with a cunning faceconvict all over he rose as we came in and gave us good evening i begged he would not disturb himself so he moved his block into the corner and smoked away with that lazy indifference that only a shepherd is master of but the old man began bustling about he made us sit down before the fire and make ourselves comfortable he never ceased talking ill get ye lads some supper just now said he theres na but twa bunks i the hut so master and man must lie o the floor less indeed the boss lies in my bed which hes welcome to weve a plenty blankets though and sheepskins well mak ye comfortable boys theres a mickle back log o the fire and yell lie warm ise warrant ye theres cowd beef sir to me and good breed no to mind boggins o tea yell be comfortable will ye whats yer name hamlyn i said oh ay yere hamlyn and stockbridge i ken ye well i kenned yer partner a good mana very good man a man o ten thousand he was put down up north a bad joba very bad job ye gat terrible vengeance though ye hewed agag in pieces t governor up there to sydney was wild angry at what ye did but he darena say much he knew that every free mans heart went with ye it were the sword of the lord and of gideon that ye fought with ye saved many good lives by that raid of yours after stockbridge was killed the devils wanted a lesson and ye gard them read one wi a vengeance during this speech which was uttered in a series of interjections we had made our supper and drawn back to the fire the shepherd had tumbled into his blankets and was snoring the old man having cleared away the things came and sat down beside us the present of a fig of tobacco won his heart utterly and he having cut up a pipeful began talking again why said he its the real barrets twistthe very real article eh master yere booklearned do you ken where this grows it must be a fine country to bring up such backer as this some o they palm isles i reckon virginia i told him or carolina one of the finest countries in the world where they hold slaves ah said he they couldnt get white men to mess with backer and such in a hot country and in course every one knows that blacks wont work till theyre made thats why they bothers themselves with em i reckon but lord they are useless trash white convicts is useless enough think what black niggers must be how about the gentleman in bed i thought but he was snoring comfortably i am a free man myself continued the old man i never did aught ay or thought o doing aught that an honest man should not do but ive lived among convicts twenty odd year and do you know sir sometimes i hardly know richt fra wrang sometimes i see things that whiles i think i should inform of and then the devil comes and tells me it would be dishonourable and then i believe him till the times gone by and after that i am miserable in my conscience so i havent an easy time of it though i have good times and money to spare i was getting fond of the honest talkative old fellow so when dick asked him if he wanted to turn in and he answered no i was well pleased cant you pitch us a yarn daddy said dick tell us something about the old country i should like well to hear what you were at home ill pitch ye a yarn lad he replied if the master dont want to turn in im fond of talking all old men are i think he said appealing to me the times coming ye see when the gift o speech will be gone from me its a great gift but happen we wont lose it after all i said no that i thought not that i thought on the other side of the grave we should both speak and hear of higher things than we did in the flesh happen so said he i think so too sometime ill give ye my yarn i have told it often howsever neither o ye have heard it so yere the luckier that i tell it better by frequent repetition here it is i was a collier lad always lean and not well favoured though i was active and strong i was small too and that set my fathers heart agin me somewhat for he was a gran man and a mighty fighter but my elder brother jack he was a mighty fellow god bless him and when he was eighteen he weighed twelve stone and was earning mans wages tho that i was hurrying still i saw that father loved him better than me and whiles that vexed me but most times it didnt for i cared about the lad as well as father did and he liked me the same he never went far without me and whether he fought or whether he drunk i must be wi him and help well so we went on till as i said i was seventeen and he eighteen we never had a word till then we were as brothers should be but at this time we had a quarrel the first we ever had ay and the last for we got something to mind this one by we both worked in the same pit it was the southstone pit happen youve heard of it no well thus things get soon forgot father had been an overman there but was doing better now above ground he and mother kept a bit shop made money there was a fair in our village a poor thing enough but when we boys were children we used to look forward to it eleven months out o twelve and the day it came round we used to go to father and get sixpence or happen a shilling apiece to spend well time went on till we came to earn money but still we kept up the custom and went to the old man reglar for our fairin and he used to laugh and chaff us as hed give us a fourpenny or such and we liked the joke as well as he well this timeit was in just after the comet just the worst times of the war the fair came round th of may i well remember and we went in to the old man to get summut to spendjust for a joke like hed lost money and been vexed so when jack asked him for his fairin he gied him five shillin and said ill go to gaol but what my handsome boy shant have summut to treat his friends to beer but when i axed him he said earn mans wages and theell get a mans fairin and heaved a penny at me that made me wild mad i tell you i wasnt only angry wi the old man but i was mad wi jack poor lad the devil of jealousy had got into me and instead of kicking him out i nursed him i ran out o the house and away into the fair and drunk and fought and swore like a mad one i was in one of the dancing booths half drunk and a young fellow came to me and said where has thee been do thee know thy brother has foughten jim perry and beaten him i felt like crying to think my brother had fought and i not there to set him up but i swore and said i wish jim perry had killed un and then i sneaked off home to bed and cried like a lass and next morning i was up before him and down the pit he worked a good piece from me so i did not see him and it came on nigh nine oclock before i began to wonder why the viewer had not been round for i had heard say there was a foul place cut into by some of them and at such times the viewer generally looks into every corner well about nine the viewer and underviewer came up with the overman and stood talking alongside of me when there came a something sudden and sharp as tho one had boxed your ears and then a whiz whiz and the viewer stumbled a one side and cried out god save us i hardly knew what had happened till i heard him singing out clear and firm come here to me you lads come here keep steady and well be all right yet then i knew it was a fire and a sharp one and began crying out for jack i heard him calling for me and then he ran up and got hold of me and so ended the only quarrel we ever had and that was a onesided one are you all here said the viewer now follow me and if we meet the afterdamp hold your breath and run i am afraid its a bad job but we may get through yet we had not gone fifty yards before we came on the afterdamp filling the headway like smoke jack and i took hold of each others collars and ran but before we were halfway through he fell i kept good hold of his shirt and dragged him on on the ground i felt as strong as a horse and in ten seconds which seemed to me like ten hours i dragged him out under the shaft into clear air at first i thought he was dead but he was still alive and very little of that his heart beat very slow and i thought hed die but i knew if he got clear air that he might come round when we had gotten to the shaft bottom we found it all full of smoke the waft had gone straight up and they on the top told us after that all the earth round was shook and the black smoke and coaldust flew up as though from a gunbarrel any way it was strong enough to carry away the machine so we waited there ten minutes and wondered the basket did not come down but they above meanwhile were rigging a rope to an old horsewhim and as they could not get horses the men run the poles round themselves but we at the bottom knew nothing of all this there were thirty or so in the shaft bottom standing there dripping wet wi water and shouting for the others who never came now the smoke began to show in the west drive and we knew the mine was fired and yet we heard nought from those above but what i minded most of all was that jack was getting better i knew we could not well be lost right under the shaft so i did not swear and go on like some of them because they did not mind us above when the basket came down at last i and jack went up among the first and there i saw such a sight lad as yell never see till ye see a colliery explosion there were hundreds and hundreds there most had got friends or kin in the pit and as each man came up his wife or his mother would seize hold of him and carry on terrible but the worst were they whose husbands and sons never came up again and they were many for out of one hundred and thirtyone men in the pit only thirtynine came up alive directly we came to bank i saw father he was first among them that were helping working like a horse and directing everything when he saw us he said thank the lord theres my two boys i am not a loser today and came running to us and helped me to carry jack down the bank he was very weak and sick but the air freshened him up wonderful i told father all about it and he said ive been wrong and thoust been wrong dont thou get angry for nothing thou hast done a mans work today at all events now come and bear a hand towd ooman will mind the lad we went back to the pits mouth the men were tearing round the whim faster than horses would a done it and first amongst em all was old mrs cobley wi her long grey hair down her back doing the work o three men for her two boys were down still and i knew for one that they were not with us at the bottom but when the basket came up with the last and her two boys missing she went across to the master and asked him what he was going to do as quiet as possible he said he was going to ask some men to go down and my father volunteered to go at once and eight more went with him they were soon up again and reported that all the mine was full of smoke and no one had dared leave the shaft bottom fifty yards its clear enough the mines fired sir said my father to the owner they thats down are dead better close it sir what screamed old mrs cobley close the pit ye dog and my boys down there ye wouldnt do such a thing master dear she continued ye couldnt do it many others were wild when they heard the thing proposed but while they raved and argued the pit began to send up a reek of smoke like the mouth of hell and then the master gave orders to close the shaft and a hundred women knew they were widows and went weeping home and jack got well and after the old man died we came out here jack has gotten a publichouse in yass and next year i shall go home and live with him and thats the yarn about the fire at the southstone pit we applauded it highly and after a time began to talk about lying down when on a sudden we heard a noise of horses feet outside then the door was opened and in came a stranger he was a stranger to me but not to my servant who i could see recognized him though he gave no sign of it in words i also stared at him for he was the handsomest young man i had ever seen handsome as an apollo beautiful as a leopard but with such a peculiar style of beauty that when you looked at him you instinctively felt at your side for a weapon of defence for a more reckless dangerous looking man i never yet set eyes on and while i looked at him i recognised him i had seen his face or one like it before often often and it seemed as though i had known him just as he stood there years and years ago on the other side of the world i was almost certain it was so and yet he seemed barely twenty it was an impossibility and yet as i looked i grew every moment more certain he dashed in in an insolent way i am going to quarter here tonight and chance it he said hallo dick my prince you here and what may your name be old cock he added turning to me now seeing me indistinctly for the first time for i was sitting back in the shadow my name is geoffry hamlyn i am a justice of the peace and i am at your service i said now perhaps you will favour me with your name the young gentleman did not seem to like coming so suddenly into close proximity with a beak and answered defiantly charles sutton is my name and i dont know as theres anything against me at present sutton i said sutton i dont know the name no i have nothing against you except that you dont appear very civil soon after i rolled myself in a blanket and lay down dick lay at right angles to me his feet nearly touching mine he began snoring heavily almost immediately and just when i was going to give him a kick and tell him not to make such a row i felt him give me a good sharp shove with the heel of his boot by which i understood that he was awake and meant to keep awake as he did not approve of the strangers i was anxious about our horses yet in a short time i could keep awake no longer i slept and when i next woke i heard voices whispering eagerly together i silently turned so that i could see whence the voices came and perceived the hutkeeper sitting up in bed in close confabulation with the stranger those two rascals are plotting some villany i said to myself somebody will be minus a horse shortly i expect and then i fell asleep again and when i awoke it was broad day i found the young man was gone and what pleased me better still had not taken either of our horses with him so when we had taken some breakfast we started and i left the kind little old man something to remember me by we had not ridden a hundred yards before i turned to dick and said now mind i dont want you to tell me anything you dont like but pray relieve my mind on one point who was that young man have i ever seen him before i think not sir but i can explain how you come to think you have you remember sir that i knew all about mrs hawkers history yes yes go on that young fellow is george hawkers son it came upon me like a thunderbolt this then was the illegitimate son that he had by his cousin ellen oh miserable child of sin and shame to what end i wondered had he been saved till now we shall see soon meanwhile i turned to my companion and said tell me how he came to be here why you see sir he went on in his fathers ways and got lagged he found his father out as soon as he was free which wasnt long first for he is mortal cunning and since then they two have stuck together most times they quarrel and sometimes they fight but they are never far apart hawker aint far off now now sir he continued i am going to tell you something which if it ever leaks out of your lips again in such a way as to show where it came from will end my life as sure as if i was hung you remember three months ago that a boatful of men were supposed to have landed from cockatoo yes i said i heard it from major buckley but the police have been scouring in all directions and can find nothing of them my opinion is that the boat was capsized and they were all drowned and that the surf piled the boat over with seaweed depend on it they did not land depend on it they did sir those men are safe and well and ready for any mischief hawker was on the lookout for them and they all stowed away till the police cleared off which they did last week there will be mischief soon there i have told you enough to cut my throat and ill tell you more and convince you that i am right that shepherd at whose hut we stayed last night was one of them that fellow was the celebrated captain mike what do you think of that i shuddered as i heard the name of that fell ruffian and thought that i had slept in the hut with him but when i remembered how he was whispering with the stranger in the middle of the night i came to the conclusion that serious mischief was brewing and pushed on through the fog which still continued as dense as ever and guided by some directions from the old hutkeeper i got to captain brentwoods about ten oclock and told him and the major the nights adventures we three armed ourselves secretly and quietly and went back to the hut with the determination of getting possession of the person of the shepherd mike who were he the man dick accused him of being would have been a prize indeed being one of the leading van diemens land rangers and one of the men reported as missing by captain blockstrop suppose said captain brentwood that we seize the fellow and it isnt him after all then said the major an action for false imprisonment would lie sir decidedly but we will chance it and when we got there we saw the old hutkeeper he of the colliery explosion experiences shepherding the sheep himself and found that the man we were in search of had left the hut that morning apparently to take the sheep out but that going out about eleven the old man had found them still in the yard whereby he concluded that the shepherd was gone which proved to be the case and making further inquiries we found that the shepherd had only been hired a month previously and no man knew whence he came all of which seemed to confirm dicks story wonderfully and made us excessively uneasy and in the end the major asked me to prolong my visit for a time and keep my servant with me as every hand was of use and so it fell out that i happened to be present at and chronicle all which follows chapter xxxvii in which george hawker settles an old score with william lee most handsomely leaving in fact a large balance in his own favour i pause herei rather dread to go on although our course has been erratic and irregular although we have had one character disappearing for a long time like tom troubridge and although we have had another entirely new coming bobbing up in the manner of punchs victims unexpected and apparently unwanted although i say the course of this story may have been illarranged in the highest degree and you may have been continually coming across some one in vol ii who forced you to go back to vol i possibly sent back to the library to find out who he was yet on the whole we have got on pleasantly enough as things go now i am sorry to say i have to record two or three fearful catastrophes the events of the next month are seldom alluded to by any of those persons mentioned in the preceding pages they are too painful i remark that the lucknow and cawnpore men dont much like talking about the affairs of that terrible six weeks much for the same reason i suspect as we going over our old recollections always omit the occurrences of this lamentable spring the facts contained in the latter end of this chapter i got from the gaol chaplain at sydney the major the captain and i got home to dinner confirmed in our suspicions that mischief was abroad and very vexed at having missed the man we went in search of both mrs buckley and alice noticed that something was wrong but neither spoke a word on the subject mrs buckley now and then looked anxiously at her husband and alice cast furtive glances at her father the rest took no notice of our silence and uneasiness little dreaming of the awful cloud that was hanging above our heads to burst alas so soon i was sitting next to mary hawker that evening talking over old devon days and devon people when she said i think i am going to have some more quiet peaceful times i am happier than i have been for many years do you know why look there i shuddered to hear her say so knowing what i knew but looked where she pointed her son sat opposite to us next to the pretty ellen mayford she had dropped the lids over her eyes and was smiling he with his face turned toward her was whispering in his eager impulsive way and tearing to pieces a slip of paper which he held in his hand as the firelight fell on his face i felt a chill come over me the likeness was so fearfulnot to the father that i had been long accustomed to but to the son to the halfbrotherto the poor lost young soul i had seen last night the companion of desperate men as it struck me i could not avoid a start and a moment after i would have given a hundred pounds not to have done so for i felt marys hand on my arm and heard her say in a low voice cruel cruel will you never forget i felt guilty and confused as usual on such occasions satan was at my elbow ready with a lie more or less clumsy and i said you do me injustice mrs hawker i was not thinking of old times i was astonished at what i see there do you think there is anything in it i sincerely hope so she said indeed and so do i it will be excellent on every account now said i mrs hawker will you tell me what has become of your old servant lee i have reasons for asking he is in my service still she said as useful and faithful as ever at present he is away at a little hut in the ranges looking after our ewes who is with him i asked well he has got a new hand with him a man who came about a month or so ago and stayed about splitting wood i fancy i heard lee remark that he had known him before however when lee had to go to the ranges he wanted a hutkeeper so this man went up with him what sort of a looking man was he oh a rather large man redhaired much pitted with the smallpox all this made me uneasy i had asked these questions by the advice of dick and from mrs hawkers description tallying so well with his i had little doubt that another of the escaped gang was living actually in her service alone too in the hut with lee the day that we went to mirngish the circumstances i am about to relate took place in lees hut a lonely spot eight miles from the home station towards the mountain and situated in a dense dark stringy bark foresta wild desolate spot even as it was that afternoon with the parrots chattering and whistling around it and the bright winters sun lighting up the green treetops lee was away and the hutkeeper was the only living soul about the place he had just made some bread and having carried out his campoven to cool was sitting on the bench in the sun lazily thinking what he would do next he was a long rather powerfullybuilt man and seemed at first sight merely a sleepy halfwitted fellow but at a second glance you might perceive that there was a good deal of cunning and some ferocity in his face he sat for some time and was beginning to think that he would like a smoke so he got out his knife preparatory to cutting tobacco the hut stood at the top of a lone gully stretching away in a vista nearly bare of trees for a width of about ten yards or so all the way down which gave it the appearance of a grassride walled on each side by tall dark forest looking down this our hutkeeper saw about a quarter of a mile off a horseman cross from one side to the other he only caught a momentary glimpse of him but that was enough to show him that it was a stranger he neither knew horse nor man at least judging by his dress and while he was still puzzling his brains as to what stranger would be coming to such an outoftheway place he heard the chuck kuk kuk kuk of an opossum close behind the hut and started to his feet it would of course have startled any bushman to hear an opossum cry in broad day but he knew what this meant well it was the arranged signal of his gang and he ran to the place from whence the sound came george hawker was therewell dressed sitting on a noble chestnut horse they greeted one another with a friendly curse as is my custom when recording the conversation of this class of worthies i suppress the expletives thereby shortening them by nearly one half and depriving the public of much valuable information well old man began hawker is the coast clear no one here but myself replied the other im hutkeeping here for one bill lee but he is away he was one of the right sort once himself i have heard but hes been on the square for twenty years so i dont like to trust him you are about right there moody my lad said hawker ive just looked up to talk to you about him and other mattersill come in when will he be back not before night i expect said the other well said hawker we shall have the more time to talk ive got a good deal to tell you our chaps are all safe and snug and the traps are off only two thats you and mike stayed this side of the hill the rest crossed the ranges and stowed away in an old lair of mine on one of the upper murray gullies theyve had pretty hard times and if it hadnt been for the cash they brought away theyd have had worse now the coast is clear theyre coming back by ones and twos and next week we shall be ready for business im going to be head man this bout because i know the country better than any and the most noble michael has consented for this time only to act as lieutenant we havent decided on any plans yet but some think of beginning from the coast because that part will be clearest of traps they having satisfied themselves that we aint there in fact the wiseacres have fully determined that we are all drowned theres one devil of a foreign doctor knows im round though he saw me the night before you came ashore and i am nigh sure he knew me i have been watching him and i could have knocked him over last week as clean as a whistle only thinks i itll make a stir before the time never mind ill have him yet this lee is a black sheep lad im glad you are here you must watch him and if you see him flinch put a knife in him he raised the country on me once before i tell you jerry that id be hung and willing tomorrow to have that chaps life and id have had it before now only i had to keep still for the sake of the others that man served me the meanest dirtiest trick twenty years ago in the old country that ever you or any other man heard of and if he catches sight of me the games up mind if you see cause you deal with him or else with an awful oath you answer to the others if hes got to go hell go replied the other doggedly dont you fear me moody the cannibal aint a man to flinch what is that tale true then asked hawker looking at his companion with a new sort of interest why in course it is replied moody i thought no one doubted that that van diemens land bush would starve a bandicoot and shiner and i walked two days before we knocked the boy on the head the lad was getting beat and couldnt a gone much further after three days more we began to watch one another and neither one durst walk first or go to sleep well shiner gave in first he couldnt keep his eyes open any longer and then you know of course my own life was dearer than hisn my god thats worse than ever i did said hawker but not worse than you may do if you persevere you promise well said moody with a grin hawker bent and whispered in his ear the other listened for a time and then said make it twenty hawker after a little consideration noddedthen the other noddedthen they whispered together again something out of the common this must be that they not very particular in their confidences should whisper about it they looked up suddenly and lee was standing in the doorway hawker and he started when they saw one another but lee recovered himself first and said george hawker its many years since we met and im not so young as i was i should like to make peace before i go as i well know that im the chief one to blame for you getting into trouble im not humbugging you when i say that i have been often sorry for it of late years but sorrow wont do any good if youll forgive and forget ill do the same you tried my life once and thats worse than ever i did for you and now ill tell you that if you want money to get out of the country and set up anywhere else and leave your poor wife in peace ill find it for you out of my own pocket i dont bear any malice said hawker but i dont want to leave the country just yet i suppose you wont peach about having seen me here i shant say a word george if you keep clear of the home station but i wont have you come about there so i warn you lee held out his hand and george took it then he asked him if he would stay there that night and george consented day was fast sinking behind the trees and making golden boughs overhead lee stood at the hut door watching the sun set and thinking perhaps of old devon he seemed sad and let us hope he was regretting his old crimes while time was left him night was closing in on him and having looked once more on the darkening sky and the fog coldly creeping up the gully he turned with a sigh and a shudder into the hut and shut the door near midnight and all was still then arose a cry upon the night so hideous so wild and so terrible that the roosting birds dashed off affrighted and the dense mist as though in sympathising fear prolonged the echoes a hundred fold one articulate cry oh you treacherous dog given with the fierce energy of a dying man and then night returned to her stillness and the listeners heard nothing but the weeping of the moisture from the wintry trees the two perpetrators of the atrocity stood silent a minute or more recovering themselves then hawker said in a fierce whisper you clumsy hound why did you let him make that noise i shall never get it out of my head again if i live till a hundred lets get out of this place before i go mad i could not stay in the house with it for salvation get his horse and come along they got the two horses and rode away into the night but hawker in his nervous anxiety to get away dropped a handsome cavalry pistola circumstance which nearly cost doctor mulhaus his life they rode till after daylight taking a course toward the sea and had gone nearly twelve miles before george discovered his loss and broke out into petulant imprecations i wouldnt have lost that pistol for five pounds he said no nor more i shall never have one like it again ive put over a parrot at twenty yards with it go back and get it then said moody if its so valuable ill camp and wait for you we want all the arms we can get not i said george i would not go back into that cursed hut alone for all the sheep in the country you coward replied the other afraid of a dead man well if you wont i will and mind i shall keep it for my own use youre welcome to it if you like to get it said george and so moody rode back chapter xxxviii how dr mulhaus got bushed in the ranges and what befel him there i must recur to the same eventful night again and relate another circumstance that occurred on it as events thicken time gets more precious so that whereas at first i thought nothing of giving you the events of twenty years or so in a chapter we are now compelled to concentrate time so much that it takes three chapters to twentyfour hours i read a long novel once the incidents of which did not extend over thirtysix hours and yet it was not so profoundly stupid as you would suppose all the party got safe home from the picnic and were glad enough to get housed out of the frosty air the doctor above all others was rampant at the thoughts of dinner and a good chat over a warm fire and burst out in a noble bass voice with an old german students song about wine and gretchen and what not his music was soon turned into mourning for as they rode into the courtyard a man came up to captain brentwood and began talking eagerly to him it was one of his shepherds who lived alone with his wife towards the mountain the poor woman his wife he said was taken in labour that morning and was very bad hearing there was a doctor staying at the home station he had come down to see if he could come to their assistance ill go of course said the doctor but let me get something to eat first is anybody with her yes a woman was with her had been staying with them some days i hope you can find the way in the dark said the doctor for i can tell you i cant no fear sir said the man theres a track all the way and the moons full if it wasnt for the fog it would be as bright as day he took a hasty meal and started they went at a foots pace for the shepherd was on foot the track was easily seen and although it was exceedingly cold the doctor being well wrapped up contrived with incessant smoking to be moderately comfortable all external objects being a blank he soon turned to his companion to see what he could get out of him what part of the country are you from my friend fra the isle of skye the man answered im one of the macdonalds of skye thats a very ancient family is it not said the doctor at a venture knowing he could not go wrong with a highlander very ancient and weel respeckit the man answered and who is your sheik rajah chieftain or what you call him my lord macdonald i am cousin to my lord indeed he owns the whole island i suppose theres mackinnons live there but they are interlopers they are worthless trash and he spit in disgust i suppose said the doctor a mackinnon would return the compliment if speaking of a macdonald the man laughed and said he supposed yes then added see whats yon a white stump burnt black at one sidewhat did you think it was i jaloused it might be a ghaist theres a many ghaists and bogles about here i should have thought the country was too young for those gentry said the doctor its a young country but theres been muckle wickedness done in it and what are those blacks do you thinknext thing to devilsat all events theyre no exactly human impish decidedly said the doctor have you ever seen any ghosts friend ay many a fortnight agone come tomorrow i saw the ghost of my wifes brother in broad day it was the time of the high wind ye mind of and the rain drove so thick i could no see all my sheep at once and a man on a white horse came fleeing before the wind close past me i knew him in a minute it was my wifes brother as i tell ye that was hung fifteen years agone for sheepstealing and he wasnt so much altered as yed think some one else like him suggested the doctor deil a fear replied the man for when i cried out and said what col lad gang hame and lie in yer grave and dinna trouble honest folk he turned and rode away through the rain straight from me well said the doctor i partly agree with you that the lands bewitched i saw a man not two months ago who ought to have been dead five or six years at least but are you quite sure the man you saw was hung well nigh about he replied when we sailed from skye he was under sentence and they werent over much given to reprieve for sheepstealing in those days it was in consequence o that that i came here thats a very tolerable ghost story said the doctor have you got another if you have i shouldnt mind hearing it as it will beguile the way did ye ever hear how faithfuls lot were murdered by the blacks up on the merrimerangbong no but i should like to is it a ghost story deed ay and is it this is how it happenedwhen faithful came to take up his country across the mountains yonder they were a strong party enough to have been safe in any country but whether it was food was scarce or whether it was on account of getting water i dont know but they separated and fifteen of them got into the yackandandah country before the others well you see they were pretty confident being still a strong mob and didnt set any watch or take any care there was one among them cranky jim they used to call himhe as told me this yarnhe used to be about reids mill last year who always was going on at them to take more care but they never heeded him at all they found a fine creek with plenty of feed and water and camped at it to wait till the others came up they saw no blacks nor heard of any and three days were past and they began to wonder why the others had not overtaken them the third night they were all sitting round the fire laughing and smoking when they heard a loud coee on the opposite side of the scrub and halfadozen of them started up and sang out there they are well they all began coeeing again and they heard the others in reply apparently all about in the scrub so off they starts one by one into the scrub answering and hallooing for it seemed to them that their mates were scattered about and didnt know where they were well as i said fourteen of them started into the scrub to collect the party and bring them up to the fire only old cranky jim sat still in the camp he believed with the others that it was the rest of their party coming up but he soon began to wonder how it was that they were so scattered then he heard one scream and then it struck him all at once that this was a dodge of the blacks to draw the men from the camp and when they were abroad cut them off one by one plunder the drays and drive off the sheep so he dropped and crawled away in the dark he heard the coees grow fewer and fewer as the men were speared one by one and at last everything was quiet and then he knew he was right and he rose up and fled away in two days he found the other party and told them what had happened they came up and there was some sharp fighting but they got a good many of their sheep back they found the men lying about singly in the scrub all speared they buried them just where they found each one for it was hot weather they buried them four foot deep but they wouldnt lie still every night about nine oclock they get up again and begin coeeing for an hour or more at first theres a regular coronach of them then by degrees the shouts get fewer and fewer and just when you think its all over one will break out loud and clear close to you and after that alls still again you dont believe that story i suppose if you press me very hard said the doctor i must confess with all humility that i dont no more did i said macdonald till i heard em heard them said the doctor ay and seen them said the man stopping and turning round you most agreeable of men pray tell me how why you see last year i was coming down with some wooldrays from parson dorkens and this cranky jim was with us and told us the same yarn and when he had finished he said youll know whether i speak truth or not tonight for were going to camp at the place where it happened well and so we did and as well as we could reckon it was a little past nine when a curlew got up and began crying that was the signal for the ghosts and in a minute they were coeeing like mad all round as jim had told us one by one ceased until all was quiet and i thought it was over when i looked and saw about a hundred yards off a tall man in grey crossing a belt of open ground he put his hand to his mouth gave a wild shout and disappeared thank you said the doctor i think you mentioned that your wifes confinement was somewhat sudden yes rather replied the man pray had you been relating any of the charming little tales to her latelyjust we will suppose to while away the time of the evening well i may have done so said macdonald but i dont exactly mind ah so i thought the next time your good lady happens to be in a similar situation i think i would refrain from ghost stories i should not like to commit myself to a decided opinion but i should be inclined to say that the tales you have been telling me were rather horrible is that the light of your hut two noble colley dogs bounded to welcome them and a beautiful barelegged girl about sixteen ran forth to tell her father in gaelic that the trouble was over and that a boy was born on going in they found the mother asleep while her gossip held the baby on her knee so the doctor saw that he was not needed and sat down to wait until the woman should wake having first however produced from his saddle two bottles of port wine a present from alice the woman soon woke and the doctor having felt her pulse and left some medicine started to ride home again carrying with him an incense of good wishes from the warmhearted highlanders instead of looking carefully for the road the good doctor was soon nine fathoms deep into the reasons why the mountaineers and coast folk of all northern countries should be more blindly superstitious than the dwellers in plains and in towns and so it happened that coming to a fork in the track he disregarded the advice of his horse and instead of taking the right hand as he should have done he held straight on and about two oclock in the morning found that not only had he lost his road but that the track had died out altogether and that he was completely abroad in the bush he was in a very disagreeable predicament the fog was thicker than ever without a breath of air and he knew that it was as likely as not that it might last for a day or two he was in a very wild part of the mountain quite on the borders of all the country used by white men after some reflection he determined to follow the fall of the land thinking that he was still on the watershed of the snowyriver and hoping by following down some creek to find some place he knew gradually day broke cold and cheerless he was wet and miserable and could merely give a guess at the east for the sun was quite invisible but about eight oclock he came on a track running at right angles to the way he had been going and marked with the hoofs of two horses whose riders had apparently passed not many hours before which way should he go he could not determine the horsemen it seemed to him as far as he could guess had been going west while his route lay east and after a time having registered a vow never to stir out of sight of the station again without a compass he determined to take a contrary direction from them and to find out where they had come from the road crossed gully after gully each one like the other the timber was heavy stringy bark and in the lower part of the shallow gullies the tall white stems of the blue gums stood up in the mist like ghosts all nature was dripping and dull and he was chilled and wretched at length at the bottom of a gully rather more dreary looking if possible than all the others he came on a black reedy waterhole the first he had seen in his ride and perceived that the track turned short to the left casting his eye along it he made out the dark indistinct outline of a hut standing about forty yards off he rode up to it all was as still as death no man came out to welcome him no dog jumped barking forth no smoke went up from the chimney and looking round he saw that the track ended here and that he had ridden all these miles only to find a deserted hut but was it deserted not very long so for those two horsemen whose tracks he had been on so long had started from here here on this bare spot in front of the door they had mounted one of their horses had been capering nay here were their footsteps on the threshold and while he looked there was a light fall inside and the chimney began smoking at all events said the doctor the fires in and heres the campoven too somebody will be here soon i shall go in and light my pipe he lifted the latch and went in nobody there stayyes there is a man asleep in the bedplace the watchman probably thought the doctor hes been up all night with the sheep and is taking his rest by day well i wont wake him ill hang up my horse a bit and take a pipe perhaps i may as well turn the horse out well no i shant wait long he may stand a little without hurting himself so soliloquised the doctor and lit his pipe a quarter of an hour passed and the man still lay there without moving the doctor rose and went close to him he could not even hear him breathe his flesh began to creep but his brows contracted and his face grew firm he went boldly up and pulled down the blanket and then to his horror and amazement recognised the distorted countenance of the unfortunate william lee he covered the face over again and stood thinking of his situation and how this had come to pass how came lee here and how had he met his death at this moment something bright half hidden by a blue shirt lying on the floor caught his eye and going to pick it up he found it was a beautiful pistol mounted in silver and richly chased he turned it over and over till in a lozenge behind the hammer he found apparently scratched with a knife the name g hawker here was light with a vengeance but he had little time to think of his discovery ere he was startled by the sound of horses feet rapidly approaching the hut instinctively he thrust the pistol into his pocket and stooped down pretending to light his pipe he heard some one ride up to the door dismount and enter the hut he at once turned round pipe in mouth and confronted him he was a tall illlooking redhaired man and to the doctors pleasant good morning he replied by sulkily asking what he wanted only a light for my pipe friend said the doctor having got one i will bid you good morning our friend here sleeps well the new comer was between him and the door but the doctor advanced boldly when the two men were opposite their eyes met and they understood one another moody for it was he threw himself upon the doctor with an oath trying to bear him down but although the tallest man he had met his match he was held in a grasp of iron the doctors hand was on his collar and his elbow against his face and thus his head was pressed slowly backwards till he fell to avoid a broken neck and fell too with such force that he lay for an instant stunned and motionless and before he came to himself the doctor was on horseback and some way along the track glad to have made so good an escape from such an awkward customer if he had been armed said the doctor as he rode along i should have been killed he evidently came back after that pistol now i wonder where i am i shall know soon at this pace the little horse keeps up well seeing he has been out all night in about two hours he heard a dog bark to the left of the track and turning off in that direction he soon found himself in a courtyard and before a door which he thought he recognised the door opened at the sound of his horse and out walked tom troubridge good lord said the doctor a friends face at last tell me where i am for i cant see the end of the house why at our place toonarbin doctor well take me in and give me some food i have terrible tidings for you when did you last see lee the day before yesterday he is up at an outlying hut of ours in the ranges he is lying murdered in his bed there for i saw him so not three hours past he then told troubridge all that had happened what sort of man was it that attacked you said troubridge the doctor described moody thats his hutkeeper that he took from here with him a man he said he knew and you say he was on horseback what sort of a horse had he a goodlooking roan with a new bridle on him lees horse said troubridge he must have murdered him for it poor william but when tom saw the pistol and read the name on it he said things are coming to a crisis doctor the net seems closing round my unfortunate partner god grant the storm may come and clear the air anything is better than these continual alarms it will be very terrible when it does come my dear friend said the doctor it cannot be much more terrible than this said tom when our servants are assassinated in their beds and travellers in lonely huts have to wrestle for their lives doctor did you ever nourish a passion for revenge yes once said the doctor and had it gratified in fair and open duel but when i saw him lying white on the grass before me and thought that he was dead i was like one demented and prayed that my life might be taken instead of his be sure tom that revenge is of the devil and like everything else you get from him is not worth having i do not in the least doubt it doctor said tom but oh if i could only have five minutes with him on the turf yonder with no one to interfere between us i want no weapons let us meet in our shirts and trowsers like devon lads and what would you do to him if you werent there to see hed never tell you why nourish this feeling tom my old friend you do not know what pain it gives me to see a noble open character like yours distorted like this leave him to desboroughwhy should you feel so deadly towards the man he has injured others more than you he stands between me and the hopes of a happy old age he stands between me and the light and he must stand on one side that night they brought poor lees body down in a dray and buried him in the family buryingground close beside old miss thornton then the next morning he rode back home to the buckleys where he found that family with myself just arrived from the brentwoods i of course was brimful of intelligence but when the doctor arrived i was thrown into the shade at once however no time was to be lost and we despatched a messenger post haste to fetch back captain desborough and his troopers who had now been moved off about a week but had not been as yet very far withdrawn and were examining into some black outrages to the northward mary hawker was warned as delicately as possible that her husband was in the neighbourhood she remained buried in thought for a time and then rousing herself said suddenly there must be an end to all this get my horse and let me go home in spite of all persuasions to the contrary she still said the same mrs buckley i will go home and see if i can meet him alone all i ask of you is to keep charles with you dont let the father and son meet in gods name but what can you do urged mrs buckley something at all events find out what he wants buy him off perhaps pray dont argue with me i am quite determined then it became necessary to tell her of lees death though the fact of his having been murdered was concealed but it deeply affected her to hear of the loss of her old faithful servant faithful to her at all events whatever his faults may have been nevertheless she went off alone and took up her abode with troubridge and there they two sat watching in the lonely station for him who was to come though they watched together there was no sympathy or confidence between them she never guessed what purpose was in toms heart she never guessed what made him so pale and gloomy or why he never stirred from the house but slept half the day on the sofa but ere she had been a week at home she found out thus they would sit those two silent and thoughtful beside that unhappy hearth watching the fire and brooding over the past each had that in their hearts which made them silent to one another and each felt the horror of some great overshadowing formless calamity which any instant might take form and overwhelm them mary would sit late dreading the weary night when her overstrained senses caught every sound in the distant forest but however late she sat she always left tom behind over the fire not taking his comfortable glass but gloomily musingas much changed from his old self as man could be she now lay always in her clothes ready for any emergency and one night about a week after lees murder she dreamt that her husband was in the hall bidding her in a whisper which thrilled her heart to come forth the fancy was so strong upon her that saying aloud to herself the end is come she arose in a state little short of delirium and went into the hall there was no one there but she went to the front door and looking out into the profoundly black gloom of the night said in a low voice george george come to me let me speak to you george it will be better for both of us to speak no answer but she heard a slight noise in the sittingroom behind her and opening the door gently saw a light there and tom sitting with parted lips watching the door holding in his hand a cocked pistol she was not in the least astonished or alarmed she was too much tete montee to be surprised at anything she said only with a laugh what are you watching too old mastiffwould you grip the wolf old dog if he came was he there mary did you speak to him no no she said a dream a wandering dream what would you do if he cameeh cousin nothing nothing said tom go to bed bed eh she answered cousin shooting is an easier death than hangingeh tom felt a creeping at the roots of his hair as he answeredyes i believe so can you shoot straight old man could you shoot straight and true if he stood there before you ah you think you could now but your hand would shake when you saw him go to bed mary said tom dont talk like that let the future lie cousin she turned and went to her room again all this was told me long after by tom himself tom believed or said he believed that she was only sounding him to see what his intentions were in case of a meeting with george hawker i would not for the world have had him suppose i disagreed with him but i myself take another and darker interpretation of her strange words that night i think that she never a very strongminded person and now grown quite desperate from terror actually contemplated her husbands death with complacency nay hoped in her secret heart that one mad struggle between him and tom might end the matter for ever and leave her a free woman i may do her injustice but i think i do not one never knows what a woman of this kind with strong passions and a not overstrong intellect may be driven to i knew her for forty years and loved her for twenty i knew in spite of all her selfishness and violence that there were many good nay noble points in her character but i cannot disguise from myself that that nights conversation with tom showed me a darker point in her character than i knew of before let us forget it i would wish to have none but kindly recollections of the woman i loved so truly and so long for the secret must be told sooner or lateri loved her before any of them before james stockbridge before george hawker before thomas troubridge and i loved her more deeply and more truly than any of them but the last remnant of that love departed from my heart twenty years ago and that is why i can write of her so calmly now and that is the reason too why i remain an old bachelor to this day chapter xxxix the last gleam before the storm but with us who were staying down at major buckleys a fortnight passed on so pleasantly that the horror of poor lees murder had begun to wear off and we were getting once more as merry and careless as though we were living in the old times of profound peace sometimes we would think of poor mary hawker at her lonely watch up at the forest station but that or any other unpleasant subject was soon driven out of our heads by captain desborough who had come back with six troopers declared the country in a state of siege proclaimed martial law and kept us all laughing and amused from daylight to dark captain brentwood and his daughter alice the transcendently beautiful had come up and were staying there jim and his friend halbert were still away but were daily expected i never passed a pleasanter time in my life than during that fortnights lull between the storms begorra thats a scotch expression miss brentwood but very forcible said captain desborough i owe you more than i can ever repay for buying out the donovans that girl lesbia burke would have forcibly abducted me and married me against my will if she hadnt had to follow the rest of the family to port phillip a fine woman too said captain brentwood id have called her a little coarse myself said desborough one of the finest strangest sights i ever saw in my life resumed captain brentwood was on the morning i came to take possession none of the family were left but murtagh donovan and miss burke i rode over from buckleys and when i came to the door donovan took me by the arm and saying whist led me into the sittingroom there in front of the empty fireplace crouched down on the floor bareheaded with her beautiful hair hanging about her shoulders sat miss burke every now and then she would utter the strangest low wailing cry you ever heard a cry by jove sir that went straight to your heart i turned to donovan and whispered is she ill and he whispered again her hearts broke at leaving the old place where shes lived so long shes raising the keen over the cold hearthstone its the way of the burkes i dont know when i was so affected in my life somehow that exquisite line came to my remembrance and the hare shall kindle on the cold hearthstone and i went back quietly with donovan and by jove sir when we came out the great ass had the tears running down his cheeks i have always felt kindly to that man since ah captain said desborough with all our vanity and absurdity we irish have got good warm hearts under our waistcoats we are the first nation in the world sir saving the jews this was late in the afternoon of a temperate spring day we were watching desborough as he was giving the finishing touches to a beautiful watercolour drawing doctor he said come and pass your opinion i think you have done admirably captain said the doctor you have given one a splendid idea of distance in the way you have toned down the plain from the grey appearance it has ten miles off to the rich delicate green it shows close to us and your mountain too is most aerial you would make an artist i am not altogether displeased with my work doctor if you who never flatter can praise it with the original before you how exceedingly beautiful the evening tones are becoming we looked across the plain the stretch of grass i have described was lying before one like a waveless sea from the horizon of which rose the square abruptsided mass of basalt which years ago we had named the organhill from the regular fluted columns of which it was composed on most occasions as seen from major buckleys it appeared a dim mass of pearly grey but tonight in the clear frosty air it was of a rich purple shining on the most prominent angles with a dull golden light the more i look at that noble firetemple the more i admire it said the doctor it is one of the most majestic objects i ever beheld it is not unlike staffa said desborough there come two travellers two dots appeared crawling over the plain and making for the river for a few minutes alice could not be brought to see them but when she did she declared that it was jim and halbert you have good eyes my love said her father to see what does not exist jims horse is black and halberts roan and those two men are both on grey horses the wish was parent to the thought father she replied laughing i wonder what is keeping him away from us so long if he is to go to india i should like to see him as much as possible my dear said her father when he went off with halbert to see the markhams i told him that if he liked to go on to sydney he could go if halbert went with him and draw on the agent for what money he wanted by his being so long away i conclude he has done so and that he is probably at this moment getting a lesson at billiards from halbert before going to dinner i shall have a nice little account from the agent just now of cash advanced to j brentwood esq i dont think jims extravagant papa said alice my dear said captain brentwood you do him injustice he hasnt had the chance i must say considering his limited opportunities he has spent as much money on horses saddlery c as any young gentleman on this country side eh sam well sir said sam jim spends his money but he generally makes pretty good investments in the horse line such as that sweettempered useful animal stampedo replied the captain laughing who nearly killed a groom and staked himself trying to leap out of the stockyard the second day he had him well never mind jims a good boy and i am proud of him i am in some hopes that this sydney journey will satisfy his wandering propensities for the present and that we may keep him at home i wish he would fall in love with somebody providing she wasnt old enough to be his grandmothercouldnt you send him a letter of introduction to some of your old schoolfellows miss puss there was one of them i remember i fell in love with myself one time when i came to see you miss green i think it was she was very nearly being your mammainlaw my dear why she is a year younger than me said alice and oh goodness such a temper she threw the selections from beethoven at signor smitherini and had bread and watermelon for two days for it serve her right i have had a narrow escape then replied the father but we shall see who these two people are immediately for they are crossing the river when the two travellers rose again into sight on the near bank of the river one of them was seen galloping forward waving his hat i knew it was jim said alice and on a new grey horse i thought he would not go to sydney and in a minute more she had run to meet him and jim was off his horse kissing his sister laughing shouting and dancing around her well father he said here i am back again went to sydney and stayed a week when we met the two marstons and went right up to the clarence with them that was a pretty journey eh sold the old horse and bought this one ive got heaps to tell you sister about what ive seen i went home and only stayed ten minutes when i heard you were here i came right on i am glad to see you back mr halbert said major buckley i hope you have had a pleasant journey you have met captain desborough captain desborough how are you says jim i am very glad to see you but between you and i youre always a bird of ill omen whose pigs dead now what brings you back i thought we should be rid of you by this time but you are not rid of me jackanapes said desborough laughing but ill tell you what jim there is really something wrong my boy and im glad to see you back and he told him all the news jim grew very serious well said he im glad to be home again and im glad too to see you here one feels safer when youre in the way we must put a cheerful face on the matter and not frighten the women i have bought such a beautiful brace of pistols in sydney i hope i may never have the chance to use them in this country why theres cecil mayford and mrs buckley coming down the garden and charley hawker too why major youve got all the world here to welcome us the young men were soon busy discussing the merits of jims new horse and examining with great admiration his splendid new pistols charley hawker poor boy made a mental resolution to go to sydney and also come back with a new grey horse and a pair of pistols more resplendent than jims and then they went in to get ready for dinner when jim unpacked his valise he produced a pretty bracelet for his sister and a stockwhip for sam on the latter article he was very eloquent sam my boy said he there is not such another in the country it was made by the celebrated bill mossman of the upper hunter the greatest swearer at bullocks and the most accomplished whipmaker on the sydney side he makes only one in six months and he makes it a favour to let you have it for five pounds you can take a piece of bark off a blue gum big enough for a canoe with one cut of it theres a fine of two pounds for cracking one within a mile of government house they make such a row a man the other day cracked one of them on the south head and broke the windows in pitt street youre improving master jim said charles hawker youll soon be as good a hand at a yarn as hamlyns dick at the same time he wrote down a stockwhip similar to this one on the tablets of his memory to be procured on his projected visit to sydney that evening we all sat listening to jims adventures and pleasantly enough he told them with not a little humorous exaggeration it is always pleasant to hear a young fellow telling his first impressions of new things and scenes which have been so long familiar to ourselves but jim had really a very good power of narration and he kept us laughing and amused till long after the usual hour for going to bed next day we had a pleasant ride all of us down the banks of the river the weather was slightly frosty and the air clear and elastic as we followed the windings of the noble rushing stream at a height of seldom less than three hundred feet above his bed the doctor was busy pointing out the alternations of primitive sandstone and slate and the great streams of volcanic bluestone which had poured from various points towards the deep glen in which the river flowed here he would tell us was formerly a lofty cascade and a lake above it but the river had worn through the sandstone bar drained the lake leaving nothing of the waterfall but two lofty cliffs and a rapid there again had come down a lavastream from mirngish which cooled by the waters of the river had stopped and accumulating formed the lofty overhanging cliff on which we stood he showed us how the ferntrees grew only in the still sheltered elbows facing northward where the sun raised a warm steam from the river and the cold south wind could not penetrate he gathered for mrs buckley a bouquet of the tender sweetscented yellow oxalis the winter flower of australia and showed us the copperlizard basking on the red rocks so like the stone on which he lay that one could scarce see him till a metallic gleam betrayed him as he slipped to his lair and we the elder of the party who followed the doctors handsome little brown mare kept our ears open and spoke littlebut gave ourselves fully up to the enjoyment of his learning and eloquence but the doctor did not absorb the whole party far from it he had a rival all the young men and miss alice besides were grouped round captain desborough frequently we elders deep in some old world history of the doctors would be disturbed by a ringing peal of laughter from the other party and then the doctor would laugh and we would all join not that we had heard the joke but from sheer sympathy with the hilarity of the young folks desborough was making himself agreeable and who could do it better he was telling the most outrageous of irish stories and making on purpose the most outrageous of irish bulls after a shout of laughter louder than the rest the doctor remarked thats better for them than geologyeh mrs buckley and so my grandmother we heard desborough say waxed mighty wrath and she up with her goldheaded walking stick in the middle of sackville street and says she ye villain do ye think i dont know my own blenheim spannel when i see him indeed my lady says mike twas himself tould me he belanged to barney who tould you says she the dog himself tould me my lady ye thief of the world says my aunt and yed believe a dog before a dowager countess give him up ye villain this minute or ill hit ye these were the sort of stories desborough delighted in making them up he often confessed as he went on on this occasion when he had done his story they all rode up and joined us and we stood admiring the river stretching westward in pools of gold between black cliffs toward the setting sun then we turned homeward that evening alice said now do tell me captain desborough was that a true story about lady covetowns dog true said he what story worth hearing ever was true the old lady lost her dog certainly and claimed him of a dogstealer in sackville street but all the rest my dear young lady is historic romance mr hamlyn knows a good story said charley hawker about bougong jack do tell it to us uncle jeff i dont think i said that it has so much foundation in fact as captain desboroughs but there must be some sort of truth in it for it comes from the old hands and shows a little more signs of imagination than you would expect from them it is a very stupid story too do tell it they all said so i complied much in the same language as i tell it now you know that these great snowranges which tower up to the west of us are farther south of great breadth and that none have yet forced their way from the country of the ovens and the mitta mitta through here to gippsland the settlers who have just taken up that country trying to penetrate to the eastward here towards us find themselves stopped by a mighty granite wall any adventurous men who may top that barrier see nothing before them but range beyond range of snow alps intersected by precipitous cliffs and frightful chasms this westward range is called the bougongs the blacks during summer are in the habit of coming thus far to collect and feed on the great grey moths bougongs which are found on the rocks they used to report that a fine available country lies to the east embosomed in mountains rendered fertile by perpetual snowfed streams this is the more credible as it is evident that between the bougong range on the west and the warragong range on the extreme east towards us there is a breadth of at least eighty miles there lived a few years ago not very far from the ovensriver a curious character by name john sampson he had been educated at one of the great english universities and was a good scholar though he had been forced to leave the university and as report went england too for some great irregularity he had money and a share in his brotherinlaws station although he never stayed there many months in the year he was always away at some mischief or another no horserace or prizefight could go on without him and he himself never left one of these lastmentioned gatherings without finding some one to try conclusions with him beside this he was a great writer and singer of comic songs and a consummate horseman one fine day he came back to his brothers station in serious trouble whether he had mistaken another mans horse for his own or not i cannot say but at all events he announced that a warrant was out against him for horsestealing and that he must go into hiding so he took up his quarters at a little hut of his brotherinlaws on the ranges inhabited only by a stockkeeper and a black boy and kept a young lubra in pay to watch down the glen for the police one morning she came running into the hut breathless to say that a lieutenant and three troopers were riding towards the hut jack had just time to saddle and mount his horse before the police caught sight of him and started after him at full speed they hunted him into a narrow glen a single cattletrack not a foot broad led on between a swollen rocky creek utterly impassable by horse or man and a lofty precipice of loose broken slate on which one would have thought a goat could not have found a footing the young police lieutenant had done his work well and sent a trooper round to head him so that jack found himself between the devil and the deep sea a tall armed trooper stood in front of him behind was the lieutenant on the right of the creek and on the left the precipice they called out to him to surrender but giving one look before and behind and seeing escape was hopeless he hesitated not a moment but put his horse at the cliff and clambered up rolling down tons of loose slate in his course the lieutenant shut his eyes expecting to see horse and man roll down into the creek and only opened them in time to see jack stand for a moment on the summit against the sky and then disappear he disappeared over the top of the cliff and so he was lost to the ken of white men for the space of four years his sister and brotherinlaw mourned for him as dead and mourned sincerely for they and all who knew him liked him well but at the end of that time on a wild winters night he came back to them dressed in opossum skins with scarce a vestige of european clothing about him his beard had grown down over his chest and he had nearly forgotten his mother tongue but when speech came to him again he told them a strange story it was winter time when he rode away all the table lands were deep with snow and when he had escaped the policemen he had crossed the first of the great ridges on the same night he camped in the valley he found on the other side and having his gun and some ammunition with him he fared well he was beyond the country which had ever been trodden by white men and now for the mere sake of adventure he determined to go further still and see if he could cross the great white mountains which had hitherto been considered an insurmountable barrier for two days he rode over a high tableland deep in snow here and there in a shallow sheltered valley he would find just grass enough to keep his horse alive but nothing for himself on the third night he saw before him another snowridge too far off to reach without rest and tethering his horse in a little crevice between the rocks he prepared to walk to and fro all night to keep off the deadly snow sleepiness that he felt coming over him let me but see what is beyond that next ridge he said and i will lie down and die and now as the stillness of the night came on and the southern cross began to twinkle brilliantly above the blinding snow he was startled once more by a sound which had fallen on his ear several times during his toilsome afternoon journey a sound as of a sudden explosion mingled strangely too with the splintering of broken glass at first he thought it was merely the booming in his ears or the rupture of some vessel in his bursting head or was it fancy no there it was again clearer than before that was no noise in his head for the patient horse turned and looked toward the place where the sound came from thunder the air was clear and frosty and not a cloud stained the sky there was some mystery beyond that snowridge worth living to see he lived to see it for an hour after daybreak next morning he leading his horse stumbled over the snowcovered rocks that bounded his view and when he reached the top there burst on his sight a scene that made him throw up his arms and shout aloud before him pinnacle after pinnacle towered up a mighty alp blazing in the morning sun down through a black rift on its side wound a gleaming glacier which hurled its shattered ice crystals over a dark cliff into the deep profound blue of a lake which stretched north and south studded with green woody islets almost as far as the eye could see toward the mountain the lake looked deep and gloomy but on the hither side showed many a pleasant yellow shallow and sandy bay while between him and the lake lay a mile or so of parklike meadow land in the full verdure of winter as he looked a vast dislocated mass of ice fell crashing from the glacier into the lake and solved at once the mystery of the noises he had heard the night before he descended into the happy valley and found a small tribe of friendly blacks who had never before seen the face of white man and who supposed him to be one of their own tribe dead long ago who had come back to them renovated and beautified from the other world with these he lived a pleasant slothful life while four years went on forgetting all the outside world till his horse was dead his gun rusted and thrown aside and his european clothes long since replaced by the skin of the opossum and the koala he had forgotten his own tongue and had given up all thoughts of crossing again the desolate barriers of snow which divided him from civilization when a slight incident brought back old associations to his mind and roused him from sleep in some hunting excursion he got a slight scratch and searching for some linen to tie it up found in his mimi an old waistcoat which he had worn when he came into the valley in the lining while tearing it up he found a crumpled paper a note from his sister written years before full of sisterly kindness and tenderness he read it again and again before he lay down and the next morning collecting such small stock of provisions as he could he started on the homeward track and after incredible hardships reached his station his brotherinlaw tried in vain with a strong party to reach the lake but never succeeded what mountain it was he discovered or what river is fed by the lake he lived on no man knows to this day some say he went mad and lived in the ranges all the time and that this was all a mere madmans fancy but whether he was mad or not then he is sane enough now and has married a wife and settled down to be one of the most thriving men in that part of the country well said the doctor thrusting his fists deep into his breeches pockets i dont believe that story nor i either doctor i replied but it has amused you all for half an hour so let it pass oh said the doctor rather peevishly if you put it on those grounds i am bound of course to withhold a few little criticisms i was inclined to make on its probability i hope you wont go and pass it off as authentic you know because if we once begin to entertain these sort of legends as meaning anything the whole history of the country becomes one great fogbank through which the devil himself could not find his way now for my part said mischievous alice i think it a very pretty story and i have no doubt that it is every word of it true oh dear me then said the doctor let us vote it true and while we are about it let us believe that the sydney ghost actually did sit on a threerail fence smoking its pipe and directing an anxious crowd of relatives where to find its body by all means let us believe everything we hear the next morning our pleasant party suffered a loss captain brentwood and alice went off home he was wanted there and all things seemed so tranquil that he thought it was foolish to stay away any longer cecil mayford too departed carrying with him the affectionate farewells of the whole party his pleasant even temper and his handsome face had won every one who knew him and though he never talked much yet when he was gone we all missed his merry laugh after one of desboroughs good stories charley hawker went off with him too and spent a few hours with ellen mayford much to his satisfaction but came in again at night as his mother had prayed of him not to leave the majors till he had seen her again that night the major proposed punch and after mrs buckley had gone to bed sam sang a song and desborough told a story about a gamekeeper of his uncles whom the old gentleman desired to start in an independent way of business so he built him a new house and gave him a keg of whisky to start in the spiritselling line but the first night said desborough the villain finished the whisky himself broke the keg and burnt the house down so my uncle had to take him back into service again after all and after this came other stories equally preposterous and we went rather late to bed and the next morning too i am afraid we were rather late for breakfast just as we were sitting down in came captain brentwood hallo said the major what brings you back so soon old friend nothing the matter i hope nothing but business he replied i am going on to dicksons and i shall be back home tonight i hope i am glad to find you so late as i have had no breakfast and have ridden ten miles he took breakfast with us and went on the morning passed somewhat heavily as a morning is apt to do after sitting up late and drinking punch towards noon desborough said now if anybody will confess that he drank just three drops too much punch last night i will do the same mrs buckley my dear lady i hope you will order plenty of pale ale for lunch lunch passed pleasantly enough and afterwards the major telling sam to move a table outside into the verandah disappeared and soon came back with a very curious bottle of madeira we sat then in the verandah smoking for about a quarter of an hour i remember every word that was spoken and every trivial circumstance that happened during that quarter of an hour they are burnt into my memory as if by fire the doctor was raving about english poetry as usual saying however that the modern english poets good as they were had lost the power of melody a good deal this the major denied quoting by torch and trumpet fast arrayd fifty such lines sir are not worth one of miltons said the doctor the trumpet spake not to the armed throng theres melody for you theres a blare and a clang theres a i heard no more mrs buckleys french clock in the house behind chimed three quarters past one and i heard a sound of two persons coming quickly through the house can you tell the step of him who brings evil tidings i think i can at all events i felt my heart grow cold when i heard those footsteps i heard them coming through the house across the boarded floor the one was a rapid firm military footstep accompanied with the clicking of a spur and the other was unmistakably the pad pad of a blackfellow we all turned round and looked at the door there stood the sergeant of desboroughs troopers pale and silent and close behind him clinging to him as if for protection was the lithe naked figure of a black lad looking from behind the sergeant with terrified visage first at one and then at another of us i saw disaster in their faces and would have held up my hand to warn him not to speak before mrs buckley but i was too late for he had spoken and then we sat for a minute looking at one another each man seeing the reflection of his own horror in his neighbours eyes chapter xl the storm bursts poor little cecil mayford had left us about nine oclock in the morning of the day before this and accompanied by charles hawker reached his mothers station about eleven oclock in the day all the way charles had talked incessantly of ellen and cecil joined in charless praises of his sister and joked with him for being awfully spooney about her youre worse about my sister charley said he than old sam is about miss brentwood he takes things quiet enough but if you go on in this style till you are old enough to marry by jove therell be nothing of you left i wonder if she would have me said charles not heeding him the best thing you can do is to ask her said cecil i think i know what she would say though they reached mrs mayfords and spent a few pleasant hours together charles started home again about three oclock and having gone a little way turned to look back the brother and sister stood at the housedoor still he waved his hand in farewell to them and they replied then he rode on and saw them no more cecil and ellen went into the house to their mother the women worked and cecil read aloud to them the book was waverley i saw it afterwards and when supper was over he took it up to begin reading again not that book tonight my boy said his mother read us a chapter out of the bible i am very low in my mind and at such times i like to hear the word he read the good book to them till quite late both he and ellen thought it strange that their mother should insist on that book on a weeknight they never usually read it save on sunday evenings the morning broke bright and frosty cecil was abroad betimes and went down the paddock to fetch the horses he put them in the stockyard and stood for a time close to the stable talking to a tame black lad that they employed about the place his attention was attracted by a noise of horses feet he looked up and saw about a dozen men riding swiftly and silently across the paddock towards the house for an instant he seems to have idly wondered who they were and have had time to notice a thickset gaudily dressed man who rode in front of the others when the kitchendoor was thrown suddenly open and the old hutkeeper with his grey hair waving in the wind run out cryingsave yourself in gods name master cecil the bushrangers cecil raised his clenched hands in wild despair they were caught like birds in a trap no hopeno escape nothing left for it now but to die redhanded he dashed into the house with the old hutkeeper and shut the door the black lad ran up to a little rocky knoll within two hundred yards of the house and hiding himself watched what went on he saw the bushrangers ride up to the door and dismount then they began to beat the door and demand admittance then the door was burst down and one of them fell dead by a pistolshot then they rushed in tumultuously leaving one outside to mind the horses then the terrified boy heard the dull sound of shots fired rapidly inside the building pray that you may never hear that noise reader it always means mischief and then all was comparatively still for a time then there began to arise a wild sound of brutal riot within and after a time they poured out again and mounting rode away then the black boy slipt down from his lair like a snake and stole towards the house all was still as death the door was open but poor little savage as he was he dared not enter once he thought he heard a movement within and listened intently with all his faculties as only a savage can listen but all was still again and then gathering courage he went in in the entrance stepping over the body of the dead bushranger he found the poor old whiteheaded hutkeeper knocked down and killed in the first rush he went on into the parlour and thereoh lamentable sightwas cecil clever handsome little cecil our old favourite lying half fallen from the sofa shot through the heart dead but not alone no prone along the floor covering six feet or more of ground lay the hideous corpse of moody the cannibal the redheaded miscreant who had murdered poor lee under george hawkers directions i think the poor black boy would have felt in his dumb darkened heart some sorrow at seeing his kind old master so cruelly murdered perhaps he would have raised the deathcry of his tribe over him and burnt himself with fire as their custom is but he was too terrified at seeing so many of the lordly white race prostrated by one anothers hands he stood and trembled and then almost in a whisper began to call for mrs mayford missis he said miss ellen all pull away bushranger chaps make a light good missis plenty frightened this fellow no answer no sign of mrs mayford or ellen they must have escaped then we will try to hope so the black boy peered into one chamber after another but saw no signs of them only the stillness of death over all let us leave this accursed house lest prying too closely we may find crouching in some dark corner a gorgon who will freeze us into stone the black lad stripped himself naked as he was born and running like a deer sped to major buckleys before the south wind across the plain there he found the sergeant and told him his tale and the sergeant and he broke in on us with the terrible news as we were sitting merrily over our wine chapter xli widderin shows clearly that he is worth all the money sam gave for him the sergeant as i said broke in upon us with the fearful news as we sat at wine for a minute no man spoke but all sat silent and horror struck only the doctor rose quietly and slipped out of the room unnoticed desborough spoke first he rose up with deadly wrath in his face and swore a fearful oath an oath so fearful that he who endorsed every word of it then will not write it down now to the effect that he would take neither meat nor drink nor pleasure nor rest beyond what was necessary to keep body and soul together before he had purged the land of these treacherous villains charles hawker went up to the sergeant with a livid face and shaking hands will you tell me again robinson are they all dead the sergeant looked at him compassionately well sir he said the boy seemed to think mrs and miss mayford had escaped but you mustnt trust what he says sir you are deceiving me said charles there is something you are hiding from me i shall go down there this minute and see you will do nothing of the kind sir said mrs buckley coming into the doorway and confronting him your place is with captain desborough i am going down to look after ellen during these few moments sam had stood stupified he stepped up to the sergeant and said would you tell me which way they went from the mayfords down the river sir ah said sam towards captain brentwoods and alice at home and alonethere may be time yet he ran out of the room and i after him his first trouble i thoughthis first trial how will our boy behave now let me mention again that the distance from the mayfords to captain brentwoods following the windings of the river on its right bank was nearly twenty miles from major buckleys to the same point across the plains was barely ten so that there was still a chance that a brave man on a good horse might reach captain brentwoods before the bushrangers in spite of the start they had got sams noble horse widderin a horse with a pedigree a hundred years old stood in the stable the buying of that horse had been sams only extravagance for which he had often reproached himself and now this day he would see whether he would get his moneys worth out of that horse or no i followed him up to the stable and found him putting the bridle on widderins beautiful little head neither of us spoke only when i handed him the saddle and helped him with the girths he said god bless you i ran out and got down the sliprails for him as he rode by he said goodbye uncle jeff perhaps you wont see me again and i cried out remember your god and your mother sam and dont do anything foolish then he was gone and looking across the plains the way he should go i saw another horseman toiling far away and recognised doctor mulhaus good doctor he had seen the danger in a moment and by his ready wit had got a start of every one else by ten minutes the doctor on his handsome longbodied arabian mare was making good work of it across the plains when he heard the rush of horses feet behind him and turning he saw tall widderin bestridden by sam springing over the turf gaining on him stride after stride in a few minutes they were alongside of one another good lad cried the doctor on forwards catch her and away to the woods with her bloodhound desborough will be on their trail in halfanhour save her and we will have noble vengeance sam only waved his hand in goodbye and sped on across the plain like a solitary ship at sea he steered for a single tree now becoming dimly visible at the foot of the organ hill the good horse with elastic and easy motion fled on his course like a bird lifting his feet clearly and rapidly through the grass the brisk south wind filled his wide nostrils as he turned his graceful neck from side to side till finding that work was meant and not play he began to hold his head straight before him and rush steadily forward and sam poor sam all his hopes for life now brought down to this to depend on the wind and pluck of an unconscious horse one stumble now and it were better to lie down on the plain and die he was in the hands of god and he felt it he said one short prayer but that towards the end was interrupted by the wild current of his thoughts was there any hope they the devils would have been drinking at the mayfords and perhaps would go slow or would they ride fast and wild after thinking a short time he feared the latter they had tasted blood and knew that the country would be roused on them shortly on on good horse the lonely shepherd on the plains sleepily watching his feeding sheep looked up as sam went speeding by and thought how fine a thing it would be to be dressed like that and have nothing to do but to ride bloodhorses to death mind your sheep good shepherd perhaps it were better for you to do that and nothing more all your life than to carry in your breast for one short hour such a volcano of rage indignation and terror as he does who hurries unheeding through your scattered flock here are a brace of good pistols and they with care shall give account if need be of two men after that nothing it were better so much better not to live if one were only ten minutes too late the doctor would be up soon not much matter if he were though only another life gone the organ hill a cloud of misty blue when he started now hung in aerial fluted cliffs above his head as he raced across the long glacis which lay below the hill he could see a solitary eagle wheeling round the topmost pinnacles against the clear blue sky then the hill was behind him and before him another stretch of plain bounded by timber which marked the course of the river brave widderin had his ears back now and was throwing his breath regularly through his nostrils in deep sighs good horse only a little longer bear thyself bravely this day and then pleasant pastures for thee till thou shalt go the way of all horses many a time has she patted with kind words thy rainbow neck my horse help us to save her now alas good willing brute he cannot understand only he knows that his kind master is on his back and so he will run till he drop good widderin think of the time when thy sire rushed triumphant through the shouting thousands at epsom and all england heard that arcturus had won the derby think of the time when thy grandam carrying sheik abdullah bore down in a whirlwind of sand on the toiling affrighted caravan ah thou knowest not of these things but yet thy speed flags not we are not far off now good horse we shall know all soon now he was in the forest again and now as he rode quickly down the steep sandy road among the braken he heard the hoarse rush of the river in his ears and knew the end was wellnigh come no drink now good widderin a bucket of champagne in an hours time if thou wilt only stay not now to bend thy neck down to the clear gleaming water flounder through the ford and just twenty yards up the bank by the cherrytree we shall catch sight of the house and know our fate now the house was in sight and now he cried aloud some wild inarticulate sound of thankfulness and joy all was as peaceful as ever and alice unconscious stood whiterobed in the verandah feeding her birds as he rode up he shouted out to her and beckoned she came running through the house and met him breathless at the doorway the bushrangers alice my love he said we must fly this instant they are close to us now she had been prepared for this she knew her duty well for her father had often told her what to do no tears no hysterics she took sams hand without a word and placing her fairy foot upon his boot vaulted up into the saddle before him cryingeleanor eleanor eleanor the cook came running out fly said alice get away into the bush the gang are coming close by she an old vandemonian needed no second warning and as the two young people rode away they saw her clearing the paddock rapidly and making for a dense clump of wattles which grew just beyond the fence whither now sam said alice the moment they were started i should feel safer across the river he replied that little wooded knoll would be a fine hidingplace and they will come down this side of the river from mayfords from mayfords why have they been there they have indeed alas poor cecil what has happened to him nothing serious dead my love dead oh poor little cecil she cried that we were all so fond of and mrs mayford and ellen they have escapedthey are not to be foundthey have hidden away somewhere they crossed the river and dismounting they led the tired horse up the steep slope of turf that surrounded a little castellated tor of bluestone here they would hide till the storm was gone by for from here they could see the windings of the river and all the broad plain stretched out beneath their feet i do not see them anywhere alice said sam presently i see no one coming across the plains they must be either very near us in the hollow of the rivervalley or else a long way off i have very little doubt they will come here though sooner or later there they are said alice surely there are a large party of horsemen on the plain but they are seven or eight miles off ay ten said sam i am not sure they are horsemen then he said suddenly in a whisper lie down my love in gods name here they are close to us there burst on his ear a confused sound of talking and laughing and out of one of the rocky gullies leading towards the river came the men they had been flying from in number about fourteen they had crossed the river for some unknown reason and to the fearstruck riders it seemed as though they were making straight towards their lair he had got widderins head in his breast blindfolding him with his coat for should he neigh now they were undone indeed as the bushrangers approached the horse began to get uneasy and paw the ground putting sam in such an agony of terror that the sweat rolled down his face in the midst of this he felt a hand on his arm and alices voice which he scarcely recognised said in a fierce whisper give me one of your pistols sir leave that to me he replied in the same tone as you please she said but i must not fall alive into their hands never look your mother in the face again if i do he gave one more glance round and saw that the enemy would come within a hundred yards of their hidingplace then he held the horse faster than ever and shut his eyes was it a minute only or an hour till they heard the sound of the voices dying away in the roar of the river and opening their eyes once more looked into one anothers faces faces they thought that they had never seen beforeso each told the other afterwardsso wild so haggard and so strange and now that they were safe and free againfree to arise and leave their dreadful rock prison and wander away where they would they could scarcely believe that the danger was past they came out silently from among the crags and took up another station where they could see all that went on they saw the miscreants swarming about the house and heard a pistolshotonly one who can they be firing at said alice in a subdued tone they were both so utterly appalled by their late danger that they spoke in whispers though the enemy were a quarter of a mile off mere mischief i should fancy said sam there is no one there oh alice my love can you realize that we are safe hardly yet sam but who could those men be we saw at such a distance on the plain could they have been cattle i am seldom deceived you know i can see an immense distance why said sam i had forgotten them they must be our friends on these fellows tracks desborough would not be long starting i know i hope my father said alice will hear nothing till he sees me poor father what a state he will be in see there is a horseman close to us it is the doctor they saw dr mulhaus ride up to one of the heights overlooking the river and reconnoitre seeing the men in the house he began riding down towards them he will be lost said alice he thinks we are there call sam at all risks sam did so and they saw the doctor turn alice showed herself for a moment and then he turned back and rode the way he had come in a few minutes he joined them from the rear and taking alice in his arms kissed her heartily so our jewel is safe thenpraise be to god thanks due also to a brave man and a good horse this is the last station those devils will ruin for our friends are barely four miles off i saw them just now i wish i only wish said sam that they may delay long enough to be caught i would give a good deal for that there was but little chance of that though their measures were too well taken almost as sam spoke the three listeners heard a shrill whistle and immediately the enemy began mounting some of them were evidently drunk and could hardly get on their horses but were assisted by the others but very shortly they were all clear off heading to the northwest now we may go down and see what destruction has been done said alice who would have thought to see such times as these stay a little said the doctor and let us watch these gentlemens motions where can they be going norweststraight on to the mountains i am of opinion said sam that they are going to lie up in one of the gullies this evening they are full of drink and madness and they dont know what they are about if they get into the main system of gullies we shall have them like rats in a trap for they can never get out by the lower end do you see doctor a little patch of white road among the trees over there that leads to the limestone gates as we call it if they pass those walls upwards they are confined as in a pound watch the white road and we shall see the piece of road alluded to was about two miles off and winding round a steep hill among trees only one turn in it was visible and over this as they watched they saw a dark spot pass followed by a crowd of others there they go said sam the madmen are safe now see there comes desborough and all of them let us go down they turned to go and saw jim coming towards them by the route that sam had come all bespattered with clay limping and leading his new grey horse dead lame he threw up his hat when he saw them and gave a feeble hurrah but even then a twinge of pain shot across his face and when he was close they saw he was badly hurt god save you my dear sister he said i have been in such a state of mind god forgive me i have been cursing the day i was born sam i started about three minutes after you and had very nearly succeeded in overhauling the doctor about two miles from here when this brute put his foot in a crab hole and came down rolling on my leg i was so bruised i couldnt mount again and so i have walked i see you are all right though and that is enough for me oh my sistermy darling alice think what we have escaped so they went towards the house and when major buckley caught sight of alice riding between doctor mulhaus and sam he gave such a stentorian cheer that the retreating bushrangers must have heard it well ridden gentlemen he said and who won the race was it widderin or the arabian or the nondescript sydney importation the sydney importation sir would have beaten the arabian barring accident said jim but seriously speaking i should have been far too late to be of any service and i said the doctor also sam won the race and has got the prize now let us look forward and not backward they communicated to desborough all particulars and told him of the way they had seen the bushrangers go every one was struck with the change in him no merry stories now the laughing irishman was gone and a stern gloomy man more like an englishman stood in his place i heard after that he deeply blamed himself for what had occurred though no one else thought of doing so and thought he had not taken full precautions on the present occasion he said well gentlemen night is closing in major buckley i think you will agree with me that we should act more effectually if we waited till daylight and refresh both horses and men more particularly as the enemy in their drunken madness have hampered themselves in the mountains major doctor mulhaus and mr halbert you are military menwhat do you say they agreed that there was no doubt it would be much the best plan i would sooner hed have gone tonight and got it over said charles hawker taking sams arm oh sam sam think of poor cecil think of poor ellen when she hears what has happened she must know by now poor charley said sam i am so sorry for you lie down and get to sleep the sun is going down he lay down as he was bid somewhere out of the way he was crushed and stunned he hardly seemed to know at present what he was doing after a time sam went in and found him sleeping uneasily but alice was in sad tribulation at the mischief done all her pretty little womanly ornaments overturned and broken her piano battered to pieces and worst of all her poor kangaroo shot dead lying in the verandah oh said she to major buckley you must think me very wicked to think of such things at a time like this but i cannot help it there is something so shocking to me in such a sudden bouleversement of old order yet if it shocks me to see my piano broken how terrible must a visitation like the mayfords be these are not the times for moralizing however i must see about entertaining the garrison eleanor the cook had come back from her lair quite unconcerned she informed the company in a nonchalant sort of way that this was the third adventure of the kind she had been engaged in and although they seemed to make a great fuss about it on the other side van diemens land it was considered a mere necessary nuisance and so proceeded to prepare such supper as she could in the same offhand way she remarked to sam when he went into the kitchen to get a light for his pipe that if it was true that mike howe had crossed and was among them they had better look out for squalls for that he was a devil and no mistake desborough determined to set a watch out on the road towards the mouth of the gully where they were supposed to be we shall have them in the morning said he let every one get to sleep who can sleep for i expect every one to follow me to morrow charles hawker had laid down in an inner room and was sleeping uneasily when he was awakened by some one and looking up saw major buckley with a light in his hand bending over him he started up what is the matter sir he asked why do you look at me so strangely is there any new misfortune charles said the major you have no older friend than me i know it sir what do you want me to do i want you to stay at home tomorrow anything but that sir they will call me a coward no one shall do so i swear that he who calls you a coward shall feel the weight of my arm why am i not to go with them why am i to be separated from the others you must not ask said the major perhaps you will know some day but not yet all i say to you is go home to your mother tomorrow and stay there should you fire a shot or strike a blow against those men we are going to hunt down you may do a deed which would separate you from the rest of mankind and leave you to drag on a miserable guilty life do you promise i will promise said charles but i wonder never mind wondering good night the troopers lay in the hall and in the middle of the night there was a sound of a horse outside and he who was nearest the door got up and went out who is there said the voice of captain brentwood jackson sir my house has been stuck up has it not yes sir and my daughter safe sir young mr buckley rode over and caught her up out of it ten minutes before they got here long life to him and glory to god who is here the trooper enumerated them and what has become of the gang asked the captain gone into the limestone gully sir safe for tomorrow ah well i shall come in and lie in the hall dont make a noise what is that they both started some one of the many sleepers with that strange hoarse voice peculiar to those who talk in their dreams said with singular energy and distinctness i will go sir they will call me coward thats young mr hawker sir said the trooper his sweethearts brother mr mayford was killed by them yesterday the head of this very gang sir that villain touanhis name is hawker an odd coincidence sir very odd said the captain at the same time jackson if i were you i wouldnt talk about it there are many things one had best not talk about jackson pull out the corner of that blanket will you so we shall have some fun tomorrow up in the pass im thinking theyll fight sir said the trooper if we can bail them up theyll fight believe me better so i think we shall save the hangman some trouble good night sir so captain brentwood lay down beside the trooper and slept the sleep of the just among his broken chairs and tables the others slept too sound and quiet as though there were no fight on the morrow but ere the moon grew pale they were woke by desborough tramping about with clicking spurs among the sleepers and giving orders in a loud noise at the first movement while the rest were yawning and stretching themselves and thinking that battle was not altogether so desirable a thing on a cold morning as it was overnight major buckley was by charles hawkers bedside and reminding him of his promise got him out unperceived helped him to saddle his horse and started him off to his mother with a note the lad overawed by the majors serious manner went without debate putting the note in his pocket i have seen that note sam showed it to me the next day and so i can give you the contents it was from major buckley to mary hawker and ran thus i have sent your boy to you dear old friend bearing this you will have heard by now what has happened and you will give me credit for preventing what might come to be a terrible catastrophe the boy is utterly unconscious that his own father is the man whose life is sought this day above all others he is at the head of this gang mary my own son saw him yesterday my hand shall not be raised against him but further than that i will not interfere your troubles have come now to the final and most terrible pass and all the advice i have to give you is to pray and pray continually till this awful storm is gone by remember that come what may you have two friends entirely devoted to youmy wife and myself hurriedly written scrawled rather as this note was it showed me again plainer than ever what a noble clearhearted man he was who had written it but this is not to the purpose charles hawker departed carrying this before the others were stirring and held his way through the forestroad towards his mothers station this same two days business was the best stroke of work that the devil did in that part of the country for many years with his usual sagacity he had busied himself in drawing the threads of mischief so parallel that it seemed they must end in one and only one lamentable issue namely that charles hawker and his father should meet pistol in hand as deadly enemies but at this last period of the game our good honest major completely checkmated him by sending charles hawker home to his mother in this terrible pass after this unexpected move of the majors he the devil no other began casting about for a scoundrel by whose assistance he might turn the majors flank but no great rogue being forthcoming he had to look round for the next best substitute a great fooland one of these he found immediately riding exactly the way he wished him he subpoenaed immediately and found to do his work better even than a good rogue would have done we shall see how poor charles hawker pricking along through the forest getting every moment further from danger and mischief met a man charging along the road full speed who instantly pulled up and spoke to him this was the consummate fool sent of the devil whom i have mentioned above we have seen him before he was the longest brownest stupidest of the hawbuck family the one who could spit further than any of his brothers well charley he said is this all true about the bushrangers charles said it was and they were bailed up in the limestone gully and all the party were away after them where are you going then asked the unfortunate young idiot home to my mother blurted out poor charles well said the other speaking unconsciously exactly the words which the enemy of mankind desired well i couldnt have believed that if a chap had said that of you in my hearing id have fought him if hed been as big as a house i never thought that of you charley charles cursed aloud what have i done to be talked to like this major buckley has no right to send me away like this to be branded as coward through the country side ten times over better to be shot than have such words as these said to me i shall go back with you thats the talk said the poor fool i thought i wasnt wrong in you charley and so charles galloped back with him we in the meantime had started from the station ere day was well broke foremost of the company rode desborough calm and serene and on either side of him captain brentwood and major buckley then came the doctor sam jim halbert and myself behind us again five troopers and the sergeant each man of us all was armed with a sword and every man in that company as it happened knew the use of that weapon well the troopers carried carbines and all of us carried pistols the glare in the east changing from pearly green to golden yellow gave notice of the coming sun one snow peak tambo i think began to catch the light and blaze like another morning star the day had begun in earnest and as we entered the mouth of the glen to which we were bound slanting gleams of light were already piercing the misty gloom and lighting up the loftier crags a deep rockwalled glen it was open and level though in the centre ran a tangled waving line of evergreen shrubs marking the course of a pretty bright creek which half hidden by luxuriant vegetation ran beside the faint track leading to one of captain brentwoods mountain huts along this track we could plainly see the hoof marks of the men we were after it was one of the most beautiful gullies i had ever seen and i turned to say so to some one who rode beside me conceive my horror at finding it was charles hawker i turned to him fiercely and said get back charles go home you dont know what you are doing lad he defied me and i was speaking roughly to him again when there came a puff of smoke from among the rocks overhead and down i went head over heels a bullet had grazed my thigh and killed my horse who throwing me on my head rendered me hors de combat so that during the fight which followed i was sitting on a rock very sick and very stupid a mile from the scene of action my catastrophe caused only a temporary stoppage and during the confusion charles hawker was unnoticed the man who had fired at me why at me i cannot divine was evidently a solitary guard perched among the rocks the others held on for about a quarter of an hour till the valley narrowed up again just leaving room for the walk between the brawling creek and the tall limestone cliff but after this it opened out into a broader amphitheatre walled on all sides by inaccessible rock save in two places sam from whom i get this account of affairs had just time to notice this when he saw captain brentwood draw a pistol and fire it and at the same instant a man dashed out of some scrub on the other side of the creek and galloped away up the valley they have had the precaution to set two watches for us which i hardly expected said captain desborough they will fight us now they cant help it thank god they have had a short turn and a merry one but they are dead men and they know it the devil is but a poor paymaster buckley after all this hide and seek work they have only got two days liberty the troopers now went to the front with halbert and the other military men while sam jim and charles the last all unperceived by the major in his excitement rode in the rear we are going to have a regular battle said jim they are bailed up and must fight some of us will go home feet foremost today so they rode on through the open forest till they began to see one or two horsemen through the treestems reconnoitering the ground began to rise towards a lofty cliff that towered before them and all could see that the end was coming then they caught sight of the whole gang scattered about among the low shrubs and a few shots were fired on both sides before the bushrangers turned and retreated towards the wall of rock now plainly visible through the timber our party continued to advance steadily in open order then under the beetling crags where the ferntrees began to feather up among the fallen boulders the bushrangers turned like hunted wolves and stood at bay chapter xlii the fight among the ferntrees then desborough cried aloud to ride at them and spare no man and as he spoke every golden fernbough and every coigne of vantage among the rocks began to blaze and crackle with gun and pistol shot jims horse sprung aloft and fell hurling him forcibly to the ground and a tall young trooper dropping his carbine rolled heavily off his saddle and lay on the grass face downward quite still as if asleep theres the first man killed said the major very quietly sam my boy dont get excited but close on the first fellow you see a chance at and sam looking in his fathers face as he spoke saw a light in his eyes that he had never seen there beforethe light of battle the major caught a carbine from the hands of a trooper who rode beside him and took a snap shot quick as lightning at a man whom they saw running from one cover to another the poor wretch staggered and put his hands to his head then stumbled and fell heavily down now the fight became general and confused all about among the fern and the flowers among the lemanshrubs and the tangled vines men fought and fired and struck and cursed while the little brown bandiroots scudded swiftly away and the deadly snake hid himself in his darkest lair affrighted shots were cracking on all sides two riderless horses confused in the melee were galloping about neighing and a third lay squealing on the ground in the agonies of death sam saw a man fire at his father whose horse went down while the major arose unhurt he rode at the ruffian who was dismounted and cut him so deep between the shoulder and the neck that he fell and never spoke again then seeing halbert and the doctor on the right fiercely engaged with four men who were fighting with clubbed muskets and knives he turned to help them but ere he reached them a tall handsome young fellow dashed out of the shrub and pulling his horse short up took deliberate aim at him and fired sam heard the bullet go hissing past his ear and got mad that young dog shall go down said he i know him he is the one who rode first yesterday and as this passed through his mind he rode straight at him with his sword hand upon his left shoulder he came full against him in a moment and as the man held up his gun to guard himself his cut descended so full and hard that it shore through the gunbarrel as through a stick and ere he could bring his hand to his cheek his opponent had grappled him and the two rolled off their horses together locked in a deadly embrace then began an awful and deadly fight between these two young fellows sams sword had gone from his hand in the fall and he was defenceless save by such splendid physical powers as he had by nature but his adversary though perhaps a little lighter was a terrible enemy and fought with the strength and litheness of a leopard he had his hand at sams throat and was trying to choke him sam saw that one great effort was necessary and with a heave of his whole body threw the other beneath him and struck downwards three quick blows with the whole strength of his ponderous fist on the face of the man as he lay beneath him the hold on his throat loosened and seeing that they had rolled within reach of his sword in a moment he had clutched it and drawing back his elbow prepared to plunge it in his adversarys chest but he hesitated he could not do it maddened as he was with fighting the sight of that bloody face bruised beyond recognition by his terrible blows and the wild fierce eyes full of rage and terror looking into his own stayed his hand and while he paused the man spoke thick and indistinctly for his jaw was broken if you will spare me he said i will be kings evidence then turn on your face said sam and i will tie you up and as he spoke a trooper ran up and secured the prisoner who appealed to sam for his handkerchief i fought you fair he said and youre a man worth fighting but you have broken something in my face with your fist give me something to tie it up with god save us all said sam giving him his handkerchief this is miserable work i hope it is all over it seemed so all he heard were the fearful screams of a wounded man lying somewhere among the fern where are they all jackson said he all away to the right sir said the trooper one of my comrades is killed your father has had his horse shot the doctor is hit in the arm and mr james brentwood has got his leg broke with the fall of his horse they are minding him now weve got all the gang alive or dead except two captain desborough is up the valley now after the head man and young mr hawker is with him dn it all hark to that two shots were fired in quick succession in the direction indicated and sam having caught his horse gallopped off to see what was going on desborough fought neither against small nor great but only against one man and he was george hawker him he had sworn he would bring home dead or alive when he and his party had first broken through the fern he had caught sight of his quarry and had instantly made towards him as quick as the broken scrubtangled ground would allow they knew one another and as soon as hawker saw that he was recognised he made to the left away from the rest of his gang trying to reach as desborough could plainly see the only practicable way that led from the amphitheatre in which they were back into the mountains they fired at one another without effect at the first hawker was now pushing in full flight though the scrub was so dense that neither made much way now the ground got more open and easier travelled when desborough was aware of one who came charging recklessly up alongside of him and looking round he recognised charles hawker good lad he said come on i must have that fellow before us there he is the archdevil of the lot if we follow him to hll we must have him well have him safe enough said charles push to the left captain and we shall get him against those fallen rocks desborough saw the excellence of this advice this was the last piece of broken ground there was on the right the cliff rose precipitous and from its side had tumbled a confused heap of broken rock running out into the glen once past this the man they were pursuing would have the advantage for he was splendidly mounted and beyond was clear galloping ground as it was he was in a recess and desborough and charles pushing forward succeeded in bringing him to bay alas too well george hawker reined up his horse when he saw escape was impossible and awaited their coming with a doublebarrelled pistol in his hand as the other two came on calling on him to surrender desboroughs horse received a bullet in his chest and down went horse and man together but charles pushed on till he was within twenty yards of the bushranger and levelled his pistol to fire so met father and son the second time in their lives all unconsciously for an instant they glared on one another with wild threatening eyes as the father made his aim more certain and deadly was there no lightning in heaven to strike him dead and save him from this last horrid crime was there no warning voice to tell him that this was his son none the bullet sped and the poor boy tumbled from his saddle clutching wildly with crooked convulsive fingers at the grass and flowersshot through the the chest then ere desborough had disentangled himself from his fallen horse george hawker rode off laughingout through the upper rock walls into the presence of the broad bald snowline that rolled above his head in endless lofty tiers towards the sky desborough arose swearing and stamping but ere he could pick up his cap sam was alongside of him breathless and with him another commonlooking manmy man dick no otherand they both cried out together what has happened look there said desborough pointing to something dark among the grassthats what has happened what lies there was charles hawker and the villain is off who shot charles hawker said dick his namesake said desborough his own father said dick thats terrible what do you mean they both asked aghast never mind now he answered captain desborough what are you going to do do you know where hes gone up into the mountain to lie by i suppose said desborough not at all sir he is going to cross the snow and get to the old hut near the murray gate what merrymans hut said the captain impossible he could not get through that way i tell you he can that is where they came from at first that is where they went to when they landed and this is the gully they came through are you deceiving me said desborough it will be worse for you if you are i aint in a humour for that sort of thing who are you i am mr hamlyns groomdick strike me dead if i aint telling the truth do you know this man buckley said desborough calling out to sam who was sitting beside poor charles hawker holding his head up know him of course i do he replied ever since i was a child then look here said desborough to dick i shall trust you now you say he will cross the snow if i were to go round by the parsons i shouldnt get much snow thats just it dont you see you can be round at the huts before him thats what i mean said dick take mr buckleys horse and ride him till he drops and youll get another at the parsons if you have any snow it will be on broadsaddle but it wont signify you go round the low side of tambo and sight the lake and youll be there before him how far sixty miles or thereabouts plain sailing it aint eleven oclock yet good ill remember you for this buckley i want your horse is the lad dead no but he is very bad ill try to get him home take the horse he is not so good a one as widderin but hell carry you to the parsons god speed you they watched him ride away almost south skirting the ridges of the mountain as long as he could then they saw him scrambling up a lofty wooded ridge and there he disappeared they raised poor charles hawker up and sam mounting dicks horse took the wounded man up before him and started to go slowly home after a time he said do you feel worse charles and the other replied no but i am very cold after that he stayed quite still with his arm round sam buckleys neck until they reached the brentwoods door some came out to the door to meet them and among others alice take him from me said sam to one of the men be very gentle he is asleep and so they took the dead mans arm from off the living mans shoulder and carried him in for charles hawker was asleep indeedin the sleep that knows no waking that was one of the fiercest and firmest stands that was ever made by bushrangers against the authorities of the latter five were shot down three wounded and the rest captured save two the gang was destroyed at once and life and property once more secure though at a sad sacrifice one trooper was shot dead at the first onseta fine young fellow just picked from his regiment for good conduct to join the police another was desperately wounded who died the next day on the part of the independent men assisting there were charles hawker killed doctor mulhaus shot in the left arm and jim with his leg broke so that on that evening captain brentwoods house was like a hospital captain brentwood set his sons leg under dr mulhaus directions the doctor keeping mighty brave though once or twice his face twisted with pain and he was nearly fainting alice was everywhere pale and calm helping every one who needed it and saying nothing eleanor the cook pervaded the house doing the work of seven women and having the sympathies of fourteen she told them that this was as bad a job as shed ever seen worse in fact that the nearest thing shed ever seen to it was when mat steemans mob were broke up by the squatters but then she added there were none but prisoners killed but when alice had done all she could and the house was quiet she went up to her father and said now father comes the worst part of the matter for me who is to tell mrs hawker mrs buckley my dear would be the best person but she is at the mayfords i am afraid mrs hawker must be told at once father by some of us i do so dread her hearing of it by some accident when none of her friends are with her oh dear oh dear i never thought to have had such times as these alice my darling said her father do you think that you have strength to carry the news to her if major buckley went with you he could tell her you know and it would be much better for her to have him an old friend beside her it would be such a delay to go round and fetch his wife have you courage i will make courage she said speak to major buckley father and i will get ready she went to sam i am going on a terrible errand she said i am going to tell mrs hawker about this dreadful dreadful business now what i want to say is that you mustnt come your father is going with me and ill get through it alone sam now please she added seeing sam was going to speak dont argue about it i am very much upset as it is and i want you to stay here you wont follow us will you whatever you order alice is law said sam i wont come if you dont wish it but i cant see there now will you get me my horse and please stay by poor jim for my sake sam complied and alice getting on her ridinghabit came back trembling and trying not to cry to tell major buckley that she was ready he took her in his arms and kissed her you are a brave noble girl he said i thank god for such a daughterinlaw now my dear let us hurry off and not think of what is to come it was about five oclock when they went off sam and halbert having let them out of the paddock went indoors to comfort poor jims heart and to get something to eat if it were procurable jim lay on his bed tossing about and the doctor sat beside him talking to him pale and grim waiting for the doctor who had been sent for no other than his drunken old enemy this is about as nice a kettle of fish said jim when they came and sat beside him as a man could possibly wish to eat poor cecil and charley both gone eh well i know it aint decent for a fellow with a broken leg to feel wicked but i do nevertheless i wish now that i had had a chance at some of them before that stupid brute of a horse got shot if you dont lie still you jim said sam your leg will never set and then you must have it taken off you know how is your arm doctor shooting a little said the doctor nothing to signify i believe at least nothing in the midst of such a tragedy as this poor mary hawker the pretty little villagemaid we all loved so well to come to such an end as this is it true then doctor that hawker the bushranger is her husband quite true alas every one must know it now but i pray you sam to keep the darkest part of it all from her dont let her know that the boy fell by the hand of his father i could almost swear said sam that one among the gang is his son too when they rode past alice and myself yesterday morning one was beside him so wonderfully like him that even at that time i set them down for father and son if hamlyns strange tale be true it is so said the doctor is the young man you speak of among the prisoners do you know yes i helped to capture him myself said sam what do you mean by hamlyns story oh a long one he met him in a hut the night after we picnicd at mirngish and found out who he was the secret not being ours your father and i never told any of you young people of the fact of this bushranger being poor mrs hawkers husband i wish we had all this might have been avoided but the poor soul always desired that the secret of his birth might be kept from charles and you see the consequences ill never keep a secret again come here with me let us see both of them they followed him and he turned into a little side room at the back of the house it was a room used for chance visitors or strangers containing two small beds which now bore an unaccustomed burden for beneath the snowwhite coverlids lay two figures indistinct indeed but unmistakeable which is he whispered the doctor sam raised the counterpane from the nearest one but it was not charles it was a young handsome face that he saw lying so quietly and peacefully on the white pillow that he exclaimed surely this man is not dead the doctor shook his head i have often seen them like that he said he is shot through the heart then they went to the other bed where poor charles lay sam gently raised the black curls from his face but none of them spoke a word for a few minutes till the doctor said now let us come and see his brother they crossed the yard to a slab outbuilding before which one of the troopers was keeping guard with a loaded carbine and the sergeant coming across admitted them seven or eight fearfully illlooking ruffians lay about on the floor handcuffed they were most of them of the usual convict stamp dark saturnine looking fellows though one offered a strange contrast by being an albino and another they could not see plainly for he was huddled up in a dark corner bending down over a basin of water and dabbing his face the greater part of them cursed and blasphemed desperately as is the manner of such men when their blood is up and they are reckless while the wounded ones lay in a fierce sullen silence more terrible almost than the foul language of the others he is not here said sam stay that must be him wiping his face he went towards him and saw he was right the young man he had taken looked wildly up like a trapped animal into his face and the doctor could not suppress an exclamation when he saw the likeness to his father is your face very bad said sam quietly the other turned away in silence ill tie it up for you if you like said sam it dont want no tying up he turned his face to the wall and remained obstinately silent they perceived that nothing more was to be got from him and departed but turning at the door they still saw him crouched in the corner like a wild beast wiping his bruised face every now and then with sams handkerchief apparently thinking of nothing hoping for nothing such a pitiful sightsuch an example of one who was gone beyond feeling pity or sorrow or aught else save physical pain that the doctors gorge rose and he said stamping on the gravel a man who says that that is not the saddest saddest sight he ever saw is a disgrace to the mother that bore him to see a young fellow like that with such a physiqueand god only knows what undeveloped qualities in him only ripe for the gallows at fiveandtwenty is enough to make the angels weep he knows no evil but physical pain and that he considers but a temporary one he knows no good save perhaps to be faithful to his confederates he has been brought up from his cradle to look on every man as his enemy he never knew what it was to love a human being in his life why what does such a man regard this world as as the antechamber of hell if he ever heard of such a place i want to know what either of us three would have been if we had had his training i want to know that now we might have been as much worse than him as a wolf is worse than an eviltempered dog a beautiful colley came up to the doctor and fawned on him looking into his face with her deep expressive hazel eyes we must do something for that fellow sam if its only for his names sake said the doctor that poor boy sitting crouched there in the corner with a broken jaw and just so much of human feeling as one may suppose a polecat to have caught in a gin is that same baby that we saw ellen lee nursing on the doorstep in the rain when our poor mary came upon her on one wild night in exeter baseborn workhousebred tossed from workhouse to prison from prison to hulkevery mans hand against himan arab of society as hopeless a case my lord judge as you ever had to deal with and yet i think my lord that your big heart grows a little pitiful when you see that handsome face before you blank and careless and you try fruitlessly to raise some blush of shame or even anger in it by your eloquence gone beyond that my lord your thunderbolts fall harmless here and the man you say is lost and naturally yet give that same man room to breathe and act keep temptation from him and let his good qualities should he have any have fair play and even yet he may convert you to the belief that hardened criminals may be reformed to the extent of one in a dozen beyond that no reasonable man will go let us see the end of this man for now the end of my tale draws near and i must begin gathering up the threads of the story to tie them in a knot and release my readers from duty here is all i can gather about him sam and the doctor moved heaven earth and the colonial secretary to get his sentence commuted and with success so when his companions were led out to execution he was held back reserved for penal servitude for life he proved himself quiet and docile so much so that when our greatest boldest explorer was starting for his last hopeless journey to the interior this man was selected as one of the twelve convicts who were to accompany him what follows is an extract which i have been favoured with from his private journal you will not find it in the published history of the expedition datelatlongmorning it is getting hopeless now and tomorrow i turn sand and nothing but sand the salsolaceous plants so long the only vegetation we have seen are gone and the little sienite peak the last symptom of a waterbearing country has disappeared behind us the sandhills still roll away towards the setting sun but get less and less elevated the wild fowl are still holding their mysterious flight to the northwest but i have not wings to follow them oh my god if i only knew what those silly birds know it is hopeless to go on and i begin to fear hopeless to go back will it never rain again afternoonmy servant hawker one of the convicts assigned to me by government died today at noon i had got fond of this man as the most patient and the bravest where all have been so patient and so brave he was a very silent and reserved man and had never complained so that i was deeply shocked on his sending for me at dinnertime to find that he was dying he asked me not to deceive him but to tell him if there was any truth in what the gaolchaplain had said about there being another life after death i told him earnestly that i knew it as surely as i knew that the earth was under my feet and went on comforting him as one comforts a dying man but he never spoke again and we buried him in the hot sand at sundown the first wind will obliterate the little mound we raised over him and none will ever cross this hideous desert again so that he will have as quiet a grave as he could wish eleven oclock at nightgod be praised heavy clouds and thunder to the north so this poor workhousebred lad lies out among the sands of the middle desert chapter xliii across the snow hawker the elder as i said casting one glance at the body of his son whom he knew not and another at captain desborough who was just rising from the ground after his fall set spurs to his noble chestnut horse and pushing through the contracted barriers of slate which closed up the southern end of the amphitheatre where they had been surprised made for the broader and rapidly rising valley which stretched beyond he soon reached the rocky gate where the vast ridge of schist alternating with the limestone and running north and south in high serrated ridges was cut through by a deep fissure formed by the never idle waters of a little creek that in the course of ages had mined away the softer portions of the slate and made a practicable pass toward the mountains he picked his way with difficulty through the tumbled boulders that lay in the chasm and then there was a cool brisk wind on his forehead and a glare in his eyes the chill breath of the west wind from the mountainthe glare of the snow that filled up the upper end of the valley rising in level ridges towards the skyline he had been this path before and if he had gone it a hundred times again he would only have cursed it for a rough desperate road the only hope of a desperate man not for him to notice the thousand lessons that the lord had spread before him in the wilderness not for him to notice how the vegetation changed when the limestone was passed and the white quartz reefs began to seam the slaty sides of the valley like rivers of silver not for him to see how as he went up and on the hardy dicksoniae still nestled in stunted tufts among the more sheltered side gullies long after her tenderer sister the queenly alsophylla had been left behind he only knew that he was a hunted wild beast and that his lair was beyond the snow the creek flashed pleasantly among the broken slate full and turbid under the midday sun after midnight when its fountains are sealed again by the frosty breath of night that creek will be reduced to a trickling rill his horses feet brushed through the delicate asplenium the venushair of australia the sarsaparilla still hung in scant purple tufts on the golden wattle and the scarlet correa lurked among the broken quartz upwards and onwards in front endless cycles agone a lava stream from some crater we know not had burst over the slate with fearful clang and fierce explosion forming a broad roadway of broken basalt up to a plateau twelve hundred feet or more above us and not so steep but that a horse might be led up it let us go up with him not cursing heaven and earth as he did but noticing how as we ascend the scarlet wreaths of the kennedia and the crimson grevillea give place to the golden grevillea and the red epacris then comes the white epacris and then the grass trees getting smaller and scantier as we go till the little blue gentian blossoming boldly among the slippery crags tells us that we have nearly reached the limits of vegetation he turned when he reached this spot and looked around him to the west a broad rolling down of snow rising gradually to the east a noble prospect of forest and plain hill and gully with old snowy winding on in broad bright curves towards the sea he looked over all the beauty and undeveloped wealth of gipps land which shall yet please god in fulness of time be one of the brightest jewels in the king of englands crown but with eyes that saw not he turned towards the snow and mounting his horse which he had led up the cliff held steadily westward his plans were well laid across the mountain north of lake omeo not far from the mighty cleft in which the infant murray spends his youth were two huts erected years before by some settler and abandoned they had been used by a gang of bushrangers who had been attacked by the police and dispersed nevertheless they had been since inhabited by the men we know of who landed in the boat from van diemens land in consequence of hawker himself having found a pass through the ranges open for nine months in the year so that when the police were searching gipps land for these men they with the exception of two or three were snugly ensconced on the other watershed waiting till the storm should blow over in these huts hawker intended to lie by for a short time living on such provisions as were left until he could make his way northward on the outskirts of the settlements and escape there was no pursuit he thought how could there be who knew of this route but himself and his mates hardly likely any of them would betray him no creature was moving in the valley he had just ascended but the sun was beginning to slope towards the west and he must onwards onwards across the slippery snow at first a few treestems blighted and withered were visible right and left proving that at some time during their existence these bald downs had either a less elevation or a warmer climate than now then these even disappeared and all around was one white blinding glare to the right the snowfields rolled up into the shapeless lofty mass called mount tambo behind which the hill they now call kosciuskoas some say the highest ground in the countrybegan to take a crimson tint from the declining sun far to the south black and gaunt among the whitened hills towered the rounded hump of buffaloe while the peaks of buller and aberdeen showed like dim blue clouds on the furthest horizon snow and nothing but snow sometimes plunging shoulder deep into some treacherous hollow sometimes guiding the tired horse across the surface frozen over unknown depths he had been drinking hard for some days and now the excitement of action had gone off was fearfully nervous the snowglint had dizzied his head too and he began to see strange shapes forming themselves in the shade of each hollow and start at each stumble of his horse a swiftflying shadow upon the snow and a rush of wings overhead an eagle the lordly scavenger is following him impatient for him to drop and become a prey soar up old bird and bide thy time on yonder precipice thou shalt have good chance of a meal twilight and then night and yet the snow but half past there is a rock in a hollow where grow a few scanty tufts of grass which the poor horse may eat here he will camp fireless foodless and walk up and down the livelong night for sleep might be death though he is not in thoroughly alpine regions yet still at this time of the year the snow is deep and the frost is keen it were as well to keep awake as he paced up and down beneath the sheltering rock when night had closed in and the frosty stars were twinkling in the cold blue firmament strange ghosts and fancies came crowding on him thick and fast down the long vista of a misspent ruined life he saw people long since forgotten trooping up towards him his father tottered sternly on as with a fixed purpose before him his gipsymother madge strode forward pitiless and poor ruined ellen holding her child to her heart joined the others and held up her withered hand as if in mockery but then there came a face between him and all the other figures which his distempered brain had summoned and blotted them out the face of a young man bearing a strange likeness to himself the face of the last human creature he had seen the face of the boy that he had shot down among the fern why should this face grow before him wherever he turned so that he could not look on rock or sky without seeing it why should it glare at him through a bloodred haze when he shut his eyes to keep it out not in sorrow not in anger but even as he had seen it last expressing only terror and pain as the lad rolled off his horse and lay a black heap among the flowers up and away anything is better than this let us stumble away across the snow through the mirk night once more rather than be driven mad by this pale boys face morning and the pale ghosts have departed long shadows of horse and man are thrown before him now as the slope dips away to the westward and he knows that his journey is wellnigh over it was late afternoon before having left the snow some hours he began to lead his horse down a wooded precipice through vegetation which grew more luxuriant every yard he descended the glen whose bottom he was trying to reach was a black profound gulf with perpendicular or rather overhanging walls on every side save where he was scrambling down here indeed it was possible for a horse to keep his footing among the belts of trees that alternating with precipitous granite cliff formed the upper end of one of the most tremendous glens in the worldthe gates of the murray he was barely onethird of the way down this mountain wall when the poor tired horse lost his footing and fell over the edge touching neither tree nor stone for five hundred feet while george hawker was left terrified hardly daring to peer into the dim abyss where the poor beast was gone but it was little matter the hut he was making for was barely four miles off now and there was meat drink and safety perhaps there might be company he hoped there mightsome of the gang might have escaped a dog would be some sort of friend anything sooner than such another night as last night his pistols were gone with the saddle and he was unarmed he reached the base of the cliff in safety and forced his way through the tangled scrub that fringed the infant river towards the lower end of the pass here the granite walls overhanging bend forward above to meet one another almost forming an arch the height of which from the riverbed is computed to be nearly if not quite three thousand feet through this awful gate he forced his way overawed and utterly dispirited and reached the gully where his refuge lay just as the sun was setting there was a slight track partly formed by stray cattle which led up it and casting his eyes upon this he saw the marks of a horses feet some one of the gang got home before me he said im right glad of that anything better than such another night he turned a sharp angle in the path just where it ran round an abrupt cliff he saw a horseman within ten yards of him with his face towards him captain desborough holding a pistol at his head surrender george hawker said desborough or by the living lord you are a dead man hungry cold desperate unarmed he saw that he was undone and that hope was dead the captain had an easier prey than he had anticipated hawker threw up his arms and ere he could fully appreciate his situation he was chained fast to desboroughs saddle only to be loosed he knew by the gallows without a word on either side they began their terrible journey desborough riding and hawker manacled by his right wrist to the saddle fully a mile was passed before the latter asked sullenly where are you going to take me tonight to dickensons replied desborough you must step out you know it will be for your own good for i must get there tonight two or three miles further were got over when hawker said abruptly look here captain i want to talk to you you had better not said desborough i dont want to have any communication with you and every word you say will go against you bah said hawker i must swing i know that i shant make any defence why the devils out of hell would come into court against me if i did but i want to ask you a question or two you havent got the character of being a brutal fellow like o it cant hurt you to answer me one or two things and ease my mind a bit god help you unhappy man said desborough i will answer any questions you ask well then see here said hawker hesitating i want to knowi want to know first how you got round before me is that all said desborough well i came round over broadsaddle and got a fresh horse at the parsons ah said hawker that young fellow i shot down when you were after me is he dead by this time said desborough he was just dying when i came away would you mind stopping for a moment captain now tell me who was he mr charles hawker son of mrs hawker of toonarbin he gave such a yell that desborough shrunk from him appalleda cry as of a wounded tigerand struggled so wildly with his handcuffs that the blood poured from his wrists let us close this scene desborough told me afterwards that that wild fierce despairing cry rang in his ears for many years afterwards and would never be forgotten till those ears were closed with the dust of the grave chapter xliv how mary hawker heard the news troubridges station toonarbin lay so far back from the river and so entirely on the road to nowhere that tom used to remark that he would back it for being the worst station for news in the country so it happened that while these terrible scenes were enacting within ten miles of them down in fact to about one oclock in the day when the bushrangers were overtaken and punished mary and her cousin sat totally unconscious of what was going on but about eleven oclock that day burnside the cattle dealer mentioned once before in these pages arrived at major buckleys from somewhere up country and found the house apparently deserted but having coeed for some time a door opened in one of the huts and a sleepy groom came forth yawning where are they all asked burnside mrs buckley and the women were down at mrs mayfords streaking the bodies out he believed the rest were gone away after the gang this was the first that burnside had heard about the matter and now bit by bit he extracted everything from the sleepy groom i got him afterwards to confess to me that when he heard of this terrible affair his natural feeling of horror was considerably alloyed with pleasure he saw here at one glance a fund of small talk for six months he saw himself a welcome visitor at every station even up to furthest lonely condamine retailing the news of these occurrences with all the authenticity of an eye witness improving his narrative by each repetition here was the basis of a new tale ode epic saga or what you may please to call it which he burnside the bard should sing at each fireside throughout the land and how are mrs and miss mayford poor souls he asked theyre as well answered the groom as youd expect folks to be after such a mishap they ran out at the back way and down the garden towards the river before the chaps could burst the door down i am sorry for that little chap cecil i am by jove a straightforward manly little chap as ever crossed a horse last week he says to me says he benjy my boy says he come and be groom to me ill give you thirty pound ayear and i says if mr sam hallo there they are at it hammer and tongs sharp work that they both listened intensely they could hear borne on the west wind a distant dropping fire and a shouting the grooms eye began to kindle a bit but burnside sitting yet upon his horse grasped the lads shoulder and cried god save us suppose our men should be beaten suppose said the groom contemptuously shaking him off why then you and i should get our throats cut at this moment the noise of the distant fight breezed up louder than ever theyre beat back said burnside i shall be off to toonarbin and give them warning i advise you to save yourself i was set to mind these here things said benjy and im agoing to mind em and they as meddles with em had better look out burnside started off for toonarbin and when halfway there he paused and listened the firing had ceased when he came to reflect now that his panic was over he had very little doubt that desboroughs party had gained the day it was impossible he thought that it could be otherwise nevertheless being halfway to toonarbin he determined to ride on and having called in a moment to follow a road which took a way past lees old hut towards the scene of action he very soon pulled up at the door and tom troubridge came slowly out to meet him hallo burnside said tom get off and come in not i indeed i am going off to see the fight what fight said mary hawker looking over toms shoulder do you mean to say you have not heard the news not a word of any news for a fortnight for once in his life burnside was laconic and told them all that had happened tom spoke not a word but ran up to the stable and had a horse out saddled in a minute he was dashing into the house again for his hat and pistols when he came against mary in the passage leaning against the wall tom she whispered hoarsely bring that boy back to me safe or never look me in the face again he never answered her he was thinking of some one beside the boy he pushed past her and the next moment she saw him gallop away with burnside followed by two men and now she was left alone indeed and helpless there was not a soul about the place but herself not a soul within ten miles she stood looking out of the door fixedly at nothing for a time but then as hour by hour went on and the afternoon stillness fell upon the forest and the shadows began to slant a terror began to grow upon her which at length became unbearable and wellnigh drove her mad at the first she understood that all these years of anxiety had come to a point at last and a strange feeling of excitement almost joy came over her she was one of those impetuous characters who stand suspense worse than anything and now although terror was in her she felt as though relief was nigh then she began to think again of her son but only for an instant he was under major buckleys care and must be safe so she dismissed that fear from her mind for a time but only for a time it came back to her again why did he not come to her why had not the major sent him off to her at once could the major have been killed even if so there was doctor mulhaus her terrors were absurd but not the less terrors that grew in strength hour by hour as she waited there looking at the pleasant spring forest and no one came terrors that grew at last so strong that they took the place of certainties some hitch must have taken place and her boy must be gone out with the rest having got as far as this to go further was no difficulty he was killed she felt sure of it and none had courage to come and tell her of it she suddenly determined to verify her thoughts at once and went in doors to get her hat she had fully made up her mind that he must be killed at this time the hope of his having escaped was gone we who know the real state of the case should tremble for her reason when she finds her fears so terribly true we shall see she determined to start away to the brentwoods and end her present state of terror one way or another tom had taken the only horse in the stable but her own brown pony was running in the paddock with some others and she sallied forth worn out feverish halfmad to try to catch him the obstinate brute wouldnt be caught then she spent a weary hour trying to drive them all into the stockyard but in vain three times she with infinite labour drove them up to the sliprack and each time the same mare and foal broke away leading off the others the third time when she saw them all run whinnying down to the further end of the paddock after half an hour or so of weary work driving them up when she had run herself off her poor tottering legs and saw that all her toil was in vain then she sank down on the cold hard gravel in the yard with her long black hair streaming loose along the ground and prayed that she might die down at full length in front of her own door like a dead woman moaning and crying from time to time oh my boy my boy how long she lay there she knew not she heard a horses feet but only stopped her ears from the news she thought was coming then she heard a steady heavy footstep close to her and some one touched her and tried to raise her she sat up shook the hair from her eyes and looked at the man who stood beside her at first she thought it was a phantom of her own brain but then looking wildly at the calm solemn features and the kindly grey eyes which were gazing at her so inquiringly she pronounced his namefrank maberly god save you madam he said what is the matter misery wrath madness despair she cried wildly raising her hand the retribution of a lifetime fallen on my luckless head in one unhappy moment frank maberly looked at her in real pity but a thought went through his head what a magnificent actress this woman would make it merely past through his brain and was gone and then he felt ashamed of himself for entertaining it a moment and yet it was not altogether an unnatural one for him who knew her character so well she was lying on the ground in an attitude which would have driven siddons to despair one white arm down which her sleeve had fallen pressed against her forehead while the other clutched the ground and her splendid black hair fallen down across her shoulders yet how could he say how much of all this wild despair was real and how much hysterical but what is the matter mary hawker he asked tell me or how can i help you matter she said listen the bushrangers are come down from the mountains spreading ruin murder and destruction far and wide my husband is captain of the gang and my son my only son whom i have loved better than my god is gone with the rest to hunt them downto seek unknowing his own fathers life there is mischief beyond your mending priest beyond his mending indeed he saw it rise up he said and act tell me all the circumstances is it too late she told him how it had come to pass and then he showed her that all her terrors were but anticipations and might be false he got her pony for her and as night was falling rode away with her along the mountain road that led to captain brentwoods the sun was down and ere they had gone far the moon was bright overhead frank having fully persuaded himself that all her terrors were the effect of an overwrought imagination grew cheerful and tried to laugh her out of them she too with the exercise of riding through the nightair and the company of a handsome agreeable wellbred man began to have a lurking idea that she had been making a fool of herself when they came suddenly on a hut dark cheerless deserted standing above a black stagnant reedgrown waterhole the hut where frank had gone to preach to the stockmen the hut where lee had been murderedan illomened place and as they came opposite to it they saw two others approaching them in the moonlightmajor buckley and alice brentwood then alice pushing forward bravely met her and told her allall from beginning to end and when she had finished having borne up nobly fell to weeping as though her heart would break but mary did not weep or cry or fall down she only said let me see him and went on with them silent and steady they got to garoopna late at night none having spoken all the way then they showed her into the room where poor charles lay cold and stiff and there she stayed hour after hour through the weary night alice looked in once or twice and saw her sitting on the bed which bore the corpse of her son with her face buried in her hands and at last summoning courage took her by the arm and led her gently to bed then she went into the drawingroom where besides her father were major buckley doctor mulhaus frank maberly and the drunken doctor before spoken of who had had the sublime pleasure of cutting a bullet from his old adversarys arm and was now in a fair way to justify the sobriquet i have so often applied to him i myself also was sitting next the fire alongside of frank maberly my brave girl said the major how is she i hardly can tell you sir said alice she is so very quiet if she would cry now i should be very glad it would not frighten me so much as seeing her like that i fear she will die if her reason holds said the doctor she will get over it she had from all accounts gone through every phase of passion down to utter despair before she knew the blow had fallen poor mary there we have done all this misery has come on her from one act of folly and selfishness years ago how many lives are ruined how many families broken up by one false step if ever a poor soul has expiated her own offence she has let us hope that brighter times are in store for her let us have done with moral reflections i am no hand at that work one more dark scene reader and then it was one wild dreary day in the spring a day of furious wind and cutting rain a day when few passengers were abroad and when the boatmen were gathered in knots among the sheltered spots upon the quays waiting to hear of disasters at sea when the ships creaked and groaned at the wharfs and the harbour was a sheet of winddriven foam and the domain was strewed with broken boughs on such a day as this major buckley and myself after a sharp walk found ourselves in front of the principal gaol in sydney we were admitted for we had orders and a small wiry cleverlooking man about fifty bowed to us as we entered the whitewashed corridor which led from the entrance hall we had a few words with him and then followed him to the darkest passage in the darkest end of that dreary place to the condemned cells and my heart sank as the heavy bolt shot back and we went into the first one on the right before us was a kind of bedplace and on that bedplace lay the figure of a man though it is twenty years ago since i saw it i can remember that scene as though it were yesterday he lay upon a heap of tumbled blankets with his face buried in a pillow one leg touched the ground and round it was a ring connecting the limb to a long iron bar which ran along beneath the bed one arm also hung listlessly on the cold stone floor and the other was thrown around his head a head covered with short black curls worthy of an antinous above a bare muscular neck worthy of a farnese hercules i advanced towards him the governor held me back my god sir he said take care dont as you value your life go within length of his chain but at that moment the handsome head was raised from the pillow and my eyes met george hawkers oh lord such a piteous wild look i could not see the fierce desperate villain who had kept our countryside in terror so long no thank god i could only see the handsome curlyheaded boy who used to play with james stockbridge and myself among the gravestones in drumston churchyard i saw again the merry lad who used to bathe with us in hatherleigh water and whom with all his faults i had once loved well and seeing him and him only before me in spite of a terrified gesture from the governor i walked up to the bed and sitting down beside him put my arm round his neck george george dear old friend i said o george my boy has it come to this i dont want to be instructed in my duty i know what my duty was on that occasion as well as any man my duty as a citizen and a magistrate was to stand at the further end of the cell and give this hardened criminal a moral lecture showing how honesty and virtue as in my case had led to wealth and honour and how yielding to ones passions led to disgrace and infamy as in his that was my duty i allow but then you see i didnt do my duty i had a certain tender feeling about my stomach which prevented me from doing it so i only hung there with my arm round his neck and said from time to time o george george like a fool he put his two hands upon my shoulders so that his fetters hung across my breast and he looked me in the face then he said after a time what hamlyn old jeff hamlyn the only man i ever knew that i didnt quarrel with come to see me now eh jeff old boy im to be hung tomorrow i know it i said and i came to ask you if i could do anything for you for the sake of dear old devon george anything you like old jeff he said with a laugh so long as you dont get me reprieved if i get loose again lad id do worse than i ever did yet believe me ive piled up a tolerable heap of wickedness as it is though ive murdered my own son jeff do you know that i answeredyes i know that george but that was an accident you did not know who he was he came at me to take my life said hawker and i tell you as a man who goes out to be hung tomorrow that if i had guessed who he was id have blown my own brains out to save him from the crime of killing me who is that man dont you remember him i said major buckley the major came forward and held out his hand to george hawker you are now he said like a dead man to me you die tomorrow and you know it and face it like a man i come to ask you to forgive me anything you may have to forgive i have been your enemy since i first saw you but i have been an honest and open enemy and now i am your enemy no longer i ask you to shake hands with me i have been warned not to come within arms length of you chained as you are but i am not afraid of you the major came and sat on the bedplace beside him as for that little animal said george hawker pointing to the governor as he stood at the further end of the cell if he comes within reach of me ill beat his useless little brains out against the wall and he knows it he was right to caution you not to come too near me i nearly killed a man yesterday and tomorrow when they come to lead me outbut with regard to you major buckley the case is different do you know i should be rather sorry to tackle you im afraid you would be too heavy for me as to my having anything to forgive major i dont know that there is anything if there is let me tell you that i feel more kind and hearty towards you and hamlyn for coming to me like this today than ive felt towards any man this twenty year bythebye let no man go to the gallows without clearing himself as far as he may do you know that i set on that redhaired villain moody to throttle bill lee because i hadnt pluck to do it myself poor lee said the major poor devil said hawker why that man had gone through every sort of villany from so and so up to so and so he said i shall not particularize before my beard was grown why that man laid such plots and snares for me when i was a lad that a bishop could not have escaped he egged me on to forge my own fathers name he drove me on to ruin and now because it suited his purpose to turn honest and act faithful domestic to my wife for twenty years he is mourned for as an exemplary character and i go to the gallows he was a meaner villain than ever i was george i asked have you any message for your wife only this he said tell her i always liked her pretty face and im sorry i brought disgrace upon her through all my rascalities old jeff i swear to you that i respected and liked her to the last i tried to see her last year only to tell her that she neednt be afraid of me and should treat me as a dead man but she and her blessed pigheaded lover tom troubridge made such knife and pistol work of it that i never got the chance of saying the word i wanted shed have saved herself much trouble if she hadnt acted so much like a frightened fool i never meant her any harm you may tell her all this if you judge right but i leave it to you times up i see i aint so much of a coward am i jeff goodbye old lad goodbye that was the last we saw of him the next morning he was executed with four of his comrades but now the major and i leaving him went out again into the street into the rain and the furious wind to beat up against it for our hotel neither spoke a word till we came to a corner in george street nearest the wharf and there the major turned back upon me suddenly and i thought he had been unable to face the terrible gust which came sweeping up from the harbour but it was not so he had turned on purpose and putting his hands upon my shoulders he said hamlyn hamlyn you have taught me a lesson i suppose so i said i have shown you what a fool a tenderhearted softheaded fellow may make of himself by yielding to his impulses but i have a defence to offer my dear sir the best of excuses the only real excuse existing in this world i couldnt help it i dont mean that hamlyn he answered the lesson you have taught me is a very different one you have taught me that there are bright points in the worst mans character a train of good feeling which no tact can bring out but yet which some human spark of feeling may light here is this man hawker of whom we heard that he was dangerous to approach and whom the good chaplain was forced to pray for and exhort from a safe distance the man for whose death till ten minutes ago i was rejoicing the man i thought lost and beyond hope yet you by one burst of unpremeditated folly by one piece of silly sentimentality by ignoring the mans later life and carrying him back in imagination to his old schoolboy days have done more than our good old friend the chaplain could have done without your assistance there is a spark of the divine in the worst of men if you can only find it in spite of the majors parliamentary and didactic way of speaking i saw there was truth at the bottom of what he said and that he meant kindly to me and to the poor fellow who was even now among the dead so instead of arguing with him i took his arm and we fought homewards together through the driving rain imagine three months to have passed that stormy spring had changed into a placid burning summer the busy shearingtime was past the noisy shearers were dispersed heaven knows where most of them probably suffering from a shortness of cash complicated with delirium tremens the grass in the plains had changed from green to dull grey the river had changed his hoarse roar for a sleepy murmur as though too lazy to quarrel with his boulders in such weather a hot dull haze was over forest and mountain the snow had perspired till it showed long black streaks on the highest eminences in short summer had come with a vengeance every one felt hot idle and thirsty and there was nothing doing now that broad cool verandah of captain brentwoods with its deep recesses of shadow was a place not to be lightly spoken of any man once getting footing there and leaving it except on compulsion would show himself of weak mind any man once comfortably settled there in an easy chair who fetched anything for himself when he could get any one else to fetch it for him would show himself in my opinion a man of weak mind one thing only was wanted to make it perfect and that was niggers to the winds with uncle toms cabin and dred after it in a hot wind what can an activeminded selfhelpful lady like mrs stowe freezing up there in connecticut obliged to do something to keep herself warmwhat can she i ask know about the requirements of a southern gentleman when the thermometer stands at degrees in the shade pish does she know the exertion required for cutting up a pipe of tobacco in a hot north wind no does she know the amount of perspiration and anger superinduced by knocking the head off a bottle of bass in january does she know the physical prostration which is caused by breaking up two lumps of hard white sugar in a pawnee before a thunderstorm no she doesnt or she would cry out for niggers with the best of us when the thermometer gets over degrees in the shade all men would have slaves if they were allowed an anglosaxon conscience will not save in rare instances bear a higher average heat than degrees but about this verandah it was the model and type of all verandahs it was made originally by the irish family the donovans before spoken of and like all irishmade things was nobly conceived beautifully carried out and then left to take care of itself so that when alice came into possession she found it a neglected mine of rare creepers run wild here for the first time i saw the exquisite crimson passionflower then a great rarity here too the native passionflower scarlet and orange was tangled up with the common purple sarsaparilla and the english honeysuckle and jessamine in this verandah one blazing morning sat mrs buckley and alice making believe to work mrs buckley really was doing something alice sat with her hands fallen on her lap so still and so beautiful that she might then and there have been photographed off by some enterprising artist and exhibited in the printshops as argia goddess of laziness they were not alone however across the very coolest darkest corner was swung a hammock looking at which you might perceive two hands elevating a green papercovered book as though the owner were readingthe aforesaid owner however being entirely invisible only proving his existence by certain bulges and angles in the canvas of the hammock now having made a nice little mystery as to who it was lying there i will proceed to solve it a burst of laughter came from the hidden man so uproarious and violent that the hammockstrings strained and shook and the magpie waking up from a sound sleep cursed and swore in a manner fearful to hear my dearest jim said alice rousing herself what is the matter with you jim read aloud the immortal battle of the two editors with their carpet bags in pickwick and ere he had half done alice and mrs buckley had mingled their laughter with his quite as heartily if not so loudly hallo said jim heres a nuisance theres no more of it alice have you got any more that is all jim the other numbers will come by the next mail how tiresome i suppose the governor is pretty sure to be home tonight he cant be away much longer dont be impatient my dear said alice how is your leg please to remember that jims leg was broken in the late wars and as yet hardly well oh its a good deal better heigho this is very dull thank you james said mrs buckley dear me the heat gets greater every day if they are on the road i hope they wont hurry themselves our old friends were just now disposed in the following manner the major was at home mary hawker was staying with him doctor mulhaus and halbert staying at major brentwoods while captain brentwood was away with sam and tom troubridge to sydney and having been absent some weeks had been expected home now for a day or two this was the day they came home riding slowly up to the porch about five oclock when all greetings were done and they were sat down beside the others jim opened the ball by asking what news father what a particularly foolish question said the captain why youll get it all in timenone the quicker for being impatient may be also when you hear some of the news you wont like it oh indeed said jim i have a letter for you here from the commanderinchief you are appointed to the th regiment at present quartered in india alice looked at him quickly as she heard this and as a natural consequence sam looked too they had expected that he would have hurrad aloud or thrown up his hat or danced about when he heard of it but no he only sat bolt upright in his hammock though his face flushed scarlet and his eyes glistened strangely his father looked at him an instant and then continued six months leave of absence procured at the same time which will give you about three months more at home so you see you now possess the inestimable privilege of wearing a red coat and what is still better of getting a hole made in it for there is great trouble threatening with the affghans and beloochs and the chances are that you will smell powder before you are up in your regimental duties under which circumstances i shall take the liberty of requesting that you inform yourself on these points under my direction for i dont want you to join your regiment in the position of any other booby have the goodness to lie down again and not excite yourself you have anticipated this some time surely it is not necessary for you to cry about it like a great girl but that night after dark when sam and alice were taking one of those agreeable nocturnal walks which all young lovers are prone to they came smoothly gliding over the lawn close up to the house and then unseen and unheard they saw captain brentwood with his arm round jims neck and heard him say o james james why did you want to leave me and jim answered father i didnt know i didnt know my own mind but i cant call back now sam and alice slipt back again and continued their walk let us hear what conversation they had been holding together before this little interruption alice my darling my love you are more beautiful than ever thanks to your absence my dear sam you see how well i thrive without you then when we are well said alice for this was eight oclock in the evening you know and the moon being four days past the full it was pitch dark well says she when we are married says sam audaciously i suppose you will pine away to nothing good gracious me she answered married why surely we are well enough as we are most excellently well my darling said sam i wish it could last for ever oh indeed said alice almost inaudibly though alice my love said sam have you thought of one thing have you thought that i must make a start in life for myself no she hadnt thought of that didnt see why baroona wasnt good enough for him my dear he said baroona is a fine property but it is not mine i want money for a set purpose for a glorious purpose my love i will not tell you yet not for years perhaps what that purpose is but i want fifty thousand pounds of my own and fifty thousand pounds i will have good gracious what an avaricious creature such a quantity of money and so she wasnt to hear what he was going to do with it for ever so many years wouldnt he tell her now she would so like to know would nothing induce him yes there was something nay what harm only an honest lovers kiss among the ripening grapes in the dark you say my dear madam you would not have them kiss one another in broad day with the cook watching them out of the kitchen window alice he said i have had one object before me from my boyhood and since you told me that i was to be your husband that object has grown from a vague intention to a fixed purpose alice i want to buy back the acres of my forefathers i wish i intend that another buckley shall be the master of clere and that you shall be his wife sam my love she said turning on him suddenly what a magnificent idea is it possible easy said sam my father could do it but will not he and my mother have severed every tie with the old country and it would be at their time of life only painful to go back to the old scenes and interests but with me it is different think of you and i taking the place we are entitled to by birth and education in the splendid society of that noble island dont let me hear all that balderdash about the founding of new empires empires take too long in growing for me what honours what society has this little colony to give compared to those open to a fourthrate gentleman in england i want to be a real englishman not half a one i want to throw in my lot heart and hand with the greatest nation in the world i dont want to be young sam buckley of baroona i want to be the buckley of clere is not that a noble ambition my whole soul goes with you sam said alice my whole heart and soul let us consult and see how this is to be done this is the way the thing stands said sam the house and park at clere were sold by my father for l to a brewer since then this brewer a most excellent fellow by all accounts has bought back acre by acre nearly half the old original property as it existed in my great grandfathers time so that now clere must be worth fifty thousand pounds at least this mans children are all dead and as far as captain brentwood has been able to find out for me no one knows exactly how the property is going the present owner is the same age as my father and at his death should an advantageous offer be made there would be a good chance of getting the heirs to sell the property we should have to pay very highly for it but consider what a position we should buy with it the county would receive us with open arms that is all i know at present a noble idea said alice and well considered now what are you going to do have you heard tell yet said sam of the new country to the north they call the darling downs i have heard of it from burnside the cattle dealer he describes it as a paradise of wealth he is right when you get through the cypress the plains are endless it is undoubtedly the finest piece of country found yet now do you know tom troubridge slightly enough said alice laughing well said sam you know he went to sydney with us and before he had been three days there he came to me full of this darling down country quite mad about it in fact and in the end he said sam what money have you got i said that my father had promised me seven thousand pounds for a certain purpose and that i had come to town partly to look for an investment he said be my partner and i said what for darling downs he said and i said i was only too highly honoured by such a mark of confidence from such a man and that i closed with his offer at once to make a long matter short he is off to the new country to take up ground under the name of troubridge and buckley there but oughtnt you to have gone up with him sam i proposed to do so as a matter of course said sam but what do you think he said i dont know he gave me a great slap on the back said sam and said he go home my old lad marry your wife and fetch her up to keep house thats what he said and now my own love my darling will you tell me am i to go up alone and wait for you or will you come up and make a happy home for me in that dreary desert will you leave your home and come away with me into the grey hot plains of the west i have no home in future sam she said but where you are and i will gladly go with you to the worlds end and so that matter was settled and now sam disclosed to her that a visitor was expected at the station in about a fortnight or three weeks and he was no less a person than our old friend the dean frank maberly and then he went to ask did she think that she could manage by that time to eh such an excellent opportunity you know seemed almost as if his visit had been arranged which between you and i it had she thought it wildly possible if there was any real necessity for it and after this they went in and alice went into her bedroom and what have you been doing out there with alice all this time eh asked the captain ive been asking a question sir you must have put it in a pretty long form what sort of an answer did you get i got yes for an answer sir ah well mrs buckley can you lend baroona to a new married couple for a few weeks do you think there is plenty of room for you here and then into mrs buckleys astonished ear all the new plans were poured she heard that sam and alice were to be married in a fortnight and that sam had gone into partnership with tom troubridge stop there she said not too much at once what becomes of mary hawker she is left at toonarbin with an overseer for the present and when she asked shall you leave us sam oh in a couple of months i suppose i must give tom time to get a house up before i go and join him what a convenient thing a partner like that is eh oh bythebye mrs buckley said captain brentwood what do you make of this letter he produced a broad thick letter directed in a bold running hand major buckley baroonah combermere county gippsland if absent to be left with the nearest magistrate and a receipt taken for it how very strange said mrs buckley turning it over where did you get it sergeant jackson asked me as nearest magistrate to take charge of it and so i did it has been forwarded by orderly from sydney and the governors private seal too said mrs buckley i dont know when my curiosity has been so painfully excited put it on the chimneypiece sam let us gaze on the outside even if we are denied to see the inside i wonder if your father will come tonight no getting too late said sam evidently halbert and the doctor have found themselves there during their ride and are keeping him and mrs hawker company they will all three be over tomorrow morning depend on it what a really good fellow that halbert is said captain brentwood one of the best companions i ever met i wish his spirits would improve with his health a sensitive fellow like him is apt not to recover from a blow like his what blow said mrs buckley did you never hear said the captain the girl he was going to be married to got drowned coming out to him in the assam chapter xlv in which there are some astonishing revelations with regard to dr mulhaus and captain desborough at ten oclock the next morning arrived the major the doctor and halbert and the first notice they had of it was the doctors voice in the passage evidently in a great state of excitement no more the common bowerbird than you sir a new species his eyes are red instead of blue and the whole plumage is lighter i will call it after you my dear major you have got to shoot him first said the major ill soon do that said the doctor bursting into the roomdoor how do you do all of you sam glad to see you back again brentwood you are welcome to your own house get me your gunwhere is it in my bedroom said the captain the doctor went off after it he reappeared again to complain that the caps would not fit but being satisfied on that score he disappeared down the garden on murderous thoughts intent sam got his father away into the verandah and told him all his plans i need hardly say that they met with the majors entire approval all his plans i said no not all sam never hinted at the end and object of all his endeavours he never said a word about his repurchase of clere the major had no more idea that sam had ever thought of such a thing or had been making inquiries than had the owner of clere himself sam my dear boy said he i am very sorry to lose you and we shall have but a dull time of it henceforth but i am sure it is good for a man to go out into the world by himself and all that sort of thing when you are gone brentwood and i mean to live together to console one another my dear are you coming in said mrs buckley here is a letter for you which i ought to have given you before the major went in and received the mysterious epistle which the captain had brought the night before when he saw it he whistled they sat waiting to know the contents he was provokingly long in opening it and when he did he said nothing but read it over twice with a lengthening visage now also it became apparent that there was another letter inside at the superscription of which the major having looked put it in his pocket and turning round to the mantelpiece with his back to the others began drumming against the fender with his foot musingly a more aggravating course of proceeding he could not have resorted to here they were all dying of curiosity and not a word did he seem inclined to answer at last mrs buckley not able to hold out any longer said from the governor was it not my love yes he said from the governor and very important too and then relapsed into silence matters were worse than ever but after a few minutes he turned round to them suddenly and said you have heard of baron landstein what said sam the man that the doctors always abusing so yes i know all about him of course the noble landstein said alice in spite of the doctors abuse he is a great favourite of mine how well he seems to have behaved at jena with those two landwehr regiments landsturm my love said the major yes landsturm i mean i wonder if he is still alive or whether he died of his wounds the doctor said sam always speaks of him as dead he is not only alive said the major but he is coming here he will be here today he may come any minute what the great landstein said sam the same man said the major the doctor will have a quarrel with him father he is always abusing him he says he lost the battle of jena or something be quiet sam and dont talk watch what follows the doctor was seen hurrying up the gardenwalk he put down his gun outside and bursting open the glass door stepped into the room holding aloft a black bird freshly killed and looking around him for applause there he said i told you so the major walked across the room and put a letter in his hand the one which was enclosed in the mysterious epistle before mentioned baron he said here is a letter for you the doctor looked round as one would who had received a blow and knew not who smote him he took the letter and went into the window to read it no one spoke a word this then my good old tutor thought sam turns out to be the great landstein save us what a piece of romance but though he thought this he never said anything and catching alices eye followed it to the window there leaning against the glass his face buried in his hands and his broad back shaking with emotion stood doctor mulhaus alas no our kindly good hearty learned irritable but dearlybeloved old friend is no more there never was such a man in reality but in his place stands baron von landstein of the niederwald what the contents of the doctors i must still call him so letter i cannot tell you but i have seen the letter which major buckley received enclosing it and i can give it you word for word it is from the governor himself and runs thus my dear major i am informed that the famous baron von landstein has been living in your house for some years under the name of dr mulhaus in fact i believe he is a partner of yours i therefore send the enclosed under cover to you and when i tell you that it has been forwarded to me through the foreign office and the colonial office and is in point of fact an autograph letter from the king of p to the baron i am sure that you will ensure its safe delivery the secretary is completely fixed with his estimates the salaries for the supreme court office are thrown out he must resign do next election send us a couple of moderates yours c gg this was the majors letter but the doctor stood still there moved more deeply than any had seen him before while alice and sam looked at one another in blank astonishment at length he turned and spoke but not to them to the empty air spoke as one aroused from a trance things hard to understand yet having some thread of sense in them too so he has sent for me he said when it seems that he may have some use for me so the old man is likely to go at last and we are to have the golden age again if talking could do it assuredly we should he has noble instincts this young fellow and some sense he has sent for me if h and b and von u and myself can but get his ear oh rhineland my own beloved rhineland shall i see you again shall i sit once more in my own grey castle among the vineyards above the broad gleaming river and hear the noises from the town come floating softly up the hillside i wonder are there any left who will remember he took two short turns through the room and then he turned and spoke to them again looking all the time at sam i am the baron von landstein the very man we have so often talked of and whose character we have so freely discussed when the french attacked us i threw myself into the foremost ranks of my countrymen and followed the queen with two regiments which i had raised almost entirely myself i fled away from the bloodred sun of jena wounded and desperate that sun i thought has set on the ruins of great fredericks kingdom prussia is a province of france what can happen worse than this i will crawl home to my castle and die i had no castle to crawl to my brother he who hung upon the same breast with me he who learnt his first prayer beside me he who i loved and trusted above all other men had turned traitor had sold himself to the french had deceived my bride that was to be and seized my castle i fled to england to drumston major i had some knowledge of physic and called myself a doctor i threw myself into the happy english domestic life which i found there and soon got around me men and women whom i loved full well old john thornton and his sister knew my secret as did lord crediton but they kept it well and by degrees i began to hope that i would begin a new life as a useful village apothecary and forget for ever the turmoils of politics then you know what happened there was an exodus all those i had got to love arose in the manner of their nation and went to the other end of the earth so that one night i was left alone on the cliff at plymouth watching a ship which was bearing away all that was left me to love in the world i went to prussia i found my brother had made good use of his prosperity and slandered me to the king his old treachery seemed forgotten and he was high in power the king for whom i had suffered so much received me coldly and leaving the palace i spoke to my brother and saidsend me so much yearly and keep the rest for a time and then i followed you major out here shall i tell you any more sam no said sam smiting his fist upon the table i can tell the rest baron to those who want to know it i can tell of ten years patient kindness towards myself i can telli can tell sam was the worst orator in the world he broke down sir he knew what he meant very well and so i hope do you reader but he couldnt say it he had done what many of us do tried to make a fine speech when his heart was full and so he failed but alice didnt failnot she though she never spoke a word she folded up her work and going up to the good old man took both his hands in hers and kissed him on both his cheeks a fine piece of rhetorical action wasnt it and then they all crowded round him and shook hands with him and kissed him and godblessed him for their kind true old friend and prayed that every blessing might light upon his noble head till he passed through them speechless and wandered away to his old friend the river about the middle of this week there arrived two of our former friends frank maberly and captain desborough riding side by side the elders with the doctor were outside and detained the dean talking to him and bidding him welcome but captain desborough passing in came into the room where were assembled alice sam and jim who gave him a most vociferous greeting they saw in a moment that there was some fun in the wind they knew by experience that when desboroughs eyes twinkled like that some absurdity was preparing though they were quite unprepared for the mixture of reality and nonsense which followed pace said desborough in his affected irish accent be on this house and all in it the top of the morning to ye all now said alice we are going to have some fun captain desborough has got his brogue on yell have some fun directly miss brentwood he said but theres some serious sober earnest to come first my cousin slievedonad is dead lord slievedonad the same that small viscount is at this moment in pur god forgive me and him too poor fellow thats just half my uncle lord covetown was taken with a fit when he heard of it and is gone after him and the lord forgive him too he turned me his own brothers son out into the world with half an education to sink or swim and never a kind word did he or his son ever give me in their lives it must have broken the old mans heart to think how the estate would go but as i said before god forgive him you must feel his loss captain desborough said alice i am very sorry for you ahem my dear young lady you dont seem to know how this ends why no said alice looking up wonderingly i do not why it ends in this said desborough that i myself am earl of covetown viscount slievedonad and baron avoca with twenty thousand a year me darlin the laste penny see to there now brogue again said alice are you joking true enough said desborough i had a letter from my grandmother the dowager she that lost the dog only this very day and theres a thousand pounds paid into the bank of new south wales to my account pretty good proof that last eh my dear lord said alice i congratulate you most heartily all the world are turning out to be noblemen i should not be surprised to find that i am a duchess myself it rests with you miss brentwood said desborough with a wicked glance at sam to be a countess i now formally make you an offer of me hand and heart oh tell me miss brentwood will ye be mrs marsi beg pardon countess of covetown no i thank you my lord said alice laughing and blushing i am afraid i must decline i was afraid ye would said lord covetown i had heard that a great sixfoot villain had been trifling with your affections so i came prepared for a refusal came prepared with this miss brentwood which i pray you to accept shall i be too bold if i say as a wedding present from one of your most sincere admirers he produced a jewel case and took from it a bracelet at the sight of which alice gave an honest womanly cry of delight and well she might for the bauble cost l it was a bracelet of gold representing a snake halfway up the reptiles back began a row of sapphires getting larger towards the neck each of which was surrounded by small emeralds the back of the head contained a noble brilliant and the eyes were two rubies altogether a thorough specimen of irish extravagance and good taste can you clasp it on for her sam said lord covetown oh my lord i ought not to accept such a princely present said alice look here miss brentwood said covetown laying his hand on sams shoulder i find that the noblest and best fellow i know is going to marry the handsomest woman saving your presence that i ever saw i myself have just come into an earldom and twenty thousand ayear and if under these circumstances i maynt make that woman a handsome present why then the deuce is in it you know sam my boy your hand jim your hand my lad may you be as good a soldier as your father ah said jim so youre an earl are you what does it feel like eh do you feel the blue blood of a hundred sires coursing in your veins do you feel the hereditary class prejudices of the norman aristocracy cutting you off from the sympathies of the inferior classes and raising you above the hopes and fears of the masses how very comical it must be so you are going to sit among the bigwigs in the house of lords i hope you wont forget yourself and cry faug a ballagh when one of the bishops rises to speak and whatever you do dont sing gama cremah cruiskeen in the lobby my dear fellow said he i am not in the house of lords at all only an irish peer i intend to get into the commons though and produce a sensation by introducing the australian coee into the seat of british legislature how long these four would have gone on talking unutterable nonsense no man can say but frank maberly coming in greeted them courteously and changed the conversation poor frank hard and incessant work was beginning to tell on that noble frame and the hard marked features were getting more hard and marked year by year yet in spite of the deep lines that now furrowed that kindly face those who knew it best said that it grew more beautiful than it had ever been before as that magnificent physique began to fail the noble soul within began to show clearer through its earthly tenement that noble soul which was getting purified and ready for what happened but a few years after this in patagonia when we heard that that man had earned the crown of glory and had been thought worthy to sit beside stephen and paul in the kingdom none of us wept for him or mourned it seemed such a fitting reward for such a pure and noble life but even now when i wake in the night i see him before me as he was described in the last scene by the only survivor felled down upon the sand with his arms before his eyes crying out as the spears struck him one after another lord forgive them they know not what they do chapter xlvi in which sam meets with a serious accident and gets crippled for life what morning is this when sam waking from silver dreams to a golden reality turns over in his bed and looks out of the open glass door at dog rover propped up against the lintel chopping at the early flies at the flowergarden dark and dewy at the black wall of forest beyond in which the magpies were beginning to pipe cheerily at the blessed dawn which was behind and above it shooting long rays of primrose and crimson halfway up the zenith hearing the sleepy ceaseless crawling of the river over the shingle bars hearing the booming of the cattleherds far over the plain hearing the chirrup of the grasshopper among the raspberries the chirr of the cicada among the wattleswhat happy morning is this is it the sabbath ah no the sabbath was yesterday this is his wedding morn my dear brother bachelor do you remember those old firstlove sensations or have you got too old and too fat do you remember the night when you parted from her on the bridge by the lock the night before her father wrote to you and forbade you the house have you got the rose she gave you there is it in your bible brother do you remember the months that followedmonths of mad grief and wild yearning till the yearning grew lessless wildand the grief less desperate and then worst of all the degrading consciousness that you were in spite of yourself getting rid of your love and that she was not to you as she had been do you remember all this when you come across the rose in your bible do you feel that you would give all the honour and wealth of the world to feel again those happy wretched old sensations do you not say that this world has nothing to give in comparison to that not this world i believe you and i can never feel that again so let us make up our minds to itit is dead in gods name dont let us try to galvanize an old corpse which may rise upon us hideous and scare us to the lower pit let us be content as we are let us read that book we spoke of just now with the rose in it and imitate the perfect man there spoken of who was crucified years ago believing like him that all men are our brothers and acting up to it and then lord knows what may be in store for us heres a digression if i had had a good wife to keep me in order i never should have gone so far out of the road here is sam in bed sitting up with his happy head upon his hands trying to believe that this dream of love is going to be realizedtrying to believe that it is really his wedding morn it evidently is so he gets out of bed and says his prayers like an honest gentlemanhe very often forgot to do this same but he did it this morning carefullymuch i am afraid as a kind of charm or incantation till he came to the lords prayer itself and then his whole happy soul wedded itself to the eternal words and he arose calm and happy and went down to bathe happy i said was he really happy he ought to have been for every wish he had in this life was fulfilled and yet when jim and he and halbert were walking towel in hand down the garden they held this conversation sam my dear old brother at last said jim are you happy i ought to be jim said sam but im in the most confounded fright sirthey generally are in a fright when they are going to be married those benedicts what the deuce are they afraid of our dear jim was in anything but an enviable frame of mind he had found out several things which did not at all conduce to his happiness he had found out that it was one thing to propose going to india or nomansland and cutting off every tie and association which he had in the world and that it was quite another thing to do that same he had found out that it was one thing to leave his sister in the keeping of his friend sam and another to part from her probably for ever and last of all he had found out ever since his father had put his arm round his neck and kissed him that night we know of that he loved that father beyond all men in this world it was a new discovery he had never known it till he found he had got to part with him and now when he woke in the night our old merryhearted jim sat up in bed and wept aye and no shame to him for it when he thought of that handsome calm bronzed face tearless and quiet there over the fortifications and the mathematics when he was far away he will never say a word sam said jim as they were walking down to bathe this very morning of the wedding but hell think the more sam i am afraid i have done a selfish thing in going but if i were to draw back now i should never be the same to him again he couldnt stand that but i am sorry i ever thought of it i dont know jim said halbert pulling off his trowsers i really dont know of any act of parliament passed in favour of the brentwood family exempting them from the ordinary evils of humanity do you think now that when john nokes aged nineteen goes into market at cambridge or elsewhere and lists and never goes home again do you think i say that that lad dont feel a very strange emptiness about the epigastric region when he thinks of the greyheaded old man that is sitting waiting for him at the cottagedoor and added halbert standing on the plungingstage adamically without a rag upon him pointing at jim with his finger in an oratorical manner do you think that the old man who sits there year after year waiting for him who never comes and telling the neighbours that his lad who is gone for a sodger was the finest lad in the village do you think that old man feels nothing give up fine feelings jim you dont know what trouble is yet and so he went souse into the water and after the bathe all came up and dressedwhite trowsers and brilliant ties being the order of the day then we all from the bachelor side of the house assembled in the verandah for the ceremony was not to be performed till eight and it was not more than halfpast seven there was the promise of a very awkward half hour so i was glad of a diversion caused by my appearing in a blue coat with gilt buttons and pockets in the tailsa coat i had not brought out for twenty years but as good as new i give you my honour jim was very funny about that coat and i encouraged him by defending it and so we got through ten minutes and kept sam amused then one of the grooms a lad i mentioned before as bringing a note to baroona on one occasion a long brownfaced lad born of london parents in the colony made a diversion by coming round to look at us he admired us very much but my gilt buttons took his attention principally he guessed they must have cost a matter of twenty pound but on my telling him that the whole affair was bought for three pounds he asked i remember what are they made on then brass i supposed and gilt so he left me in disgust and took up with jims trowsers wanting to know if they was canvas satin velvet jim said and then the major came out and beckoned us into the drawingroom and there she was between mrs buckley and mary hawker dressed all in white looking as beautiful as morning frank maberly stood beside a little table which the women had made into an altar with the big prayerbook in his hand and we all stood around and the servants thronged in and sam taking alices hand went up and stood before frank maberly captain brentwood of the artillery would give this woman to be married to this man with ten thousand blessings on her head and samuel buckley of baroona would take this woman as his wedded wife in sickness and health for richer for poorer till death did them part and yes by george he will says jim to himselfbut i heard him for we were reading out of the same prayerbook and so it was all over and the doctor who had all the morning been invisible and had only slipt into the room just as the ceremony had began wearing on his coat a great star a prodigy which had drawn many eyes from their prayerbooks the doctor i say came up star and all and taking alices hand kissed her forehead and then clasped a splendid necklace round her throat then followed all the usual kissings and congratulations and then came the breakfast i hope alice and sam were happy as happy as young folks can be in such a state of flutter and excitement but all i know is that the rest of the party were thoroughly and utterly miserable the certainty that this was the breakup of our happy old society that all that was young and merry and graceful among us was about to take wing and leave us old folks sitting there lonely and dull the thought that neither baroona nor garoopna could ever be again what they had once been and that never again we should hear those merry voices wakening us in the morning or ringing pleasant by the river on the soft summers evening these thoughts i say made us but a dull party although covetown and the doctor made talking enough for the rest of us there was something i could not understand about the doctor he talked loud and nervously all breakfast time and afterwards when alice had retired to change her dress and we were all standing about talking he came up to me in a quiet corner where i was and took me by the hand my dear old friend he said you will never forget me will you forget you baron never i said i would have asked him more but there was alice in the room in her pretty blue ridinghabit and hat ready for a start and sam beside her whip in hand so we all crowded out to say goodbye that was the worst time of all mrs buckley had said farewell and departed jim was walking about tearless but quite unable to answer me when i asked him a question those two grim old warriors the captain and the major were taking things very quietly but did not seem inclined to talk much while the doctor was conducting himself like an amiable lunatic getting in everybodys way as he followed sam about sam he said after alice had been lifted on her horse my dear sam my good pupil you will never forget your old tutor will you never never said sam not likely if i lived to be a hundred i shall see you tomorrow oh yes surely said the baron we shall meet tomorrow for certain but goodbye my boy good bye and then the young couple rode away to baroona which was empty swept and garnished ready for their reception and the servants cheered them as they went away and tall eleanor sent one of her husbands boots after them for luck with such force and dexterity that it fell close to the heels of widderin setting him caperingthen sam turned round and waved his hat and they were gone and we turned round to look at one another and lo another horse the doctors was being led up and down by a groom saddled and while we wondered out came the doctor himself and began strapping his valise on to the saddle and where are you going today baron asked the major i am going said he to sydney i sail for europe in a week our astonishment was too great for ejaculations we kept an awful silence this was the first hint he had given us of his intention yes said he i sail from sydney this day week i could not embitter my boys weddingday by letting him know that he was to lose me better that he should come back and find me gone i must go and i foresaw it when that letter came but i would not tell you because i knew you would be so sorry to part i have been inside and said farewell to mrs buckley and now my friends shorten this scene for me night and day for a month i have been dreading it and now let us spare one another why should we tear our hearts asunder by a long leavetaking oh buckley buckley after so many years only a hurried shaking of hands and he was gone down by the paddock to the river and when he reached the height beyond he turned and waved his hand then he went on his way across the old plains and we saw him lessening in the distance until he disappeared altogether and we saw him no more no more in two months from that time jim and halbert were gone to india sam and alice were away to the darling downs desborough and the doctor had sailed for europe and we old folks taking up our residence at baroona had agreed to make common house of it of course we were very dull at first when we missed half of the faces which had been used to smile upon us but this soon wore off during the succeeding winter i remember many pleasant evenings when the captain the major mrs buckley and myself played whist shilling points and the rigour of the game and while mary hawker in her widows weeds sat sewing by the fireside contentedly enough chapter xlvii how mary hawker said yes it was one evening during the next spring and the game of whist was over for the night the servant had just brought in tumblers with a view to whiskey and water before bed i was preparing to pay fourteen shillings to mrs buckley and was rather nervous about meeting my partner the majors eye when he tapping the table with his hand spoke the most childish play hamlyn the most childish play i dont defend the last game i said i thought you were short of diamondsat least i calculated on the chance of your being so having seven myself but please to remember major that you yourself lost two tricks in hearts in the first game of the second rubber and why sir said the major tell me that sir because you confused me by leading queen when you had ace king queen the most utterly schoolboy play i wouldnt have done such a thing at eton i had a flush of them i said eagerly and i meant to lead ace and then get trumps out but i put down queen by mistake you can make what excuses you like hamlyn said the major but the fact remains the same there is one great fault in your character the greatest fault i know of and which you ought to study to correct i tell you of it boldly as an old friend you are too confoundedly chary in leading out your trumps and you cant deny it hallo said captain brentwood who comes so late mary hawker rose from her chair and looked eagerly towards the door i know who it is she said blushing i heard him laugh in another moment the door was thrown open and in stalked tom troubridge by george he said dont all speak to me at once i feel the queerest wambling in my innards as we used to say in devon at the sight of so many old faces somehow a man cant make a new home in a hurry its the people make the home not the house and furniture my dear old cousin and how are you i am very quiet tom i am much happier than i thought to have been and i am deeply thankful to see you again how is my boy tom said the major and how is my girl tom said the captain sam said tom is a sight worth a guinea and mrs samuel looks charming butin point of fact you know i believe she expects no said the captain you dont say so fact my dear sir dear me said the major drumming on the table i hope it will be a b by the bye how go the sheep you never saw such a country sir said tom we have got nearly five thousand on each run and there is no one crowding up yet if we can hold that ground with our produce and such storesheep as we can pick up we shall do wonders by this time tom was set at supper and between the business of satisfying a hunger of fifteen hours began asking after old friends how are the mayfords he asked poor mrs mayford is better said mrs buckley she and ellen are just starting for europe they have sold their station and we have bought it what are they going to do in england asked tom going to live with their relations in hampshire ellen will be a fine match for some young english squire said tom she will have twenty thousand pounds some day i suppose and then we went on talking about other matters a little scene took place in the garden next morning which may astonish some of my readers but which did not surprise me in the least i knew it would happen sooner or later and when i saw toms air on his arrival the night before i said to myself it is coming and so sure enough it did and i got all the circumstances out of tom only a few days afterwards mary hawker was now a very handsome woman about one and forty there may have been a grey hair here and there among her long black tresses but they were few and far between i used to watch her sometimes of an evening and wonder to myself how she had come through such troubles and lived and yet there she was on the night when tom arrived for instance sitting quite calm and cheerful beside the fire in her halfmourning she had soon dropped her weeds perhaps considering who her husband had been a piece of good taste with quite a placid contented look on her fine black eyes i think no one was capable of feeling deeper for a time but her power of resilience was marvellous i have noticed that before it may god forgive me have given me some slight feeling of contempt for her because forsooth she did not brood over and nurse an old grief as i did myself i am not the man to judge her when i look back on my own wasted life when i see how for one boyish fancy i cut myself off from all the ties of domestic life to hold my selfish way alone i sometimes think that she has shown herself a better woman than i have a man ah well old sweetheart not much to boast of either of us let us get on she was walking in the garden next morning and tom came and walked beside her and after a little he said so you are pretty well contented cousin i am as well content she said as a poor desolate old childless widow could hope to be there is no happiness left for me in this life who told you that said tom who told you that the next twenty years of your life might not be happier than any that have gone before how could that be she asked what is left for me now but to go quietly to my grave grave said tom who talks of graves for twenty years to come mary my darling i have waited for you so long and faithfully you will not disappoint me at last what do you mean what can you mean mean said he why i mean this cousin i mean you to be my wifeto come and live with me as my honoured wife for the next thirty years please god you are mad she said do you know what you say do you know who you are speaking to to my old sweetheart polly thornton he said with a laughto no one else in the world you are wrong she said you may try to forget now but you will remember afterwards i am not mary thornton i am an old broken woman whose husband was transported for coining and hung for murder and worse peace be with him said tom i am not asking who your husband was i have had twenty years to think about that and at the end of twenty years i say my dear old sweetheart you are free at last will you marry me impossible said mary all the countryside knows who i am think of the eternal disgrace that clings to me oh never never then you have no objection to me eh cousin to you my kind noble old partner ah i love and honour you above all men then said tom putting his arm round her waist to the devil with all the nonsense you have just been talking about eternal disgraces and so forth i am an honest man and youre an honest woman and therefore what cause or impediment can there be come mary its no use resisting my mind is made up and you must oh think she said oh think only once before it is too late for ever i have thought said tom as i told you before for twenty years and i aint likely to alter my opinion in ten minutes come mary say yes and so she said yes mrs buckley said tom as they came up arm in arm to the house it will be a good thing if somebody was to go up to our place and nurse mrs sam in her confinement i shall go up myself said mrs buckley though how i am to get there i hardly know it must be nearly eight hundred miles i am afraid i dont think you need my dear madam said he my wife will make an excellent nurse your wife tom looked at mary who blushed and mrs buckley came up and kissed her i am so glad so very glad my love she said the very happiest and wisest thing that could be i have been hoping for it my love and i felt sure it would be so sooner or later how glad your dear aunt would be if she were alive and in short he took her off with him and they were married and went up to join sam and his wife in new englandreducing our party to four not very long after they were gone we heard that there was a new sam buckley born who promised said the wise women to be as big a man as his father then at an interval of very little more than two years mrs buckley got a long letter from alice announcing the birth of a little girl to the troubridges this letter is still extant and in my possession having been lent me among other family papers by agnes buckley as soon as she heard that i was bent upon correcting these memoirs to fit them for the press i will give you some extracts from it dear mary troubridge has got a little girl a sweet quiet brighteyed little thing taking i imagine after old miss thornton they are going to call it agnes alice after you and i my dearest mother you cannot imagine how different mary is grown from what she used to be stout merry and matronly quite she keeps the house alive and i think i never saw a couple more sincerely attached than are she and her husband he is a most excellent companion for my sam not to make matters too long we are just about as happy as four people can be some day we may all come to live together again and then our delight will be perfect i got jims letter which you sent me sam and his partner are embarking every sixpence they can spare in buying town and suburban lots at melbourne i know every street and alley in that wonderful city containing near a hundred houses on the map but i am not very likely to go there ever let us hope that sams speculations will turn out profitable best love to mr hamlyn i must make a note to this letter alice refers to a letter received from jim which as near as i can make the dates agree must be the one i hold in my hand at this moment i am not sure but i think so this one runs dear dad i have been down among the dead men and since then up into the seventh heaven in consequence of being not only gazetted but promoted the beggars very nearly did for us all our fortifications the prettiest things ever done under the circumstances executed under bobbys own eye were thrown down bywhat do you thinkan earthquake perhaps we didnt swearlord forgive us akbar had a shy at us immediately but got a most immortal licking is not this a most wonderful thing about halbert the girl that he was to be married to was supposed to be lost coming out in the assam and now it appears that she wasnt lost at all the girl i mean not the ship but that she was wrecked on the east coast of madagascar and saved with five and twenty more she came on to calcutta and they were married the week after he got his troop she is uncommonly handsome and ladylike but looks rather brown and lean from living on birds nests and seaweed for above six months of her life allow me to remark that this must be romance on jims part birds nests and trepang are not found in madagascar my wound is nearly all right again it was only a prick with a spear in my thigh it is the very deuce editing these old letters without anything to guide one as far as i can make out by myself jim being now down at melton hunting and not having answered my letter of inquiries this letter must have come accompanied by an indian newspaper containing the account of some battle or campaign in which he was engaged putting this and that together i am inclined to believe that it refers to the defence of jellalabad by sir robert sale in which i know he was engaged i form this opinion from the fact of his mentioning that the fortifications were destroyed by an earthquake and i very much fear that the individual so disrespectfully mentioned above as bobby was no other than the great hero himself in my second or if that goes off too quick in my third edition i will endeavour to clear this point up in a satisfactory manner after this there was a long dull time with no news from him or from any one then sam came down from new england and paid us a visit which freshened us up a little but in spite of this and other episodes there was little change or excitement for us four we made common house of it and never parted from one another more than a day always of an evening came the old friendly rubber i playing with the major and captain brentwood with mrs buckley the most remarkable event i have to chronicle during the long period which followed is that one day a bushfire came right up to the garden rails and was beaten out with difficulty and that same evening i held nine trumps ace queen knave nine of hearts and the rest small i cannot for the life of me remember what year it was in somewhere between fortytwo and fortyfive i believe because within a year or two of that time we heard that a large comet had appeared in england and that sir robert peel was distrusted on the subject of protection after all it is no great consequence though it is rather provoking because i never before or since held more than eight trumps burnside the cattledealer claims to have held eleven but i may state once for all that i doubt that mans statements on this and every other subject on which he speaks he knows where i am to be found my man dick too somehow or another constituted himself my groom and valet and the major was well contented with the arrangement so we four major and mrs buckley captain brentwood and i sat there in the old station night after night playing our whist till even my head the youngest of the four began to be streaked with grey and sixteen years were past chapter xlviii the latest intelligence it is march the short autumn day is rapidly giving place to night and darkness and the horror of a great tempest is settling down upon the desolate grey sea which heaves and seethes for ever around cape horn a great clipper ship the noblest and swiftest of her class is hurling along her vast length before the terrible west wind hour by hour through the short and gloomy day sail after sail has gone fluttering in till now at nightfall she reels and rolls before the storm under a single close reefed maintopsail there is a humming and a roaring and a rushing of great waters so that they who are clinging to the bulwarks and watching awestruck this great work of the lords cannot hear one another though they shout now there is a grey mountain which chases the ship overtakes her pours cataracts of water over her rounded stern and goes hissing and booming past her and now a roll more frantic than usual nigh dips her mainyard and sends the water spouting wildly over her bulwarks oh you very miserable ass said captain brentwood to sit down and try to describe the indescribable do you think that because you can see all the scene before you now because your flesh creeps and your blood moves as you call it to mind do you think i say that you can describe it do you think that you can give a man in black and white with ink and on paper any real notion of that most tremendous spectacle a sharp bowed ship running before a gale of wind through the ice in the great south sea where every wave rolls round the world go toread tom cringle who has given up his whole soul to descriptions and see how many pictures dwell in your minds eye after reading his books two or at most three and they probably quite different from what he intended you to see lovely as they areleave describing things man and give us some more facts said major buckley go on hamlyn and do the best you can dont mind him and so i go on accordingly degrees minutes south the horn stormbeaten desolate four hundred miles to the north and barely forty miles to the south that cruel gleaming ice barrier which we saw today when the weather lifted at noon and which we know is there yet though we dare not think about it there comes to us though in spite of ourselves a vision of what may happen any hour a wild cry from the foretop a mass grey indistinct horrible rising from the wild waters scarce a hundred yards from her bowsprit a mad hurrying to and fro a crash a great ruin of masts and spars and then utter hopeless destruction that is the way the poor old madagascar must have gone the lord send us safe through the ice stunned drenched to the skin halffrightened but wildly excited and determined to see out what a landsman has but seldom a chance of seeing a great gale of wind at sea i clung tight to the starboard bulwarks of mr richard greens new clipper sultan captain sneezer about an hour after dark as she was rounding the horn watching much such a scene as i have attempted to give you a notion of above and as i held on there wishing that the directors of my insurance office could see me at that moment the first mate coming from forward warping himself from one belayingpin to another roared in my ear that he thought it was going to blow man man i said do you mean to tell me it is not blowing now a bit of a breeze he roared but his roar came to me like a whisper however i pretty soon found out that this was something quite out of the common for crawling up along the gangway which runs between the poophouse and the bulwarks i came with great difficulty to the stern and there i saw the two best men in the larboard watch let us immortalize them they were deaf bob and harry the digger lashed to the wheel and the skipper himself steadfast and anxious alongside of them lashed to a cleat on the afterpart of the deckhouse so thinks i if these men are made fast this is no place for me to be loose in and crawled down to my old place in the waist at the after end of the spare topsailyard which was made fast to the starboardbulwarks and which extended a little abaft of the main shrouds if any gentleman can detect a nautical error in that last sentence i shall feel obliged by his mentioning it somebody who came forth from the confusion and was gone again informed me that he was going to lay her to and that id better hold on i comforted myself with the reflection that i was doing exactly the right thing holding on like grim death then something happened and i am sorry to say i dont exactly know what i find in my notes taken shortly afterwards from the dictation of an intelligent midshipman that the fore royalyard got jammed with the spankerboom and carried away the larboard quarter boat nautical friends have since pointed out to me that this involves an impossibility i daresay it does i know it involved an impossibility of turning in without subjecting yourself to a hydropathic remedy of violent nature by going to bed in wet blankets and of getting anything for breakfast besides wet biscuit and cold tea let it go something went wrong and the consequences were these a wall of water looming high above her mainyard came rushing and booming along dark terrible opaque for a moment i saw it curling overhead and would have cried out i believe had there been time but a midshipman a mere child slipped up before me and caught hold of my legs while i tried to catch his collar then i heard the skipper roar out in that hoarse throaty voice that seamen use when excited hold on the seas aboard and then a stunning blinding rush of water buried us altogether the sultan was on her beamends and what was more seemed inclined to stay there so that i holding on by the bulwarks saw the sea seething and boiling almost beneath my feet which were swinging clear off the deck but the midshipman sung out that she was righting again which she did rather quicker than was desirable bringing every loose article on deck down to our side again with a rush a useless thundering fourpounder gun of which terrible implements of war we carried six came plunging across from the other side of the deck and went crashing through the bulwarks out into the sea within two feet of my legs i think i said trying to persuade myself that i was not frightened i think i shall go into the cuddy that was not very easy to do i reached the door and got hold of the handle and watching my opportunity slipped dexterously in and making a plunge came against the surgeon who seated on a campstool was playing piquette and overthrew him into a corner repique by jingo shouted sam buckley who was the surgeons opponent see what a capital thing it is to have an old friend like hamlyn to come in and knock your opponent down just at the right moment and papa was losing too uncle jeff added a handsome lad about fifteen who was leaning over sams shoulder what are they doing to you doctor said alice buckley nee brentwood coming out of a cabin and supporting herself to a seat by her husband and son why replied the surgeon hamlyn knocked me down just in a moment of victory but his nefarious project has failed for i have kept possession of my cards play buckley let us give a glance at the group which is assembled beneath the swing lamp in the reeling cabin the wife and son are both leaning over the fathers shoulder and the three faces are together sam is about forty there is not a wrinkle in that honest forehead and the eyes beam upon you as kindly and pleasantly as ever they did and when after playing to the surgeon he looks up and laughs one sees that he is just the same old sam that used to lie as a lad dreaming in the verandah at garoopna no trouble has left its shadow there alice whose face is pressed against his is now a calm young matron of three or fourandthirty if it were possible more beautiful than ever only she has grown from a hebe into a juno the boy the son and heir is much such a stripling as i can remember his father at the same age but handsomer and while we look another face comes peering over his shoulder the laughing face of a lovely girl with bright sunny hair and soft blue eyes the face of maud buckley sams daughter they are going home to england samwhat between his new england runs where there are now under tom troubridges care sheep and his land speculations at melbourne which have turned him out somewhere about per cent since the gold discoverysam i say is one of the richest of her majestys subjects in the southern hemisphere i would give l for sam and make a large fortune in the surplus and so i suppose you say he is going home to buy clere not at all my dear sir clere is bought and sam is going home to take possession marry how thus does any one of my readers remember that our dear old friend agnes buckleys maiden name was talbot and that her father owned the property adjoining clere we do not remember you say or at least if we do we are not bound to you have not mentioned the circumstance since the very beginning of this excessively wearisome book forty years ago allow me to say that i have purposely avoided mentioning them all along in order that at this very point i might come down on you like a thunderbolt with this piece of information namelythat talbot of beaulieu castle the towers of which were visible from clere terrace had died without male issue that marian and gertrude talbot the two pretty girls agnes buckleys eldest sisters who used to come in and see old marmaduke when james was campaigning had never married that marian was dead that gertrude a broken old maid was sole owner of beaulieu castle with eight thousand ayear and that agnes buckley her sister and consequently sam as next in succession was her heir all the negotiations for the purchase of clere had been carried on through miss gertrude and her steward the brewer died the property was sold and sam by his agents bought old clere back eight months before this for l then why on earth says mrs councillor wattlegum our colonial mrs grundy didnt they go home overland how could people with such wealth as you describe demean themselves by going home round the horn like a parcel of diggers because my dear madam the young folks were very anxious to see an iceberg come let us get on the gale has lasted three days and in that time we have run before it on our course miles the fourth morning breaks gloriously bright with the shadows of a few fleecy clouds flying across the bright blue heaving sea the ship with all canvas crowded on her alow and aloft is racing on fifteen knots an hour with a brisk cold wind full on her quarter heeling over till the water comes rushing and spouting through her leeward ports and no man can stand without holding on but all are merry and happy to see the water fly past like blue champagne and to watch the seething wake that the good ship leaves behind her ah what is this that all are crowding down to leeward to look at is this the crystal palace of which we have read come out to sea to meet us no the young folks are going to be gratified it is a great iceberg and we shall pass about a mile to windward certainly worth seeing much more tremendous than i had expected though my imagination had rather run riot in expectation just a great floating cluster of shining splintered crystals about a mile long and feet high with the cold hungry sea leaping and gnawing at its basethat is all send up those german musicians here and let us hear the echo of one of strauss waltzes come ringing back from the chill green caverns then away her head in northward again now we may sight the falklands the day after tomorrow hardly worth telling you much more about that happy voyage i think and really i remember but few things more of note a great american ship in degrees steaming in the teeth of the wind heaving her long gleaming sides through the roll of the south atlantic the royal charter passing us like a phantom ship through the hot haze when we were becalmed on the line waking the silence of the heaving glassy sea with her throbbing propeller a valiant vainglorious little gunboat going out all the way to china by herself giving herself the airs of a seventyfour requiring boats to be sent on board her as if we couldnt have stowed her guns and all on our poop and never crowded ourselves a noble transport with painted on her bows swarming with soldiers for india to whom we gave three times three all these things have faded from my recollection in favour of a bright spring morning in april a morning which beyond all others in my life stands out clear and distinct as the most memorable jim buckley shoved aside my cabin door when i was dressing and says heuncle jeff my dad wants you immediately he is standing by the davits of the larboard quarterboat and so i ran up to sam and he took my arm and pointed northward over the gleaming morning sea rose a purple mountain shadowed here and there by travelling clouds and a little redsailed boat was diving and plunging towards us with a red flag fluttering on her mast what i saidbut i could say no more the lizard but i could not see it now for a blinding haze and i bent down my head upon the bulwarksbah i am but a fool after all what could there have been to cry at in a cornish moor and a falmouth pilot boat i am not quite so young as i was and my nerves are probably failing that must have been it when i saw the steeple says m tapley i thought it would have choked me let me say the same of eddystone lighthouse which we saw that afternoon and have done with sentiment for good if my memory serves me rightly we have had a good deal of that sort of thing in the preceding pages i left the ship at plymouth and sam went on in her to london i satisfied my soul with amazement at the men of war and the breakwater and having bought a horse i struck boldly across the moor for drumston revisiting on my way many a wellknown snipeground and old trout haunt and so on the third morning i reached drumston once more and stabled my horse at a little publichouse near the church it was about eight oclock on a tuesday morning nevertheless the churchbell was going and the door was open as if for prayer i was a little surprised at this but having visited the grave where my father and mother lay and then passed on to the simple headstone which marked the resting place of john thornton and his wife i brushed through the docks and nettles towards the lychgate in the shadow of which stood the clergyman a gentlemanly looking young man talking to a very aged woman in a red cloak he saluted me courteously and passed on talking earnestly and kindly to his aged companion and so the remarkable couple went into the church and the bell stopped i looked around close to me leaning against the gate was a coarse looking woman about fifty who had just set down a red earthen pitcher to rest herself and seemed not disinclined for a gossip and at the same moment i saw a fat man about my own age with breeches unbuttoned at the knee grey worsted stockings and slippers and looking altogether as if he was just out of bed having had too much to drink the night before such a man i say i saw coming across the road towards us with his hands in his pockets good morning i said to the woman pray what is the clergymans name mr montague she answered with a curtsey does he have prayers every morning every marnin of his life she said hes a papister youm a fool cis jewell said the man who had by this time arrived youm leading the gentleman wrong hes a pussyite and there baint much difference im thinking james gosford said cis jewell i started james gosford had been one of my favourite old comrades in times gone by and here he was could it be he could this fat redfaced man of sixtyone be the handsome hardriding young dandy of forty years ago it was he doubtless and in another moment i should have declared myself but a new interruption occurred the bell began again and service was over the old woman came out of the porch and slowly down the pathway towards us is that all his congregation i asked thats all sir said gosford sometimes some of they young villains of boys gets in and our old clerk jerry hunts em round and round all prayer time but theres none goes regular except the old ooman and she had need to pray a little more than other folks said cis jewell folding her arms and balancing herself in a conversational attitude my poor old grandfather further conversation was stopped by the near approach of the old woman herself and i looked up at her with some little curiosity a very old woman she was surely and while i seemed struggling with some sort of recollection she fixed her eyes upon me and we knew one another geoffry hamlyn she said without a sign of surprise you are welcome back to your native village when your old comrade did not know you i whose eyes are dim with the sorrow of eighty years recognised you at once they may well call me the wise woman good god was all i could say can this be madge this is madge she said who has lived long enough to see and to bless the man who saw and comforted her poor lost boy in prison when all beside fell off from him the lord reward you for it how did you know that madge ask a witch where she gets her information laughed she god forgive me ill tell you how it was one of the turnkeys in that very prison was a cooper a hampshire gipsy and he knowing my boy to be halfblooded passed all the facts on through the tribes to me who am a mother among them did you see him die she added eagerly putting her great bony hand upon my arm and looking up in my face no no mother i answered i hadnt courage for that i heard he died grim she continued half to herself he should a done there was a deal of wild blood in him from both sides are you going up to the woodlands to see the old place tis all in ruins now and the choughs and stares are building and brooding in the chimney nook where i nursed him i shall not have much longer to wait i only stayed for this goodbye and she was gone and gosford relieved by her departure was affectionately lugging me off to his house oh the mixture of wealth and discomfort that house exhibited oh the warmhearted jollity of every one there oh to see those three pretty welleducated girls taking their father off by force and making him clean himself in honour of my arrival oh the merry evening we had what though the cider disagreed with me what though i knew it would disagree with me at the time i drank it that noisy jolly night in the old devonshire grange was one of the pleasantest of my life and to my great surprise the vicar came in in the middle of it and made himself very agreeable to me he told me that old madge as far as he could see was a thoroughly converted and orderly person having thrown aside all pretence of witchcraft that she lived on some trifle of hoarded money of her own and a small parish allowance that she had and that she had only come back to the parish some six years since after wandering about as a gipsy in almost every part of england he was so good as to undertake the delivery of a small sum to her weekly from me quite sufficient to enable her to refuse the parish allowance and live comfortably he wrote to me a few months afterwards and told me that it was required no longer for that madge was gone to rest at last and a good deal more news he gave me very little of which is interesting here he told me that lord c john thorntons friend was dead that he never thoroughly got over the great reform debate in which he overexerted himself and that after the passing of the bill he had walked joyfully home and had a fit which prevented his ever taking any part in politics afterwards though he lived above ten years that his son was not so popular as his father in consequence of his politics which were too conservative for the new class of tenants his father had brought in and his religious opinions which said the clergyman were those of a sound churchman by which he meant i rather suspect that he was a pretty smart tractarian i was getting won with this young gentleman in spite of religious difference when he chose to say that the parish had never been right since maberly had had it and that the dissenters always raved about him to this day whereby he concluded that frank maberly was far from orthodox i took occasion to say that frank was the man of all others in this world whom i admired most and that considering he had sealed his faith with his life i thought that he ought to be very reverently spoken of after this there arose a little coolness and he went home i went up to town by the great western and for the first time knew what was meant by railway travelling true i had seen and travelled on that monument of human industry the hobsons bay railroad but that stupendous work hardly prepared me for the great western and on this journey i began to understand for the first time in my life what a marvellous country this england of ours was i wondered at the wealth and traffic i saw even in comparatively unimportant towns i wondered at the beauty and solidity of the railway works at the vast crowds of people which i saw at every station at the manly independent bearing of the men of the working classes which combined so well with their civility and intelligence and i thought with a laugh of the fate of any eighty thousand men who might shove their noses into this beehive while there was such material to draw upon such were the thoughts of an englishman landing in england from whom the evils produced by dense population were as yet hidden but when i got into the whirl of london i was completely overwhelmed and stupified i did not enjoy anything the eternal roar was so different to what i had been used to and i had stayed there a couple of months before i had got a distinct impression of anything save and except the crystal palace at sydenham it was during this visit to london that i heard of the fall of von landsteins dr mulhaus ministry which had happened a year or two before and now also i read the speech he made on his resignation which for biting sarcasm and bitter truth rudely told is unequalled by any speech i ever read a more witty more insolent more audacious tirade was never hurled at a successful opposition by a fallen minister the k party sat furious as one by one were seized on by our ruthless friend held up to ridicule and thrown aside they however meditated vengeance our friend in the heat of debate used the word dummerkopf which answers i believe to our wooden head he applied it to no one in particular but a certain young nobleman bowwow von azelsberg was his name found the epithet so applicable to his own case that he took umbrage at it and being egged on by his comrades challenged von landstein to mortal combat von landstein received his fire without suffering adjusted his spectacles and shot the young gentleman in the knee stopping his waltzing for ever and a day he then departed for his castle where he is at this present speaking having just gone there after a visit to clere busy at his great book the history of fanatics and fanaticism from mahomet to joe smith beloved by all who come in contact with him happy honoured and prosperous as he so well deserves to be but i used to go and see everything that was to be seen though having no companion for sam was down at clere putting his house in order it was very wretched work i did in fact all the public amusements in london and as a matter of course found myself one night about eleven oclock at evanss in covent garden the place was crowded to suffocation but i got a place at a table about halfway up opposite an old gentleman who had been drinking a good deal of brandy and water and was wanting some more next me was an honestlooking young fellow enough and opposite him his friend these two looked like shoplads out for a spree a tall old gentleman made me buy some cigars with such an air of condescending goodwill that i was encouraged to stop a waiter and humbly ask for a glass of whisky and water he was kind enough to bring it for me so i felt more at ease and prepared to enjoy myself a very gentlemanlylooking man sang us a song so unutterably funny that we were dissolved in inextinguishable laughter and then from behind a curtain began to come boys in black one after another as the imps in a pantomime come from a place i dare not mention to chase the clown to his destruction i counted twelve of them and grew dizzy they ranged themselves in a row with their hands behind them and began screeching tennysons millers daughter with such a maximum of shrillness and such a minimum of expression that i began to think that tailing wild cattle on the mountains at midnight in a thunderstorm with my boots full of water was a far preferable situation to my present one they finished thank goodness ah delusive hope the drunken old miscreant opposite me got up an encore with the bottom of his tumbler and we had it all over again who can tell my delight when he broke his glass applauding and the waiter came down on him sharp and made him pay for it i gave that waiter sixpence on the spot then came some capital singing which i really enjoyed and then came a remarkable adventure an adventure you say and at evanss my dear sir do you suppose that at a moment like this when i am pressed for space and just coming to the end of my storydo you suppose that at a moment like this i would waste your time at a singinghouse for nothing a tall upright looking man passed up the lane between the tables and almost touched me as he passed i did not catch his face but there was something so distingue about him that i watched him he had his hat off and was smoothing down his closecropped hair and appeared to be looking for a seat as he was just opposite to us one of the young clerks leant over to the other and said that is i did not catch what he said by george said the other lad is it now thats him sir said the first one the new comer was walking slowly up the room and there began to arise a little breeze of applause and then some one called out three cheers for the inkerman pet and then there was a stamping of feet and a little laughter and cheering in various parts of the room but the new comer made one bow and walked on pray sir said i bending over to one of those who had spoken before who is that gentleman he had no need to tell me the man we spoke of reached the orchestra and turned round it was jim brentwood there was a great white seam down his face and he wore a pair of light curling moustachios but i knew him in a moment and when he faced round to the company i noticed that his person seemed known to the public for there was not a little applause with the bottoms of tumblers not unlike what one remembers at certain banquets i have been at with certain brethren sons of apollo in one moment we were standing face to face shaking one another by both hands in another we were arm in arm walking through the quiet streets towards jims lodgings he had been in ireland with his regiment as i knew which accounted for my not having seen him and that night major brentwood recounted to me all his part in the last great campaign from the first fierce rush up the hill at the alma down to the time when our lady pinned a certain bit of gun metal on to his coat in st jamess park a few days after this jim and i were standing together on the platform of the wildmoor station on the southwestern railway and a couple of porters were carrying our portmanteaus towards a pairhorse phaeton in which stood sam buckley shouting to us to come on for the horses wouldnt stand so in a moment i was alongside of sam in the front seat with jim standing up behind between the grooms and leaning over between us to see after sams driving and away we went along a splendid road across a heath at what seemed to me a rather dangerous pace let them go my child said jim to sam youve got a fair mile before you sit at your work in capital style give me time and ill teach you to drive sam how do you like this uncle jeff i said thats more than i can tell you master jim i know so little of your wheeled vehicles that i am rather alarmed ah said jim you should have been in calcutta when the orourke and little charley badminton tried to drive a pair of fresh imported australians tandem through the town red maclean and i looked out of the billiardroom and we saw the two horses go by with a bit of a shaft banging about the wheelers hocks so we ran down and found charley with his head broke standing in the middle of the street mopping the blood off his forehead charley says i how the deuce did this happen we met an elephant says he in a faint voice have you heard anything of the mayfords lately said jim you know ellen is married said sam no is she i said and pray to whom the squire of monkspool he answered a very fine young fellow and clever withal did old mrs mayford asked jim ever recover her reason before she died never poor soul said sam to the last she refused to see my mother believing that the rivalry between cecil and myself in some way led to his death she was never sane after that dreadful morning and so with much pleasant talk we beguiled the way till i saw across a deep valley on our right a line of noble heights well timbered but broken into open grassy glades and smooth sheets of bright green lawn between us and these hills flowed a gleaming river from which a broad avenue led up to the eye of the picture a noble grey stone mansion a mass of turrets gables and chimneys which the afternoon sun was lighting up right pleasantly that is the finest seat i have seen yet sam i said whose is that that said sam is clere my house and your home old friend swiftly up under the shadow of the elm avenue past the herds of dappled deer up to the broad graveled terrace which ran along in front of the brave old house and there beneath the dark wild porch above the group of servants that stood upon the steps to receive their master was alice with her son and daughter beside her waiting to welcome us with the happy sunlight on her face i bought a sweet cottage barely a mile from clere with forty acres of grassland round it and every convenience suited for an old bachelor of my moderate though comfortable means i took to fishing and to the breeding of horses on a small scale and finding that i could make myself enormously busy with these occupations and as much hunting as i wanted i became very comfortable and considered myself settled i had plenty of society the best in the land above all men i was the honoured guest at clere and as the county had rallied round sam with acclamation i saw and enjoyed to the fullest extent that charming english countrylife the like of which i take it no other country can show i was a great favourite too with old miss gertrude talbot at the castle her admiration and love for sam and his wife was almost equal to mine so we never bored one another and so by degrees gaining the old ladys entire confidence i got entrusted with a special mission of a somewhat peculiar character the leading desire of this good old womans life was that her sister agnes should come back with her husband the major and take possession of the castle again alice could not be content unless her father could be induced to come back and take up his residence at clere and letters having failed to produce the desired effect in both instances the major saying that he was quite comfortable where he was and the captain urging that the english winters would be too vigorous for his constitution under these circumstances i say i the confidant of the family within fifteen months of landing at plymouth found myself in a hot omnibus with a mahomedan driver jolting and bumping over the desert of suez on my way back to australia charged to bring the old folks home or never show my face again and it was after this journey that the scene described in the first chapter of this book took place when i read aloud to them from the roll of manuscript mentioned there my recollections of all that had happened to us during so many years but since i have come back to england these recollections have been very much enlarged and improved by the assistance of major buckley agnes and captain brentwood for i succeeded in my object and brought them back in triumph through the red sea across the isthmus of suez and so by way of the mediterranean the bay of biscay the english channel southampton water the southwestern railway and alices new darkblue barouche safe and sound to clere and the castle where they all are at this present speaking unless some of them are gone out a walking as for tom troubridge and mary they are so exceedingly happy and prosperous that they are not worth talking about they will come either by the swiftsure or the norfolk and we have got their rooms ready for them they say that their second child the boy is one of the finest riders in the colony you have forgotten some one after all says the reader after due examination a man we took some little interest in it is not much matter though we shall be glad when you have done is this the man you mean i am sitting in sams den at clere he is engaged in receiving the afterdavy of a man who got his head broke by a tinker at the cricketmatch in the park for sam is in the commission and sits on the bench once a month a perfect midas as mrs wattlegum would say i am busy rigging up one of these wonderful new yankee spoons with a view to killing a villanous pike who has got into the troutwater i have just tied on the thirtyninth hook and have got the fortieth ready in my fingers when a footman opens the door and says to me if you please sir your studgroom would be glad to see you i keep two horses of all work and a grey pony so that the word stud before the word groom in the last sentence must be taken to refer to my little farm on which i rear a few colts annually may he come in sam i ask of course uncle jeff says he and so there comes in a little old man dressed in the extreme of that peculiar dandyism which is affected by retired jockeys and trainers and which i have seen since attempted with indifferent success by a few young gentlemen at our great universities he stands in the door and says mr plowden has offered forty pound for the dark chestnut colt sir dick i say mark that if you please dick i think he may have the brute and so my dear reader i must at last bid you heartily farewell i am not entirely without hope that we may meet again
