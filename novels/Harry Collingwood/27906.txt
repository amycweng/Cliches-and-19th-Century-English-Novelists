the voyage of the aurora by harry collingwood chapter one introduces lucy walford those who have ever had occasion to reside for any length of time in gosport are sure to be more or less acquainted with the little village of alverstoke because it lies near at hand and the road leading thereto forms one of the most pleasant walks in the neighbourhood but it may be that there are those into whose hands this book will fall who have never so much as heard the name of the place for their benefit then it may be worth while to state that alverstoke is pleasantly situated at a distance of about one mile from the abovementioned town of gosport and within half a mile of the waters of the solent it is a very unimportant little place at the present day it was even more so in the year the year in which this veracious history opens it was unimportant that is to say in a general sense the public knew very little about it and cared still less but in a particular sense and to the officers of his majestys customs it was a very important place indeed inasmuch as the inhabitants animated by a spirit of enterprise and a love of adventure not to be satisfied by such very ordinary and humdrum pursuits as those of fishing and marketgardening had almost to a manto say nothing of the women and childrenadded thereto the illegal but lucrative and exciting occupation of smuggling to the great loss and damage of the kings revenues the village consisted at that time of a single short narrow street with a bend in the middle of it nearly one half of the north side of this street was occupied by the churchyard and church the remaining portion as well as the opposite side of the way being composed of small low twostory cottages with thatched roofs and most of them having little projecting dormerwindows a couple of publichouses and a small grocery establishment this constituted the village proper but a little aloof from itbeing in it but not of it as it werethere were in all perhaps half a dozen residences of a somewhat more pretentious kind there was the rectory for instance on the opposite side of the road eastward of the church built in the very centre of its extensive garden and snugly surrounded on all sides by high stone walls then there was stoke house near the rectory standing well back from the road embowered in trees and with a carriagedrive running straight up through its beautiful rosegarden to the front door nearer the beach and on the opposite side of the valley was verbena cottage the abode of lieutenant bobus in command of the coastguard and still nearer the beach some ten or a dozen yards back from the road enclosed within a neat paling sheltered by lofty trees with a lovely flowergarden in front and an extensive fruit and kitchengarden in the rear stood sea view a small but wellbuilt house in which resided the relict and daughter of the late capn walford the late capn walford had been a wonderfully popular man in his day and his memory was greatly esteemed and revered by the villagers manifesting at an early age a love of enterprise and excitement quite extraordinary even in an alverstoke man he had seized the first opportunity which offered to become the owner of a very fine fastsailing lugger in which during his thirty years of devotion to maritime pursuits he by a rare combination of prudence and audacity gradually acquired the reputation of being a most successful smuggler and the snug little fortune of some ten thousand pounds the latter and more desirable portion of his acquirements he carefully invested as it dribbled in bit by bit in houseproperty in the neighbourhood so that when this estimable mans career was cut short at the comparatively early age of sixty years by an unlucky cannonshot fired from a revenue cutter his disconsolate relict found herself the possessor of a comfortable income amounting to some five hundred pounds per annum together with sea view andlast but by no means leasta daughter fourteen years of age this melancholy event occurred four years before the date at which this history opens lucy walford was therefore about eighteen years old when the first of that train of events happened which it is herein proposed to record mrs walford was wont to assert just about this time that lucy was the very living picture of what she herself used to be when a girl if this was indeed true it was at once an evidence of that remarkable good taste which the late capn was said to have possessed and of the extraordinary changes effected by the hand of time for no one could ever have suspected such a resemblance without mrs walfords assurance the old lady was a sad and subdued personage thin and angular of figure and face with prominent cheekbones eyebrows and chin dark eyes deeply sunk in their sockets a broad forehead ploughed with innumerable wrinkles a long sharp aquiline nose a large thinlipped mouth and a querulous temper lucy on the other hand was of medium height slight graceful figure abounding in delicate curves with small hands and feet an exquisite complexion a face the sweet piquant loveliness of which set all the youth of alverstokeand gosport too for that matterby the ears a wealth of long silky golden hair which persisted in twisting itself into a most distracting conglomeration of wavy curls and a temper which nothingnot even her mothers querulousnesscould ruffle that lucy should be fairly beset by suitors was only natural there was not a single bold young smuggler of marriageable age in all the country round about who did not cherish in a greater or lesser degree the fond hope of one day making her his own albeit most of them wereit is only just to saydimly cognisant of the fact that she was much too good for the best of them it was probably in consequence of this feeling that only one or twothe boldest of the bold of this dashing fraternity had so far mustered up the courage to approach the young lady with a distinct proposal of marriage and these it is hardly necessary to say had been firmly but as pleasantly as possible sent to the rightabout this class of lovers gave lucy no trouble whatever bold as they might be in the pursuit of their lawless avocation they were diffident to the verge of absurdity in the presence of beauty if associated with dignity and refinement they were painfully conscious of their uncouth bearing and manners and lucy had little difficulty in keeping them at a proper distance but if these admirers gave her no trouble there were othersnotably twowho did quite enough in fact to fully compensate for the ease with which she was able to manage all the rest one of these was a certain lieutenant walford a cousin of lucys the other being captain george leicester of the merchant schooner industry edward walford was the only son of a halfbrother of the late captain walford he was an orphan twentythree years of age and held a commission in his majestysfoot then quartered in gosport he was fairly well educated tall passably goodlooking of engaging manners butthose who knew him best saidtreacherous unscrupulous and a gamester george leicester on the other hand whilst perhaps quite as handsome as his rival was simply a frank honest sturdy seaman carrying his heart upon his sleeve thoroughly master of his profession but diffident and doubtful of himself in all other matters the trouble with these two was that walford could not be made to see that his presence was distasteful to lucy whilst leicester was provokingly blind to the fact that the fair girl loved him with all her pure simple little heart she had not given her love to him unsought it must be understoodfar from it george leicester had been one of the earliest as he was one of her most constant and devoted admirers he was unremitting in his attentions to her whenever he was in port but the simple fellow was so doubtful as to his prospects of success that he had never given lucy the chance which she would so gladly have welcomed to say yes to the momentous question which was ever hovering upon his lips but had never yet been able to get beyond them it was on a certain brilliant june afternoon that lucy as was her frequent custom took a book in her hand and strolled down to the beach where making a little nest for herself in the shingle she sat down to read or think as the whim might take her the ardent rays of the sun streaming down out of a cloudless sky gleamed and flashed and sparkled upon the waters of the solent which ruffled by a gentle westerly breeze shone like a sheet of liquid gold on the further side of the strait the isle of wight upreared its green and wooded slopes in fair perspective its northern shore from nettlestone point to egypt bounding the view on lucys right lay the entrance to southampton water with the further shore about stone point and the mouth of the beaulieu river indistinctly seen through the quivering golden haze whilst on the left across the water southsea castle stood boldly forward upon its low projecting point a watchful sentinel over the magnificent anchorage of spithead inland from the castle lay the little straggling town of southsea and beyond it again still higher up the estuary appeared the spires and roofs of portsmouth its harbour crowded with a perfect forest of masts some half a dozen menowar lay at anchor at spithead and the waters of the solent were dotted with the sails of craft of all sizes from the stately frigate to the humble but enterprising bumboat as lucy sat there on the beach basking in the sun and far too idle to read her listless gaze became fastened upon a trim smartlooking little schooner which under all the canvas she could possibly spread was creeping slowly up from the westward before the light summer breeze the glance of indifference with which the fair girl at first regarded the little craft gradually changed to one of the greatest interest lucy it must be remembered was a sailors daughter nearly all her neighbours were interested almost solely in seafaring matters the daily conversation of those by whom she was surrounded abounded in nautical technicalities she had even made a trip upon one occasion in her fathers lugger the only occasion by the bye on which the hold of the said lugger was absolutely guiltless of contraband freight and lastly were not the walls of her home adorned with portraits of craft of various rigs passing flushing or the needles all of which circumstances had combined to give lucy a very fair knowledge of nautical matters and a sailors eye she had not only learned the distinguishing characteristics of different rigs but had also acquired the subtle power of recognising the individuality of different craft of the same rig whenever there happened to be anything to excite her interest in such craft so now she first recognised the fact that the approaching vessel was a schooner and a little later on when the schooner had drawn somewhat nearer she became conscious that the schooner was well known to her drawing a small telescope from her pocket she focussed it and pointed it at the vessel yes there could be no doubt about it it was the industry every little detail of canvas and rigging proclaimed the schooners identity and then as though in order that there should be no possible room for doubt and as though george leicester had seen and recognised the charming girlish figure standing there on the beach as possibly he had through his powerful marine glass a white fluttering object gleamed out over the rail and soaring aloft streamed from the maintruck a burgee with the name industry worked upon it in red letters at the sight of this lucy rapidly closed her little telescope and returned it to her pocket with a bright flush and a conscious happy little laugh dear george she murmured how glad i am that he is back all safe and how fervently i hope that he did not see me watching the schooner i wonder whether he will walk over this evening she then uncomfortably conscious of the possibility that dear george might at that very moment have her accurately focussed in the field of his glass sauntered along the beach with as much of an air of total abstraction as she could conveniently assume on the spur of the moment and finally after watching the schooner pass safely into portsmouth harbour and there come to an anchor returned home she found her mother suffering from a more than ordinarily severe attack of the miserables as that lady was wont to term her low spirits it was one of mrs walfords peculiarities to be depressed in spirits in exact proportion to the brightness and exhilarating character of the weatherbut lucy was completely proof against it all just now the sight she had so lately looked upon had sent a soft dainty flush into her cheeks a light into her eyes and a song to her lips which her mothers miserables were wholly powerless to drive away and she went about the house filling it with the melody of her low sweet voice tea was over mrs walford was made comfortable in her wide armchair with a huge volume of sermons in her lap and lucy was trying to settle down with composure to the execution of some trifle in the way of needlework when the sharp click of the gatelatch was heard there was a crunching of feet upon the gravel walk the front door was unceremoniously opened and lieutenant edward walford walked in how do aunt lucy fair coz i hope i see you in a state of perfect salubrity was his nonchalant greeting mrs walford replied that she was as well as could be expectedshe did not say under what adverse circumstancesand lucy requested him not to make himself ridiculous it was too bad she decided here she had been looking forward to a delightful visit from george leicester probably a whole evening spent in his society and now this pestilent cousin of hers must needs take it into his perverse head to walk over from gosportto be found later on by dear george making fierce love to her the unfortunate lucywhich would be quite sufficient she felt sure to choke the said george off for at least another voyage but that should never be she was quite resolved she could not prevent her cousin coming to the house since her mother not only tolerated but rather encouraged his visits but she could and she would prevent his making love to her with this determination she sat down and resorting to the best means she could think of for keeping her cousin at arms length produced her writingmaterials and proceeded to discharge a few of her epistolary debts being thus unmistakably shown that his presence was unwelcome to the younger lady he turned his attention to the elder one talking to her about the warthe then allimportant and most interesting topic of the momentand giving her such scraps of news as had come to hand during the day but it was perfectly evident from the uneasy glances he shot at his cousin and the nervous way in which he tugged at his long auburn moustache that his occupation was not to his liking at last abandoning all further effort to accomplish the almost impossible task of amusing the old lady he stepped to lucys side and said in a low whisper will you come into the garden with me for a few minutes lucy i have something of the utmost importance to say to you something which will brook no delay for my regiment is ordered off to the west indies and i may not have another opportunity to see you lucy knew as well as possible what the something was which her cousin so anxiously desired to say to her she was convinced that it was nothing less than a proposal of marriage and her first impulse was to excuse herself but that she decided would hardly be kind on the eve of his departure for foreign service moreover it might leave him in possession of a feeling that there was some hope for him or possibly after the many lovespeeches he had made her he might feel himself in some sort bound not to marry any one else until he had had a distinct refusal from her and that must certainly be avoided so she decided that she would grant him the desired interview give him his dismissal as speedily and withal as kindly as possible and get him out of the house without delayit was still early in the evening and who knew but that she might succeed in getting rid of her unwelcome suitor before the welcome one put in an appearance so laying aside her pen she motioned him to follow her into the large garden at the back of the house where they would be perfectly secure from observation and herself led the way she conducted her cousin to a little summerhouse at the lower end of the garden and motioning him to a seat said now cousin edward what is this important communication which you have to make be as brief as possible if you please for i really cannot spare you much time i will he said then pausing for a moment and making an unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of her hand he remarked i think you must have already guessed what it is that i have to say to you lucy you cannot be ignorant of the feeling with which i regard you you must have discovered long ago that i love you lucy deeply passionately tenderly as a man loves only once in his lifetime we have not known each other very long it is true he continued after a slight pause during which he had vainly looked into her downcast face for some sign of encouragement but the time has been long enough for me to learn that all my hopes of future happiness depend on you and i think it has also been long enough to enable you to judge whether you can entrust your happiness to me or not i know i am by no means what i ought to behere he made another pause hoping for some word or sign of disclaimer which however never camebut i hope you will not judge me too harshly i am an orphan remember robbed at an early age of a mothers tender care and gentle training i have been left pretty much to the mercy of strangers who allowed me to grow up to manhood without an effort to check the development of those evil propensities which we all alike inherit from our first parents and then too i have had the misfortune to be thrownagainst my will i honestly assure youinto evil companionship but in spite of all these disadvantages i flatter myself that i am by no means a bad sort of fellow and if you will only take me in hand lucy i feel sure you could make a reformed character of me and then too consider the society into which i could introduce you wearing his majestys uniform as i do i could pray say no more edward i beg interrupted lucy i am grieved to be obliged to disappoint youthough i do not think the disappointment will be very greatbut what you ask is quite impossible in the first place i must frankly say that i do not love you and in the second i must with equal frankness say that though i might love ever so much i would never marry a man who needed that i should take him in hand to make a reformed character of him you are my cousin and as such i shall always regard you with friendly interest but i shall never be able to entertain for you any warmer feeling walford pale to the lips with surprise and chagrin looked incredulously in the face of the fair girl by whose side he was seated he was completely staggered the idea of his being indifferent to his cousin had never for a single instant occurred to him he had won for himself the reputation of being quite a ladykiller and now this little countrybred girl had the impertinence to tell him coolly that she did not love him nay moreto hint pretty strongly that she regarded him with feelings not very far removed from contempt because forsooth he had lived a somewhat fast life why many of the girls he had met had positively admired him for his rakishnesshe did not pause to consider what manner of girls these were though by the bye it was monstrous it was positively insulting then in addition to the severe wound to his amourpropre there was the disappointment of his hopes of pecuniary aggrandisement lucys fortune modest though it was would have been of the utmost service to him it was true he knew that she would not have a penny of her own until her mother died but that he was firmly convinced would not be a very longpostponed event the old foolas he called mrs walford in his heartwould doubtless be in her grave long enough before he returned from foreign service and at all events he was willing to risk that but then lucy had said she would not have him surely she could not mean it she was only saying it to try him orstaywas it possible that she loved that sailorfellow leicester he would find out are you quite sure lucy that you will never be able to love me he asked infusing a very successful affectation of passionate entreaty into the tones of his voice perhaps i have spoken too quickly i have taken you by surprise i have allowed my impatience to outrun my judgment perhaps if i had waited a little longer it would have been just the same i could never have loved you interrupted lucy and now let us return to the house this interview has lasted quite long enough i am sincerely sorry if you are disappointed edward but i could never give you any other answer so please say no more about it one word more exclaimed walford tell mei have a right to know do you love any one else i really do not see that you have a right to know anything about my private affairs answered lucy with some hauteur but in order that you may fully understand the hopelessness of your own case i will confess thatthat there issome one else ah ejaculated walford between his set teeth i suspected as much and i can form a pretty shrewd guess as to who it is too it is that sneaking rascal leicester is it not how dare you sir speak to me of my friends in that manner exclaimed lucy rising to her feet and stamping upon the ground in the excess of her indignation go sir and never come near me again i will never speak another word to you you wont eh was the sneering retort all right i will go and ill not come near you again but ill make you bitterly repent of your treatment of me yet or my name is not edward walford and rising to his feet he walked rapidly up the garden through the house and straight out at the front door without so much as pausing to bid his aunt goodbye chapter two captain leicester hears bad news in the meantime the industry having come to an anchor in portsmouth harbour captain leicester waiting only to see the sails properly furled jumped into the boat and hurried away to his owners residence here he was detained for more than an hour the individual he was desirous of seeing happening to be absent but expected back immediately according to the statement of the solitary clerk who occupied the little front room which did duty as an office the owner of the industry having at length turned up her captain was instructed to haul alongside the wharf forthwith in readiness to begin discharging her cargo the first thing next morning so george leicester greatly to his disappointment had to return on board once more and it was not until the clocks were striking seven that the schooner having been duly hauled alongside the wharf and securely moored thereto her commander felt himself at liberty to leave her and set out upon a pilgrimage to alverstoke but for the delay thus occasioned the events herein recorded would probably never have occurred those of them at least which chiefly concern captain leicester let us take a good look at our hero as he stands for a moment in the golden evening light on the planks of the wooden structure which supported by ricketty wormeaten piles does duty as a wharf like a thorough seaman as he is he is taking a last glance at the schooner before he leaves her to see that everything is thoroughly shipshape and bristolfashion on board her she is a small and somewhat insignificant craft but as george has sailed in her for the last four years of his lifetwo years as mate and two more as masterhe has become attached to her looking at her faults with a lenient eye and striving to conceal them as much as possible from others as he stands with his hands lightly crossed behind him his legs a trifle apart and his eye wandering critically over the industrys hull and rigging we see him to be a man of about five feet eight inches in height with a wellknit figure regular features dark hair and eyes the former surmounted by a jaunty crimson worsted cap with a silk tassel on its drooping end and tied into a queue behind with a bow of very broad black silk ribbon short black whiskers on each side of his face with a cleanshaven upper lip and chin he is clad in a wideskirted coat of fine blue cloth trimmed with large gilt buttons and worn open to show the kerseymere waistcoat beneath the long flaps of which are confined by a broad belt he wears a white silk kerchief round his throat lace ruffles at his wrists in honour of his projected visit to his ladylove and his nether man is encased in kneebreeches white stockings and shoes with large silver buckles there is a frank pleasant look in the keen dark eyes and an expression of firmness about the closed lips which makes most people feel when they look at him that they would much rather have him for a friend than for an enemy altogether as far as physique is concerned he certainly has the advantage of lieutenant walford as to the comparative moral qualities of the two men the reader will have abundant opportunity to judge for himor herself unfortunately however for his own and lucy walfords peace of mind george leicester is not only unaware of this superiority on his own part but he strongly suspects it to be all on the other side he has made walfords acquaintance having met him perhaps some half a dozen times in all at sea view and despite his simplicity he has had no difficulty in recognising in the lieutenant a wouldbe rival and this is just where his own modesty and selfdepreciation have played him a scurvy trick he has noted walfords easy nonchalant bearing and his two or three flashy accomplishments he has noticed too that the lieutenant is not altogether devoid of good looks and has jumpedall too hastily as we are awareat the conclusion that where a woman is concerned a plain straightforward honest sailor can have no chance against a dashing soldier like the lieutenant at the same time he has by no means given up the chase nor ever will so he tells himself as long as lucy is free over and over again has he been upon the point of speaking out and learning his fate and over and over again has he hesitated and closed his lips deeming the occasion unpropitious or fearing to learn that which will make the remainder of his life a blank to him but now he has resolved to delay no longer he has been screwing up his courage to the stickingplace during the whole of the passage from waterford to gosport and when he stepped from the rail of the industry on to the wharf he was on his way to alverstoke to learn his fate satisfied at last that everything was right on board the schooner leicester turned away and directed his steps up high street and thence out on to the stoke road alverstoke churchclock struck eight just as he came in sight of it and the next moment he saw far ahead of him a man dart round the corner and come swinging along the road towards him at a tremendous pace distant as the man was captain leicester had no difficulty in recognising in him his dreaded rival lieutenant walford he guessed at once that the lieutenant had been visiting at sea view but what struck him as strange was that walfords appearance and bearing was that of a man in a towering passion almost immediately afterwards however he decided that he must have been mistaken in supposing this for as walford looked up and recognised him he stopped dead in the road for a moment and then hurried towards the skipper with outstretched hand and a beaming face my dear leicester how are you walford exclaimed with effusion as he grasped the seamans hand and wrung it heartily how glad i am to see you when did you arrive this afternoon only was the answer have you been to sea view lately there is nothing wrong there i hope wrong my dear fellow no why do you ask well when you rounded the corner just now you were walking at such a terrific pace and looked so much as though you were greatly upset about something that i feared there had been an accident at sea view and that that i was hurrying off for the nearest doctor eh well you may set your mind at rest my dear boy nothing is the matter i have just left mrs walfords and both she and lucy are in excellent health i am glad to say it is deuced kind of you though to take such a warm interest in them and i thank you for it with all my heart you are a prime favourite there i can tell you my lad i have been frightfully jealous of you for a long time but now i shall never be so any more lucydarling girl that she ishas had pity upon me at last and has condescended to set all my fears at rest so you may congratulate me if you like upon her havingaccepted you asasher future husband gasped leicester white to the very lips exactly i knew you would be glad to hear it being an old friend of hers was the reply but mums the word for the present our regiment is ordered away to the west indies at once so lucy wishes the engagement to be kept secret until i can return home to claim her well i must be off you are going to sea view i suppose dont mention our conversation there please i should not like lucy to know that i have already been prating of the engagement if she feels inclined to tell you of it herself of course that is another thing all right ill not say a word about it you may rest assured answered leicester as he suffered his hand to be clasped in farewell in fact i dont suppose i shall have an opportunity to mention it to them i am not going to call there tonight and i may not have time to call there at all as i shall be very busy during the next few days ii amthinking of giving up the industry and goingsomewhere abroad myself are you ejaculated walford with great heartiness well done i am glad to hear you say so a fellow with your pluck and sinews was never intended to potter about in a trumpery little coaster well goodbye the two men separated walford to chuckle and exult over the complete success of his suddenly planned ruse and leicester with all hope and brightness gone out of his face to saunter despondently along the road and back to gosport by way of haslar common avoiding sea view altogether so lucy was lost to him well after all it was no more than he had dreaded all along he had been a fool and worse than a fool to suppose that he a plain unpolished seaman could possibly have a chance of success when pitted against a fellow like walfordcurse him nono not that he did not mean that why should he curse the man to whom lucy had given her young fresh love still it was very hard to bearvery hard he hoped the fellow would treat her well if not let him look to himself but why should not walford treat her well who could do otherwise who was there in the whole wide world who could find it in his heart to be anything but kind and loving and tender to her and yetpsha who was hegeorge leicesterthat he should judge another man true he had heard some very queer stories about this same lieutenant walford but doubtless they were all fabrications lucy was not the girl to love a man of whom such things could possibly be true and as to his leicesters own feelings of distrust and dislike why they were after all only the natural outcome of his jealousy and were certainly not to be relied upon as indicating faultiness of character in his successful rival still argue as he would he had his doubts and he could not dispel them andwell it was a hard blow coming so suddenly too it was difficult to bear it patiently even now and he had a shrewd suspicion that it would be still more difficult to bear byandby when he fully realised the extent of his loss but it was no use fretting over it the question was what was now to be done he could not possibly live on the old humdrum life any longer he must have excitement and activity plenty of both to keep his mind occupied and to prevent his fretting over his disappointment yes that was a happy inspiration which had led him to tell walford he intended giving up the industry that must be his first act and after that well after that he would look about him and if he could pick up a tidy little vessel cheap he would invest his savings in the purchase of her sail in his own employ and try to stifle all vain regrets by plunging into a more adventurous mode of existence so ran george leicesters thoughts as he made his way back to the industry meanwhile lucy having given one lover his conge waited with loving impatience but in vain for the appearance of the other on the following day the master of the industry waited upon his owner a mr winter and requested his discharge mr winter was both surprised and chagrined at the news that he was to lose so welltried and faithful a servant as george but finding our hero inflexible in his resolution he could of course do nothing but accede to his request which he did at last with a very good grace and now said mr winter when the accounts had all been gone through and squared up since you are quite determined to go your own wilful way i suppose i must do what i can to help you you will go to london of course to look out for this ship that you propose to purchase and i will give you a letter to a mr roberts a shipbroker and a friend of mine who has an office in great saint helens he is pretty sure to have or to know of something which will suit you he is a thoroughly straightforward honourable man will do his best to suit you and will charge you nothing the seller is the man who will have to pay him his commission george duly thanked mr winter for his kindness received the letter and on the following morning crossed over to portsmouth and booked himself to london on the highflyer coach the next day found our hero at an early hour in leadenhall street seeking for the whereabouts of great saint helens a clerk going in that direction on his way to business pointed out the place and turning into the narrow court george soon found the office of which he was in search mr roberts was busy perusing a large pile of papers when his visitor was shown in and he begged to be excused for a moment whilst he completed his task this was soon done whereupon mr roberts rang two distinct strokes upon a small handbell and a clerk entered in response here wilson said the shipbroker handing over the pile of papers take these you will find from the notes i have jotted down upon this sheet of paper what to do with them now sir turning to george what can i have the pleasure of doing for you george briefly explained his business and handed over mr winters letter of introduction which mr roberts rapidly glanced through then the little bell was struck once and another and much more substantiallooking clerk made his appearance bring me list a if you please said mr roberts list a a large leatherbound volume was brought in and laid upon the table before the shipbroker who at once opened it and began to run his fingers slowly down an index then he rapidly turned up an entry in the book itself and read out challengerbrig tons softwood built ironfastened sheathed with zinc nine years old well found in sails groundtackle and all necessary stores ready for sea price pounds how will that do she is really a very decent vessel of her kind and exceedingly cheap at the price we might take a look at her remarked george but her description does not sound very inviting another reference to the index another turning up of an entry and well what do you think of this lucybrigantine tons oakbuilt coppered and copperfastened throughout has only been to sea twice excellent seaboat very fast and weatherly fully found in every respect and quite ready for sea price pounds that sounds very much better answered leicester who to tell the truth was almost as much taken with the name as anything else but i dont particularly admire the rig umph ejaculated mr roberts pursing up his lips and referring to the index once more um um maid of the mistlizziehighland lassenterpriseah yes perhaps this will do enterprise brig seven years old oakbuilt ironfastened tons register will carry tons deadweight well found price pounds requires a few trifling repairs amounting to possibly pounds how does that strike you not very favourably was the reply well lets try again remarked the shipbroker i know i can suit you another reference to the index then a sudden sharp closing of the book with the muttered ejaculation the very thing what a donkey i am not to have thought of her before then a single stroke on the bell followed by the reappearance of the substantiallooking clerk bring me in the inventory of the aurora if you please that paper that was left here by mr sutton yesterday the document was brought in and mr roberts at once handed it over to his client with the remark there my dear sir just run your eye over that if the aurora wont suit you nothing will she is a capital little ship i know her well her owner poor fellowwho is captain of her alsohad the misfortune to lose his wife last voyagewashed overboard somehow in a gale of windand it has so upset him that he has resolved to cut the sea altogether and everything connected with it he is even willing to sell at a great sacrifice so as to get rid of the ship as soon as possible great bargain captain most extraordinary bargain never get another such a chance that looks much more promising said george returning the paper where is she and when can i see her london dockssee her in an hourill take you down on board at once was the reply and merely stopping to change his coat and give some instructions to his clerks mr roberts invited george to follow him and getting into the street they hailed the first hackneycoach which passed and in a few minutes were jolting along on their way to the london docks dismissing the coach at the dock gates mr roberts inquired of the gatekeeper where the aurora was to be found inside ship fourth berth north side answered the man pointing out the direction they were to take they soon found the vessel and george standing on the edge of the dock wall saw before him a pretty little barque of some four hundred and odd tons copperbottomed with a flush deck fore and aft a fine set of spars and such a shapely hull as set his eyes glistening he walked away from her and knelt down so as to take a good look at her run then went ahead of her to see what her bows were like and finally very much prepossessed in her favour already went on board accompanied by mr roberts here they were received by the shipkeeper who at once led the way into the cabin this proved to be an exceedingly snug and comfortable apartment not very large yet roomy enough and very tastefully fitted up abaft this they found the captains cabin a room some twelve feet long and the entire width of the ship well lightedthere being both a skylight and sternportsand fitted up in a style which gave unmistakable evidence of the refined taste of the former captains poor drowned wife from the cabin they proceeded to the forecastle and from thence into the hold george all the time peering about everywhere for signs of weakness or bad workmanship without finding any having at length satisfied himself as to the soundness of the hull he went aloft and gave to the spars and rigging a careful examination here too everything was perfectly satisfactory and when he at length stepped down out of the rigging on to the deck he nodded approvingly to mr roberts and said all right ill take her glad to hear you say so captain was the cheery reply she is a capital little craft and im sure youll like her nowas it is nearly two oclockwhat say you will you come and take dinner with me leicester acquiescing they made the best of their way to the eatinghouse which mr roberts patronised and while discussing the meal made arrangements for the completion of the purchase the meal ended george wended his way back toward the dock and turning into nightingale lane established himself in tolerably comfortable quarters in a boardinghouse kept by a widow whose husband had been what she called a seacaptain on the following day captain leicester paid over the full amount of the purchasemoney receiving in return the ships register properly endorsed and that same evening he found himself the undisputed owner of the aurora his next task was to secure a freight this he had no difficulty in doingin fact he had his choice of some half a dozenand by noon he had accepted a charter for the conveyance of a general cargo to kingston jamaica to commence loading at once having completed the business he hurried away to the shippingoffice and was fortunate enough to secure the services of a very promisinglooking mate who undertook to establish himself on board forthwith so as to be on the spot in readiness to receive the cargo as it came down to the ship george now found himself comparatively at leisure and he had at one time serious thoughts of running down to gosport were it only for a day just to see lucy once more and bid her goodbye well would it have been for both of them had he done so but on reconsidering the matter he arrived at the conclusion that no good could possibly come of any such proceeding whilst the sight of lucy would only too certainly increase the pangs of regret he already so keenly felt at his failure to win her so he eventually decided to remain where he was and occupy himself in watching the stowage of the cargo chapter three a capture and a recapture a fortnight from the day on which captain leicester signed the charterparty saw the last package passed into the auroras hold and on the following day she sailed for plymouth there to join a fleet of merchantships which were to cross the atlantic under convoy thanks principally to the exertions of his chief mate mr bowen george was fortunate enough to pick up a very good crew comprising a second matewho acted also as boatswaina carpenter a steward a black cook two ableseamen four ordinary ditto and two wellgrown lads who had already been a voyage or two in a coaster this constituted a complement of fourteen men all told just sufficient to handle the barque comfortably they sailed from the thames with the wind at about west and had a capital run as far as the south foreland the aurora showing herself to be such a smart vessel under her canvas that her commander was delighted with her at this point however the wind which still held from the westward was dead against them and it became a question whether they should anchor in the downs to await a favourable change or continue on and endeavour to beat a passage as far as plymouth prudence dictated the adoption of the former course it being well known that the channel was just then swarming with french privateerspowerful luggers for the most partthe captains of which had an unpleasant habit of slipping out of harbour as the evening came on and stretching across toward the english coast on the lookout for our merchantmen very often picking up a valuable prize and getting back into port the next morning the weather too happened just then to be highly favourable for the operations of these gentry the sky being overcast with frequent showers and no moon on the other hand however time was of the utmost importance george had only five days left him in which to reach plymouth if he was to avail himself of the protection of convoy so after discussing the question with mr bowen and carefully weighing it in his own mind he finally decided to keep the ship moving and to trust to fortune and a good lookout the aurora accordingly proceeded stretching over as far as midchannel when she went about and on drawing in with the land again leicester had the satisfaction of seeing that she would handsomely weather beachy head which she did tacking close in under the land about breakfasttime on the day following her departure from london at pm being at the time rather nearer to the french than to the english coast george tacked again in order to close the english shore toward nightfall at pm being abreast of littlehampton and about eight miles off the shore the aurora went about once more and stood over towards france closehauled on the starboard tack the weather had cleared somewhat the sun breaking through the clouds as the afternoon wore on and flooding the whole western sky with splendour as he sank to rest one by one as the golden glory of the west faded into sober grey the stars shone out peeping shyly down upon the world from the softly dappled sky and there was every prospect of its being a fine night in the channel george accordingly gave instructions for the ship to continue on the same tack until midnight when she was to be hove about once more then cautioning the second matewho was in charge of the deckto maintain a strict lookout and to call him in the event of a change of weather or the appearance of a suspiciouslooking sail in their neighbourhood he went below to snatch an hour or two of sleep having had none so far from the moment of the vessels sailing flinging off his clothes he threw himself into his swinging cot and instantly sank into a sound and dreamless slumber to be awakened again with a start and almost instantly as it seemed to him by the flapping of the ships canvas in the wind starting up into a sitting posture he heard the voice of the chief mate on deck giving the necessary orders for tacking ship hillo he thought what is the meaning of this nothing wrong i hope no that cannot be or they would surely have called me perhaps it is a change of wind i hope it is well being awake i may as well slip on deck and satisfy myself as to the meaning of it he accordingly sprang out of his cot and began to dress himself the sounds on deck having meanwhile ceased save for the monotonous tread overhead of the officer of the watch and the occasional clank of the wheelchains the ship was heeling over to starboard showing that she was on the port tack and the rushing sound of the water along her sides seemed to indicate that she was moving pretty rapidly through it as he opened his stateroom door to pass into the main cabin a heavy step was heard descending the companionladder and the next moment the second mate appeared at its foot in the act of turning into his own stateroom well mr cross said the skipper what is the news from the deck you have tacked ship it seems is there a change of wind no sir answered cross the wind still holds steady at about west though it seems a little inclined to back half a point or so to the southard and its clouded over again and gone very dark we tacked at midnight sir according to your orders midnight ejaculated george you surely do not mean to say it is midnight already cross about a quarter after it sir answered the second mate with a smile youve slept sound sir i expect and time has travelled fast with you i must have slept sound indeed answered the skipper to me it seemed that i had hardly fallen asleep when i was awakened by the flapping of the canvas well ill not keep you from your bunk i shall go on deck and take a look round before i turn in again goodnight goodnight sir was the reply and the second mate opened the door of his berth and passed in whilst george sprang lightly up the companionladder and stepped out on deck it was indeed as the second mate had said very dark so much so that the skipper having just left the cabin where a lamp was dimly burning was unable to see anything for a moment or two then as his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he caught first a glimpse of the man at the wheel his form faintly illuminated by the binnacle light then the figure of the mate just turning near the taffrail to walk forward and finally the dark shadowy pile of canvas towering away aloft until it melted into the general obscurity it has gone very dark again mr bowen remarked the skipper as the mate becoming aware of georges presence on deck joined him it is dark sir answered the mate almost too dark to be poking about here in the channel without lights it is rather risky i admit returned george still i do not think it is so dangerous as showing our lights that would simply be hanging out an invitation to those prowling french privateers to pounce down on us how is her headto the man at the wheel george and the mate having by this time strolled aft together noth half west sir was the reply come that is not so bad remarked george we shall fetch plymouth yet in good time to join the convoy if all be a sail broad on the weather bow broke in the lookout forward with startling abruptness both george and the mate instantly directed their gaze in the direction indicated by the lookout and presently a shapeless something like a blacker patch against the black background of the darkness loomed into view about one point before the beam showing by this rapid change in the respective positions of the two ships how near was the stranger why exclaimed leicester he is coming right down for us he will be into us port port hard up with your helm smartly my lad to the man at the wheel ship ahoy port your helm can you not see us ay ay oh yesh was the response from the other vessel and as it came floating down upon the wind the stranger took a broad sheer to port showing herself to be a large lugger and shot very neatly alongside the aurora the grapplingirons being cleverly hove into the barques fore and mainrigging as the two vessels touched at the same moment some fiveandtwenty frenchmen armed with cutlass and pistol scrambled alertly in over the auroras bulwarks the leader singling out george notwithstanding the darkness and exclaiming as he promptly presented a pistol at his head vat cheep dis is eh the aurora of london was the answer tres bien my cheep the belle marie est un corsaire francais unvat you callprivateere et vous etes mes prisonniers it is ze fortune of war messieurs my turn tonightyours tomorrow perhapsha ha now my dear sares as there not moosh time is permettez moi and he flung open the companiondoors motioning significantly to george and the mate to go below poor george glanced swiftly round the deck only to see that it was in complete possession of the frenchmen one of whom was already at the wheel so turning to mr bowen and murmuring there is no help for it i suppose he signed to the mate to lead the way and then followed dejectedly the doors being smartly slammedto after them and the next moment they heard the sound of some heavy body being dragged up to and banged against the companion entrance thus precluding the possibility of their stealing on deck again and effecting a counter surprise the whole thing had been done so rapidly that it was not until he found the ship being once more hove about with her head pointing toward the french coast that captain leicester fully realised his situation in less than ten minutes his ship had been taken from him and himself confined in his own cabin a prisoner had he not been on deck at the time of the occurrence he would certainly have considered it an avoidable misfortune to be accounted for only by the most gross carelessness but as it was he was fully able to understand that it was entirely due to the extreme darkness of the night and the circumstance of the lugger and the barque stumbling over each other as it were but that made matters no better for him he had lost his shiphis alland now there loomed before him the immediate prospect of a dreary confinementfor many years perhapsin a french prison the thought goaded him almost to madness and he sprang impatiently to his feet and began to pace moodily to and fro over the narrow limits of the cabin floor meanwhile the second matewho had started out of his berth at the first shock of contact between the two vessels and had made a rush for the deck only to be confronted and driven back by a frenchman with a drawn cutlasswas seated on the lockers alongside mr bowen listening to that individuals gloomy recital of the details of the capture the low murmur of the two mens voices annoyed george in his then irritable frame of mind and to avoid it he retired into his own stateroom the night being close and sultry all the sternports were open and as he entered the cabin the sound of a hail from to leeward came floating in through the ports it was answered from the deck and kneeling upon the sofalocker and thrusting his body well out of the port the skipper became aware that the lugger was parting company and that the hail he had heard was the voice of the french captain shouting his parting instructions to the officer he had left in charge of the prize looking away to leeward in the direction from which the sounds had come he was just able to distinguish the dark outline of the lugger as she bore up and pursued her way once more to the eastward after this a considerable amount of excited jabbering took place on deck the word cherbourg being so often repeated that george had no doubt it was to that port that the barque was to be taken but in about half an hour all this died away and perfect silence reigned on board once more from the moment that the lugger parted company a confused idea as to the possibility of retaking the barque had been gradually attaining definite shape in georges mind it was rather a desperate attempt to make it is true with himself and the two mates shut up there in the cabin aft while the crew were doubtless confined in the forecastle and with no possibility of effecting a junction with them still if bowen and cross were willing to run the risk of assisting him it might be worth while to try it thinking thus he drew his head inside the sternport and made his way back into the main cabin where he found the two mates with their arms crossed upon their chests and their heads bowed upon their breasts asleep giving them a gentle shake apiece to arouse them he sat down beside them and asked them bluntly if they felt disposed to run a little risk in an attempt to retake the barque and so avoid a french prison you may reckon on me for one sir if youve hit upon anything likely in the shape of a plan heartily answered the chief mate and cross here i know wont hold back either unless im greatly mistaken in him never fear said cross if you give the word sir and the ship is to be retook well have her but how do you propose to do ititll have to be a surprise i spose listen said george what i propose is this the sternports are all open and i believe that by assisting each other we may manage to creep out through them on to the mainbrace boomiron and thence make our way along the ships side outside the bulwarks forward when by watching our opportunity we may possibly manage to overpower the guard on the forecastle throw off the hatch and release our own lads and then we must just make a fight for it we may perhapswe threemanage to take along with us a cutlass and a brace of pistols each but the men must do the best they can with handspikes belayingpins and in short anything they can lay their hands upon a very promising plan indeed sir answered the chief mate the next question is when are we to set about it the sooner the better answered george so go at once please for your pistols load them carefully take a cutlass each from the rack and then we will proceed to business in a very few minutes the trio were ready going softly into georges stateroom they paused for a minute or two to listen for any sounds which might furnish them with a clue to the condition of affairs on deck but nothing was to be heard save the occasional clank of the wheelchains and the low humming of a song by the helmsman it is all curiously quiet on deck whispered george to his two companions i cant quite make it out it undoubtedly means one of two things howevereither they are keeping a very strict and careful watch or none at all we shall soon see which now cross stand by to give me a hoist if i seem to require it i will go first and as soon as i am fairly out of the way mr bowen can follow kicking off his boots and stockings the skipper thereupon without further ado mounted the lockers and passing his body cautiously out of the weathermost sternport held on by the edge of the port with one hand whilst he reached out and felt for the braceiron with the other this he soon found and grasping it firmly with his right hand began to work himself cautiously towards it the task he had set himself proved however to be much more difficult than he had expected the rake of the ships stern so greatly interfering with his freedom of motion that at first he feared he would be obliged to abandon the attempt altogether as he foresaw that the moment he released his hold upon the edge of the port he must infallibly swing off backwards and unless he could manage to retain his grasp of the iron drop overboard so he slipped in through the port again to explain this difficulty to the mates and to caution them to be careful when it came to their turn and then resumed his attempt once more securing a firm grasp upon the braceiron he watched the roll of the ship and seizing the first favourable opportunity boldly swung himself off into the air where he hung suspended by one arm with his feet almost touching the water in another moment he had both hands upon the iron and giving himself a vigorous upward swing he was soon able to throw his feet over the tautlystrained mainbrace to scramble up and place himself astride the braceblock was now an easy task and settling himself firmly there he prepared to assist the chief mate when he should make his appearance he had not long to wait hardly was he comfortably established in his comparatively safe position when a hand appeared from behind the quarterpiece in search of the iron george promptly seized and guided it to the object of its search then firmly grasped the wrist with one hand keeping the other ready to render further assistance look out sir im coming he heard the chief mate mutter and then with a tremendous swing mr bowens body came into view quick as thought george leaned over and caught the disengaged hand placed it too upon the iron and then rising to his feet and exerting his strength to the utmost he proceeded to drag his chief mate up alongside himself now he whispered as soon as he had got him there i shall begin to work my way forward at once so as to be out of your way but you had better stay and lend cross a hand i shall wait for you both in the forechains so saying he stepped off the braceiron planting his feet firmly on the broad beading which ran along the top edge of the sheerstrake and leaning his body against the bulwarks whilst he grasped the outer edge of the rail to steady himself he speedily and easily reached the mizzenchains here availing himself of the partial shelter and cover afforded by the lanyards and deadeyes of the rigging he cautiously raised his head above the level of the bulwarks to survey the state of the deck inboard the first object which met his view was the figure of the helmsman rendered visible by the light of the binnaclelamps as they beamed dimly out upon him and feebly lighted up his figure he was leaning negligently against the wheel with one arm thrown carelessly over it and his eyes were vacantly fixed upon the cloudy heavens above him with his thoughts evidently far away not another soul was visible either forward or aft but george thought he could make out the indistinct outline of something resembling a human figure seated on the bench to windward of the cabin companion he continued so long his earnest gaze upon this object that he was quite startled to find his first and second mates beside him and he came at last to the conclusion that if it were indeed a human figure at all it must be that of the prizemastersound asleep turning his glances from this object forward he saw that the galleydoor to windward was shut whilst on the leeside it was open the reflection of a light inside shining pretty strongly upon the lee bulwarks and showing the shadows of men evidently in the act of eating and drinking do you see that whispered george to his two companions nothing could possibly be more favourable to our plans we will work our way forward as far as the mainrigging when i think we may venture to slip over the bulwarks and in on deck then we must creep very cautiously forward find out the whereabouts of the watchman or lookout or whatever he is and overpower him if possible without raising an alarm that done we will set free our own lads and i have no fear whatever as to the result the three adventurers then moved noiselessly forward until they came to the mainrigging when they slipped in on deck and crouching low in the deep shadow of the weather bulwarks crept along until they were within a dozen feet of the forescuttle here they paused and began to peer anxiously about for the man they expected to find on watch on the forecastle there he is just forward of the cathead whispered the second mate and hastily snatching a heavy iron belayingpin from the rail he stole crouching and noiseless as a cat upon his unconscious enemy six seconds later a dull heavy blow was heard followed by a faint groan the dark object near the cathead vanished and cross returning to the skippers side whispered hes all right knocked the senses clean out of him and then laid him quietly out on deck i reckon he wont come to hisself again for the next halfhour now whats the next move capn the next thing answered george is to open the forescuttle and quietly get our own lads on deck i am surprised that they have not attempted to steal up of their own accord before this on going to the forecastle hatch however they soon discovered the reason why the men were content to remain so quietly below a large mooring hawser having been coiled down on the top of the hatch thus effectually preventing the imprisoned men from raising it we shall never be able to move this without giving the alarm said george we must contrive somehow to shut those fellows up in the galley and keep them there that is easily done whispered the chief mate cookey has a lot of firewood stowed away in the eyes of the longboat we must get hold of a piece cut half a dozen wedges from it and one of us must then slideto the door on the leeside and wedge it tight with three of the wedges whilst another of us at the same time wedges up the door to windward he then glided away to the longboat and soon returned with a small piece of wood in his hand here we are he whispered now well soon have them boxed up so tight that they wont get out until we open the doors for em whilst speaking he had produced his knife from his pocket and notwithstanding the intense darkness soon hacked out the halfdozen wedges which though very roughly shaped were still good enough for the purpose now sir said he in a low tone to george you take these three let cross go with you and slideto the leedoor with a slam and then you slip in the wedges and jam them tight home while i will do the same to windard as soon as i hear cross close the leedoor george took the wedges and accompanied by cross crept noiselessly up to the galleydoor to leeward mr bowen meanwhile making his way to the corresponding door on the weather side there was a loud slam a moment of silence then a tremendous outcry accompanied by the sound of heavy battering from inside the galley and the three adventurers met again at the forecastle hatch now then cried george we havent a moment to lose so let us capsize the hawser bodily are you ready then onetwothree heave by exerting their whole strength to the utmost the heavy hawser was rolled off the hatch and the hatch itself raised just as two figures came rushing forward from the quarterdeck with loud and angry outcries tumble up my lads shouted george down the scuttle tumble up smartly and help us to retake the ship ay ay sir was the eager answer from below and then the skipper drawing his cutlass and pistol turned to meet the prizemaster and the helmsman who had both hurried forward to learn the meaning of the disturbance in the galley surrender or you are a dead man exclaimed george thrusting the muzzle of his pistol into the face of the as yet only halfawake prizemaster oui oui msieu oh yais i surrendaire exclaimed the poor fellow as he felt the firm pressure of the cold pistolbarrel against his forehead and hastily unbuckling his cutlass he thrust it into georges hand the chief mate in the meantime had incontinently felled the other man to the deck with a single blow from his fist and had then left cross to secure him with a ropes end the barques crew had meanwhile made their way on deck and were now clustered about their officers anxious to know what they were to do whilst the aurora left to herself had shot up into the winds eye and was now lying stationary with all her square canvas aback and the rest of her sails fluttering loudly in the wind one hand to the wheel and jam it hard up commanded george the rest of you to your stations mr bowen and mr cross you will mount guard over the galleydoors if you please until we have got the ship round raise tacks and sheets round with the mainyard and flatten in forward well there with the mainbraces now swing your foreyard board the fore and maintacks and haul over the headsheets right your helm my lad give her a spoke or two if you find she wants it as she gathers way and then keep her full and by now lads never mind about coiling up just now you can do that after we have attended to the prisoners come forward and open the weather galleydoor and as the frenchmen pass out seize them and lash their hands and heels together these orders were promptly executed the discomfited frenchmen being permitted to pass out of the galley only one at a time crosss burly form drawn cutlass and conspicuously displayed pistol supported by the appearance of the barques crew in his immediate background proving an effectual deterrent to any attempt on the part of the privateersmen to make a rush for freedom and in something like a couple of hours from the time of her capture the aurora was once more in the undisputed possession of her rightful owner chapter four the departure of the convoy about daybreak the wind veered round and blew a fine fresh steady breeze from the northward enabling the barque to lay her course with flowing sheets and sunset found her safely anchored in plymouth sound one of a fleet of nearly two hundred merchantmen which had assembled there for the purpose of being convoyed across the atlantic the convoy was to sail on the following day but one the menowar which constituted their escort were already in the sound along with several other ships of the royal navy and as the cable smoked out through the auroras hawsepipe that evening when she dropped her anchor george fondly hoped his troubles were at an end but he was mistaken as soon as the canvas was furled captain leicester manned a boat and proceeding on board the admirals ship reported the circumstance of the capture and recapture of his vessel requesting at the same time to be relieved as soon as possible of the custody of his prisoners this was speedily arranged by the admirals orders an armed boats crew was at once despatched to the aurora the prisoners were released from their bonds passed into the manowars boat and in little more than an hour from their arrival in the sound safely lodged on board a prisonhulk so far so good but george had yet to learn that there was one inconvenient result generally attendant upon a request to a manowar for assistance the boat after conveying the frenchmen to the prisonhulk duly returned to the admirals ship but instead of the crew at once passing out of her they were ordered to remain where they were the lieutenant in charge alone going on deck and holding a short conference with the captain after which he reentered the boat and she proceeded once more alongside the aurora george saw her coming and wondered what could possibly be her errand he was not left long in doubt i am very sorry to trouble you remarked the lieutenant as he encountered george at the gangway whither the latter had repaired to meet him but i must ask you to kindly muster your men george knew only too well then what this visit boded but he was quite helpless so putting the best face he could upon the matter he answered as cheerfully as he could and directed that all hands should be summoned on deck i hope however he remarked to the officer that you will not deprive me of any of my crew i have shipped only just sufficient men to handle her and i assure you that even with the fine weather we have had in our trip down channel i have found that we have not a hand too many for the efficient management of the ship ah yes answered the lieutenant with a laugh all you merchantskippers tell the same story but we shall seewe shall see they must be exceptionally good men however or you would never have succeeded in recovering possession of your ship ah here they are and a fine smart crew they look too upon my word i must congratulate you mrauma upon your good luck in securing so many fine fellows why they look capable of taking care of a ship twice your size i really must relieve you of one or two of them it would be nothing short of treason to his most gracious majesty to allow you to keep them all when the navy is in such urgent want of men the crew were by this time assembled on deck and a very disconcerted and disgustedlooking set of men they were they had submitted to weeks of voluntary imprisonment in crimps houses for the sole purpose of escaping impressment into the navy and now when their voyage had actually begun here was a manowars boat alongside to force them into the service they regarded with so great an abhorrence no wonder that they looked and felt disgusted the men were drawn up in line along the deck in single file and the lieutenant sauntered leisurely along the line critically examining each man as he came to him but without as george had anticipated ordering any of them into the boat alongside at length he reached the last individual in the line one of the lads and leicester was beginning to breathe freely once more hoping that he was after all not to be robbed of any of his crew when the officer returned to the head of the line and touching the second mate lightly on the chest with his finger said you were evidently born to become a manowars man my fine fellow get your traps together and pass them and yourself into the boat alongside as soon as you have received your wages excuse me said george i really must ask you not to take that man he is my second mate your second mate exclaimed the officer with wellfeigned astonishment you surely do not mean to say you carry a second mate on board such a cockboat as this certainly i do retorted george somewhat tartly why not pray simply my good man because such an individual is wholly unnecessary you can take charge of one watch yourself you know and your mate will of course command the other so that you can have no possible use for a second mate why a smart active young fellow like you ought to be ashamed of such an act of laziness as the carrying of a second mate pay the man his wages if you please and let him pass into the boat i owe him no wages answered george on the contrary heand every other man of the crew for that matterhas drawn a months advance and owes me three weeks service yet before we shall be square who is to reimburse me for that loss i am sorry to say i am quite unable to answer that question was the reply but giving itmind you strictly as my private opinioni am afraid you will have to suffer the loss for my part i have never been able to understand why you masters of merchantmen will persist in so risky a policy as the payment of a months wages in advance when you can never tell what may occur to prevent the men from working out their time but this is not business i must bear a hand and finish my work or i shall get severely rapped over the knuckles then turning once more to the men he ordered the carpenter to get his things ready and go into the boat no said george by this time thoroughly exasperated that i will not permit this man is the ships carpenter and i forbid you sir to impress him at your peril you forbid eh said the lieutenant turning angrily upon george take care what you are saying my fine fellow or i may perhaps find ways and means of impressing you before you sail then suddenly realising that he had allowed his temper to outrun his discretion he added in a conciliatory tone well since you say that this man is the carpenter i will spare him but you should have explained that fact to me at first and as to impressing you why i daresay you know the old joke about impressing a shipmaster and will understand i was only jesting you are a capital fellow and have behaved very well over this business so i will let you off as easily as i can but of course i must do my duty and take another man or two from you if i did not some of the other ships would be sending on board you and leaving you really shorthanded with that he picked out with unerring eye the two ableseamen and then turning to george with a great show of generous forbearance announced that he would leave him all the rest though he could hardly reconcile it to his conscience to go away with only three men out of so strong and smart a crew as that belonging to the aurora cross was by this time with his chest on deck the other two impressed men soon followed and the disconsolate trio passed down the ships side in moody silence unmoved alike by the commiserating looks of their late shipmates or the jocular and more than halfironical congratulations of the manowars men in the boat upon their entry into so promising a service as that of the british navy on the departure of the boat george held a short consultation with mr bowen the result of which was a very wise determination to grin and bear it rather than risk fresh annoyance by an effortwhich he very strongly suspected would be utterly uselessto obtain redress and the restitution of his men this determination come to the carpenter was summoned aft and installed into the duties and the berth of the unfortunate cross george thus finding his crew reduced to three men the officers included and one lad in each watch the cook and steward of course being idlers and their services in the working of the ship only to be demanded on occasions of exceptional urgency on the day but one following that of the impressment of the auroras men a gun was fired at sunrise by the commodore bluepeter was hoisted at the foreroyalmastheads and the foretopsails were loosed on board the ships of the convoying squadron and the still morning air immediately began to resound with the songs of seamen and the clanking of windlasspawls as the fleet of merchantmen constituting the convoy began to get under weigh there was a considerable amount of emulation displayed among the merchantskippersthose of them at least whose ships or crews had any pretensions to smartness and in half an hour a good many of the craft were under weigh and standing out to sea with a light air of wind from the eastward the old tremendous led the van closely followed by the torpid while the frigates andromeda and vixen each of guns assisted by the dasher grampus throstle and mallard gunbrigs cruised round and round the laggards making signals firing guns and generally creating a great deal of fuss noise and excitement the leading portion of the fleet was hoveto hulldown at sea before the last craft in the convoy had succeeded in getting her anchor and making a start but by noon the whole of the fleet was fairly in the channel when the tremendous made the signal to fill and away they all went bowling along to the southward and westward the dull sailers under every rag they could spread to the windnow settled into a fine steady royalbreeze from eastsoutheast while the smarter craft were compelled to show only such a spread of canvas as would enable the dullards to keep pace with them the tremendous and torpid under doublereefed topsails led the way about two miles apart the frigates were posted one to windward and one to leeward of the merchantfleet and the brigs brought up the rear it being their duty to whipin the stragglers urge on the slowcoaches and keep a sharp lookout for prowling privateers the english coast was still faintly visible like a light grey cloud on the horizon astern when a strange sail was sighted on the port beam steering west a course which brought her gradually nearer to the convoy she was brigrigged and she continued to approach until she had reached a point some six miles from the fleet when she suddenly hauled her wind and without showing any colours stood away to the southward and eastward closehauled under a heavy press of canvas there had been a considerable amount of signalling going on between the various menowar from the moment of her first appearance and now there was still more but it soon ceased the last string of flags displayed by the tremendous was acknowledged by the andromeda the weathermost frigate and the excitement appeared to be at an end im afraid that means trouble for some of us unless the menowar keep a good sharp lookout observed mr bowen to george jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the rapidly receding brig as the two men walked the deck together criticising the appearance and sailing powers of the various craft in company ah indeed remarked george i see you have come to the same conclusion as myself with regard to the stranger which is that she is a french privateer just that sir and nothing else was the reply she is french all over no need for her to show her colours her rig speaks her nationality plain enough for a blind man to read it shes been on the watch for this fleet for the last week or more you may depend on it and now she has gone back to report the news to her consorts that the west india convoy has sailed mark my words sir we shall all have to keep a good sharp lookout or a few of us will be snapped up yet in spite of the menowar before we sight the next land well said george we must take care that the aurora is not one of the few that is all luckily we are not exactly the dullest sailer in the fleet and we must manage to keep well in the body of it it is the outsiders that will run the greatest risk for the next three or four days an unusual amount of vigilance was observable on board the menowar especially the frigates and gunbrigs all of which kept well in the offing during the day evidently on the lookout for prowling picaroons and closing in again upon the convoy at night but nothing was seen to keep alive suspicion no ships of any description were encountered save a couple of english frigates each of which replied to the private signal and exchanged numbers with the tremendous and on the evening of the tenth day out the lofty precipitous cliffs of the azores were sighted and passed another week sped away without the occurrence of any incident worthy of record the wind continued fair and steady and the convoy though its rate of travelling was rather slow made very good progress on the afternoon of the eighteenth day out from plymouth the fleet being at the time in latitude degrees north longitude degrees minutes west or about halfway to jamaica the wind fell light the sky which had hitherto been clear became overcast heavy masses of dark thunderous cloud slowly gathering in the southwestern quarter and gradually spreading athwart the sky until the whole of the visible heavens were obscured the barometer dropped slightly indicating in conjunction with the aspect of the sky a probable change of wind and a consequent interruption to their hitherto highly satisfactory progress as evening fell flashes of sheetlightning were occasionally to be seen along the southern horizon and captain leicester anticipating a thunderstorm and a probable heavy downfall of rain made preparations for the refilling of his watercasks but though the atmosphere appeared to be heavily charged with electricity the thunder held off and when night closed down upon the convoy the moon being then in her third quarter and rising late it became as dark as a wolfs mouth lights were of course displayed on board each ship and the convoy having become somewhat scattered in consequence of the failure of the breeze the effect was very singular and striking this being georges first voyage across the atlantic he was naturally a little anxious and on the night in question he resolved to remain on deck until the weather should have assumed some more decided aspect there was fortunately still a gentle breeze from about eastsoutheast fanning the convoy along at a speed of some two knots in the hour just giving the ships steerageway and they were consequently able to keep out of each others way and thus avoid collision always a great element of danger when a large number of craft happen to be sailing in company about two bells in the middle watch george being seated at the time near the companion smoking a meditative pipe and thinking somewhat ruefully about lucy walford the carpenter who was in charge of the deck approached him and said unless i am greatly mistaken sir heres a large craft without any lights creeping up on our larboard quarter indeed said george rousing himself and stepping aft to the taffrail with the carpenter whereabouts is she the carpenter looked intently astern for a moment then stretched out his arm saying there sirah now you can see her she is just about to shut out the first of those four lights that you can see all close together there now she has shut it out i see her said george whatever does the fellow mean by being without lights on such a pitchdark night as this it would serve him right to report him to the commodore in the morning he has a smart vessel under his feet though see how she is overhauling us why it must surely be one of the gunbrigs judging from her spread of canvas and her lofty spars but what can she be doing here in the very middle of the fleet and without lights too the stranger was by this time little more than a couple of cables lengths from the aurora drawing up to her fast and apparently intending to pass her very closely george glanced anxiously at his stern light thinking it might possibly have gone out but no it was burning brightly and must be distinctly visible to those on board the other craft gradually the dark mysterious fabric drew closer and still closer up on the port quarter of the aurora not the faintest glimmer of light being visible from stem to stern and not a sound of any kind to be heard on board her george began to feel a trifle nervous as he watched the silent stealthy approach of the stranger and fetching his speakingtrumpet from the beckets in the companionway where it always hung in company with the telescope he stepped aft to the taffrail and hailed ship ahoy hillo was the response in a tone of voice pitched so low that though it was distinctly audible to those on board the aurora it would not penetrate the sluggish atmosphere to any great distance what ship is that inquired george his britannic majestys brig name unintelligible what ship is that the aurora of london why are you out of your station and without lights sir is there anything wrong yes was the reply but dont hail any more there are enemies at hand i will sheer alongside you presently and tell you what to do enemies at hand eh muttered george what can it mean i wonder and if there are enemies by which i suppose they mean frenchmen in our neighbourhood those manowar fellows must have eyes like owls to be able to see them in the dark just step down into the cabin if you please mr ritson and give the mate a call i dont half like this in little more than a minute mr bowen was on deck and listening to georges statement of what had already passed and of his uneasiness george had just finished speaking when there was a sound as of a falling handspike or something of the kind on board the stranger followed by a loud ejaculation of sacrrrrre nom de the remainder of the exclamation was promptly suppressed but it was enough georges suspicions were now fully aroused and he whispered to the two men standing by him she is french beyond a doubt they intended to surprise us and very nearly they did it too but we will not be caught quite so easily this time ritson go forward rouse the men and tell them to creep aft under the shelter of the bulwarks let not one of them show so much as a hair of his head above the rail and tell them to look lively and you mr bowen be good enough to go below and bring up a cutlass apiece for all hands chapter five choppee for changeea black dog for a blue monkey by the time that the auroras crew were on deck crouching behind the bulwarks aft on the port side armed and instructed by george as to what he required of them the strange sail was within a dozen fathoms of the auroras port quarter she could now be seen with tolerable distinctness the outline of the hull and of the lofty canvas showing black as ebony against the dark background of sea and sky and any doubts which captain leicester might have still entertained concerning her were completely set at rest as he glanced at the cut of her canvas it was french all over foot by foot the brigfor such she wascrept up to the aurora until her bows were in a line with the barques stern and not more than twenty feet distant george stood by the mainrigging watching her cutlass in hand calm and determined his plans already formed for action in the event of his suspicions proving correct in the ordinary course of things the two craft were now quite near enough to each other for any communication however confidential in its nature to be made without the possibility of its being overheard but though george could see that a figure stood on the brigs rail by the mainrigging not a word was uttered keeping his gaze steadfastly fixed upon the brig captain leicester saw that her helm had suddenly been ported for she was sheering strongly in toward his own vessel brig ahoy he hailed what is it you have to say to me do not come too close sir or you will be into us never fear answered in perfect english the dark figure on board the brig we will not carry away so much as a ropeyarn belonging to you but i must be on board you before i can venture to give you your instructions oh very well said george if you intend boarding us you had better do so by way of our forerigging or you may get a nasty fall we are very much littered up here abaft with spars and so on ah thank you very much i will take your advice was the reply george saw the man motion with his arm and the brigs course was altered sufficiently to put her alongside with her gangway even with the auroras foremast another second or two and the ships gently jarred together the brigs quarter dropping alongside the barque at the same moment enfans allonsnousen exclaimed the voice of the stranger forward followed by the sound of a leap on to the barques deck and a scramble among the spars which littered it there now is your time lads jump for your lives exclaimed george in a low excited tone and setting his men the example he forthwith sprang from his own ships bulwarks to those of the brig and dashing at the helmsman cut him down with his cutlass before the fellow could recover sufficiently from his astonishment to utter a cry then without a moments pause he seized the wheel and exerting all his strength sent it with a single twirl spinning hard over to starboard where he lashed it the shock of collision slight as it was caused the two vessels to recoil from each other and they were barely alongside when they separated again georges manipulation of the brigs wheel and a similar manipulation of the auroras helm at the last moment before the touching of the two vessels greatly expediting the separation by the time therefore that george had looked about him and satisfied himself that the whole of his crew were safely with him on the brigs deck the two vessels were a dozen feet apart and increasing their distance every second their bows diverging from each other at almost a right angle the frenchmen on boarding the aurora divided into two parties one of which rushed forward to secure the crew while the other made a similar rush aft for the purpose of overpowering the officers and helmsman in their astonishment and perplexity at finding the decks deserted they paused for a moment irresolutely then hurriedly searched the cabin and forecastle only to find that the ship was utterly deserted then for the first time a glimmering of the truth presented itself to the mind of the french leader and his suspicions were instantly confirmed for captain leicester having at that moment rallied his crew led them forward and finding that as he had expected the frenchmen had boarded the aurora with all their available strength leaving only some fiveandtwenty men on board the brig to handle her he after a short sharp tussle drove these men below and secured complete possession of the brig the party on board the aurora distinctly heard the sounds of the conflict and waited in breathless expectancy for its termination they had not long to wait in little over a couple of minutes captain leicesters voice was heard giving the order to shift the helmthe brig having in the meantime gone round until she was head to wind with her canvas flat abackand to trim over the headsheets then a chorus of curses both loud and deep from the deck of the aurora proclaimed the chagrin of the frenchmen on board her at theto themextraordinary and unforeseen result of the adventure but their captain was a man of indomitable pluck energy and readiness of resource and by no means given to a tame and immediate acceptance of defeat he realised the situation in a moment and determining to make the best of a bad bargain promptly ordered sail to be crowded upon the aurora in the hope of effecting his escape the night being dark however and his men new to the ship the work went on but slowly and by the time that the topgallantsails were sheeted home his own brig was once more alongside with two red lights hoisted to her gaffend the alarmsignal her ports open guns run out and the men standing by them ready to open fire as she drew up abreast the aurora george hailed barque ahoy let fly your sheets and halliards at once and surrender or i will fire into you all right was the reply from the french captain you have won the game monsieur so i will not attempt to rob you of the credit of victory you managed the affair exceedingly well mon ami and have taught me a lesson i shall remember for the rest of my life you may come on board and take possession as soon as you like he then gave the necessary orders in french to his crew the halliards and sheets were let fly on board the aurora george reducing sail at the same time in the brig and the two vessels losing way began gradually to drop into the rear portion of the convoy captain leicester did not however accept the french captains invitation to go on board and take possession once more of his own ship that proceeding would have been just a trifle too risky he had the game in his own hands and intended to keep it there so he quietly waited until one of the menowar should come alongside as he knew would soon be the case in response to his signal in a short time another brig was seen approaching under a perfect cloud of sail an unmistakably english gunbrig this time however sweeping up on the port quarter of georges prize an officer sprang into the mainrigging and hailed brig ahoy what brig is that the jeune virginie french privateer answered george she managed somehow to slip in among the fleet unobserved in the darkness and threw a heavy boardingparty in on the deck of my vesselthe aurora i suspected her designs just in time however and as her crew boarded me i boarded her and succeeded in taking possession the two ships separating immediately and thus preventing the return of the french to their own craft ah i see remarked the officer you effected an exchange of shipschoppee for changeea black dog for a blue monkey eh and now you want us to get your own ship back for you not exactly answered george with a laugh i have already forced her to surrender that is the craftthe barque immediately under my lee but i shall feel obliged if you will take charge of the prisoners and lend me sufficient men to navigate my prize into port um well i really do not quite know about that i will man your prize for you tonight but you must see the commodore about the matter in the morning if he will authorise me to lend you a prizecrew of course i shall be very happy by the way where did the frenchman come from when i saw the craft first she was about a couple of cables lengths directly astern of us answered leicester she was eh remarked the officer well there will be a pretty row tomorrow about her being allowed to slip in undetected i will send a boat on board your own ship at once to remove the prisoners and that done i will tell off a crew to man your prize for you this was accordingly done and an hour after the arrival of the throstle upon the scene george and his crew were once more comfortably established on board their own ship on the following morning the affair was officially reported to the commodore who put himself into a tremendous passion about it declaring that such an occurrence reflected indelible disgrace upon the whole british navy and that he would bring to courtmartial every one of the officers belonging to the convoying shipswhich however seeing that at bottom he was a fine goodhearted old fellow he never did and after abusing everybody else he sent for george complimented him upon his gallantry publicly on the quarterdeck of the tremendous offered to obtain a commission for him an offer which our hero was foolish enough to decline and gave his hearty consent to the proposed borrowing of a prizecrew but the affair did not by any means end here for on the following night which was almost as dark as the preceding one three ships belonging to the merchantfleet under convoy gave an unusual and altogether extraordinary amount of trouble to the captains of the gunbrigs by their persistent straggling and suspicion being at length aroused they were all found to be in the hands of french prizecrews having been surprised and captured by the jeune virginie immediately prior to her unsuccessful attempt upon the aurora had they been only a little less anxious to effect their escape they might as the event proved have accomplished it without the slightest difficulty about pm on the day following the recapture of these three vessels the weather being at the time stark calm with an overcast sky the signal to shorten sail and prepare for bad weather was exhibited on board the commodores shipthe old tremendous it was very difficult to make out the signal the flags hanging from the masthead in such close motionless folds that it was almost impossible to identify them so after a long and anxious scrutiny of them through his telescope george thinking he must surely have misinterpreted the message dived below to take a look at his barometer a single glance at it was sufficient to show him that he was not mistaken the mercury having fallen a full inch in little more than two hours when he returned to the deck again which he did immediately the various ships were lying with their heads all round the compass the merchantmen showing no signs that they understood the signal but on board the menowar the crews were seen to be very busy reefing topsails the topgallant and royalmasts and yards being already sent down on deck captain leicester lost no time in following their example as far as he was able to send down on deck any of his tophamper with his limited crew was of course quite out of the question but he called all hands and hurrying them aloft set them to work first to furl all the light upper canvas and then to closereef both topsails this done he ordered them to furl the main and fore courses which were already clewed up part of the crew were already on the mainyard and the remainder having completed the reefing of the foretopsail had descended from aloft forward and were on their way up the mainrigging to assist in the stowing of the mainsail when a heavy black threateninglooking cloudbank which lay stretched along the western horizon was seen to suddenly burst open revealing a broad coppertinted rent which widened with alarming rapidity georges quick eye detected the change in an instant and knowing what it meant and that there was no time to lose hailed the crew with a loud shout of now then my lads look alive aloft there and toss up that mainsail smartly if you are quick about it you may yet get the gaskets round it before the gale strikes us if you are not we shall lose the sail and very probably some of you too the men answered with a cheery ay ay sir and set to work with a will leicester and the chief mate springing aft to the wheel at the same moment in the meantime the broad yellow rent in the clouds to the westward had spread very considerably the vapour overhead had gathered way and was scudding rapidly across the sky in an easterly direction and already upon the western horizon a long rapidly advancing line of white foaming water gave unmistakable indications of the close proximity of the hurricane the old tremendous now did what she could to hurry up the laggards by firing rapid signalguns and the crews of the several ships waking up at last were seen swarming aloft when it was too late to shorten sail the aurora was lying with her head pointed to the southward with her starboard broadside presented square to the wind when the gale first struck her her skipper anxious to save his canvas if possible kept his men aloft as long as he dared urging and encouraging them with his voice to exert themselves to their utmost but when he saw the old tremendous bow under the first stroke of the blast as though she meant to turn the turtle altogether he thought it was high time to look to the safety of his crew make fast and come down at once lads he shouted down with you for your lives the canvas must take care of itself now startled by the anxious sharpness of the hail the men hurriedly knotted the gaskets just as they were and scuttled in off the yard like so many frightened squirrels they were all in the mainrigging when the hurricane burst upon the ship with a terrific unearthly streaming roar it rushed upon her and the barque as if conscious of her utter inability to withstand its tremendous strength instantly went over on her beamends with her lower yardarms dipping into the water the men in the leerigging were almost completely sheltered by the hull of the ship and they had therefore but little difficulty in holding on but they were obliged to remain where they were the lower portion of the shrouds being buried some eight feet deep in water thus precluding the possibility of the men descending to the deck whilst to go aloft again and endeavour to descend to windward was as much as their lives were worth they had a practical illustration of this in the fact that two of the men in the weather shrouds were actually torn from their hold and dashed with such violence against the maintop that one man had his arm and the other three of his ribs broken captain leicester on seeing the near approach of the hurricane had after hailing his men to come down from aloft lashed the wheel hardastarboard and then accompanied by mr bowen he hurried away to the foot of the mainmast where they cast off the starboard forebraces and hauled in upon the larboard until they had braced the topsail as sharp up as it was possible for two men to get it the result of this manoeuvre was that when the gale struck the aurora her maintopsail which was ashiver was blown clean out of the boltropes in an instant as also was the foresail and the partiallystowed mainsail whilst the foretopsail was strongly filled at once and being luckily a new sail and standing the strain upon it bravely it quickly began to drag the ship through the water as soon as she gathered way her bows began to pay off and presently she recovered her upright position with a jerk which snapped both her topgallantmasts close off by the caps the wheel was now righted and away the aurora went scudding dead before it under her closereefed foretopsail only the crew now made the best of their way down on deck the headyards were squared and an effort was made to clear away the wreck two of the men volunteering for and succeeding in the dangerous task of going aloft to cut away the fore and maintopgallant rigging george now had time to look about him a little and observe the state of affairs prevailing outside his own ship on all sides were to be seen shipsmenowar as well as merchantmenscudding like his own before the irresistible fury of the gale nearly every ship had suffered damage of some sort either to sails spars or rigging and out of them all very few had come better out of the first buffet than the aurora here was to be seen a craft with topgallantmasts and jibboom gone and her canvas hanging from her yards in long tattered streamers there another with nothing standing above her lower mastheads here a barque with her mainyard carried away there a stately ship with her mizzenmast and all attached still towing astern and the crew busy cutting away at the rigging which held the shattered spar here another fine ship totally dismasted and there now far astern more than one dark object lying low in the water and but imperfectly seen through the flying spindrift which george leicester knew only too well were the hulls of ships which had capsized and whose crews would be left to perish miserably since no human power could possibly save them in an hour like that it soon became evident to the crew of the aurora that though they had so far escaped with comparatively slight damage they could certainly not regard their ship as by any means free from peril so long as they remained in the company of the rest of the fleet so many ships scudding together almost helplessly before the fury of the gale could not but prove a very great source of danger to each other now that it was no longer possible to regulate their rate of sailing and george soon found himself confronted with a new anxiety that of being in danger of a collision the sea was rising with extraordinary rapidity and the various craft soon began to steer wildly sheering so rankly first to one side and then to the other that many of them threatened to broachto altogether the aurora was a very smart little vessel under her canvas as she now proved by keeping pace with two large ships one of which lay on her portbow and the other on her starboard beam so even was the rate of sailing of the three that neither of them anxious as each was to accomplish the feat could draw away from the others and the strength of the gale was such that it was equally impossible for them either to make or to reduce sail there they remained therefore maintaining exactly the same relative position to each other now sheering uncontrollably inwards so that each man held his breath and braced himself for the shock which seemed inevitable and which under such circumstances must result in the total destruction of both ships and anon surging as wildly off in opposite directions to add still further to captain leicesters embarrassments the trio of ships were rapidly overhauling a fourth which was wallowing along dead ahead of the aurora she was a large craft apparently of about eight hundred tons measurement her three topmasts were carried away close off by the caps the wreckage was all lying inboard cumbering up her decks her courses and staysails were blown to ribbons and she was steering so badly that it was difficult to say where she was going except that her general direction was to leeward george saw that should he overtake this vessel before getting clear of the two which already hampered him so seriously a catastrophe was inevitable and he speedily made up his mind that the auroras speed must be sufficiently reduced to allow of her dropping astern and into the wake of one or the other of his present consorts the only means by which under the circumstances this could be accomplished was by sacrificing the foretopsail and he accordingly called for a volunteer to assist him in the task mr bowen and the carpenter both proffered their services and selecting the latter and requesting the chief mate to take charge of the deck and superintend the conning of the ship george went forward followed by the carpenter and led the way aloft now that they were scudding before it the strength of the wind was no longer felt to its full extent it was still powerful enough however to make the journey aloft full of peril and the two adventurers were compelled to make frequent pauses on their way in order to avoid being blown out of the rigging at length however they reached the yard and producing their knives began to work their way outwards from the mast one toward each yardarm cutting the seizings as they came to them their task was soon accomplished for when half the seizings were cut the wind saved them all further trouble by carrying away the remainder the sail gave one terrific flapwhich sprung the foreyardand then tearing out of its boltropes went soaring away ahead of them like a flake of cloud thus relieved the auroras speed sensibly diminished and by the time that george was once more down on deck they were able by watching their opportunity to sheer in under the stern of the ship which had before lain upon their portbow and thus place the aurora comparatively out of harms way they were only just in time the ship ahead was overtaken and in sheering into her new position the aurora was compelled to shave close past the strangers stern glancing up at her as they shot past with a feeling of deep gratitude at their escape george saw a little crowd of passengers huddled together upon her poop like frightened sheep they were all looking at the aurora evidently fully aware of the danger from which they had so narrowly escaped and among them george suddenly recognised a face which he had more than half hoped he would never see againthe face of his successful rival as he believed him to be lieutenant walford george waved his hand in recognition the salutation was half reluctantly returned and then the two craft separated but not before george had had time to read the name painted on her sternthe princess royal of london chapter six the mutiny on board the princess royal it now becomes necessary that we should for a short time forsake the aurora and follow the fortunes of the princess royal at the moment of our making the acquaintance of this vessel a very unsatisfactory state of affairs happened to prevail on board her she was as we have already seen a large ship as ships went at that time being of tons register and capable of carrying close upon tons deadweight she had saloon accommodation for forty passengers and carried an armament of twelve pounders upon her maindeck the intention of her owners being that she should fight her own way if necessary to and fro across the ocean and so be independent of convoy but on her present voyage this plan had to be abandoned the activity of the pressgangs and the consequent scarcity of seamen being such that she cleared out of the port of london with only thirty men in her forecastle a crew wholly inadequate to successfully defend a ship of her size in the extremely likely event of her encountering an adversary she was therefore compelled like many others to avail herself of the protection of convoy upon her arrival at plymouth she like the aurora received a visit from a manowars boat which carried off four of her best men reducing her number of seamen to twentysix it will thus be seen that when she finally sailed out of english waters she was very shorthanded now as jack is to this day so he ever has beenan inveterate grumbler he will find something to growl about it is not to be wondered at therefore that with such good cause there should be constant dissatisfaction in the princess royals forecastle but though jack is and always has been such a grumbler and though probably nothing on earth will ever cure him of this habitfor habit only it isyet even where there is good and sufficient cause for discontent a little judicious management forbearance and sympathy will prevent the mischief from going any further unfortunately however for the princess royal and all connected with her the measures adopted by those in authority on board her for the suppression of this quicklydiscovered spirit of discontent were the extreme opposite of judicious the masteras is sometimes the case with masters of very fine shipswas haughty and overbearing possessed of a highlyexaggerated opinion of his own importance turning a deaf ear to all the complaints of his crew and treating them with an impatience and superciliousness of manner which made him heartily detested the chief mate an arrant sycophant taking his cue from his superior officer imitated him to the utmost extent of his ability with a like result while the second mate was a blustering bully whose great pride and boast it was that he could always make one man do the work of two hence from the very commencement of the voyage the quarterdeck and the forecastle instead of pulling together and making an united effort to overcome the difficulties of their position rapidly grew to regard each other with mutual feelings of enmity and distrust matters had consequently as might be expected been steadily growing from bad to worse from the first moment of sailing and on the day before the gale a very unpleasant incident had occurred on board it arose in this way on the second mates watch being called one of the men remained in his hammock sending word by one of his shipmates to the officer of the watch that he was ill and unfit for duty the second mate instead of reporting the circumstance to the master and having it inquired into as was the proper course jumped at once to the conclusion that the man was merely feigning sickness in order to avoid the performance of his proper share of work and taking the matter into his own hands he proceeded to the forecastle armed with a colt and dragging the unhappy seaman out of his hammock drove him on deck abusing him roundly the while in no measured terms and setting him to work to grease the mainmast from the truck downward the poor fellow who was really ill procured a pot of grease and started up the rigging but finding himself wholly unequal to the task of going aloft descended again and proceeding aft to the poop went up to the captain who happened to be standing conversing with some of the passengers and requested to be released from duty repeating his plea of illness the second mate had however in the meantime mentioned the matter to the captain putting his own construction upon it the request was therefore harshly and hastily refused the refusal being accompanied by the assertion that the pleader was a mean skulking mutinous rascal not worth his salt lieutenant walford happened to be one of the passengers standing near at the moment and as the dissatisfied seaman turned away walford turned to the captain and said we in the army have a very short and simple method of dealing with fellows like thatwe flog them and i assure you it proves a neverfailing cure the sick man heard this remark so did the man at the wheel and from that moment walford was a marked man the captain turned round sharply do you said he then by jove ill see if it will prove equally efficacious here mr thomson have that man seized up to a grating and give him two dozen ill be bound hell be well enough to go aloft after that if he isnt he shall have another couple of dozen thomson the second mate at once sprang upon the man and seizing him by the collar ordered the boatswain to call all hands this was done the men were drawn up in the waist of the ship on the leeside the sick seaman was seized up at the lee gangway and in the presence of all on board except the ladies who retired to the saloon in indignation and disgust the unhappy man received his two dozen but here a further widening of the breach between the officers and the crew of the ship took place the individual appointed to administer the flogging was the boatswains mate a great brawny cornishman named talbot this individual when all was ready bared his muscular right arm to the shoulder and grasping the cat firmly measured his distance accurately with his eye then stood waiting the command to begin the captain the mates walford and one or two more of the onlookers smiled their satisfaction as they witnessed these elaborate preparations for the infliction of a severe flogging and the captain willing to prolong the mans suffering as much as possible allowed a long pause to ensue before giving the word at length he nodded to talbot who at once took a step back and giving the tails of the cat a mighty flourish in the air brought them down upon the mans naked shoulders so gently that an audible laugh broke spontaneously from the entire crew at the ludicrous sight the captain turned livid with fury you he gasped what do you mean by that you lubber lay it on sir lay it on hot and heavy or by jove ill have you seized up and will give you five dozen myself ay ay sir was the imperturbable reply and the second stroke was administered with even more threatening preliminaries than the first but with if possible even less effect put that fellow in irons at once shouted the captain and let him have no food except bread and water until further orders you hear steward if he has anything more i will make you responsible for it i will teach himand everybody elsethat when i give an order i will have it obeyed now rogers to the boatswain take the cat and give that skulking rascal at the grating the two dozen he so richly deserves the boatswain stepped forward and without removing his jacket or making any other preparation sullenly took the cat in his hand the chief mate meanwhile went off for a pair of handcuffs and returning slipped them on the wrists of the rebellious boatswains mate the second mate who was still looking on noticing the behaviour of the boatswain and the illconcealed triumph of the crew at talbots conduct now turned to the captain and said let me play bosuns mate for once sir ill be bound ill give the sneaking lubber his proper lowance hell never get it from any of his shipmates i can see very well do so said the captain let him have it hot and strong it will show those mutinous scoundrels that we have it in our power to punish them yet the second mate waited for no more but whipping off his coat and rolling up his shirtsleeves snatched the cat out of rogers hand and began at once to administer the punishment his first stroke drew blood and forced a shriek of anguish from the quivering lips of his victim a sound which extorted a laugh of fiendish glee from the captain a second third fourth and fifth lash followed in slow deliberate succession stripping off shreds of skin and lacerating the back of the sufferer until it presented a sickening sight at the sixth stroke the shrieks ceased and the mans head dropped upon his breast at this sight the second mate seemed somewhat startled and looked up inquiringly at the captain go on said the latter with an encouraging nod of the head go on and finish the dose hes only shamming put a little more strength into your blows man ill be bound you can fetch another howl or two out of him yet if you feel inclined thus incited the second mate actually proceeded with and completed his fiendish task at the end of which the perspiration poured in a stream down his face so great had been his exertions but not another cry could he wring from his victim in spite of all his effortsthe poor fellow was insensible and in that condition was cast off from the grating and taken below to his hammock there was no doctor on board so the unfortunate seaman was left to the clumsy though wellmeant ministrations of his shipmates who did the best they could for him the captain refusing to supply salve lint or in fact anything else with which to dress his wounds at dinner that evening the captain was urged by some of the passengers to represent to the commodore of the convoying squadron the insubordinate condition of the crew and to request his assistance this however he positively refused to do roundly asserting his ability to command his own ship but as a matter of fact the only reason for his reluctance to take this step arose out of the conviction that an inquiry would certainly follow as to the causes of the insubordination from which inquiry as he was very well aware he and his officers could hope for nothing but a complete revelation of their own culpability at the moment that this course was being urged upon the captain in the saloon the incident of the flogging and indeed the whole question of their treatment by their officers was being discussed on the forecastle by the men and singular to relate although talbot was believed by his officers to be at that instant in irons below if either of them had walked forward just then they would have found him snugly seated on deck free on the foreside of the windlass taking an active part in the discussion by the time that eight bells had struck they had fully made up their minds as to their course of action and the assembly quietly dispersed the next day was that on which the gale burst upon the fleet on the signal being made by the tremendous to shorten sail and prepare for bad weather the princess royal was one of the first to manifest signs of obedience she was at the time under every stitch of canvas she could spread not because she was a sluggish sailer for she was the reverse of that but because there being a flat calm it mattered not how much or how little canvas was set it could make no possible difference in the movements or position of the vessel and the captain seeing here a fine opportunity to impose upon his crewby way of punishment as he put it to himself and his officersa great deal of unnecessary work ordered all sail even to the studdingsails to be set for the purpose as he averred of giving them an airing the first thing to be done in the way of shortening sail therefore was to take in the studdingsails which the crew not being then aware of the danger which threatened the ship proceeded to do in a very leisurely and deliberate fashion their next task was to haul down the smaller staysails then to clew up and furl royals and topgallantsails they were all aloft in the act of stowing these sails when the hurricane burst upon them they fortunately saw its approach in time to save themselves and leaving the canvas drooping loose from the yards hurriedly descended to the deck by way of the backstays and were scarcely there when with the first furious rush of the wind the three topmasts went one after the other in quick succession the wreckage falling on deck and lumbering it fore and aft the crew regarded the mishap with stolid satisfaction the delay which it would occasion in the prosecution of the voyage was nothing to them the ship was stripped of everything above her lower mastheads leaving so much the less canvas for her crew to handle and that was all they cared about at the moment a little later on in the day they saw that if the gale lastedof which there was every prospectthe loss of her spars would result in her separation from the remainder of the fleet and as they remarked upon this to each other the men smiled grimly and exchanged certain short pithy remarks which had they been heard by the occupants of the saloon would have produced a feeling of grave uneasiness the crew were of course at once set to work to clear away the wreck and this they forthwith proceeded to do for their own sakes however rather than out of respect to the captains orders the heavy spars dashing about the deck with the roll of the ship in a manner which made it positively dangerous to be there at all by nightfall the rest of the fleet had passed out of sight to the eastward scattered like chaff before the angry breath of the hurricane and the princess royal was left to fight out her battle alone by dint of almost superhuman exertions the shattered spars had been secured the mainsail cut away from the yard and such other dispositions made as would allow of her being kept dead before the wind and out of the trough of the sea during the coming night and when the captain took his seat at the head of the saloontable at dinner that evening he was full of boastful exultation over the prompt obedience of his crew frequently congratulating his passengers upon their being on board a ship in charge of such capable officers as himself and his mates of course he did not actually say this in so many words but the burden of his remarks amounted to it and nothing less the second mate had the middle watch on that eventful night and just after he had struck four bells and the wheel had been relieved he was inexpressibly scandalised by hearing above the howling of the gale loud sounds of singing and jocularity on the forecastle such sounds were of so very unusual a character on board the princess royal that coupled with the circumstance of their being uttered in the middle watch of all times in the world he was at first so astonished as to be quite unable to believe his own ears very soon however they were repeated one of the men actually breaking into a rollicking song the burden of which was an invocation to let us all be jolly boys under every conceivable combination of circumstances jolly the scoundrels how dare they so much as think of such a thing at a time when they were living under the ban of their officers severe displeasure and the ship a perfect wreck aloft too it was simply monstrous the second mates righteous anger blazed up into full fury at once and advancing to the break of the poop he roared out in stentorian tones silence there forard what do you mean you unmannerly swabs by disturbing the ship fore and aft with your infernal howling at this time of night either the unmannerly swabs had not heard him or they were so utterly lost to all sense of the respect due to their officer as to pay no attention to his polite adjuration for the song was continued with some attempt at a chorus the second mate was not in the habit of speaking twice to those under him and he did not attempt to do so now drawing his knotted colt out of his pocket he descended the poopladder and hurried forward as fast as the heavy rolling of the ship would permit determined to teach the howling thieves a lesson they would not readily forget meanwhile though he was blissfully ignorant of the fact sharp eyes had been watching his motions for some time and his foot was scarcely on the top step of the poopladder when jim martin the owner of a pair of the aforesaid sharp eyes exclaimed hurrah my bullies keep it up here he comes the shark has bolted the bait without so much as smelling at it the group of men clustered on the forecastle made a slight restless movement as men sometimes will when they are conscious of the approach of a great crisis in their lives and the voice of the singer quavered the merest trifle another moment and the second mate was among them his eyes flashing with anger and his colt uplifted to strike what the deuce before he could utter another word his legs were cut from under him by the sweeping blow of a handspike and he fell with a crash to the deck the back of his head striking so violently on the planking as to momentarily stun him in an instant a belayingpin was thrust between his teeth and secured there with a lashing of spunyarn and then before he had sufficiently recovered to realise his position he was turned over on his face his arms drawn behind him and his wrists and ankles firmly lashed together very neatly managed remarked talbot approvingly as his gaze rested on the prostrate figure on the deck now mates whats the next move come ned to the boatswain youre to be our new skipper you know give us your orders capn and well be yours obejently well then if youre all agreed upon that shipmates my first order is for one of youyou tomto go aft into the saloon and knock at the old mans door note and ask him to come on deck at once as mr thomson have met with a haccident two more of youll wait for him outside the door and when he steps out pon deck sarve him the same as youve sarved our respected friend here then do the same with mr nicholls the chief mate these orders were so skilfully executed that in a quarter of an hour the mutineers had the captain and his two aides prisonersbound and helpless in their hands without the slightest alarm having been given to the other occupants of the saloon the larboard watch was then called and from their first eager questions when aroused it became evident that the seizure of the ship was a carefully planned affair of which all in the forecastle were fully cognisant the seamen having paraded on deck and been with the aid of a lantern carefully inspected by the boatswain to ascertain that there were no recreant spirits among them now that the crisis had arrived each man excepting a halfdozen left in charge of the deckwas provided with a short length of wellstretched ratline carrying which they proceeded in a body to the saloon and entering the staterooms surprised in their sleep and secured without difficulty the whole of the male passengers pinioned them firmly and then after depriving them of such weapons as they happened to possess locked them up in their own cabins the ladies were only disturbed so far as was necessary to make them acquainted with the fact that the ship had changed hands and that if they had only the good sense to acquiesce in the arrangement they would be perfectly unmolested the cook and stewards were also called and having been left in ignorance of the proposed mutiny lest they should inadvertently let the secret slip addressed in somewhat similar terms whereupon they at once declared their readiness to throw in their lot with the mutineers and were forthwith sworn in note the master of a merchantship is frequently spoken of by his crew as the old man whether his years happen to be few or many chapter seven lieutenant walford finds himself in an exceedingly unpleasant position on the morning following the seizure of the princess royal by her misguided crew the day broke tardily revealing to the mutineers a wild threatening sky a high and increasing sea the curling foamcrests of which raced after the ship menacingly and an unbroken horizon all round not a solitary sail of any description was visible they were alone at the mercy of the towering mountainsurges and of the gale which howled deafeningly past them the sight which on that morning presented itself from the poop of the crippled ship was one to make the stoutest heart quail to impress the onlooker with an overpowering sense of his own insignificance compared with him who holds the ocean in the hollow of his hand and of the blasphemous arrogance of those who would presume to take upon themselves one of the functions of the almighty and in the blindness of their anger attempt to mete out to their fellowmen that justice which it is his alone to repay yet no such idea presented itself to the mutineers or if it did each man was careful to conceal it from all the rest they had been systematically downtrodden and illtreated from the commencement of the voyage their lives had been made a burden to them and nowhaving at last been provoked into the throwing off of their yoke of insupportable bondagethey thirsted for revenge upon the authors of their miseries as might be expected the whole internal economy of the ship was upset from the moment that she fell into the hands of the mutineers their first act on the morning in question was to transfer the male passengers from the cabin to the forecastle and to remove their own belongings aft into the staterooms thus rendered vacant the ladies of whom fortunately there were only half a dozen on board were permitted for the present to retain possession of their staterooms being given to understand however that it was only upon the express condition that they were to make no attempt whatever to meddle with the arrangements of the mutineers nor to communicate in any way with the male passengers confined in the forecastle these arrangements completed rogers ordered the steward to prepare and serve to the mutineers in the saloon the best breakfast that the resources of the ship would allow the passengers in the forecastle to be served with such a meal as ordinarily fell to the lot of the seamen while the deposed captain and the two mates were to be left entirely without food of any kind these orders were carried out to the letter the unfortunate ladies being compelled to take their seats as usual at the breakfast table and share the meal of the mutineers this being over the table was cleared spirits and tobacco were called for and rogers from his seat at the head of the saloontable gave orders that the captain and the two mates should be brought aft and put upon their trial before a court of the whole crew theres one more as i votes we try at the same time and thats the sodgerofficer as got poor dicky rudd his flogging observed one of the men very well assented rogers bring him along too mates i intended to take him by hisself but it dont matter bring the whole four of em in a few minutes captain arnold nicholls the chief mate and thomson the second mate with lieutenant walford were ushered into the saloon handcuffed and guarded by eight armed mutineers the prisoners is before the court announced talbot in a loud voice anxious to make the proceedings partake as much of the character of a ceremonial as possible the four men were then ordered to range themselves in line at the foot of the table an order which after a little hesitation they sullenly obeyed meanwhile the mutineers having been served with tobacco and brandy had lighted their pipes and provided themselves each man with a stiff rummer of grog a cursory observer would possibly have thought the scene grotesque but the four men ranged at the foot of the table speedily detected in the countenances of their selfconstituted judges an expression of stern determination which caused their hearts to sink and their cheeks to blanch with sudden fear a lowtoned consultation now ensued between rogers and those nearest him in which talbot was summoned to take part at its conclusion the latter withdrew a little apart and rogers turning to the captain said robert arnold yours is the first case who is the prosecutor i am answered talbot on behalf of the whole crew very good acquiesced rogers benjamin talbot state yur case upon this talbot stepped up to the cabintable and said on behalf of the whole crew of this here shipthe princess royali charges robert arnold late skipper of the same with havin treated all hands before the mast in a most onjustifiable manner as youre fully aweer shipmates we was shorthanded when we left london and at plymouth the menowar robbed us of four of our best hands makin us more shorthanded still very well now whats the dooty of a skipper to his crew under such sarcumstances as this here why i say his dooty is to make things as easy as possible for em instead o which this here robert arnold the prisoner as were tryin he goes and expects us to do as much work and to do it as smartly as if the ship was fully manned and because we couldnt do itas it stands to reason we couldnthe goes and makes extra work for us by way of punishment he robs us of our aternoon watch below he stops our grog he tyrannises over us in every imaginable way he treats us like dogs and not like men abusin and bullyin us and goin out of his way to hurt our feelins he refuses to listen to our just complaints he encourages the first and second mates to sarve out to us the same sort of treatment as he gives us hisself instead of takin our part and treatin us with justice and he does all this not once in a way only but from the very commencement of the vyage and lastly he orders a sick man to be flogged laughs at the poor chaps sufferins and refuses to sarve out the necessaries to dress his wounds aterwards that shipmates is the charge i brings against robert arnold you hears the charge agin the prisoner shipmates all observed rogers glancing round the table ben talbot brings this here charge in the name of all hands so if theres any of yer as disagrees with what heve said just stand up like men and say so a profound silence followed no man making the slightest sign or token of dissent very well resumed rogers nobody dont seem to have anything to say agin the charge now you that agrees with talbot and thinks as heve stated the case fairly hold up yur hands every hand was at once and unhesitatingly raised at arms length unanermous pronounced rogers now robert arnold youve heard whats been charged agin yer and youve seen that all hands of us agrees that the charge is just what have yer got to say in yur defence nothing answered the captain except that i utterly disclaim your right to sit in judgment upon me or to criticise my actions in any manner whatsoever your conduct is in the last degree illegal and unjustifiable you are a pack of mutinous scoundrels and i warn you that a terrible punishment will surely overtake you if you persist in your defiance of my authority if however you will return to your duty and deliver up to us your duly appointed officers the ringleaders in this disgraceful mutiny i will undertake to overlook this most serious offence so far as the rest of you are concerned you hear what the prisoner says shipmates observed rogers calmly do you consider as heve made good his defence is it your opinion as heve justified hisself them as thinks he have hold up their hands them as thinks he havent stand up the selfconstituted judges with one accord rose to their feet thatll do you may sit down agin remarked rogers the prisoner is found guilty the next question to be settled is the matter of punishment now theres a many ways of punishing a man some on em more severe than others the most severest as i knows is death death by hangin from the yardarm them as thinks the prisoner arnold deservin of this punishment hold up their hands two or three hands were hesitatingly raised and after a slight pause lowered again do i understand as everybody thinks hangin too severe inquired rogers glancing slowly round the table i doas no hands were shown well then lets try something else perhaps shipmates some of yers got a hidee as youd like to put afore the court if so lets hear what it is i thinks as it would be no more nor he desarves if we was to treat him for the rest of the vyage as heve treated us from the beginnin of it hed know then what its like and if he lives long enough to get the command of another ship maybe hell then know better how to treat his crew observed one of the men not at all a bad idee commented rogers youve heard what phil says what dye think ont i thinks its a capical notion remarked one im agreeable intimated another ay lets see how he likes that sort of thing hisself remarked a third and so on all hands intimating their concurrence in the suggestion wery good remarked rogers when all had spoken then turning to the captain he said robert arnold the sentence of this here court is that youm to be turned forard and conwerted into a hordinary seaman to do a hordinary seamans dooties and to receive just exactly the same treatment as youve sarved out to the hands since this here ship sailed from hold england namely more kicks than hapence and the lord have mercy on yer miserable carcase he paused for a moment on concluding thisin his opinionimpressive address and then ordered that arnold should be removed to the forecastle and the chief mate brought forward this was done and as nicholls the chief mate stepped forward in answer to his name his ashy pale face his trepidation of manner and his imperfect articulation all showed him to be labouring under a very agony of fear the charge against him was also preferred by talbot in pretty much the same language as was used by that individual in his charge against the captain the accusation in the present case however being to the effect that nicholls occupying as he did the influential post of chief mate had instead of using his influence with the captain to make matters as agreeable as possible for the men countenanced aided abetted and encouraged his superior in the adoption of a harsh and tyrannical course of conduct upon this charge he was found guilty and his sentence was similar to that of the captains with the addition that he was to receive at the gangway twentyfive lashes well laid on thomson the second mate was now called forward and the yell of fiendish delight which greeted him as the bully staggered up to the cabintable fairly caused his teeth to chatter with affright the charge against him was made by talbot who plunged eagerly into his task with a manifest gusto which had been well suppressed in the previous cases the indictment was very similar to that preferred against nicholls but in addition to all that the latter had been charged with talbot rapidly enumerated a long list of wanton cruelties and petty tyrannies which had sprung spontaneously and unprompted as it were from the second mates own evil nature at the conclusion of talbots address the men without waiting for rogers to formally charge them sprang eagerly to their feet and clamorously declared the prisoner guilty the question of punishment was then referred to by rogers and the moment that he ceased to speak the shout of death death hanging from the yardarm rang through the cabin and let him have five dozen at the gangway before hes strung up just by way of payin off dicky rudds debt with interest added a voice the suggestion was carried by acclamation and the miserable man was informed that the sentence against him would be carried into effect at the conclusion of the trial of the fourth prisoner lieutenant walford who was now commanded to stand forward walford stepped up to the cabintable with an assumption of firmness which was completely belied by the ghastly pallor of his countenance and the convulsive twitching of his white lips grasping the table with both hands he said in a voice which he in vain attempted to render steady before you proceed any further in this matter i wish to remind you that i am merely a passenger on board this ship and that i have nothing whatever to do with any quarrel which may exist between you and your officers i have heard the charges which you have preferred against them and i am wholly at a loss to understand in what way you associate me with them you can scarcely suppose i imagine that the passengers would regard themselves as called upon to interfere in the management or discipline of the ship for my own part i have always considered you quite able to manage your own affairs and quite capable of putting a stop to any injustice to which you might be subjected you never appealed to me for help and you therefore ought not to be surprised if i have held aloof he paused here for a moment and glanced anxiously round the table to note the effect of his address and seeing by the stern expression on the faces of the men seated at the table that he had wholly failed to make a favourable impression he hastily proceeded to add furthermore let me remind you that i am an officer and a gentleman the wearer of his most gracious majestys uniform and in virtue of that fact i may claimi do claimto be in some sort his majestys representative on board this ship any violence or indignity offered to me therefore is tantamount to offering the same to the king himself and as you are all fully aware to offer indignity or violence to the kings person is high treason a crime punishable with death i hope therefore that you will pause and consider well the consequences of any hasty action which your present temporary assumption of power might betray you into and that before it is too late and before you have too deeply inculpated yourselves you will see the advisability of restoring to me my freedom if he expected this appeal to be of any benefit to him he was sorely disappointed for the gloomy repellent expression on the faces of his judges was only deepened by his illadvised address a moment or two of complete silence followed the utterance of his closing words and then rogers looking him straight in the face said well prisner have yer quite finished surely i have said sufficient to demonstrate to you the impolicy as well as the injustice of making me suffer for the faults of others exclaimed walford glad you think so replied rogers with a sardonic grin howsoever he continued you may keep yur mind easy about one thing we aint goin to make yer suffer for the faults of others as you calls it youll only be made to suffer for faults of yur own and bad enough youll find that i reckon now ben whats the charge agin this one i charges him answered talbot with havin wilfully spoke the words what got poor dicky rudd two dozen lashes at the gangway when the poor feller was most too sick to stand upright if he hadnt spoke as likely as not the skipper had never ha thought of it and so far as that goes i believes that all hands of us is agreed that he wouldnt therefore i charges this here prisner with bein the man what acshully got poor dicky his floggin you hears prisner what the crew has against yer what have yer got to say to it interrogated rogers walford had evidently either forgotten all about his illadvised suggestion or had believed the crew to be ignorant of it he seemed to have thought that the utmost extent of the mutineers complaint against him would be that he had not interfered in their behalf when therefore he heard the charge against him and realised the fact that he was wholly in their power and utterly at their mercy his couragewhich at the best of times was only of a very flimsy and unreliable character utterly gave way he involuntarily turned his eyes for a moment upon the miserable second mate recalled the fact that the wretched man had been doomed to a speedy and degrading death by the same individuals who were now sitting in judgment upon him and a shameful panic took possession of him an uncontrollable shivering fit seized his frame he was obliged to clench his teeth together to prevent them from chattering audibly he glanced wildly round him as if seeking for some means of escape and after two or three ineffectual efforts to speak he managed to gasp out brokenly through his clenched teeth and quivering lips iii give youmymy sacred word of honour gengentlemen that i was oonly injest i nevnever believed for aa moment that capttain arnold would ttake my remark seriously or i assure you i would nnever have uttered it and besides i rereally believed that yourfriend rrudd waswas only shherahi beg your pardon gentlemen i scscarcely know what i am saying butoh gentlemen i dont be hard upon mehave mercy upon me for gods sake spare my life and you may do with me what you will he ceased from sheer physical inability to utter another word and sinking upon his knees stretched forth his quaking hands in a mute appeal for mercy this disgraceful exhibition of cowardice was almost successful in winning for walford an ignominious release the mutineers were so unutterably disgusted that for a moment their impulse was to kick him out of the cabin like a craven hound and henceforward ignore his existence but this impulse lasted only for a moment they recalled to mind the insolent arrogance with which this same cowering creature had treated them when he deemed himself secure from retaliation and they determined that while his miserable life was not worth the taking he should still receive so salutary a lesson as should effectually deter him from any repetition of the offence for the remainder of his life well shipmates exclaimed rogers breaking the painful silence which had followed walfords shameful appeal what dye think is the prisner guilty or not guilty guilty was the unanimous declaration of the assembly guilty in course he is and whats the punishment to be death oh no not deathnot death gentlemen for the love of god spare my life i am not fit to die i am not indeed you see how young a man i am why i have never yet thought about dying mercy mercy shrieked the miserable wretch as he grovelled on his knees before them and sought to clasp the knees of the man nearest himan attempt which was repulsed with an oath a look of unutterable loathing a kick and a brutal blow on the mouth come lads speak up urged rogers wholly unmoved by the interruption say what the punishments to be and lets have done with it im sick of this here i am well said talbot stepping forward i wotes that the prisoner be first made to go and axe poor dickys pardon if he cant get it why lets string him up at the yardarm to balance tother one but if dicky likes to forgie him well well spare his life and redooce his punishment to two dozen at the gangwaysame as he got for ruddand make him do rudds dooty til the poor chaps better arter which the prisoner can be set to do all the dirty work o the ship hows that shipmates ay ay ben thatll do bo thatll do fustrate and he may thank his lucky stars at bein let off so precious easy was rogers reply in which the remainder of the men laughingly acquiesced then youd better step this way at once young feller remarked talbot to the miserable walford and see what you can do with poor dicky if he wont forgive yer mind its all up with yer so saying he opened the door of the stateroom in which rudd was lying thrust his victim into the apartment and closed the door upon him the stateroom into which walford was thus unceremoniously ushered was divided from the saloon by a bulkhead with a door in it the upper panel of which was fitted with sloping slats like those of the venetian windowblinds of the present day it was perfectly easy therefore for an occupant of the stateroom to hear all that passed in the saloon and vice versa as a matter of fact rudd who was lying in his berth broad awake had heard every word uttered during the course of the trial and shrewdly suspecting that his shipmates were more anxious to thoroughly frighten than to actually hurt their fourth prisoner and having moreover a trifling personal grudge against the man who had secured for him his flogging he determined to have a little amusement at walfords expense before according to him the pardon which he knew his shipmates expected of him when therefore walford staggered up to the side of the berth and began eagerly and incoherently to stammer forth the most abject apologies and the wildest prayers for forgiveness rudd simply growled forth an oath and impatiently flung himself over in the berth with his back to the petitioner this had the intended effect of causing walfords apologies and prayers to be reiterated with increased eagerness and incoherence to the hearty amusement of the men in the saloon at length talbot opened the stateroom door and thrusting in his head said roughly here come out of that mister youve worried poor dicky quite long enough if he wont forgive yer why he wont and that settles it youve had a fair chance to see what you could do with him and youve failed we decided to give yer a quarter of a hour and the times up so out you comes dye hear the next moment walford was seized by the collar and was being dragged roughly enough out of the stateroom when rudd pretending to relent called out there take him away ben but dont be too hard on him i forgives him just this once and i hopes he wont never do it again walford upon hearing these words which seemed to him a reprieve from the very jaws of death broke away from talbots grasp and rushing back to the side of the berth seized rudds hand kissed it wildly and burst into an uncontrollable passion of tears in the midst of which he was hustled unceremoniously out on deck chapter eight a double tragedy a moment or two in the open air sufficed to settle in some measure walfords disordered faculties and to restore to him his reason of which he had been pretty nearly bereft by the terror of the preceding halfhour he found himself in the midst of theby this timemore than halfintoxicated seamen none of whom appeared to be paying much attention to him for they were all talking loudly together discussing and arranging the details of the punishment of those whom they chose to regard as the two chief offenders the men were all greatly excited by the potations in which they had freely indulged during the mockery of a trial in the saloon and their differences of opinion on some points were so strong that at one moment the proceedings seemed more than likely to be diversified by a pitched battle rogers however whose head seemed capable of resisting the effects of almost any amount of liquor interposed between the belligerents and by a determined exercise of his newlyacquired authority and by most frightful threats of the chastisement which he personally would inflict on the first man who ventured to disobey him succeeded at length in restoring some semblance of order this achieved he ordered a grating to be rigged in the larboard gangway and that when this was done the chief mate should be seized thereto his orders were speedily carried out and when the man nicholls stripped to the waist was firmly lashed to the grating in readiness to receive his punishment rogers ordered that the second mate should be brought to him the miserable thomson was thereupon led before him and a more wretched spectacle than this man presented it would be difficult to find his old blustering bullying overbearing manner had completely deserted him the fear of death was upon him and he shivered like a man in an aguefit you thomson said rogers addressing him in a calm matteroffact tone of voice as if what he was about to say had reference only to some trifling everyday affair you was present at the trial of that man nicholls as stands seized up to yonder grating and you knows the punishment as it was decided for to give him it was five and twenty lashes well laid on you hears that well laid on wery good now this here same man nicholls it seems to me is in a sort o way to blame for getting you into your trouble if hed been a proper sort of man understandin that he owed a dooty to the crew as well as to the owners of the ship instead of encouraging you in your goinson agin us hed have took you o one side and hed ha said to you look here thomson my good feller you mustnt be too hard upon them poor sailormen forard you knows as they dont muster a fullhanded crew and so it dont stand to reason as they can do so much as if they was fullhanded theyre a decent enough willin lot of men and we mustnt axe too much from em just keep that in mind and make things as easy as you can for em if hed been a proper sort of man i say hed have said someat of that sort to you now wouldnt he and youd have listened to him and then you wouldnt have been in this here precious scrape as youre in now would you youre right rogers i should not eagerly exclaimed thomson his eyes lighting up with a gleam of fresh hope as he thought he detected in the boatswains speech some signs of relenting if mr nicholls had only put the matter to me as you have just now put it i should never have given a single man of you the slightest reason for complaint against me but he never did anything of the kind on the contrary both he and captain arnold encouraged me to believe you an idle worthless lot of scamps and to treat you as such and that is the plain simple truth i swear it wery good commented rogers then you see thomson you and us thinks alike namely that nicholls in a kind of a sort of a way led you into this here miserable scrape that bein the case we thinks itll be only fair if you gives him the twentyfive lasheswell laid on that the court have condemned him to receive thomson looked eagerly into the face of the boatswain hoping that in this proposal he saw a commutation of his deathsentence rogers returned the gaze with a look of grim satisfaction which the second mate mistook for a halfdrunken leer of benevolence and anxious above all things to propitiate this man who undoubtedly held the power of life and death in his hands he excitedly exclaimed ill do it give me the cat and you shall have no cause to complain of the way in which i will execute your sentence all right thats a bargain agreed rogers then turning to the rest of the mutineers he ordered them to fetch all hands on deck to witness punishment all hands exceptin the ladies i mean theyd be shocked at the sight pretty dears and we must take care as they dont see nor hear nothin asd shock em sweet delicate creeturs he added with a contemptuous laugh which was echoed by his comrades as they staggered forward to drag the male passengers on deck in a few minutes these were all mustered walford contriving seemingly without attracting attention to mingle with them and take up an unobtrusive position from which he intended if possible to quietly effect a retreat at the first convenient opportunity when all was at length ready the scene which presented itself was a sufficiently curious one the chief object of the picture was of course the figure of the unhappy chief mate who naked to the waist stood firmly lashed to the grating with arms and legs wide spread in the orthodox attitude of a man about to be flogged opposite him and some four or five feet distant stood thomson his coat and vest laid aside his shirtsleeves rolled above his elbows and the cat in his hand with the knotted tails prone upon the deck around these two figures in a compact ring stood the gentlemen passengers and the captain of the ship a group of unwilling spectators of the outrage about to be inflicted whilst outside them again and completely hemming them in beyond all possibility of escape crowded the halfdrunken mutineers armed to the teeth and bandying brutal and obscene jests back and forth then there was the huge bulk of the disabled ship surging madly forward like a hunted creature dizzy and reeling with terror her spacious decks kneedeep in the water which was incessantly pouring in over her bulwarks as she rolled gunwaleunder and for a background the mountainous seas careering swiftly past with their lofty crests towering high and menacingly all round the ship and the leadenhued stormy sky the deep and painful silence which prevailed was broken by rogers harsh voice remarking now thomson you knows your dooty which is to give the prisner on the gratin five and twenty lashes well laid on so go ahead my man and lets see if you cant make him yell a bit louder than you did poor dicky rudd thomson glanced at the speaker and nodded the hope which he entertained of an eventual escape from death had thrown him into a state of terrible excitement bordering almost upon madness his ghastly pallor had vanished and was now superseded by a deep purplish tinge resulting from the violent rush of blood to the head the veins upon his forehead stood out like cords his eyes glowed like those of a wild animal and his jaws were flecked with foam streaked with blood which trickled from a wound in his lower lip where in his terrible excitement he had unconsciously bitten it through this frenzied creature nodded his comprehension of rogers command and gathering himself up like an animal about to make a spring he drew the tails of the cat slowly through his closed left hand measured his distance carefully and making a quick bound forward brought the nine knotted lashes down upon the mates naked shoulders with a demoniac strength which seemed to literally bury them in the quivering flesh the mate responded to this with a sharp yell which was greeted by the mutineers with mocking laughter rogers remarking to thomson that that was pretty well but you know you can do a deal bettern that the second strokebut why go further with the description of the sickening scene let it suffice to say that when the inanimate body of the mate was cast loose from the grating it bore the appearance of having been mangled by the teeth and claws of some savage beast rather than by a human being so far so good observed rogers that ends act the first now thomson its your turn you know strip my boy without makin any bones about it and lets see if you can take yur punishment any bettern your superior hossifer the man spoke in a rallying tone of such geniality that thomson grew more sanguine than ever as to the remission of the more serious part of his sentence and with a ghastly grin in response to rogers patronising smile he began to slowly strip he even after drawing his shirt over his head summoned the courage to walk up to the grating and leaning his body upon it to spontaneously stretch out his arms and legs to the proper position when the wretched man was securely spreadeagled on the grating talbot and another man were ordered to step forward and administer the flogging which they did relieving each other at the completion of every dozen lashes until the entire fifty had been inflicted the punishment was terribly severe but the intense excitement under which the second mate laboured enabled him to retain his consciousness throughout and even to stand without assistance on being cast loose a stiff reviver of grog was administered to him by rogers order and he was then told to dress himself the critical moment was now at hand when the miserable thomsons state of torturing suspense was to cease when he would know for certain whether these men were actually relentless or whether having already wreaked an ample vengeance upon him they would be content to ignore the remainder of his sentence which after all he was more than halfinclined to believe was nothing but a cruel hoax arranged beforehand for the purpose of giving him a good fright hopeful as he was however upon this score he could not help feeling terribly anxious and it was with the utmost difficulty that he controlled his quaking nerves sufficiently to replace his clothing without assistance during the time that he was thus engaged the circle which hemmed him in was maintained unbroken the mutineers watching his motions with strong interest and indulging freely in jocular comments and jeering encouragement as he winced and shrank at the chafe of his clothing on his lacerated back and shoulders at length he stood once more before them fully clothed his eyes glowing like carbuncles his visage blanched and his whole frame quivering with pain and the tensity of excitement and suspense wery good thomson wery good indeed remarked rogers approvingly youve showed a great deal more pluck than any of us have ever give you credit forso far if you only behaves as well for the next ten minutes we shall feel quite a respec for yur memry now shipmates and prisners all forard we goes to carry out the second part of the sentence at the word two of the mutineers stepped forward and placing themselves one on each side of the second mate linked their arms in his and led him forward halting him just beneath the foreyard the remainder of the crowd following in a body and forming in a circle round him as before then at rogers command one of the mutineers separated himself from the main body and in the course of a minute or two was seen leisurely ascending the forerigging with a tailblock in one hand and the end of a coil of light line in the other thomson glanced upward at this man and like a lightningstroke the conviction flashed upon him that his doom was indeed sealedthat the deathsentence passed upon him was no grim and ghastly piece of jocularity no hoax practised upon him to test his courage but that it was spoken in cruel and bitter earnest for a second or two his heart stood still his head swam his sight failed him and a feeling of horrible nausea oppressed him he realised at last that he was about to die that standing there on that reeling deck as he did in the full strength and prime of lusty manhood with all his energies mental and physical at their best the sands of his life had so nearly run out that the few last grains were even now falling in the hourglass of his fate then in a single instant the whole of his past life rose up before him with every thought word and deed clearly and sharply reproduced and as it did so the present world and all its concerns its petty aspirations ambitions hopes and strivings dwindled away into the most contemptible insignificance his mental vision cleared he saw how full had been his life of great and noble possibilitiesas are the lives of all of us would we but allow ourselves to see that it is so and he saw too how completely he had missed his mark how very far his own evil passions had led him astray from the narrow and seldomtrodden path which faithfully followed leads to that highest possible attainment of humanitytrue goodness ah how bitterly he repented him then of all his lost or rather his castaway opportunities from his earliest youth he had chosen to follow evil rather than good he had turned persistently away from the right and now there was neither time nor opportunity left him for reparation the utter blankness and uselessness of his life stood revealed to him as one long unbroken unanswerable accusation and in his mad despair he suddenly dashed aside the two men who held him in their custody sprang with a single bound to the rail and placing his hands upon the top of the topgallantbulwark vaulted clear over it before a single hand could be outstretched to restrain him and with a yell which evermore rang in the ears of those who heard it threw up his hands and vanished for ever into the dark and terrible depths of his oceangrave the little crowd of spectators stood for a few moments silent and almost stupefied at this sudden and tragic disappearance of the second mate from their midst the occurrence was so totally unexpected that it in a measure sobered the mutineers who regarded each other with some such expression as that of a group of schoolboys terrified at the sudden occurrence of some disaster the result of their own mischievous acts and each anxious to shift the blame and responsibility from his own shoulders to those of the others the first to recover his selfpossession was rogers who exclaimed with an obviously forced laugh well curse me if that aint a good un what in the name of all thats foolish made the man do that he might ha knowed as we was only goin to frighten him a bit youll bear me out shipmates that we was all agreed to go no further than the frightenin of him a bit and meant to let him off arter wed made fast the rope and let him stand with it round his neck a minute or two now aint them there the facts o the case ay ay ned youre right bo thats just exactly howt was was the reply nevertheless answered captain arnold sternly you are as much murderers every one of you as if you had hanged the manas you seemed about to door had taken him up and flung him over the side with your own hands you drove him to his death his blood is upon your hands and you will individually be called upon to answer for your accursed deed if not in this world certainly in the next the men cowered like whipped hounds before the captains denunciation which they knew in their inmost souls to be just for an instant they stood appalled before the awful conviction that they were indeed murderers none the less guilty because their crime was unintentional and but for the swift intervention of rogers they would there and then in their horror and remorse have yielded up possession of the ship and returned to their duty but the boatswain taking in at a glance the critical state of affairs and fully realising his own perilous position as the ringleader in the mutiny rallied his men by exclaiming there now belay all that you arnold we wants none of your preachin and whats more we wont have it and shipmates dont you take no notice of what he says we never meant to take the second mates life wed ha stopped him from drownin hisself if we could and so its just all gammon to talk about our bein hishismurderers now march the prisners down into the focsle again clap the bilboes on em shut down the scuttle upon em and then come aft into the cabin all hands and well freshen the nip this proposal to freshen the nipor take another glass or two of grogwas eagerly welcomed by the mutineers who felt that they must have something to dispel those qualms of conscience which so greatly disturbed them and in another quarter of an hour they were allwith the exception of two men at the wheel and one on the poop who was supposed to be acting as lookoutonce more assembled round the saloontable busily endeavouring to drown their sense of guilt in a flood of liquor the ladieswho had long before effected a retreat to their own staterooms where they had locked themselves inwere for some time allowed to remain unmolested but when the libations in which the mutineers liberally indulged had at last achieved their desired effect and the spirits of the men began to rise one of the most reckless of them proposed that the ladies should be invited to grace the revel with their presence the proposal was received with acclamation and the unhappy women were forthwith ordered into the saloon the poor terrified creatures at first made no response hoping that if no notice were taken of them the intoxicated mutineers would forget all about them and leave them in peace but this hope was of short duration for the mutineers drinking deep and rapidly soon grew excited and finding their repeated demands of no avail staggered to their feet and breaking open the stateroom doors dragged forth their victims compelling them to seat themselves at the same table and partake with them of the liquor with which it was bountifully supplied the scene which followed is simply too shameful for detailed description the men inflamed by drink and rendered reckless by a feeling which none of them could entirely shake offthat they had already offended past all forgivenessspeedily grew more and more outrageous in their behaviour until the orgie became one of such unbridled licence that one of the ladiesthe young and lovely wife of one of the passengers imprisoned in the forecastlein her desperation drew a pistol from the belt of the man nearest her and quickly cocking it placed the muzzle to her breast pulled the trigger and sank upon the saloon floor a corpse shot through the heart this second fatality more sudden if possible than the first brought the unholy revel to an abrupt conclusion the mutineers thoroughly horrified at the occurrence notwithstanding their drunken condition staggering to their feet with one accord and making the best of their way out on deck where they sought to sober themselves by plunging their heads into buckets of water having to some extent succeeded in this endeavour they next bethought themselves of the desirability of putting the ship to rights it was still blowing very heavily and the sea was higher than ever dangerously so indeed as the ship had more than once narrowly escaped being poopedbut the sky looked a trifle less wild than before and the glass was rising rogers therefore determined as a first step to get up a new foresail bend and set it the sailroom was accordingly opened and then in pursuance of their resolution to do as little work as possible themselves the prisoners in the forecastle were brought up on deck and ordered first to rouse out the sail and then to go aloft and bend it this the unfortunate passengers aided and directed by the captain at length accomplished though it was at the imminent risk of their lives the violent motion of the ship momentarily threatening to send themunaccustomed as they were to such workwhirling off the yard into the sea the sail being bent it was loosed and set closereefed after which the disabled ship not only steered more easily but also became more steady all further danger too of being pooped was at an end the spare spars were next cast adrift and preparations made for getting new topmasts on end as soon as the weather should moderate sufficiently and thus passed that eventful day walford was soon found to be so exceedingly timid when aloft that he was not only of no use there he was absolutely a clog and hindrance to the efforts of the others he was accordingly relegated to the ignominious post of cooks mate in which an abundance of the dirtiest work was carefully provided for him on the second day after his assumption of his new duties this unfortunate individual while engaged in the task of getting up coals from the forepeak was unlucky enough to capsize the lamp which he was using and so set the ship on fire instead of giving the alarm instantly as he ought to have done he rushed on deck with the intention of getting some buckets of water and endeavouring to extinguish the fire unaided no sooner however did he make his appearance than he was hustled peremptorily off by the cook upon another errand and when he returned a quarter of an hour later the forecastle was all ablaze and the smoke just beginning to curl up through the scuttle then indeed he shouted fire with all his might and at the terrible cry all hands rushed forward to find the alarm only too true in the first mad hurry and confusion no one seemed to think of inquiring how the fire had originated and walford was beginning to congratulate himself that whatever happened his complicity would not be suspected when talbot happening to run up against him stopped abruptly and exclaimed ha you lubber i saw you creeping up and down the forecastle ladder just now as gingerly as a cat walking upon hot bricksyou ought to know something about this joband by jove you do too i can see it by the blink of your eyesso out with it you longshore lanternjawed son of a baked monkey to this elegant adjuration walford began to stammer out an exculpatory explanation which however was abruptly nipped in the bud by the boatswains mate exclaiming there belay all that and coil up the slack of your jawingtackle theres no time to talk now tail on there and try to make yourself useful but look out my lad if this fire gets the upper hand of us curse me if we dont leave you to roast in it a vigorous attack upon the fire was speedily organised rogers and talbot each taking command of a separate party which they were careful so to arrange that there should be no possibility of their prisoners concerting together in a successful attempt to retake the ship so far however as the passengers were concerned they appeared to be far too anxious to subdue the flames to have time for any other thought or consideration all through the ensuing night this curiouslyconstituted party laboured in their efforts to get the upper hand of the fire but it had been allowed to obtain too firm a hold upon the ship before the alarm was given much of the cargo was of a highly combustible nature and though by the zeal and energy with which all hands worked they succeeded to some extent in retarding the progress of the flames when day at length broke it became apparent to all that the ship was doomed when at last they were compelled from sheer exhaustion to desist for a time from their longcontinued and fatiguing efforts the factwhich had hitherto escaped their noticebecame apparent that happily the gale had blown itself out the wind had already dropped considerably and the sea though it was still very high no longer broke in its former dangerous and menacing fashion upon seeing this rogers at once came to the determination not to waste any further labour in the useless endeavour to save the ship but to devote all his energies to the getting of the boats safely into the water the mutineers were by this time perfectly sober once more and having shaken off with their intoxication the recklessness which it had engendered they felt keenly anxious to escape the responsibility of any further waste of human life but as usual in such cases their own escape not only from the danger of being burnt with the ship but also from the punishment due to their misdeeds was of paramount importance with them before commencing therefore upon the difficult task of launching the boats rogers informed his unfortunate prisoners that he was willing to give them a couple of boats with all necessary provisions and water if they would individually take a solemn oath never to reveal any of the circumstances connected with the mutiny nor to say or do anything which would place the mutineers within the power of the law if they would do this they might have the boats if not he informed them that they would be left on board the burning ship and that the mutineers would take such measures as would effectually preclude any possibility of escape under the circumstances the prisoners had no alternative but to comply which they did and the launching of the boats was then vigorously proceeded with this task after an immense amount of difficulty and two or three exceedingly narrow escapes from the accident of having the boats stove or swamped was at length satisfactorily accomplished after which no time was lost in provisioning and manning them as soon as the boats were ready to receive them the ladies were summoned from the saloon to take their places therein the poor creatures could hardly be persuaded in their terror and distraction to leave even such inefficient protection as the saloon afforded them so great was their horror and repugnance at the idea of being brought once more even though it might be for ever so short a time into the presence and propinquity of the mutineers and when at length they emerged from the saloon and standing upon the wet and slippery deck glanced first aloft at the splintered spars the tattered remains of the sails and the ends and bights of rope streaming in the wind then at the great tongues of flame and clouds of smoke which enwrapped the forepart of the ship and lastly over the side at the boats tossing like eggshells upon the mountainous seas which swept hissing past their courage entirely failed them and it was not until rogers growing impatient at the delay strode up to them and gave them the choice of going instantly and without further ado over the side and into the boats or of being left behind altogether that they could be persuaded to essay the dangerous adventure at length however by the exercise of great care and circumspection on the part of all concerned the transshipment of the ladies was safely effected and then the gentlemen were ordered to go the husband of the unhappy lady who had been so cruelly driven to suicide had been for some time eagerly looking about for his wife and not seeing her he at last made inquiry of the other ladies as to her whereabouts his grief when the dreadful news of her death was gradually broken to him with all that gentleness of which a womans tender loving heart alone is capable was something pitiful to witness he rushed into the saloon and entering the stateroom in which the poor ladys inanimate body had been reverently deposited by her companions in misfortune flung himself upon his knees by the side of the berth and uttered alternately the wildest prayers that heaven would pardon her act of desperation and the bitterest curses upon the heads of those who had driven her to it it was with the utmost difficulty that he was at last persuaded by captain arnold to bid an eternal farewell to the beloved remains and to join the rest of the party in the boats allotted to them on hearing the order given for the gentlemen to pass down into the boats walford mingled with the group and pressed quietly forward to the gangway having a vivid remembrance of talbots terrible threat and not caring to remind him of it by a too obtrusive exhibition of his anxiety to escape but in consequence of the still heavy run of the sea several of the mutineersboth rogers and talbot being among themwere assisting at the transfer and when walfords turn came to pass down over the side he was summarily ordered back by the boatswains mate who gruffly exclaimed as his eye fell upon the quaking lieutenant here you stand back will yer your turn aint come yet walford at once fell back in a state of most painful trepidation but still hopeful that he would be allowed to go with the rest when all the passengers but himself however had passed down the side the order was given for them to cast off which they at once did ignorant or forgetful of the fact that one of their number still remained behind walford was about to rush to the gangway and hail the fast receding boat when the everwatchful talbot caught him by the collar and flung him from him with an ah would yer and a kick which sent the unfortunate officer sprawling upon the deck it was now the turn of the mutineers to take to the boats and it was not long before they stood in the gangway each with the bag containing his few belongings in his hand waiting to be passed in turn down over the side rogers rapidly ran his eye over them satisfied himself that everybody was present and then began to call out their names in the order in which they were to leave the ship when one boat had received its complement and shoved off walford once more pressed forward half wild with anxiety now and begged in piteous terms that he might not be left on board as now seemed to be the actual determination of the mutineers upon this talbot lost all patience with him and seizing him once more by the collar thrust him before him into the saloon exclaiming as he did so now look here you meddlesome young jackanapes theres been enough blood spilt on board this ship alreadychiefly in consekence of your havin shoved in your oar where it werent wanted and advisin the skipper to flog a sick manand i dont want to have to shed any more you understand wery well then you stay in here until that there clock have marked off a good halfhour arter that you may come out and do the best you can for yourself theres plenty o spars knockin about the decks here which you can lash together and make a tiptop raft out of em upon which you can go for a cruise on your own account but if you shows your ugly head outside this here cabin before the halfhours out damn me if i wont lash your neck and heels together and heave you into the middle of the fire there forard comprenny so saying he coolly shifted the key from the inside to the outside of the saloondoor slammed the latter turned the key and then the wretched walford heard the heavy tramp of his footsteps upon the deck rapidly growing fainter and more faint as he walked away chapter nine driven to madness as the key turned in the lock walford sank down in a state of semistupefaction upon one of the saloon sofas listening like one in a dream to the distant sound of the mens voices and the occasional tramp of feet as the mutineers passed one by one down the ships side into the boats a few minutes more and these sounds ceased he lifted up his head listening eagerly but he could hear nothing save the dismal creaking of the bulkheads the moaning of the wind the monotonous swish swish of the water washing across the deck outside with the roll of the ship and the dull hum and crackling of the flames as they slowly ate their destructive way further and further into the heart of the doomed craft were they actually gone he asked himself was it possible that he was left alone absolutely alone on that burning wreck thousands of miles from the nearest land drifting he knew not whither at the mercy of wind and wave with no hope of rescue and with the certainty that in a day or two at most the fabric which bore him would be so completely enveloped in the flames kindled by his own clumsiness that it would no longer be tenable and the only alternative open to him would be that of perishing in the fire or flinging himself into the sea there to battle despairingly for an extra hour or two of life he could not believe it he would not believe it possible that men could be found so inhuman as to leave a fellowmortal in so desperate a strait they were only trying him as they had tried that poor fellow thomson and if he would but have patience to wait until the stipulated halfhour had passed he would find them still there waiting to receive him into the boat he laughed aloud as he thought what a fool he had been to allow himself to be terrified even for a moment but the laugh was so utterly the reverse of mirthful so harsh and ghastly that he stopped abruptly startled by the hideous strangeness of the sounds then he rose and crept on tiptoe towards the saloondoor and on reaching it crouched down and applied first his eye and then his ear to the keyhole the key had been removed from the lock and the shield had fallen down over the opening outside so that he was unable to see anything neither could he detect any sounds indicative of the presence of others on board once or twice indeed he thought he caught the sound of whispered voices just outside the door but he could not be sure about the matter and in an agony of uncertainty he crept back to the sofa to watch the lagging minutehand of the clock and wait for the expiration of the halfhour oh what a weary time was that for the lonely watcher as he sat there with his hands tightly locked together his frame quivering with anxiety and apprehension and his eyes fixed upon that inexorable minutehand which would not hasten its movement though his life might be dependent on it what if the men should grow weary of waiting a thousand horrible fancies crowded in upon him until in his distraction he groaned aloud the suspense became unendurable and in his anguish he started up to burst open the saloondoor and learn the worst at once but remembering talbots threat and more than halfbelieving him to be capable of carrying it into execution turned back again and fell to pacing rapidly to and fro the whole length of the saloon instead at last at last the halfhour of penance was over and he was free once more he dashed at the locked saloondoor and frantically hammering upon it with his clenched firsts until his knuckles streamed with blood shouted eagerly talbot talbot the halfhour is up so open the door please and let me out theres a good fellow then he applied his ear to the keyhole listening eagerly for the first sound of approaching footsteps five secondsten secondstwentythirtya minute why did they not come was it possible that they had not heard him he applied his mouth to the joint between the door and its jamb and again shouted talbot talbot talbot until his voice cracked with the strain he put upon it still no answer no sound save the wail of the wind the wash of the water and the creaking of the ships timbers good god were they really gone was he after all actually left there to die alone he seized the handle of the door and tugged at it fiercely desperately with the strength of a madman but the stout lock stood firm defying his utmost efforts then he suddenly remembered that the captains cabin was situated on the other side of the ship with one door opening into the saloon and the other out on deck with a single bound and a wild cry he crossed the saloon and laying his hand upon the handle of the door of the captains cabin turned it the door swang open another bound and he was at the outer door was it locked no a twist of the handle and he stepped out on deck with the water surging and splashing over his feet but what cared he then for such a trifle he was not even conscious of it swiftly his gaze swept round the decks they were empty in an instant he was at the gangway and peering over the side no boats there nothing but the empty tackles of the quarterboats alternately swinging in the air and trailing in the water with the roll of the ship where were the boats ha towing astern of course it would simply mean destruction to them if they attempted to remain alongside in so heavy a sea in frantic haste he scrambled up the poopladder and rushed aft the boats were gone then it was an absolute fact that he was left there alone and powerless doomed to watch with a horrible fascination the steady relentless approach of the grim enemy in his most terrible form and to suffer the while in imaginative anticipation all the agonies of a thousand fiery deaths oh god it was too much mercy mercy and with a demoniac yell he stood clutching and tugging at his hair with both hands his teeth clenched his eyes fixed and almost bursting from their sockets foam bubbling from his lipsa raving madman this terrible state of distraction endured for nearly an hour and then a species of numbness seized upon his faculties his anxiety vanished and he found his thoughts straying away and fixing themselves upon the veriest trivialities conjuring up again before his mental vision acts and words which had never recurred to him since the day on which they had been done or said mischievous practical jokes played off upon some unlucky schoolfellow messroom jests and tattle and a thousand other absurdities at which he laughed aloud then disconnected words and phrases rushed helterskelter through his seething brain having no meaning yet causing him the keenest annoyance because he believed he had heard them before and was anxious to connect them with the circumstances of their utterance there was one in particular which especially tormented him go for a cruise on your own account go for a cruise on your own account his brain reiterated with merciless pertinacity what did it mean where had he heard those words before and who had uttered them he felt absolutely certain that at some time or other he had heard that phrase spoken and that it had some intimate connection with himself that it somehow concerned him vitally there was something else too said at the same timesomething aboutabout what was it something aboutah yesspars and a raftsparsraft go for a cruise on your own account what could it mean finally a gleam of reason returned to his clouded mind and he realised dimly that it was of the utmost importance that he should construct a raft and go for a cruise on his own account having at last grasped this idea he rose from the seat upon which he had flung himself and upon which he seemed to himself to have been sitting as long as ever he could remember and proceeded to carry it out sauntering leisurely off the poop he descended to the waist of the ship repeating eagerly over and over again the words sparsraft lest he should forget them there were several spare spars of various sizes ranging from topmasts down to studdingsail booms lashed to the deck on each side of the mainhatchway and these he deliberately set to work to cast adrift with considerable difficulty he at length succeeded in accomplishing this task the result being that the spars were set rolling athwart the deck with the roll of the ship nothing daunted by this however he dashed recklessly in among them and escaping heaven knows how from the incessant danger of fractured limbs managed to drag out one after the other and launch overboard several of the lighter spars having commenced the work he now toiled persistently on allowing himself neither pause nor rest until he had disposed of every spar which his unaided strength would allow him to move then panting breathless and reeking with perspiration he walked to the side and peered over the spars were nowhere to be seen in his madness it had never occurred to him to secure them with ropes and they had consequently drifted astern and were of course tossing some of them miles away in the wake of the ship somehow the loss of the spars caused him no distress indeed as a matter of fact he had again forgotten all about the raft and had continued to labour on merely because it had not occurred to him to stop now that he had stopped however he began to be conscious not only of fatigue but also of hunger for he had tasted no food for nearly twentyfour hours and had been working hard all through the night so he made his way by instinct into the saloon and thence to the stewards pantry where he found an abundance of food which he attacked ravenously he then after satisfying his hunger bent his steps in the direction of his own stateroom and entering flung himself upon the bed and soon sank into an uneasy and restless sleep meanwhile the wind had been steadily dropping the sea going down at the same time and when just before sunset the glorious orb burst through and dispersed the curtain of stormtattered clouds which had for so long a time overspread the sky his golden rays fell upon the princess royal now no longer rolling gunwaleunder but swinging with a slow stately motion over the long swell and still drifting lazily to the eastward her bows heading now this way now that her foremast burned through and towing over the side and the flames in complete possession of her as far aft as the mainmast walfords sleep if such it could be called lasted all through the night and until just before the dawn then the overpowering heat and smoke the loud crackling roar of the flames and the fierce ruddy light streaming into the saloon and through the open stateroom door aroused him sitting up in his berth he looked around him in a bewildered way passing his hand impatiently over his brow repeatedly as if striving to recall distinctly the remembrance of something vaguely haunting his memory but ever eluding his mental grasp glancing vacantly around him the red glare of the flames fascinated his gaze and he turned to watch the leaping flickering flashes of light as they came and went with the sway and roll of the ship red he began to mutter red as blood blood who said that i had been the cause of bloodshed who dares to say that it is my hand which has splashed those wallsthat floorwith such hideous stains ha see how they leap and dance rise and fall the place is full of them horrible horrible are they there to taunt me to reproach me to accuse me i say i did not do it i am not to blame how could i know thatthatwhat was it let me think his blood is upon your hands whose hands not mine i swear i could not do it i have not the nerve the courage for it his blood is upon your hands who said that it was not said to me but staywas i to blamewas it my fault ugh what a terrible thing it was to see him standing there with the rope round his neck to know that they were going to take away his life for a fault which perhaps he would never have committed but for me and to feel that i had not the courage to intercede in his behalf to stand there quaking with fear whilst he was driven to his death no no i did not drive him to it it was they and i had no control over thembutbutah i never tried to save him yes yes i am coming is that you thomson are you calling me he sprang out of his berth and making his way through the captains cabin passed out on deck the first faint rays of the approaching dawn were lighting up the eastern horizon but he saw them not they were effectually hidden from his sight by the dazzling brightness of the flames and the dense clouds of smoke which went rolling heavily to leeward before the now scanty wind the fire had made steady progress during the night the hull forward being burned down nearly to the waters edge while aft the flames had extended to the after hatchway and the mainmast burnt through at its heel had gone by the board and fallen forward into the fiercest of the fire where it was rapidly consuming luckily for the wretched walford the ship was once more dead before the wind and the flames were fanned forward had her head been in the opposite direction his retreat would have been effectually cut off as it was the heat was so intense that he instinctively avoided it by springing up the poopladder and making his way as far aft as possible arrived at the extreme end of the poop he stood gazing intently down into the black water and presently he began muttering again yes he said pointing down into the hollow of the swell as it came creeping up after the ship that is the spot where he went down i saw him i was standing near the bulwarks and when he sprang my eyes followed him i heard his dying cry and i saw his last agonised upward look of despair as he went down with a plunge into the hollow between the waves and the waters closed over his head for ever for ever yes surelyand yetwhat is that white gleaming object there now glaring up at me from beneath the water it isit is the face of the dead man ha see he is beckoning to me then it was his voice i heard calling to me listenwhat was that did you call thomson he will not answer he is tired of calling but the white ghastly face is still there andseethere too is the beckoning hand it is my summons and i must obey at that moment the weird plaintive scream of a seabird came floating down out of the grey shadows of the dawn and walford starting violently stood for a moment in an attitude of rapt attention the cry was repeated he glared wildly round him for an instant and then screaming hoarsely i comei come sprang over the guardrails and into the sea chapter ten a strange rencontre we left the aurora as the reader will remember at the moment when by the merest hairs breadth she was enabled to avoid what must have been a terribly disastrous collision with the illfated princess royal on the day when the hurricane burst with such destructive effect upon the outwardbound fleet deprived of her foretopsail the little barque was soon left astern by her two unwelcome neighbours andthe fleet rapidly dispersing now that it was no longer possible to regulate the speed of the several craft which composed itby nightfall her crew found themselves comparatively speaking alone there being only some twenty sail in sight from the deck that night was a most anxious one for captain leicester the gale being heavier and the sea considerably higher than he had ever before witnessed the aurora however proved to be a capital little seaboat riding over the great liquid hills light and dry as a gull and when at length the morning broke revealing only two sail in sight george felt so easy in his mind that he did not hesitate to go below and seek in his comfortable berth an hour or two of that rest which he so greatly needed the first stroke of the hurricane had been as is generally the case the worst for about half an hour it had blown with frightful and disastrous fury as has already been described after which it lulled somewhat and then had again steadily increased accordingly when captain leicester went on deck at noon he found the gale still gathering strength the sea higher than ever and the sky looking more threatening than he remembered to have ever before seen it the ship was scudding under bare poles and behaving capitally too but george saw that if the sea rose much higher there would be great danger of being pooped so helike the people on board the unfortunate princess royalroused out a new foresail and with very great difficulty got it bent and set reefed this sail dragged the little barque along at a tremendous pace and from that time there was no further danger of her being pooped or overrun by the sea on the third day the gale broke and by sundown the weather had so far moderated as to permit of the aurora being brought to the wind and hoveto a manoeuvre which george was most anxious to accomplish since the ship had for over seventytwo hours been running to the eastward or directly away from her port at the rate of some ten knots an hour giving her over seven hundred miles of extra distance to make up the aurora remained hoveto during the whole of that night but at eight bells next morning she made sail under singlereefed topsails and courses stretching away to the northward and westward on the port tack she continued on this tack all day and went about at the end of the second dogwatch georges object being to work his way back to the spot as nearly as possible where the fleet had separated and there wait two or three days if need be in the hope of falling in with the bulk of them again captain leicester had of course taken full advantage of the return of fine weather to repair damages the crew had been busy during the whole day getting two new topgallantmasts aloft and rigging them bending new sails in place of those split or blown away and so on the aurora was consequently when night fell all ataunto once more and a stranger looking at her would except for the new look of some of the spars and canvas never have suspected that she had had her wings clipped at nightfall she was standing to the southward and westward on the port tack under every stitch of canvas that would draw the wind was failing fast the sea had long since ceased to break there was now only an occasional white fleecy comb to be seen on the crests of the waves and the ship was gliding gently along with a slow steady rhythmical risingandfalling motion over the long heavy swell at the rate of some five knots in the hour the skipper was in excellent spirits at having escaped so well and so cheaply from the fury of the hurricane and he remained on deck until midnight chatting with mr bowen the chief mate the reliefwatch had just been called and george was waiting to accompany the mate below when his attention was suddenly attracted by a curious appearance in the sky to windward it was still cloudy and low down on the horizon and about two points on the weather bow he noticed that the clouds were lighter and brighter in tint than anywhere else look bowen he exclaimed do you see that peculiarlooking cloud away there on the horizon just over our cathead what is the meaning of it the mate looked in the direction indicated and his more mature experience at once suggested an explanation looks to me he said as if there was something afire over there here you tom to a lad belonging to the reliefwatch who had just come on deck slip up as far as the foretopmast crosstrees and see if you can see anything out of the common away there on the weather bow ay ay sir answered the lad and in another moment he was dancing nimbly up the forerigging his form just dimly discernible in the dark shadow of the sails presently he hailed from the crosstrees i cant see nothing sir but the sky away over there looks uncommon bright and it seems to flicker now and then as if there was a big fire burning under it thatll do you can come down again answered the chief mate then turning to george he said depend upon it sir theres a ship afire away over there well were steering a course asll take us pretty close to her if so be as there is one and i suppose sir youll feel like giving of her a overhaul wont you most certainly answered george earnestly we will at least ascertain whether there are any human beings on board her mr ritsonto the carpenter who since crosss impressment had acted in the capacity of second matesteer your present course please as long as the wind will allow you crack on all you can and as soon as the burning shipor whatever it isis fairly in sight give me a call he then descended to his cabin and in another five minutes had fallen into a state of blissful oblivion at eight bells or four oclock am ritson knocked at georges stateroom door after calling the chief mate and said we can see the flames and smoke from the deck sir though the ship herself is still hulldown ive been up in the foretop howsoever with the glass and make her out to be a large shipclose upon a thousand tons i should saybut i cant see any people on board of her nor i cant make out no sign of boats shes all ablaze from forard right aft as far as the mainmast which toppled over and fell forard while i was lookin at her i fancy the people must ha left her sir all right ritson answered george ill be on deck in a minute or two within the stipulated time captain leicester made his appearance on deck and proceeded at once to the foretop where with the aid of his glass he made a careful inspection of the burning ship well mr bowen he said when he had completed his examination and was once more down on deck it is as ritson says there is no sign of any human being on board her i have looked long and carefully at her and am quite sure i should have seen the people moving about had there been any we will stand on as we are going however and cross her stern we shall then perhaps get a chance to make out her name somehow she has a familiar look with her as though i had seen her before i wonder if she was in the fleet like enough sir answered bowen were right in the track of em and maybe this is one of the slowcoaches as we run away from possibly answered george abstractedly and then the two fell to pacing slowly fore and aft from the mainmast to the taffrail in that persevering way which is so characteristic of seamen the aurora was now sliding gently along at a speed of about four knots with every sail set that would draw and gradually she crept up closer and closer to the burning ship which meanwhile was slowly drifting to leeward the watch on deck were clustered together in a body forward watching the unusual sight the ship being now about a point on the lee bow and about half a mile distant suddenly there was a loud shout from them followed by the cry theres somebody still aboard the burning ship sir george and the mate who at the moment were walking towards the taffrail with their backs towards the burning ship turned quickly at the cry and the former hastily seizing the telescope which lay ready to hand on the skylight swiftly brought it to bear there sure enough standing right aft on the raised poop could be distinctly seen a solitary figure apparently that of a man he seemed to be gazing intently into the water astern pointing and gesticulating and was evidently wholly unaware of the approach of the aurora yes said george truly enough there is a man on board and he does not seem to have seen us yet perhaps the glare of the flames has dazzled his eyes just step down into the cabin mr bowen if you please and bring up a couple of muskets we will fire them one after the other and the reports will call his attention to the fact of our presence the mate turned away to do georges bidding and he had hardly disappeared down the companionladder when the skipper who had the telescope once more at his eye saw the figure startlook behind him as though he had heard some alarming soundand then spring in apparent terror into the sea hes jumped overboard sir reported the men forward who were now eagerly watching the actions of the stranger ay ay answered leicester i see he has one of you call the watch below the rest of you lay aft here and clear away the starboard gig cast off her lashings and get her ready for rousing off the gallows and into the water the gig which had been hanging at the davits ever since the aurora cleared out of the docks at london had been destroyed when the ship was thrown on her beamends in the hurricane and the men had been so busy on apparently more important duties that they had had no opportunity of getting another boat ready for service hence there was now a considerable amount of delay in the launching of the boat which george intended to despatch in search of the swimmer mr bowen soon returned to the deck with the muskets and handing one to george and retaining the other himself they fired them one after the other in rapid succession hoping by this means to attract the unfortunate mans attention and show him that help was near george then sprang into the mizzenrigging and looked anxiously out over the glittering surface of the sea in the effort to catch a glimpse of the man should he happen to be still above water it was not however until the aurora was fairly crossing the wake of the burning ship which by this time had drifted a considerable distance to leewardthat he was successful then indeed he did for an instant detect a small dark object on the crest of a sea standing out in bold relief against the bright ruddy reflection of the flames in the water beyond it almost at the instant that he caught sight of it he lost it again as it disappeared in the hollow of the swell then once more it rose into view clearly and unmistakably the head of a man all right i see him he exclaimed now then mr bowen is the boat ready i am going to that poor fellows assistance so back the maintopsail if you please and send the boat after us as quickly as you can as the last words left georges mouth his hands rose above his head his body curved itself over towards the water and in an instant he shot downward out of the rigging swiftly as a seabird making its swoop and entered the water without a splash on coming to the surface captain leicester struck vigorously out at once in the direction of the burning ship knowing that the man he sought was exactly in line with her but that he would probably not see him until he was close upon him he swam steadily on not hurrying himself but husbanding his strength as much as possible and in about ten minutes he caught sight of the object of which he was in search but the manner in which that object presented itself to his view was so startling that georges first impulse was to turn round and swim back towards the aurora with all speed an impulse which however was only felt to be instantly overcome the man was suddenly revealed within some six feet or so of georges grasp as the latter rose upon the crest of a sea but instead of swimming as george expected he would be the unfortunate creature was lying on his back his ghastly white face upturned to the sky and his eyes fixed and staring with that terrible indescribable expression in them which tells at once and unmistakably the dreadful tale of madness very naturally our hero felt a little doubtful as to the expediency of placing himself within the grasp of a madman he therefore before closing with him exclaimed in a loud cheery voice hillo there are you tired if so just say the word and ill drop alongside and lend you a hand for all the visible effect this speech had on the stranger he might as well have been stonedeaf for he vouchsafed not the slightest notice george shouted again with a like result and thenstill feeling very doubtful as to the best mode of proceedinghe struck out and swam quietly round the ghastly floating figure a stroke or two sufficed to place him in such a position as enabled him at last to get a clear and distinct view of the strangers features fully illumined by the glare of the flames and instant recognition followed walford he exclaimed then without another moments hesitation he dashed up and throwing himself upon his back seized his rival by the hair and drew him into such a position as permitted of his taking walfords head upon his shoulder and supporting it high enough above the surface to prevent the sea washing over it and so suffocating him walford offered no resistance and gave not the faintest sign of being aware of georges presence and there the two lay quietly floating on the bosom of the long heaving swell until the boat came to their assistance and conveyed them both on board the aurora on reaching the ship george had his rival promptly stripped rubbed vigorously down and comfortably bestowed in his own berth well and warmly wrapped up in blankets with tom priceone of the forecastle hands and a very smart intelligent young fellowto watch over him after which the skipper gave a little attention to his own comfort and finally went on deck once more it being by that time too late to think of turning in again by the time that george regained the deck the aurora had crept to a distance of about four miles from the princess royal the unfortunate craft was by that time blazing fiercely fore and aft the fire having at last reached her storeroom in which there was a considerable quantity of highly inflammable material and half an hour afterwards her powdermagazine almost every ship of any size in those days was provided with a magazine exploded and the charred fragments of halfconsumed timber which were widely scattered over the now sleepily heaving surface of the sea alone remained as relics of the once noble and stately ship the destruction of which had been the last link in a chain of disastrous occurrences resulting primarily from the overbearing tyrannical and imprudent behaviour of her officers with the appearance of the sun above the horizon the clouds gradually disappeared the wind dropped the surface of the ocean became like heaving oil and the aurora losing steerageway rolled almost gunwaleto with her canvas flapping loudly and monotonously against her masts about two bells or nine oclock one of the hands upon being sent aloft to grease down reported a sail in the southern quarter and on the usual inquiry being put to him as to what he made her out to be he replied that she was a small topsailschooner a small topsailschooner muttered george i wonder what she can be i cannot remember having seen any such craft in the fleet ritsonto the carpenter who had charge of the deckdo you remember having seen a topsailschooner among the fleet no sir cant say as i do answered ritson dont believe there was any such craft sir the smallest as i remembers was that purty little brig painted all white down to her waterline perhaps you recollects her sir yes said leicester i recollect the craft perfectly well and as far as my memory serves me she was as you say the smallest craft in company the conversation here dropped for a time george resuming the somewhat dejected saunter fore and aft from the mainmast to the taffrail and the halfunconscious whistling for a wind in which he had before been indulging his pursuit of this monotonous and uninteresting occupation was interrupted by the steward who requested him to step down into the cabin to take a look at the man as was picked up this morning as he seems to be took a bit worse sir george at once went below and found walford sitting up in the berth muttering to himself disconnectedly and occasionally addressing with great earnestness the watchful tom whose horrorstricken face plainly revealed that his patients random observations had been of a somewhat startling character on entering the stateroom leicester at once addressed walford asking him whether he felt better and the unfortunate man glanced for a moment in georges face with an air of semirecognition but this immediately passed away and the incoherent mutterings went on again as before thats just how heve been goin on for the last halfour explained tom talkin about murder and hangin and being left to burn in the ship its enough to give one the orrors to listen to him george sat down by the side of the cot and listened patiently for nearly an hour to walfords rambling talk and although he was unable to make out from it a clearlyconnected story he heard enough to give him a shrewd idea of the truth and to convince him that a terrible tragedy of some kind had occurred on board the illfated princess royal the patient at length grew calm once more and lying back upon his pillow seemed inclined to sleep upon which george quietly rose and went on deck again to see how matters were proceeding there as he meditatively made his way up the companionladder he could not help thinking of the singularity of this last meeting between him and his rival and comparing it with the one which had occurred on that lovely june evening on the road to stoke as the two men stood there on the white dusty road with the rays of the declining sun darting down upon them through the foliage of the overhanging trees and as walford told the story of his just concluded engagement to lucy how little thought george could either of them suspect that when they next came into such close contact it would be literally on the bosom of the broad atlantic upborne by nothing save its restless waters poor leicester was greatly disturbed by this singular and unconscious claim upon his hospitality which had so recently arisen he was as generoushearted a man as the sun ever shone upon ever ready to give liberally and ungrudgingly to any one who seemed to be in need but somehow he wished that in the present instance it had fallen to the lot of some one else than himself to play the part of rescuer and benefactor or that the rescued individual had been any one rather than walford the fact was that he wanted to forget if possible the keen and bitter pain of his disappointment and now the presence of his unhappy guest had brought it all back to him and would keep it in poignant remembrance as long as they two should remain together then he bethought himself how selfish a feeling he had been allowing himself to indulge how utterly he had forgotten that the matter was one with which lucys happiness must be inseparably connected and that fateor providence rather as he reverently corrected himselfhad in a very great measure confided that happiness to his keeping by delivering into his care the man upon whom she had bestowed the priceless treasure of her hearts best love and as he thought this he solemnly vowed that he would honestly strive to prove worthy of the trust that he would be to lucys lover a brother ay more than a brother that he would nurse and tend him restore to him his reason if god willed it and in any case watch over and protect himat the cost of his own life even if need wereuntil he could restore him to the arms of the woman who was impatiently awaiting at home his safe return his wellbeing has been confided to me as a sacred trust he murmured in conclusion and please god i will prove myself worthy of it with this resolution he dismissed the subject temporarily from his thoughts and turned his attention once more to the affairs of the ship glancing aloft and then all round the horizon he observed that it had fallen a flat calm and that moreover there was no immediate prospect of a breeze the sky was a clear deep blue in the zenith merging by imperceptible gradations into a delicate warm grey at the horizon the water was absolutely without a ripple there was not so much as the faintest suggestion of a catspaw on all its glassy surface and save for the long sluggish sweep and heave of the swell which as it undulated past the ship caught and reflected the varying tints of the sky it would have been difficult to detect the presence of water at all at a distance of more than a few yards from the ship the aurora was still rolling sluggishly on the sleepy swell her dazzling white canvas flapping and the slings and trusses of the yards creaking with the roll the men rendered languid by the heat were making such show as they were able of being busy on various odd jobs about the decks or aloft and the man at the wheel had lashed it and was leaning upon it more than halfasleep ritson apparently for want of something better to do was seated on the maintopmast crosstrees with the ships telescope in his hand scrutinising the motions of the distant schooner whose tiny royal was now visible from the deck gleaming white as snow on the extreme verge of the horizon noting all these things at a glance george turned to saunter aft thinking that on such a perfectly calm day and with such still water he might by leaning well out over the taffrail get a glimpse of the ships bottom and see whether it had fouled at all or whether the copper showed any signs of wrinkling arrived at the taffrail he leaned well out over it and peered down into the water the first thing which attracted his notice was the deep pure beautiful ultramarine tint of the water as he gazed far down into its unfathomable depths the next was the presence of a long greyishbrown object under the ships counter which had escaped his notice at first in consequence of its being in the deepest shadow of the hull a moment sufficed to satisfy him that it was a huge shark and as the creature caught sight of him and with a barely perceptible movement of its fins backed out a foot or two from under the ship as if in preparation to make a dart at him in case he should fall into the water george shuddered at the thought of what might have been his or walfords fate had the monster been in the neighbourhood of the ship a few hours earlier sliding his body gently inboard again leicester turned to the dozing helmsman and exclaimed here you ned rouse up man theres a big shark under the counter so get out the sharkhook ask the cook for a piece of good fat pork and muster the watch aft in readiness to haul him inboard in case we can coax him into swallowing the bait chapter eleven a suspicious sail the man hurried away joyously to do georges bidding hailing his comrades aloft to knock off work and come sharkfishing all you seadogs aloft there as soon as he had placed a sufficiently respectful distance between himself and his skipper there is no sport or pastime in which sailors will engage more eagerly than in the attempt to capture a shark they regard the creature as their worst and most relentless enemy and never willingly let slip an opportunity to catch and destroy one frequently venting their hatred upon the unfortunate fish when caught in the utmost refinement of cruelty accordingly no sooner was neds hail heard than dropping incontinently whatever work they happened to be engaged on the whole watch ritson included hurried down on deck and aft to the taffrail to take a share in the sport ritson by virtue of his superior rank assumed the lead at once and as a matter of course taking the hook with its swivel and chain attached and a piece of fat pork some three or four pounds in weight from the now lively and wideawake ned he called out for a bit of stoutish line busying himself meanwhile in burying the hook cunningly in the bait in order that the shark might not see itfor it is a wellestablished fact that these monsters unless very hungry are acute enough to refuse a bait if the hook is not well hidden the line in the shape of the gafftopsail halliardfall hastily unrove for the occasion was soon forthcoming and the hook being at last baited to the second mates satisfaction bent on to the chain now stand clear commanded ritson as he prepared to pitch the bait overboard stand clear all of yer and when i gives the word to haul in walk away forard with the line and bring his head out of water a long steady pendulumlike swing or two of the bait followed and then away it went out over the stern and into the water with a splash leicester who was leaning over the taffrail and watching the proceedings with the greatest interest saw the great fish turn like a flash and rush to the spot where the bait had fallen turning himself over on his side as he did so hurrah he bites hes got it shouted one of the men eagerly but he spoke rather too soon jack shark was not to be caught quite so easily instead of opening his great jaws and swallowing the bait hook and all at a gulp as was expected he stopped dead in his rush and began to poke the bait about suspiciously with the point of his shovelshaped nose and finally with a contemptuous whisk of his tail left it and resumed his former position under the ships quarter great was the disappointment of the younger hands at this failure he aint hungry explained one aint he contemptuously retorted another just you drop overboard and try him bo why hed take yousouwester waterboots and all down that mainhatchway of hisn without winking and then come back and axe for more no no taint that mates hes waiting for somebody most likely for the poor chap as the skipper picked up this mornin come stow all that rubbish exclaimed the second mate how do you expect were going to catch the brute if you all stand there palavering like so many fishwives its enough to frighten him away altogether clap a stopper on your jawtackles now all of you and give me a chance to play him a bit the speaker thereupon by sundry dexterous movements of the wrist imparted a gentle wriggling motion to the line which in its turn conveyed a corresponding motion to the bait the latter being slowly drawn through the water at the same time this was too much for the sharks equanimity and he made another dash at the bait still refusing to swallow it however the second mate then tried the virtue of a few quick jerks upon the bait as though drawing it away from the creature which had the effect of causing him to turn once more on his side and make a snap at it actually taking it into his mouth still he would neither swallow it nor close his jaws upon it but unresistingly suffered it to be jerked out of his mouth again well have him yet boys ritson exclaimed pay out the line to its bare end this was done the shark keeping close to the bait turning it over and over with his nose but persistently refusing to take it now walk away steadily forard with your line and stand by for a surge was the next command away went the men dragging the line after them and towing the bait through the water the shark followed it closely up and at last just as the pork was being dragged out of the water altogether he made a determined jump at it swallowing it and the hook together and the next moment the men were broughtup all standing by the tremendous strain on the line as the hook buried its barbed point in the creatures body while the water was lashed into foam and splashed clear in over the barques taffrail in the fishs frantic efforts to free itself hurrah exclaimed ritson now you have him lads hold on every inch of line or hell break away from you yet bear a hand here one of you take the spankersheet and throw a runningbowline round the line sos we can get it down over his fins thats your sort ned dont let him get it into his jaws cleverly done haul taut now we have him safe lead the sheet forard let all hands tail on to it and well run him up out of the water and in on deck the bowline in the end of the sheet having been successfully passed over the fishs shoulders and under his fins the rope was laid along the deck and the watch leaving one by one the line to which the hook was attached got hold of the sheet and then with a joyous shout of stamp and go boys walk away with him they dragged the monster still struggling furiously up out of the water and in on deck over the taffrail for a moment the huge fish lay perfectly still then he began to plunge about and lash right and left with his tail in a manner which caused the whole ship to resound with the terrific blows rousing the watch below and causing them to tumble up en masse to ascertain the nature of the disturbance ware tail exclaimed the second mate warningly if any of you chaps catches a smack with it across your shins itll snap em like pipestems wheres the cooks axe the question was promptly answered by the appearance of cookie himself his sable visage beaming and his eyeballs rolling with delight as he danced nimbly about the deck dodging the strokes of that terrible tail with his gleaming axe upraised in readiness to deal a blow at the first opportunity at length there was a momentary pause in the tremendous struggles a pause of which snowball all black cooks who go to sea seem to be dubbed snowball promptly availed himself a quick flash of his axeblade in the sun a dull crunching thud and the backbone was severed at the junction of the tail with the body a lightninglike stroke of his long keen knife followed and the severed tail was flung quivering aside as a long thin jet of blood spouted out from the body broadly staining the snowwhite deckplanks but the shark had plenty of fight left in him still as one of the men speedily discovered when on thrusting a handspike into the great jaws the strong stout wooden bar was promptly bitten in two here lay hold two or three of you and capsize him ordered ritson we must make an end of the beast or some of yerll get hurted yet i can see now then as three of the men seized the shark by his enormous fins one two three and over with him with a cry of yo heave he and a hearty drag the great fish was turned over on his back and then snowball stepping forward once more placed himself astride the creature and with a quick powerful stroke of his knife slit open its belly and so put an end to its sufferings but so tenacious of life was it that even after the removal of the vital organs the heart was seen to be still expanding and contracting which it continued to do for fully five minutes after being taken out of the fish the head was next cut off and the backbone removed for preservation as curios after which the mutilated carcass was thrown overboard and the decks washed down ritson did not wait for the completion of this operation but leaving its superintendence to mr bowen who like the rest of the watch below had come on deck to see what was the cause of the unusual tumult retired once more with the telescope to his former post in the maintopmast crosstrees and resumed his scrutiny of the strange schooner george noticed this and vaguely wondering what had so greatly excited his second mates curiosity glanced in the direction to which the telescope was pointing to find to his surprise that the upper half of the strangers topsail was visible from the deck why ritson he hailed the schooner must have a little air of wind surely she is nearing us perceptibly ritson entirely contrary to nautical etiquette made no reply to the skippers hail but remained with his eye immovably glued to the tube for a full minute longer when he gently closed the instrument and descended slowly to the deck arrived there he walked up to captain leicester and first glancing cautiously round to make sure that no one was within earshot murmured in a low voice shes heading as straight for us as she can steer sir with six sweeps outthree of a side that means sir that her skipper wants so badly to get alongside of us that hes noways particular about the trouble he takes to bring him here george gave a low involuntary whistle of astonishment that is queer news indeed he remarked after a contemplative pause and you think then ritson that the craft is a a rover sir neither more nor less answered the second mate she aint french im certain she aint got the look of it besides the johnnies wouldnt ventur so far as this in a craft of that sizewhy she aint more than about a hundred and twenty tons at the very outside no shes a rover thats what she is a craft with a low beamy hull painted all black tremendous long spars and canvas with just no end of a hist to it give me the glass said george ill go as far as the crosstrees and take a look at her myself the second mate handed over the telescope and the skipper proceeding aloft soon saw quite enough to satisfy him that ritsons conjectures as to the character and intentions of the schooner were only too likely to prove correct descending once more to the deck he held a hurried consultation with his two officers the result of which was a determination to fight to the last gasp if the crew were only willing to stand by them it would be necessary to ascertain their feeling upon the subject before anything could be done so it being then within a quarter of an hour of noon george and the chief mate went below for their quadrants took the suns meridian altitude and on the bell being struck to denote the hour of noon and the termination of the morning watch captain leicester gave the word for all hands to muster aft my lads said george when the men were all standing before him in obedience to his summons i have called you here in order that i may communicate to you a very disagreeable piece of intelligence briefly it is this the strange schooner yonder is a very suspiciouslooking craft mr ritson and i who have both carefully examined her through the glass are quite of the same opinion about her namely that she is a pirate she has all the look of one and her conduct tends greatly to confirm us in our suspicions for she has rigged out half a dozen sweeps and is sweeping as straight down for us as she can come now lads i want to know what you propose to do in the event of our suspicions proving correct will you allow her to come alongside and throw her bloodthirsty crew in on our deck to cut our throats as if we were so many sheep or will you fight for your lives and take your chance of being able to beat her off there was a few minutes of anxious consultation among the men and then ned stepped forward as spokesman of the party and asked what would you advise us to do sir what do you think of doin yourself sir if we may make so bold as to axe mr bowen mr ritson and i have resolved to fight as long as we can raise a hand in selfdefence answered george and my advice to you is to do the same alone we three men cannot hope to do much but with your aid i certainly should not despair of beating off yonder schooner even though she be full of men and if the worst comes to the worst and we find that we must die it will be far better to do so with swords in our hands than to be slaughtered in cold blood yes yes thats true none o that for me thankee and sundry other exclamations of concurrence followed the conclusion of the skippers speech then came another very brief consultation and finally ned once more stepped forward and said weve agreed sir as youre in the rights of it about the fightin and were quite ready to stand by yerall hands of usand do our best very well said george then we will lose no time in making ready for our defence mr bowen we will have up that brass long ninepounder which is down below i provided it for just such an emergency as this ay ay sir answered the mate in a cheery tone of voice which spoke volumes as to his confidence in their ability to beat off the pirate if such the schooner should prove to be then turning to the men he continued now then some of you whip the tarpaulin off this after hatchway and lift off the hatches mr ritson will you be good enough to rouse out a couple of fourfold tackles and get them made fast aloft we shall require a chain strop also thats right lads off with those hatches well soon have the old barkie in fighting trim inspired by the mates cheery manner the men worked with hearty goodwill and in less than an hour they had the long ninepounder on deck mounted on its carriage its tackles hooked on the gun loaded cutlasses and pistols distributed boardingpikes cast loose and everything ready for a stubborn resistance these preliminaries arranged george and the chief mate made their way aloft as far as the maintop to watch the approach of the suspected schooner which had by this time crept up to within about nine miles of the aurora she was still heading straight for the barque and the telescope enabled them to see that her six sweeps were being vigorously plied their long steady swing and the perfect time which was maintained in the working of them conclusively showing that they were being handled by a strong gang of men why she must be full of men or those long heavy sweeps could never be kept going for so great a length of time remarked george to the mate we shall have to devote all our attention to those sweeps in the first instance i can see if we are only fortunate enough to knock away two or three of them it will at least delay their approach and if a breeze would only spring up smart as that schooner looks i should not despair of being able to show her a clean pair of heels ay answered bowen and were going to have a breeze byandby just the way we wants it too i can make out the upper edge of a cloudbank rising now above the horizon to the eastard there and if we can only keep yonder cutthroat crew at arms length until we get the wind and if itll only come down upon us pretty fresh when it does come i think as you say sir we may give them handsomely the slip with the view of getting a still clearer idea as to the possible advent of the desired breeze mr bowen forthwith undertook a journey as far as the mainroyal yard upon which he comfortably established himself with one arm round the royalpole whilst he carefully studied the aspect of the weather and as carefully scrutinised the horizon to see whether there were any other craft in their immediate neighbourhood no other sail excepting the schooner however was in sight in any direction and having at length formed a tolerably clear opinion with regard to the weather he descended again to the maintop and remarked to george that schooner must be coming up at the rate of about three knots by the look of her yes about that answered george and shes about eight miles off now i should say continued bowen yes about eight miles returned george with his eye still peering through the telescope then remarked the mate it will take her a matter of some two hours and forty minutes or thereabouts to get alongside and by that time unless i am greatly mistaken the first of the breeze will have reached us i hope we shall get it before then because in light winds i dont doubt but what that craft could sail round and round us but only let it come strong enough to oblige us to stow our royals and ill bet my old hat that we can walk away from her im afraid we shant scrape clear without finding out the weight of the shot she can pitch at us but if our lads are only steady when the powderburning begins i shant feel noways very greatly concerned with which summing up of the case mr bowen dropped into a sitting posture alongside his commander and letting his legs dangle down over the outer edge of the top filled his pipe and proceeded to regale himself with what he chose to term two whiffs and a half chapter twelve a marine dueland its result the two occupants of the maintop maintained their position therein keeping a watchful eye upon the movements of the schooner until that craft had approached to within about three miles of the aurora when they descended to the deck captain leicester remarking to the mate as the latter swung himself down off the rail i think mr bowen we may as well run up our ensign perhaps the schooner will return the compliment and oblige us with a sight of the colour of her bunting ay ay sir answered the mate and he walked aft got out the ensign bent it on to the halliards and ran it up to the mizzen peak where it hung in drooping folds swaying listlessly with the sleepy roll of the ship for some time there was no response on the part of the schooner which held steadily on her way straight for the barque her six long sweeps plying as vigorously as ever and churning up the glassy water into a long line of miniature whirlpools which gradually diminished until they finally subsided on each side of her gleaming wake the breeze the breeze here it comes at last thank god ejaculated bowen who had been for some time anxiously regarding the rising bank of greyish cloud to the eastward as he spoke a faint barely perceptible breath of cool air fanned the faces of the anxious watchers on the deck of the aurora and was gone again a catspaw or two momentarily ruffled the surface of the water here and there only to leave it as glassy as before then came another puff which lasted just long enough to trail out the ensign for an instant and to rustle the royals and then away on the extreme verge of the eastern horizon the gleaming water assumed a light blue tint which gradually spread creeping slowly down towards the two vessels the blue on the horizon insensibly darkening all the while and conveying the thrice welcome intelligence that the breeze was slowly but steadily freshening yes said george here it comes sure enough and in a few hours we shall have plenty of it by the look of the sky stand by the braces lads let go and haul the yards round and be lively about it we cannot spare the time to be taken aback just now thats right men well there with the forebraces well with the main brail in the mizzen and stow it haul down the mizzentopmast staysail now she feels the breeze hard up with your helm my man and let her wear short round let go your lee mainbraces and round in to windwardgently now not too quick thats well catch a turn with your afterbraces and then square the foreyard well with the forebraces belay all and coil up ah i expected that the latter exclamation was evoked by the boom of a gun from the schooner and turning his eyes in her direction george saw the white smoke floating lazily away from her to leeward and then a white jet of water started up as the shot came flying towards the barque then anotheranotherand another and finally a scurrying splash as the iron messenger swept along the surface of the water and sank falling short by about a hundred yards at the same moment the heavy sweeps were laid in the schooners sails were trimmed as if by magic to the coy breeze her head paid off and as she swept gracefully round upon a course which would enable her to intercept the aurora a tiny ball went soaring aloft to her maintopmasthead and breaking abroad as it reached the truck a square black flag fluttered threateningly out a fit emblem of the character of those who sailed beneath it not quite close enough mr rover remarked bowen cheerfully as the shot sank into the placid depths of the ocean now gently ruffled by the increasing breeze shall we return the compliment sir not just yet answered george she is still a long way off and we cannot afford to waste a single ounce of powder or shot but it is time that we should have everything ready to carry on the fight in earnest so i must ask you mr bowenas the most reliable man i have on boardto go below and see to the passing up of the powder it will never do to run the risk of having an explosion in the powdermagazine very well sir id have greatly preferred to have been on deck to take my fair share in the fighting but im ready to do my duty wherever you may choose to order me said the chief mate as he walked away aft with a rather rueful face on his way below to the magazine the schooner finding that she was not yet within range remained silent for the next five minutes and then george who was keenly watching her saw another flash another puff of white fleecy smoke and once more the ball came bounding over the water straight for the barque it will reach us this time thought the skipper and he was right the shot striking the water about forty feet from the side of the aurora and then bounding harmlessly over her except for a hole which it punched in the main trysail in its passage now lads said george its our turn mr ritson run out the gun if you please and show us what you can do in the way of shooting ay ay sir answered ritson gleefully the waters smooth the ships steady and altogether its a capital day for this kind of work man the tackles there run out muzzle to the right a trifle not too much so well there elevate the muzzle a leetle more there thatll do ill try that now then snowball lets have that loggerhead ned just freshen that priming a bit now stand clear lads and you tom touch her off when i give the word then stooping down he glanced along the sights for an instant or two and finally gave the word fire at the word tom promptly applied the loggerhead there was a ringing report and as the smoke cleared off the shot was seen to strike the water close alongside the schooner and the next instant a white scar in her bulwarks attested ritsons skill as a marksman and showed that the shot had taken effect a hearty cheer from the auroras crew manifested their elation at this lucky hit and george who was watching the schooner through his telescope quietly remarked thank you ritson that was capitally aimed you must have done some execution among the crew of that craft too for there is a great deal of confusion among them on deck i see ah there they fire again once more the shot came flying straight for the barque and once more it whistled harmlessly over her just touching the mainmast as it passed but inflicting no injury on the spar capital practice on both sides remarked the skipper coolly six inches further to the right gentlemen and you would have plumped that shot right into our mainmast now try again ritson and aim for his spars the sooner we can cripple him the better will be out chances of getting clear of him without loss to ourselves again the auroras long nine rang out its sharp report but for some reason probably from overeagerness on the part of the second mate the shot flew wide passing some twenty yards astern of the schooner bad luck to it exclaimed the discomfited ritson impatiently run in the gun lads and be smart with it thats your sort sponge it well out thatll do now in with the cartridge three strokes with the rammer now home with the shot run out the gun again bear a hand with the primingiron you ned muzzle to the lefta little more yet well with that now tom stand byfire both vessels fired at precisely the same moment the schooners shot passing in through the auroras bulwarks close to the gun and making the splinters fly in all directions one of the latter grazing captain leicesters cheek and drawing blood but very fortunately beyond this no further damage was done on the other hand the auroras shot much better aimed this time cut the weather whiskerstay on board the schooner and compelled her to at once keep dead away before the wind in order to prevent the loss of her jibboom well shot exclaimed george enthusiastically fore and mainbraces lads port your helm my manto the helmsmanand let her come up full and by round in upon the portbraces fore and aft board the fore and maintacks aft with the sheets cheerily my lads if we are smart we may get out of gunshot before they can repair that damage well there of all now to your gun again lads and lets treat them to another dose of the same sort the men sprang about the decks like wildcats and in their elation and excitement did the work of at least three men each the yards were braced up almost as soon as the ship could luff to the wind the tacks were seized and boarded with irresistible strength and energy the sheets flattened in and in considerably less than five minutes the aurora was rushing along on a bowline with her lee coveringboard nearly awash and a clear glassy surge spouting up on each side of her cutwater and foaming away from her sharp bows with a hissing roar which was sweetest music just then to the ears of her delighted crew now the old barkie travels exclaimed the exultant ritson unhook the guntackles you seadogs and rush the gun aft well try a shot out through the sternports this time at this moment the boom of another gun from the schooner was heard and next moment the shot came flying through the auroras rigging cutting the mainbrace pennant and passing through the head of the foresail the lee mainyardarm at once flew forward throwing the mainsail aback and of course seriously interfering with the barques flight up with your helm and keep her away until the mainsail fills again commanded george haul inboard the brace and one hand get a marlinespike and jump aloft to make the splice be smart lads theres no great harm done ritson was in the meantime busy aft with the gun and presently he fired again pitching the shot fairly on the schooners forecastle where some of her crew were busy with the cut stay on board the aurora the mainbrace was very soon spliced after which captain leicester had the mizzen gafftopsail and in short every stitch of canvas that would draw set to the freshening breeze then inquiry having elicited the fact that teaor supper as the men termed itwas ready he ordered the crew to knock off and take the meal whilst they had the opportunity george and the two mates had their meal served on deck the top of the skylight doing duty for a table and they were about halfway through with it when the pirate schooner was seen to once more haul her wind in pursuit this however gave them no immediate apprehension as she was far out of gunshot the breeze was still steadily freshening and the aurora was plunging along at a racing pace over the short sea which had already been raised with the wind humming merrily through her rigging and a great foaming surge hissing and buzzing under her lee bow and streaming out in a long trail of bubbling froth behind her were going to have a fresh breeze tonight i think sir remarked the chief mate as he helped himself to another slab of salt junk and if itll only come fresh enough to oblige us to stow our royals i think that on an easy bowlineour best point of sailingwe shall be able to fairly run away from that chap yes said george i believe we shall and if we can only get weather which will give us the advantage over her in the matter of speed i shall feel very much inclined to turn the tables on her and give her a good wholesome lesson it struck me that our gun threw its shot considerably further than hers did im sure it did emphatically corroborated ritson and itd be doin a real service to give the piccarooning rascals a thorough good drubbing it appeared however as though the fortuitous combination of circumstances hinted at by captain leicester was not to be for before long it became evident that the schooner notwithstanding the freshening breeze and the increasing sea was slowly but steadily gaining on the barque but a stern chase is a long chase and the schooner while repairing damages had not only been left astern but had also been compelled to run a considerable distance to leeward so that when the sun set and the short brilliant tropical twilight faded out of the sky she was still some six miles distant broad on the auroras lee quarter with the setting of the sun there came a still further freshening of the breeze laying the barque down upon her side until her lee coveringboard was buried and the water spouting up through the scuppers was washing the deck on the leeside almost up to the coamings of the mainhatchway the wind was making weird wild music as it swept through the tautlystrained rigging and the topgallant and royalmasts were whipping and bending like fishingrods with every pitch and scend of the ship while the straining canvas towering away aloft toward the dusky heavens stood as firm and steady as though moulded in iron the watch below were in their hammocks enjoying the repose which they had earned by a day of unusual exertion and the watch on deck were also by georges express command snatching such a weazellike sleep as could be obtained consistently with the holding of themselves ready for a prompt call in case of emergency the night wore slowly on the young moon which had been hanging like a silver crescent low in the western sky sank beneath the horizon and the spangled heavens became almost wholly obscured by the broadening masses of dusky vapour which swept rapidly athwart them there was light enough however to render the schooner easily distinguishable with the aid of the nightglass and george after attentively watching her for more than half an hour came to the conclusion that the aurora was at length holding her own we will clew up and furl the royals if you please mr ritson said he to the officer of the watch i am getting uneasy about those sticks and it would be most unfortunate to lose them just now i believe we shall do just as well without the royals as with them in this fresh breeze how is she steering pretty easily to the man at the wheel no sir was the reply shes gripin awful it takes a halfturn of the wheel to keep her out of the wind then well take in the gafftopsail and mizzentopmast staysail as well said george all that weatherhelm must make at least half a knot difference in her sailing sail was accordingly shortened the result proving the justice of captain leicesters surmise for there was no perceptible diminution in the speed of the barque on the contrary in another halfhour both the skipper and his second mate were convinced that the aurora was gradually creeping away from her pursuer the spread of canvas was then further reduced by the hauling down of the maintopgallantstaysail and the furling of the foretopgallantsail and finally the flyingjib and maintopgallantsail were stowed after which the two craft appeared to maintain as nearly as possible an equal speed all through the remainder of the night the next morning dawned with a copperyred tint in the eastern sky and a streaky look in the clouds which was a presage of a windy day the schooner was about six miles distant bearing three points on the barques lee quarter her royal topgallantsail and flyingjib were stowed but by the way in which she was lying over to the breeze and the dense showers of spray which were incessantly flying in over her weather bow it was evident that she was still carrying all the canvas she could stagger under now said george to the first mate when the latter came on deck to take charge at eight bells i think we have that fellow in our power and can do pretty nearly what we like with him in this breeze and with this sea we can outsail him and with all that water pouring in upon his forecastle it will be difficult for him to work his longgun to advantage which i believe unlike ourselves he has fixed there on a pivot so i propose to let him creep up within gunshot astern of us and fight him there where all the advantage will be on our side accordingly as soon as the crew had taken their breakfast captain leicester ordered the jib and foretopmast staysailsheets to be hauled over to windward in order that the barques speed might be reduced without shortening sail and so exciting any suspicion in the minds of the pirates of a desire on the part of the aurora to renew the action this manoeuvre had the desired effect and shortly before noon the schooner once more opened fire the shot flying past the aurora and at some distance to leeward of her this was doubtless in consequence of the violent motion of the schooner which being a much smaller vessel than the barque was much more lively in the seaway this gave the aurora another advantage over the schooner as was at once apparent when ritson recommenced his gunpractice his first shot passing through the schooners topsail in close proximity to the mast the firing soon became pretty animated on both sides the aurora having however a decided advantage over her antagonist both in rapidity and precision of fire thus while at the end of half an hour only one of the schooners shot had touched the barque and that without doing any material damage her own sails and rigging were pretty well cut up several shotholes being visible in her canvas whilst a number of ends and bights of ropes were seen streaming to leeward in the wind at length a lucky shot from the aurora struck the schooners foremast just below the eyes of the rigging wounding the spar so badly that it almost immediately afterwards went carrying away the maintopmast with it and in an instant the whole of the pirates tophamper was towing to leeward causing tremendous confusion on board and placing the craft almost completely at the mercy of her antagonist a hearty cheer burst from the lips of the auroras crew at the sight of this disaster on board their adversary a disaster of which george was determined to take the fullest advantage now lads he exclaimed she is at our mercy and we will inflict on her a lesson she is not likely to speedily forget clew up the courses then let go the topsailhalliards and doublereef the fore and maintopsails and as you come down stow the courses the men sprang aloft with alacrity to execute these duties and on their return to the deck sail was further shortened until the barque was under doublereefed topsails and foretopmast staysail only when she wore round and stood directly for the disabled pirate schooner the longgun being run forward and pointed out of the foremost port on the leeside and the firing resumed in a very short time she was close to the schooner round and round which george proceeded deliberately to sail maintaining a steady fire upon her meanwhile the pirate schooner however though disabled was by no means rendered harmless as captain leicester soon discovered to his cost for as he was sailing past her to windward at a distance of about fifty yards to his very great surprise her crew suddenly threw open three ports in her weather bulwarks and the next moment three sixpounder shots came whistling through the auroras rigging cutting a rope or two but happily missing the spars and all gear connected with the canvas which was set at the same moment ritson fired his ninepounder and struck the schooner which was listing over to leeward with the weight of her wreckage exactly between wind and water now that the two vessels were so close together it became apparent that captain leicester had been perfectly correct in his estimate as to the strength of the schooners crew for whilst a strong gang could be seen hard at work clearing away the wreckage of the spars a sufficient number of men were still available to work the broadside guns to windward which they did with great animation as long as it was possible for one of them to be pointed at the aurora this was not for long however for the barque holding on her way wore round as soon as she was out of musketshot and passing across the schooners stern swept up again to leeward ritson all the while keeping up an animated fire from the longnine and evidently doing tremendous execution among the thicklyclustering men on the schooners deck who whilst the barque was to leeward were unable in consequence of the wreckage to return more than a very ineffectual fire at length after an hour of this work the black flag which had fallen with the maintopmast was exhibited above the bulwarks of the schooner for a moment lashed to a boats oar and was then dropped again in token of surrender that means that theyve struck sir you may depend ont exclaimed ritson walking aft as if for further instructions yes i have no doubt it does replied captain leicester but if they expect that the fact of their striking will be of any benefit to them they are woefully mistaken we are altogether too shorthanded to attempt to take possession of her as a prize and as to leaving her alone in order that she may repair damages and have the opportunity of renewing her depredations it is not to be thought of she is not entitled to any of the privileges of an ordinary enemy nor shall i extend any such to her she is simply a pirate one of those pests of the high seas which it is the duty of any honest man to destroy if he have the opportunity and that he concluded grimly is what i intend to do keep up your fire sir and aim so as to strike her between wind and water if possible ill sink her before ive done with her ritson accordingly returned forward and communicating the captains determination to the crew they resumed work at the gun with the stern set faces of men who recognised that they had a very terrible and disagreeable duty to perform from the responsibility of which they dared not shrink as soon as the schooners crew discovered that their surrender had not been accepted they reopened fire as well as they could from their own guns and a man was seen to jump into the mainrigging and run aloft with something rolled up under his arm which proved in another minute to be the black flag ascending as high as the lower masthead he coolly climbed up on the crosstrees and standing there deftly and rapidly lashed it to the masthead after which he deliberately descended the rigging again defiantly shaking his fist at the aurora as he did so about ten minutes after the occurrence of this incident there followed another of an infinitely more thrilling and startling character the aurora had worn round and was once more passing the schooner and ritson was in the act of glancing along the sights of the gun preparatory to giving the order to fire when without the slightest warning or premonition of the dreadful tragedy about to take place a dazzling flash of light was seen on board the schooner her spars her deck and all that was upon it went soaring in fragments high into the air her sides were rent open and in a tremendous cloud of smoke and with a deafening report the devoted craft disappeared the barques whole frame jarred her canvas flapped violently and she careened perceptibly under the terrific concussion a dead silence seemed suddenly to have fallen upon the scene of strife and then came the splash splash of the falling fragments into the water around accompanied by the heavy thud of others descending upon the barques deck the water seethed and leaped madly for a few seconds on the spot where the schooner had a minute before been floating then subsided once more into the long steady regular run and heave of the sea and all was over whether the explosion was the result of accident or the deliberate act of her desperate and reckless commander it was of course impossible to ascertain very probably it was the latter but whatever the cause of it the pirate schooner was no more a few rent and blackened timbers with here and there the mangled remains of what had a few minutes before been a human being floating on the surface of the heaving waters was all that remained of her and her crew george leicesters grim deed of retribution was complete chapter thirteen surprised a terrible ending to a sinstained career murmured the skipper of the aurora with white set lips when the first shock of surprise and consternation had passed away sufficiently to allow him to speak up with your helm my man he continued to the seaman at the wheel up with your helm and keep her away upon a west and by south course well get away from this accursed spot as soon as possible man the braces fore and aft if you please mr ritson square the yards secure the longgun and then let all hands make sail then going to the companion he passed the word below for mr bowen to close the magazine and come on deck five minutes later the chief mate emerged from the companion and walking up to george observed well sir youve managed to make a pretty effectual end of the buccaneer i see yes answered george gravely the schooner struck but we are much too shorthanded to take and retain possession of such a craft as that so as i did not feel justified in leaving them at liberty to resume their nefarious business i continued to fire into the schooner intending to sink her and i am of opinion that her captain recognising the fact that escape was hopeless blew her up with his own hand hoping to involve us in the destruction also it was a terrible thing mr bowen to cause the loss of so many lives but i am convinced that i only did my duty and now as there seems to be no immediate prospect of our falling in with the fleet again i propose to take full advantage of this fine fair wind and proceed upon my voyage so please pack on the ship everything that will draw then let the men clear up the decks and knock off work they have had two very fatiguing days and have fought well let them get all the rest they possibly can between this and tomorrow morning when the sun set that evening the aurora was flying to the southward and westward as if instinct with life and thrilling with horror at her terrible achievement before the freshening gale at the rate of fully twelve knots per hour with studdingsails set on both sides alow and aloft while her crew assembled on the forecastle discussed in low tones the incidents of the fight and her skipper with hands clasped behind him bent head and furrowed brow held solemn selfcommunion upon the same subject george leicester now found himself at liberty to attend to his guest and he spent almost the whole of his leisure time by the side of walfords cot for the first week after the arrival of the latter on board the aurora very little change or improvement could be detected in him his mental faculties seemed to be almost paralysed and he would lie in his cot for hours at a time with wideopened eyes staring into vacancy the blank expressionless look upon his face betraying the utter inactivity of his mind then there would occur a short period during which it seemed that memory was struggling to reassert itself he would glance vacantly round the cosy sleepingcabin in which he found himself a look of mild surprise would overspread his features and he would pass his hand over his brow with the action of one who is trying to remember something then would recur another vacant period during all this time he never expressed a wish or uttered a single coherent word only occasionally when the memory was struggling to regain its seat he would mutter a few incoherent words that of murder being sometimes repeated in low tones of suppressed horror halfadozen times together his appetite appeared to be good since he ate and drank freely whatever was offered him but if the food was withheld as it sometimes was by way of experiment at captain leicesters order he never asked for it or evinced any surprise or uneasiness at its nonappearance about the tenth day however after the one on which he had been picked up george thought he detected signs of improvement the periods of thinking were more frequent and more prolonged and once during that day when the skipper entered the cabin walford noticed the opening of the door and turning his eyes in that direction regarded george for some moments with a steadfast inquiring look but the recognition if such there was was momentary only the hand was pressed meditatively to the forehead the next instant and then the blank look returned the next day witnessed a recurrence of the same symptoms added to which there seemed to be a vague sort of semirecognition of georges voice for whenever the latter spoke walford would look up with an anxious questioning glance as though he had an idea that he had heard the voice before finally on that same evening when george and mr bowen were in the saloon together chatting over the teatable the aftercabin door being open so as to insure a current of air through the apartment walford who had been asleep suddenly started up in his cot with the exclamation surely that is leicesters voice george heard the ejaculation and springing to his feet stepped eagerly into the sleepingcabin saying of course it is my dear fellow how do you feel now better better repeated walford i havent been ill have i where am i how did i come here and where did you come from what a string of questions said george with a laugh but dont worry yourself by trying to guess the answers to any of them just now you have been ill but thank god you are getting better again when you are well enough to listen i will tell you all i know until then you must be satisfied with the assurance that you are as safe as a man can be in a tight little ship with fine weather and plenty of searoom safe ejaculated walford ah but am i safe i have a horrible feeling of dread upon mea sensation of some frightful danger hovering over mea feeling that unless i can do something i know not what a hideous disaster will happen he shuddered violently as these words left his lips then turning suddenly to george he grasped him convulsively by the arm and exclaimed in agitated tones oh leicester tell me what is it that threatens what have i to guard against if you know what it is there said george soothingly do not worry about it any more i did not intend to say a word about it for some time to come but since i find that you remember something about it i will tell you this much you have been in very great danger indeed but all that is long past you are now on board my ship more than a thousand miles away from the danger which threatened you and as safe as a man can be in midocean thanks thanks i believe you muttered walford with a sigh of ineffable relief as he sank back upon his pillow so i am in your ship eh thats strange i cant imaginebut there i shall not worry myself any more about the matter youll look after me i know youre a thorough good fellow leicester and im almost sorry now that ithat ium what was it now well i dare say i shall remember it further on i say old fellow what time is it nearly dinnertime i should think for i feel most confoundedly hungry it is nearly dinnertime answered george delighted to find so great an improvement in the man he had vowed to protect and restore if you can hold out for another halfhour i think i may promise you a decent meal by that time will that do yes oh yes i dare say i can manage to survive until then murmured walford whereupon the skipper hurried away and took counsel with the steward the result of which was that in little more than the stipulated halfhour walford was served with the best meal which the auroras resources could furnish from that time he grew steadily better and in another day or two he was able to leave his cot and to indulge in a bath a clean shave and an hour or so on deck halfsitting halfreclining in a hammock which the skipper had ordered to be slung for him from the spankerboom he suffered from extreme bodily weakness doubtless the result of his frenzied exertions on board the illfated princess royal but that was of course an evil which rest and nourishing food would speedily remedy but he did not recover the use of his reasoning faculties for some time after the period now referred to and then the recovery was only partial as for captain leicester he was in high spirits the breeze lasted fresh for four full days after his encounter with the pirate schooner so fresh indeed that once or twice he was obliged to furl his royals in order to save the sticks and the barque no longer compelled to moderate her pace to that of the slowest sailer in a large fleet maintained a steady speed of twelve knots during the whole of that time thus fully making up in the skippers opinion for the time and ground lost during the gale and encouraging him to look forward hopefully to the accomplishment of a quick passage but such a state of things was too good to last on the fifth day the wind fell light and on the sixth it failed them altogether leaving the aurora helpless in the doldrums she being at that time about a thousand miles from cape haytien and six hundred from the island of saint thomas this was particularly vexatious because captain leicester considered that had the breeze continued fresh and favourable for only twentyfour hours longer it would in all probability have run him fairly into the northeast trades and he would then have been able to calculate the duration of the remainder of the voyage with almost mathematical exactness and what was still more to the purpose would have been sure of a breeze and that a fair one for the remainder of the way however there was no help for it they had to take the wind and weather as it came and the crew had a busy time of it boxhauling the yards now this way now that trimming the sails to every passing breath of the capricious air and after all their trouble accomplishing only some halfadozen miles during the whole day on the next day it was the same excepting that the proceedings were varied by a tremendously heavy thunderstorm followed by instead of the wind which captain leicester so earnestly hoped for a perfect deluge of rain which lasted for rather more than an hour it was a regular tropical downpour the water descended not in separate detached drops but in sheets which splashed down on the decks as if from a cataract advantage was taken of this copious downfall of pure fresh water to refill all the watercasks after which the scuppers were plugged washdeck tubs filled and all hands stripping to the skin indulged in the unwonted luxury of a thorough ablution in the warm soft water finishing up by rousing out all their wash clothes and treating them to the same beneficial process the storm cleared away as rapidly as it had worked up leaving the sky absolutely cloudless and the water thrashed down by the rain until it was smooth as a polished mirror the heat was intense and the men notwithstanding their refreshing bath went about their work languidly perspiring at every pore it was a positive relief to them to see the sun at last go down behind the gleaming horizon and a greater relief still when an hour later a faint breeze from the eastward came creeping over the water and barely filling the auroras light upper sails gave her just sufficient way through the water to allow of her head being kept in the right direction at eight oclock that evening mr bowen retired to his cabin it being then his watch below and at nine the skipper followed his example the ship was then stealing along through the water at a speed of about two knots the royals topgallantsails and more lofty staysails just asleep the topsails alternately filling out and flapping again to the masts with the barely perceptible swing of the ship over the low long sleepy heave of the swell and the courses drooping heavily and uselessly from the yards the sky was as clear as a bell to use a favourite metaphor of ritsons not a trace of cloud being visible in any part of the vast sapphire vault which stretched overhead spangled here and there with a few stars of the first magnitude and with the moon nearly at the full hanging in the midst like a disc of burnished silver her pure soft light flooding the sea with its dazzling radiance and causing the sails to stand out like sheets of ivory against the deep dark blue of the sky there seemed to be no immediate prospect of any change in the weather but george was thankful that the ship was really at last moving once morethough ever so slowlyin the right direction and fervently hoping that the breeze would last long enough to run him into the trades he went below with an easy mind after giving ritson the usual stereotyped order to call him should any untoward event occur after the overpowering heat of the day the comparative coolness of the night was unspeakably refreshing and with all the doors the skylight and the sternwindows open and a thorough circulation of fresh air through the cabins their several occupants were soon wrapped in a sound and dreamless slumber it was even more pleasant on deck than it was below for the hull of the ship had during the long scorching day absorbed a considerable amount of heat which it gave off again during the night causing the cabins and forecastle to be unpleasantly warm even after all possible means had been adopted for their thorough ventilation whilst on deck the full benefit of the breeze what there was of it was to be obtained such at all events was mr ritsons opinion as he sauntered listlessly fore and aft between the taffrail and the mainmast glancing now aloft at the all but idle canvas then into the binnacle then over the side at the tiny bubbles creeping lazily past the ships side and finally forward to where the man on the lookout could be seen seated upon the rail facing ahead with his arms folded and his back leaning against the great wooden stock of one of the anchors his form showing black as that of an ebony statue against the brilliant silvery sheen of the moonlight on the water the remainder of the crew were dimly visible seated on the deck in the black shadow of the bulwarks a tiny red spark or two indicating that some of them were solacing the idle hours with a whiff or two of the fragrant weed officers who were strict disciplinarians would have forbidden smoking in the watch on deck and would have insisted on the whole watch keeping constantly on the move as a safeguard against dozing but ritson was not a strict disciplinarian he liked to spare the men all unnecessary labour of every kind and as there was no sailtrimming to be done he just allowed them to rest their weary bodies as much as they could he would have liked greatly to rest his own weary body too for indeed he felt it to be almost a torture to be pacing ceaselessly to and fro there on the deck hour after hour he pulled out his watch the hands indicated that it was ten minutes to ten it would be full two hours more before he would be relieved there was a most invitinglooking chair standing on deck near the skylight which captain leicester had been using during the day and poor ritson thought how pleasant it would be to rest his tired limbs in it for a few minutes then he took a stroll round the decks just to wile away the time and to make sure that the watchand especially the lookoutwas not caulking the shadowy figures scrambled somewhat hurriedly to their feet on his approach giving rise to just the faintest suspicion that perhaps after all they might have been shutting their eyes to keep them warm but the lookout man seemed unconscious of his presence and was humming scarcely above his breath the air of a homely song as ritson passed him his gaze resting on a brig ahead which had been in sight all day and which from the fact that she was steering in the same direction as the aurora was thought to belong like themselves to the dispersed fleet when ritson again reached the quarterdeck it was ten oclock so he struck four bells sharply the wheel and lookout were relieved and then everybody settled down once more to pass away the remaining two hours of the watch as has been already hinted ritson was not so strict a disciplinarian as to forbid smoking by the watch on deck so long of course as the smoking was not allowed to interfere with the duty of the ship nay more he sometimes allowed himself the luxury of a pipe under similar circumstances and he thought he might safely do so on the present occasion so seating himself in the skippers chair he drew out his pipe tobacco and knife and prepared to enjoy his whiff oh how comfortable a chair that was how great a relief to sit in it even for the minute or two during which he was cutting up his tobacco and filling his pipe this work though performed with great deliberation was at length accomplished his steel and tinderbox furnished him with a light and he began to smoke somehow he forgot to get up out of the chair again when his pipe was lighted but leaning back restfully in it instead watched the little rings and wreaths of smoke which issued from it and went floating lazily away until they vanished in the soft cool air of the night then by association of ideas ritsons thoughts strayed away to the little flaxen curlyhaired urchin at home his oneyearold son who used to be so delighted to watch the wreathing smoke issue from his fathers pipe that he would crow and jump and kick upon his mothers knee until the good woman had hard work to hold him he fancied he could see the young rascal still his fat dimpled cheeks wreathed with smiles of delight his blue eyes sparkling and his fat chubby arms and legs flourishing in the air as he made frantic grasps at the little blue smokerings floating toward him yes and he could hear annas his wifes voice halfjestingly half in earnest scolding the happy father for keeping the child awake and letting his thoughts have free play on so pleasant a theme he could recall the same voice crooning a soothing lullaby to the little fellow as later on he nestled into his mothers breast tired out with his romp and softly sank to sleep very soothing was that lullabyvery soothing indeedyesit was veryaverysoothinglittlesongandand and ritsons head sank upon his breast as he too yielded to the seductive influence of sleep a few feet away stood or rather lolled the helmsman his body drooping over the wheel on the upper rim of which he had crossed his arms for the sake of the welcome support on taking charge of the wheel he had been given the course and glancing into the binnacle he found that the barque was heading in the required direction upon which like a good helmsman he at once selected a star to steer by a star which was just a fingers breadth clear of the mainroyal yardarm by the time that he had been at the wheel a quarter of an hour he discovered that the ship was steering herself and he accordingly relaxed his vigilance allowing his thoughts to travel away whithersoever they would gradually his weary eyelids closed and a short periodperhaps a minute or soof forgetfulness followed from which he would suddenly start guiltily and glance first aloft at the star and then at the motionless figure of ritson this glance of inquiry showing that the star still occupied its proper position and that the second mate had not observed his dereliction of duty the eyelids again closed and a longer period of forgetfulness would ensue which of course ended as it was sure to do in the man falling soundly asleep as he stood as for the man on the lookout he was notorious for his somnolent powers he made no pretence of an effort to keep awake there was no reason he argued why he should it was a fine night as light as day there was nothing in sight but the brig ahead and although the aurora was clearly gaining on her there was no likelihood of her running over her in his watch therefore to keep a lookout just then was quite a useless formality besides there was the officer of the watch who would keep all the lookout required on such a brilliantly fine night and arguing thus he settled himself comfortably into the position vacated by his predecessor and folding his arms across his breast tranquilly composed himself to sleep the remainder of the watch had settled down to sleep as a matter of course they had not the lookout and they were within call of the officer of the watch should their services be required that they considered was all that was just then expected of them and they closed their eyes and yielded to their feelings of drowsiness without a shadow of compunction thus by halfpast ten oclock that night the entire ships company of the aurora fore and aft were fast asleep whilst all hands were thus wrapped in peaceful oblivion a small object gradually merged into view immediately ahead of the aurora had the lookout man been broad awakeinstead of fast asleep as he washe would certainly not have noticed this object until it was within a mile of the shipunless his gaze had happened to have been attracted by an occasional momentary flashing gleam of silvery lightbecause its colour so artfully matched the delicate steely blue grey of the gentlyrippled sea that it was absolutely invisible beyond that distance even at the distance of half a mile a cursory careless glance ahead might have easily missed it but when a quarter of a mile only intervened between it and the barque the look out man had he been wideawake and with all his wits about him would suddenly have become conscious that a large boat painted grey and full of men was pulling swiftly and noiselessly toward the ship on she swept silently as a dream not a word was uttered on board her there was no warning roll and rattle of the oars in the rowlocks to apprise the sleeping crew of the approach of danger there was not even the plashing sound of the oarblades dipping into the water they rose and fell silently as the misty oars of a phantom boat and when at length she swept up alongside the aurora a sign was all that was needed to convey the orders of the officer in charge to his crew his right hand was gently raised the oars were noiselessly lifted from the rowlocks and laid in without a sound upon the padded thwarts the boat sheered alongside without absolutely touching the painter was made fast to the auroras forechains and sixteen armed figures climbed noiselessly as ghosts over the bulwarks leaving two in charge of the boat chapter fourteen sold into slavery when george leicester retired to his cabin that night it was with the full intention to at once retire to his cot instead however of doing this he flung himself down on the sofa to indulge in a few minutes of entirely undisturbed thought and there sleep overtook him from this he was abruptly startled into complete wakefulness by a sudden cry immediately followed by a confused sound of struggling on deck and of a dull crunching blow a cry of oh god have mercy upon my dear another blow a heavy fall on the planking overhead a deep groan and then a splash in the water alongside conscious at once that something terrible had happened he sprang to his feet buckled on his cutlass and snatching up a pistol in one hand and a lamp in the other hurriedly stepped out of the cabin to investigate he was just in time to encounter at the foot of the companionladder a motley crowd of swarthyskinned strangers who with bared daggers and swordblades were making their way down to the cabin that they were enemies was so instantly apparent that george unhesitatingly levelled his pistol at the foremost man and fired the bullet struck the man in the shoulder shattering the bone and he staggered to one sideonly to make way for others however who pressing upon george disarmed and overpowered him before he had opportunity to do further harm mr bowen who had dashed out of his cabin just behind george was similarly disarmed and overpowered and then the crowd pressed on into the cabin where they found and secured walford and the lad tom having made a thorough search of the various staterooms the strangerswho were evidently spaniardshurried their prisoners on deck here a single glance sufficed to show captain leicester that his ship had been taken from him by a clever surprise aidedor rather rendered possibleby terrible carelessness on the part of those left in charge of the deck the crew as he found on rapidly counting heads were all presentwith one exceptionsecurely bound hand and foot and huddled together under the bulwarks the exceptionthe missing man was ritson and the overturned and broken chair the bloodspattered deck in its immediate vicinity and the heavy splash into the water alongside which george had heard rendered the whole story as plain and clear as the moon which rode so serenely in the heavens above poor ritson he had paid with his life the penalty of his disastrous lapse of duty and the drowsy helmsmanwho had obviously awakened in time to spring to the assistance of his superiorwas lying near the skylight white and ghastly in the moonlight with his skull cloven and a great black pool of blood slowly spreading on the planking beneath his head the brig ahead now hoveto and evidently awaiting the approach of the aurora told george from whence his enemies had sprung andnow that it was all too latehe bitterly reproached himself for his lack of caution with regard to her the individuals who had thus cleverly gained possession of the barque were as ruffianly a set of scoundrels as could well be met with on the high seas their leader a brawny thickset spaniard with a skin tanned to the hue of wellseasoned mahogany his ragged black locks bound round with a filthy red silk handkerchief and surmounted by a broadbrimmed straw hat his body clad in a red and yellow striped worsted shirt confined at the waist by a cutlassbelt into which a longbarrelled pistol was thrust and his legs encased in seaboots reaching nearly to the thigh was a particularly truculentlooking ruffian and a powerful negro somewhat similarly clad who seemed to be his chief aide was little if anything better that they were pirates there could be no possible doubt and poor george leicester expected nothing less than that he and his ships company would all have their throats cut and then be unceremoniously pitched overboard to keep poor ritson company it soon appeared however that his career was not to be thus summarily brought to an end for after a few words between the leader and the negro george and his crew were after their bonds had been looked to and made more secure distributed about the deck and chained to the ringbolts in the bulwarks and elsewhere the aurora under the influence of a slightly freshening breeze soon joined company with the brig from which a boat then put off bringing on board the barque a tall handsome man whose features were however spoiled by the expression of cunning and cruelty legibly imprinted on them he said a few words to the spaniard in charge glanced round the deck at the helpless prisoners made a jesting remark or two at which of course everybody dutifully laughed gave georgewho unfortunately happened to be nearest hima playful kick in the mouth with his heavy boot and then sauntered leisurely down into the cabin where from the repeated loud bursts of laughter and the singing which soon arose a carouse seemed to have been promptly entered upon the sky to the eastward was brightening with the approach of dawn when the revellers at last staggered once more on deck here the handsome manwho seemed to be the chief of the pirate crewpaused for a moment apparently to reiterate and emphasise certain commands already laid upon his subordinate after which he went down the side into his boat and some five minutes afterwards the two craft filled away once more upon their former course it would be impossible to convey to the reader without going into the most shocking and disgusting details any clear idea of the sufferings and indignities to which the unfortunate captain and crew of the aurora were subjected during the next three weeks suffice it to say that during the whole of that time they were never released from the ringbolts to which they were chained that they lay there on the hard planking day and night alternately scorched by the fierce rays of the noonday sun and chilled by the heavy dews of night that they were sparingly and irregularly fedand then only upon the coarsest and most loathsome of foodand still more sparingly and irregularly supplied with water that they were the recipients of incessant abuse and brutality from the wretches who were in possession of the ship and some slight conception can be formed of their dreadful state of body and mind during that interminable three weeks at the end of that time the land was made and late at night both ships glided into an anchorage where they broughtup the canvas was furled in a slovenly fashion which drove poor bowenin spite of all that he had sufferedhalfdistracted the boats were lowered and preparations were at once made for the transport of the prisoners to the shore this operation under the direction of the truculentlooking and ruffianly spaniard already mentioned as the head of the gang in possession of the aurora was speedily effected the prisoners handcuffed with their hands behind them were sent down into one of the boats lowered for their reception and there secured to a length of heavy chain so that where one went the rest were compelled to go also and thus yoked together they were transferred to the shore a glance at the starlit sky in which the polestar hung only some twenty to twentyfive degrees above the horizon told poor leicester that they were landing upon a shore open to the northward and that from the position of polaris in the sky they were somewhere within about twentyfive degrees of the equator but beyond that he was just then unable to learn anything further concerning their whereabouts as the boats keel grated upon the beach the prisoners were ordered by sufficiently significant gesturesnone of them understanding a single word of spanishto climb over the side and make their way up the beach the spaniard in charge pointed significantly with a long whip which he carried to a break in the dense growth of trees which clustered close to the waters edge and then with an ominous flourish of the lash gave the word for the miserable band to move forward a toilsome march of some four or five miles along a track of heavy sand then commenced a march which fatiguing enough in itself after the long period of close confinement to which they had been subjected was rendered trebly so by the constraint of the heavy chain to which they were secured staggering reeling and stumbling forward conscious of nothing beyond their dreadful state of misery and suffering it took them over three hours to perform that horrible journey urged on though they were by the incessant application of the cruel whip and then they found themselves outside an enclosure formed of heavy slabs of planking some nine feet in height a narrow door gave admittance to the place and this being unlocked the prisoners were driven in and after the door had been again securely fastened they were released from the chain and still with their hands secured behind them allowed to stretch their exhausted bodies upon the ground and take such repose as was possible under the circumstances the first definite idea to take possession of george leicesters mind after he had fully realised the calamity of his capture was escape whilst chained immovable to a ringbolt on his own vessels deck this was clearly a simple impossibility and as he now glanced round the enclosure in which he found himself he recognised the fact that it was still equally so it was true that the place was open to the sky and that the scaling of the barricade would be to a strong active free man simply a pleasant gymnastic exercise but he was not free his hands were shackled behind him a sentinel armed with cutlass and gun was promptly placed on guard over the wretched group of captives and last but not least the three weeks of confinement exposure and privation to which he had been subjected had left their mark upon him he could no longer call himself a strong and active man besides this there was walford georges vow to watch over and protect this man and if possible to restore him to lucys arms was ever present to him and he recognised from the very first that if ever he should be so fortunate as to escape walford must certainly accompany him when leicester contemplated the additional difficulties which this necessity forced upon him his courage almostthough not quitefailed him for since the capture of the aurora walford had under the influence of the sufferings to which he in common with the rest had been subjected relapsed into a state of almost complete imbecility so that so far as assisting in the matter of his own escape was concerned he was helpless as an infant there was however one point in leicesters favour and it was this walford still knew him and appeared to recognise in spite of the mists which obscured his intellect the fact that george was keenly interested in him and he was always passively obedient to any injunction which the latter laid upon him the unfortunate crew of the aurora were kept confined in this enclosure four days during which their condition was somewhat ameliorated by the administration of a better quality and a more liberal quantity of food than before and also by the permissionor rather the commandto exercise their cramped and stiffened limbs by a dailyincreasing amount of exercise the cause for this altered treatment soon became apparent on the morning of the fifth dayby which time their haggard halfstarved and feeble appearance had to some slight extent passed away and they were once more able to keep upon their feet for an hour or so without dropping exhausted to the groundthe spaniard who had charge of them made his appearance in the enclosure still arrayed in the filthy habiliments which he wore on board the aurora and armed as usual with whip cutlass and pistol and flourishing the former threateningly in the air roughly bade them rise to their feet this command being obeyed a chain was producedsomewhat lighter than the one before usedthe prisoners were secured to it and then the negro who acted as the spaniards aide or chief mate unlocked the door and the whole party marched out the route on this occasion as on the last was along a narrow bridlepath of heavy sand which led through a dense growth of tropical trees and plants following this path for about a mile the party emerged upon a road crossing the path at right angles into which they turned when at a distance of about two miles a straggling town of low white flatroofed houses became visible with blue water beyond just beginning to be ruffled by the seabreeze a toilsome march of about an hours duration along the glaring white road during which they were scorched by the fierce rays of the sun and nearly blinded by the whirling clouds of fine dust and they entered the town passing along a number of narrow sandy streetsdeserted save for the presence of a few negroes and miserablelooking spaniards ragged and dirty bearing barrels of water strapped upon their shoulders and a goatherd or two driving his flock of milch goats from door to doorthey emerged at last into a large open square in the centre of which stood a tall ugly stone fountain from which more negroes and spaniards were filling their barrels from the wide basin of this fountain george and his companions in misery were allowed to slake their thirst and then they were conducted to a large open shed which stood on one side of the square and under the welcome shade of its wide shingled roof ordered to sit down they had not been here long when another gang of unfortunatesnegroes this timewere driven into the square and under the shed then another and another making in all some four hundred human beings huddled together there like cattle in a pound then for the first time the full horror of their position burst upon george and his wretched companions they were in a slavemarket and were about to be sold as slaves the conviction that this was actually to be their fate fell upon them like a thunderbolt it was almost too much for even georges courage to bear up against and as for poor bowen for a moment it seemed that he would go out of his senses altogether he prayed he cursed himself and everybody else he swore solemnly that he would kill the man who dared to buy him and finally in a paroxysm of mad fury started to his feet dragging at the chain and exerting such an extraordinary amount of strengthin spite of all his recent sufferingsin his efforts to break away that for a moment it seemed almost possible that he would succeed a cruel lash across the face from the spaniards whipa lash which tore away the skin and left a livid bloody weal on both cheeksonly maddened him the more seeing which the negro who with the spaniard was in charge of the party sprang upon him and gripping him by the throat hurled him to the ground with such brutal force that the poor fellow lay there for a time stunned at about nine oclock the square gradually began to fill a large number of spanish gentlemen arriving upon the scene some on horseback and others in gigs drawn by a pair of horses driven tandemfashion they all smoked incessantly and nearly all of them on reaching the square proceeded at once to the shed and walking up and down its entire length examined with the utmost minuteness every individual beneath its roof frequently stopping to make some inquiry of those who had the poor wretches in charge at ten oclock a small shrivelledup specimen of a spaniard dressed entirely in white made his appearance in the square followed by four negroes bearing a couple of chairs and a lightlyconstructed rostrum and accompanied by a sallow cadaverouslooking individual with a large book under his arm a pen behind his ear and a silvermounted inkhorn at his buttonhole selecting a suitable spot for the purpose the negroes placed the rostrum on the ground with one chair in and the other in front of it the shrivelledup spaniard mounted into position his clerk seated himself in front a negro perambulated the square ringing a large handbell and the sale began the blacks were offered first and of these a large proportion had evidently been landed very recently from a slaver for the most part they were a tall finelooking set of men and women that is to say they had been but disease and privation had done almost their worst upon them and as they took their places upon the block one by one their forms showed gaunt and spare as so many skeletons in spite however of their poor condition competition ran high the bidding was brisk and they were rapidly knocked down one after the other until the whole of the cargo was cleared then came a gang of negroesslaves alreadybelonging to the estate of a tobacco planter recently deceased whose heir was disposing of everything prior to a trip to europe most of these poor wretches had been born on the estate others had been on it long enough to form family connections upon it and now husbands and wives parents and children were in many cases about to be ruthlessly torn from each other for ever it was pitifulit was heartbreakingto those unaccustomed to such a scene to witness the expression of utter despair on the faces of these poor creatures then as the sale proceeded this expression would sometimes give way to one of feverish hope as the purchaser of a husband or parent would become a bidder for the wife or child in one or two rare cases the hope was realised and as husband and wife or parent and child found themselves once more reunitedonce more the property of the same mantheir joy was enough to wring tears from the heart of a stone but in most cases the families were utterly broken up no two members becoming the property of the same purchaser and then their dreadful misery their heartbroken anguish was simply indescribable and must be left to the imagination of the reader at length it came to the turn of the auroras crew and mr bowen was selected as the first man to be put up on being released from the chain instead of at once stepping up on the block as he was signed to do he turned to george whose arms were still bound behind him and extending his hand touched the latter lightly on the head by way of farewell exclaiming well capn the moment of partings come at last and a sorrowful enough parting it is battle storm fire or shipwreck i was prepared for but when we sailed out of london i never dreamed that i was on the highway to slavery well gods will be done here we are and i spose we must make the best of it while it lasts which wont be a minute longer than either of us can help if i know anything of you or myself if i get clear first i vow never to steer to the eastard until youve joined company and if you should happen to be off first i hope an impatient exclamation from the spaniard in charge of the party with a savage lash of the whip and a gesture of command to mount the block at once here cut short the rest of poor bowens farewell speech the mate fairly reeled under the force of the blow but he steadied himself in an instant and turned upon his assailant with eyes literally blazing with fury the veins on his forehead stood out like cords the muscles of his arms and legs swelled as he gathered himself together and his body quivered like that of a tiger crouching to the leap in another instant he would have had the presumptuous spaniard in a deathgrip but a cry from leicester stopped him just in time steady bowen exclaimed george eagerly steady dear old friend resistance is worse than useless just now it is their turn today but ours will come it shall come some day and then we will repay them with interest for all our present sufferings right you are capn was bowens reply as he stepped quietly up on the block but turning to the spaniard if ever you and i meet on blue waterwell you shall rue this day thats all this incident being of a somewhat exciting and novel character seemed to afford great gratification to the crowd of buyers gathered round the spot who eagerly remarked to each other upon the courage and indomitable spirit of the british seaman and dwelt upon the pleasure it would afford them to quell that courage and humble that proud spirit to the dust the result of it all was a keen competition for the possession of the man and bowen was at length knocked down to a tall man with thin aquiline features the expression of which was pretty evenly made up of pride resolution and relentless cruelty walford was next put up but the miserable condition of the unfortunate man and his vacant look of imbecility excited nothing but laughter and ridicule and no one would make a bid for him seeing that it would be impossible to sell this lot alone the spaniard with the whip ordered george to be released and placed upon the block also stepping forward at the same time and whispering eagerly in the ear of the auctioneer the latter thereupon explained to the crowd that while the first of the two men offered was undoubtedly valueless of himself and alone he could be made very useful if purchased along with the second who had been found to have great influence over him and could in fact persuade him to do anything which might be required and so on and so on a little brisk bidding then ensued for the two on the part of the more speculative among the buyers who were willing to risk a little possible loss on the chance of obtaining two slaves for a trifle more than the price of one and finally they were purchased by a man who had all the appearance of being an overseer on some extensive estate the lad tom who was next put up was also bought by the same purchaser and in a few minutes the three white mennow slavesfound themselves chained to a gang of negroesmen and womenwho had also fallen into the hands of the same owner half an hour afterwards the gang was put in motion and with the overseer for such he eventually proved to be at their head and three other men mountedone riding on each side and one in the rearas a guard took their way through the town which george at last ascertained was havana out into the country and inland toward the hills along a fairly good road well shaded for the most part with a dense growth of tropical verdure a wearisome tramp along this road for a distance of some ten miles brought them late in the afternoon to the plantation which was to be their future home or prison and george walford and the lad tom with an old negro who possessed a slight smattering of english were installed into a small but fairly comfortable wooden hut thatched with sugarcaneleaves here the clothing which they had been wearing when purchased was taken from them and they were supplied instead with short drawers and jumpers of blue dungaree a plentiful meal of ground maize with a little salt was served out to them and they were left for the remainder of the day to recover themselves and prepare for the labours which awaited them on the morrow chapter fifteen a dash for freedom to find ones self sold into slavery must be a thoroughly unpleasant experience yet when george leicester that night found himself actually a slave the tenant of a slavecabin and with slaves only for his future companions and associates he felt by no means discouraged there was no oppressive feeling of despair weighing down his heart and crushing his spirit into utter hopelessness on the contrary he had the feeling as if a great load of care and anxiety had been lifted from off his heart he now knew the worst of what was to befall him he fully recognised that the life before him was to be one of unrequited hardship at least and it might be also of suffering and bitter tyranny but he braced himself to meet it all whatever it might be with unflinching fortitude sustained by the steadfast inextinguishable hope of eventual escape this hope indeed of eventual escape rose high within his breast now that he had actually arrived upon the spot from which it must be made the estate of which he was now one of the chattels was that of a tobacco and sugar planter of its extent he could at present form no opinion but he saw that it was of considerable size the whole of the cultivated ground within sight being the property of his owner it was situated upon a tolerably level plain with a road running through it from the main road along which they had recently travelled up to the planters house a wide straggling stone structure with a thatched roof and a verandah all round occupying the summit of a slight eminence nearly in the middle of the estate behind the house at a distance of some twenty yards stood another building which george rightly guessed to be the stables the slavehuts of which there were thirtyfour were built at a distance of about a quarter of a mile from the house on a gentle slope at the foot of which stood the boilinghouse and sugarmill the storehouses the tobacco factory etcetera and just beyond them again ran a tiny sparkling stream from which was obtained the power for driving the crushing machinery the slavecabins were wholly unenclosed and george had not failed to notice on his arrival upon the estate that though it was certainly fenced in the fencing consisted of nothing more than a common rough postandrail fence evidently intended merely to keep out cattle and in his innocence he began to think that escape from such a place would prove a very easy matter after all what indeed he asked himself was to prevent his rising from his bed upon the very first favourable night which should arrive and quietly walking off the estate what indeed but escape was far too precious a thing to be risked by being undertaken in ignorance of whatever perils might attend the attempt so he resolved that for the present he would not attempt to frame any plans whatever he felt pretty certain that as a new acquisition he would be closely watched for some time to come by those who might have the more immediate charge of him and his first task he told himself must be to disarm any suspicion which might exist in their minds as to an intention on his part to escape the time necessary to the accomplishment of this might also be profitably employed in acquiring a knowledge of spanish without which he fully realised that his attempt must inevitably fail and he believed that by the time he had thus paved the way for the great attempt his ingenuity would have proved sufficient to gain without suspicion from his fellowslaves a tolerably accurate idea of the perils and difficulties with which he would have to contend he took the lad tom into his confidence at once intending of course that the poor boy should if he were willing to incur the risk go with him and walford and share with them at least the chance of freedom and so from the very first day of their thraldom there were two keen intelligent brains incessantly at work diligently clearing the way to recovered liberty to walford george said nothing whatever of his purpose the unfortunate wretch could not possibly aid them and there was the possibility that he might unwittingly betray them at six oclock next morning the great bell at the enginehouse rang this being the signal for the slaves to turn out and get breakfast half an hour was allowed for this and at halfpast six they were formed into gangs and marched off to the fields in charge of the overseers george and walford were handed a hoe apiece and attached to one of the gangs detailed for work in the tobaccofields the lad tom was attached to another gang and he spent his first day of slavelabour among the sugarcane the tobacco was fast ripening and was just then at one of its many critical stages the plants requiring individually almost as much care and attention as a newborn child each plant required that the earth should be hoed up round its stalk with almost mathematical accuracy to a certain height and no more and every leaf had to be tenderly and scrupulously examined twice or thrice daily to guard against the ruinous attack of the tobaccogrubs it was exhausting backbreaking labour particularly for those unaccustomed to it and the drivers whips were freely used to stimulate the sluggards or those who exhibited any signs of a tendency to shirk the work but george soon sawand congratulated himself upon the circumstancethat the rule was evidently a mild one on this particular plantation the whip being rarely used without provocation it is scarcely necessary to say that leicester was quite resolved to save himself from the indignity of the lash if hard work would do it and he was fortunate enough to return to his hut on that first day without the whip having once been raised against him thus passed day after day and week after week the only variation being that when the tobacco was in proper condition the fields had to be gone through with the utmost care and those leaves which were sufficiently ripe were then picked and laid in little heaps in the sun to sweat and cure this process being repeated daily until the entire crop was gathered in then followed the cleaning of the fields and their preparation for another crop and so on upon all of which it is unnecessary to dwell george and tom devoted the whole of their brief leisure after the work of the day was over to the cultivation of a knowledge of spanish being fortunate enough in their pursuit of this acquirement to make the acquaintance of a young and very intelligent negro who had been for many years valet to his master but being unlucky enough to incur that gentlemans displeasure had been sent in disgrace into the fieldgang with him as a tutor their progress was rapid and in little over six months they were able to converse in spanish with tolerable fluency when at length george found that he was fairly master of the language he began cautiously to touch on the subject of escape a topic upon which pedro his tutor was luckily always ready to enlarge this gentleman regarding himself as an injured individual was always threateningamong his fellowslaves of courseto run away and george was once on the point of declaring to the fellow his own intention of doing the same thing but luckily his discretion stepped in and prevented his committing so great an imprudence the reflection occurring to him just in time that a man who talked so much about the matter was after all very unlikely to act to any purpose one night however pedro entered georges cabin looking very gloomy and sulky and flinging himself down on a stool he announced that he had called to say farewell as he was fully determined not to submit any longer to such base treatment why what has happened now pedro exclaimed george when he heard this announcement i will tell you friend george answered pedro you may possibly have observed that miserable piece of insolence called juan who has been promoted to the post from which i was so unjustly expelled well this wretched ape must needs sendsend mind you not come down and himself ask but sendfor a man to move some furniture up at the house there i have no doubt he specially named me as i was ordered to go and ii refused i declined to be subjected to such an indignity and for this i was at once flogged i have been humiliated disgraced dishonoured and i am resolved not to bear it any longer i shall fly tonight well said george i hope you will get off clear i see no reason why you should not you do not exclaimed pedro ah my good friend that is because you are new to this wretched country are you not aware then that the master keeps quite a pack of bloodhounds for the purpose of hunting runaway slaves and that these bloodhounds are turned loose every night to scour the estate they have been trained to watch over us and prevent our escape if i should happen to encounter one tonight i shall be compelled to abandon the attempt for he will follow me about and should i attempt to pass the fencing spring upon and hold me until his baying brings the overseers to the spot have you never encountered any of these fiends of dogs never answered george his heart sinking at the startling news this is the first i have heard of them then is it quite impossible to walk about the estate at night without being pounced upon by a bloodhound oh dear no was the reply they are so trained that they will not molest you so long as you keep within the boundaries of the estate but they will watch and follow you until you return to your cabin and of course as there is only a dozen of the dogs in all you may perchance get away without encountering one of them but if you do your prospects of escape are still small for you would be missed in the morning the dogs would at once be put upon your track and a regular slavehunt would then begin a slavehunt is rare sport i promise youfor everybody but the slave then it seems remarked george that even in the event of your getting clear of the estate you have very little hope of escape after all none was the reply none whateverunless you happen to possess a certain secret the secret of hiding the scent so that the dogs cannot follow your trail then indeed you may hope to escape but not otherwise i am fortunate enough to possess this secret and as we have been good friendsyou and ii do not mind letting you into itprovided that if you make one in the hunt tomorrowthey take slaves to help sometimesyou will aid my escape in any way you can agreed exclaimed george joyously in any case i would do that still the secret is a valuable one and i should like to be made acquainted with it you shall amigo said pedro and placing his hand inside the bosom of his shirt he produced a handful of leaves do you see these he asked george intimated that he did take particular notice of them so that you may recognise them again with certainty whenever you see them urged pedro note their shape their exact colour note their peculiar odour and above all note their taste for there are other plants quite worthless for the purpose closely resembling this one but the taste will at once tell you when you have found the right one george eagerly took a quantity of the leaves in his hand and carefully examined them noting that though they varied in size they were all of exactly the same shape and hue then he held them to his nostrils and inhaled their odour until he thought he had become fully acquainted with it and finally he put one in his mouth and masticated it the juice had a very peculiar flavour indeed so peculiar that he felt sure he should never forget it and how do you use these leaves asked george if answered pedro you have an opportunity to gather them only a few hours before you wish to use them so that they are perfectly fresh all that you have to do is to bruise and crush them so that their juice shall be free to escape and then rub them well all over your feet this imparts the odour of the plant to the skin and so hides the scent that the dogs are quite unable to follow it but if the leaves have been gathered so long that they have become dry you must put them in water to soak until they become soft once more then first wash your feet in the water and afterwards rub them thoroughly with the leaves only in the latter case you will require a much larger quantity of leaves thanks pedro i shall remember that answered george one more question and i have done where is this plant to be found ah now you have given me a puzzle exclaimed the black the plant is very scarce and is growing daily more so for the reason that the slaveowners carefully root it up and destroy it wherever they find it they are fully acquainted with its peculiar properties they know that it has freed many a persecuted slave from the bondage of a cruel and tyrannical master and that if allowed to flourish it would free many more so it is carefully sought out and ruthlessly dug up when found notwithstanding which a plant is to be found here and there by diligently searching after it it grows generally in wet or marshy ground and in such spots you will have to seek for it if ever you need it now i must go it is close upon the time for the head overseer to go his rounds and i want him to see me in my own cabin as soon as he is once more fairly out of the way i shall be off goodnightand goodbye goodbye answered george grasping the negros proffered hand goodbye and thank you for your valuable secret i heartily wish you good luck and if they get up a hunt and take me to help ill do what i can to throw them off the scent which way do you go you had better know nothing about that answered pedro cautiously all i ask is that if you catch sight of me or observe any sign of my having passed you will simply keep quiet about it and now once more goodbye ten minutes later the head overseer going his rounds on looking into pedros cabin found that individual apparently fast asleep on the floor with his back against the wall and such an utterly fagged wornout look pervading his entire personality that the man was almost betrayed into a momentary feeling of pity for the poor boy his surprise was therefore proportionally great when on the following morning it became apparent that pedro had succeeded in spite of the dogs in making good his escape from the estate a slavehunt was at once organised and about nine oclock as george was hard at work in the fields he saw the hunterssome half a dozen in number mounted and accompanied each by a bloodhoundpass down the main road through the estate and out on to the open ground beyond here the party divided half going in one direction and half in the other to encircle the estate and endeavour to pick up the trail they were absent the whole day but when they returned at about midnight the unfortunate pedro was with them handcuffed and secured by a rope round his neck to the saddle of one of the horsemen it afterwards transpired that he had been perfectly successful not only in evading the dogs during his actual escape from the estate but also in hiding the scent from them and his capture was due to the unfortunate circumstance of his having been met by a friend of his masters who an hour afterwards encountered the party in pursuit of him and so put them upon his track next morning the unhappy wretch was made an example of by being flogged so severely in the presence of all the other slaves belonging to the plantation that at first it seemed doubtful whether he would ever recover from the effects of it and though he did eventually it was nearly three months before he was again fit for work this incident of pedros escape and its unfortunate failure was naturally the chief topic of conversation among the slaves for a long time afterwards and george heard so much of the many difficulties attending such attempts that he often felt upon the very brink of despair the obstacles were so great as to be almost insurmountable when those who made the attempt were strong healthy thoroughly inured to fatigue and had all their faculties about them but when it came to not only making good ones own escape but also that of a feeble and weakly companion of unsettled reason the task seemed so utterly hopeless so thoroughly impracticable that it appeared almost worse than madness to dream of undertaking it yet in spite of all this and notwithstanding the terrible example which had been made of the unhappy pedro george clung tenaciously to the idea and never let slip an opportunity to do anything which in ever so slight a degree might contribute to his success when the time should come for the effort to be made as time passed on and his knowledge of the spanish language became perfected his uniform industry and good conduct procured him many little indulgences such as a few hours of release from fieldlabour now and then in order that he might instead be despatched duly provided with a pass on some errand or message either to a neighbouring plantation or to havana itself these little journeys not only afforded him an opportunityof which he made the mostof studying the physical geography of the island but also of hunting for the precious plant by means of which he hoped to successfully hide his trail and in this latter quest he was so far fortunate that he found at different times as many as eight of them five of which he successfully transplanted to a favourable spot on the estate itself in such an outoftheway locality that he fervently hoped they would escape discovery the next task which he set himselfand tomwas that of propitiating and making friends with the dogs which nightly guarded the estate but in this they were wholly unsuccessful the creatures had been too well trained and they absolutely refused all overtures from men who wore the detested garb of slavery the circumstance however that they were of white instead of negro blood was a point in our adventurers favour and george accidentally made the discovery that probably in consequence of this circumstance when he was able by any means to conceal the uniform he usually wore the hounds though still suspicious were puzzled and undecided how to behave towards him in the meantime whilst steadily cultivating the favour of the overseers by his unvarying industry and good conduct he as sedulously cultivated the goodwill and friendship of his fellowslaves and by the exercise of great tact and circumspection he gradually won from them without exciting their slightest suspicion such a mass of valuable information as quite decided him when the time should come to make his way inland and to the southward rather than to the northward the latter route though that which would soonest enable him to reach the coast being chiefly in consequence of that circumstance by far the most perilous one the next matter requiring attention was the acquisition of arms of some description with which the party could defend themselves in the event of their being pursued and overtaken these by a lucky chance he was at length enabled to procure in the shape of three caneknives weapons closely resembling a cutlass as regards the length and curve of the blade but provided merely with a wooden handle instead of the metal guard usually fitted to the latter weapon the same lucky chance which enabled him to secure these caneknivesnamely the finding of a gold fivedollar piece on the road during one of his excursions into havana also supplied him with the means of purchasing three coarse canvas jackets such as were commonly worn by the cuban coasting seamen at that time and with these he hoped to sufficiently disguise himself and his companions to avoid any inconvenient questioning on the road when the time for the great attempt should arrive the auspicious moment arrived as such moments frequently do quite unexpectedly and it came about in the following manner when george and his comrades had been in slavery a trifle over a year a message reached the estate to the effect that a ship had that day arrived from europe in the cargo of which there were certain household articles that had been ordered expressly for the use of the planters wife and that as they happened to be stowed on the top and the ship had already begun to discharge it was desirable that they should be sent for at once in order that they might escape damage this message reached the estate quite late in the evening in fact it was within half an hour of the time for knocking off work for the night but so impatient was the lady to see her new possessions that she insisted upon their being sent for at once and george as the most trustworthy slave on the plantation was ordered to take the mulewaggon and a couple of companions and proceed into town forthwith to fetch them so that they might be at the house and all ready for unloading by the first thing next morning he was instructed that as it would probably be very late or rather early next morning before he returned he was to drive the waggon down to the enginehouse and place it under the shed there for the remainder of the night instead of driving up to the house so that he might not disturb the occupants by the noise of his arrival leicester at once saw that this errand would afford him probably the best opportunity he would ever have for the attempted escape he therefore mentioned to the overseer that he thought tom and walford would be the most handy men he could take with him as helpers and at once went off in an unconcerned manner but with a wellassumed air of imperfectly concealed dissatisfaction at the prospect of his night journey to harness up the mules on his way to the stables he sought out walford and the lad tom bidding them both be ready to go with him and imparting to the latter his determination to take advantage of this opportunity to attempt their joint escape this done he hurried away to the spot where he had concealed his treasured plants and arrived there only to find that they were gone whether they had been discovered and destroyed by the overseers or had been found and appropriated by some fellowslave acquainted with their valuable properties it was impossible to tell the one indisputable fact was that the plants had vanished this was a most unfortunate circumstance but george would not allow it to dishearten him the fugitives would have several hours start before the pursuit would commence and then there was always the possibility that other specimens of the plant might be found thinking thus he slowly wended his way to the stable where he harnessed up the mules threw into the waggon a quantity of grass and caneleaves together with a canvas cover and rope supposed to be required for packing and protecting the articles and then drove to the hut where tom and walford awaited him the former a very shrewd and intelligent young fellow had immediately upon being apprised by george of his intention hurried off to prepare supper recognising the great importance of a good substantial meal before starting especially in view of the uncertainty as to when they would be able to secure another and when george reached the hut this meal was just ready the trio partook of this their last meal in slavery as they hoped with great deliberation george being most anxious not to start until darkness should so far have settled down upon the scene as to allow of his smuggling the caneknives and canvas jackets in under the grass in the waggon without detection this was at length successfully managed and first taking a careful look all round the hut to see that they were leaving nothing behind them which might possibly prove useful they clambered into the cart and drove slowly off night had by this time fairly set in the stars were just beginning to peep out from the deepening blue of the cloudless vault above them and the moon in her first quarter and hanging almost in the zenith was already flooding the scene with her soft silvery radiance it promised to be a magnificent night for their enterprise though excessively close and hot and as they turned into the main road leading into havana and left the estate fairly behind them george and the lad tom felt their spirits rising and their pulses bounding with joyous anticipation of a speedy return to freedom whilst harnessing the mules leicester had rapidly turned over in his mind the pros and cons of the situation and had come to the conclusion that it would be necessary in the first instance to proceed some three or four miles on the road toward havana this necessity arose from the circumstance that the planters house stood upon a slight eminence commanding a perfect view of the road for that distance and as leicester could not possibly be sure that some one might not be idly watching from the verandah the progress of the waggon as long as it remained in view he deemed it only common prudence to keep to the road until he had passed completely out of the range of any such chance watchers this done he intended to turn sharp off and make the best of his way southward utilising the waggon and mules for as great a distance as possible and then abandoning them and pressing forward on foot the distance which they would have to travel was not very great the island being according to such information as had been available to him only some twelve and a half spanish leagues or about thirty english miles wide at that part thus if they were fortunate in their choice of a route so as to be able to use the waggon for the whole distance they might succeed in reaching the southern shore of the island before their escape was so much as suspected george explained all this to tom as the mules trotted cheerily along the road and by the time that the plan of escape had been fully elucidated they had reached a point where they might with perfect safety branch off and make their way to the southward this they did at once branching square off to the westward in the first instance until they were about a mile distant from the road and completely hidden by the bush from the observation of any one upon it and then turning in a southerly direction a dense belt of forest then lay before them at a distance of some six miles with a lofty hilltop rising behind it and toward this latter object george now headed the mules as straight as the scattered clumps of bush would permit the soil was very light and sandy but it was covered with a thick growth of grass which prevented the mules feet or the waggonwheels from sinking so that the travelling was nearly if not quite as rapid as it had been along the road a sharp lookout was maintained for signs indicative of their approach to the neighbourhood of plantations and two or three bridlepaths evidently leading to such were crossed but at length they reached the welcome skirts of the forest without having had the least cause to suppose that they had been observed in the meantime however a heavy bank of thundercloud had been observed rapidly gathering on the southern horizon and the runaways had scarcely plunged a mile into the forest before the heavens were obscured and it at once became so pitchdark that it was utterly impossible for them to proceed the mules were consequently pulled up and the three adventurers made what few preparations were possible for their protection from the coming storm soon the low threatening rumble of the thunder was heard and then as it rapidly increased in volume of sound bright flashes of light were seen blazing out beyond the interweaving branches of the trees the storm as in all tropical countries quickly gathered force and intensity and very soon it was raging in all its fury above and around them the loud reverberating roll of the thunder was incessant the lightning flashed with everincreasing rapidity and at last the entire atmosphere seemed to be in one continued tremulous glare of unearthly light the mules started and quivered as the lightningflashes grew more rapid and intense and finally they became so terrified that george had as much as he could do to restrain them from bolting and so dashing themselves the waggon and its occupants to pieces against the trees the storm was at its fiercest when suddenly the party found themselves enveloped in a blinding blaze of greenishblue light simultaneously there came a terrific rattling crash as though the universe had burst asunder the occupants of the waggonblinded and deafened by the dazzling brilliancy of the flash and the tremendous report which accompanied itfelt themselves hurled violently to the earth and then followed oblivion chapter sixteen the pursuit when george leicester at last awoke from his stupor and had sufficiently recovered his scattered senses to remember where he was the strength and fury of the storm had passed the lightningflashes being much less vivid and coming at considerably longer intervals but the rain was descending in a perfect deluge and notwithstanding the shelter of the thick overhanging foliage the ground was already so completely flooded that george at first thought he was lying in the bed of some shallow watercourse he staggered to his feet chill and dripping wet and taking advantage of the intermittent light afforded by the lightning looked around him to ascertain if possible what had actually happened and he then saw that an immense tree close by had been shivered from top to bottom by the lightning and falling across their path had killed both mules and completely wrecked the waggon his own escape and that of his companions if indeed they had escaped had been simply miraculous a huge branch having struck the waggon only about one foot behind the seat upon which they had been sitting the ground was littered with splinters and encumbered with the spreading branches of the fallen tree and among these he proceeded to search for tom and walford a low moaning sound some short distance on his right told him that in that direction he would probably find one of the missing and groping his way cautiously to the spot he found the unfortunate walford lying on his back with the water surging round him like a millrace and a large branch of the fallen tree lying across his breast and pinning him down by exerting his whole strength george managed to bear up the branch sufficiently for walford to work his way from underneath it and then he helped the poor wretch to his feet inquiring at the same time if he had received any serious hurt unfortunately one of the apathetic fits which occasionally seized walford had come upon him and george was quite unable to gain anything like an intelligible answer from him but he was scarcely able to stand and his continued moaning and the constant pressure of his hands upon his breast showed that he was evidently suffering great pain seating the unfortunate man at the foot of a tree where he would be beyond the reach of the water and making him as comfortable as was possible george then went in search of the lad tom whom he found standing bewildered over the wreck of the waggon with a thin stream of blood slowly trickling down his face from a scalpwound probably inflicted by a blow from one of the branches of the tree as it fell ha tom is that you exclaimed george joyously i was just coming to look for you how have you fared in the general smash is that you capn answered tom well im very glad to find youve turned up all right it has been a smash and no mistake a total wreck and no insurance ill be bound well its unfortnate but it cant be helped it might ha been much worse i got a whack on the skull that knocked the senses out of me for a while but i dont feel very much the worse for it ater all wheres poor mr walford sir whats become of him he is close by answered george but a big branch fell across his chest and i am afraid he is very much hurt lets have a look at him said tom and the two men groped and stumbled their way without more ado to the place where walford was still seated with his back resting against the giant bole of the tree a few trials were sufficient to establish the fact that the poor fellow was practically helpless for the time at least and it then became a question of what it would be best to do under the circumstances the first idea was that george and tom should each take an arm of the injured man over their shoulders and so assist him along but he moved with such great difficulty that it was soon apparent some other plan would have to be adopted i have it exclaimed george as a bright idea struck him and hurrying away to the waggon he secured the canvas and rope which had been thrown into it together with the caneknives canvas jackets and other trifling belongings and hurried back to the tree now tom he said look about you my lad and see if you can find a nice light handy branch tolerably straight and about ten feet long and bring it here as quickly as you can ay ay sir answered tom starting off on his errand at once whilst he was gone george spread out the canvas upon the ground and with the aid of a pocketknife which he had seen lying about in the stable that evening and had taken the liberty of appropriating proceeded to roughly shape a hammock out of the material leaving enough canvas at each end to form with the rope an eye through which to pass the branch from which he intended it to be slung he had hardly finished his preparations when tom reappeared with the waggonpole which he had found fortunately unbroken will this do sir asked tom the very thing was georges delighted reply now walford he continued lie down on that canvas old fellow and well soon have you slung comfortably in your hammock between us where you will travel without much pain to your poor chest thats it now tom pass the end of the pole through this eye capital now through the other thats your sort now ill take the fore end of the pole and you the after end lift handsomely have you got your end on your shoulder then off we go we have not such a very great distance to travelonly some twenty miles or sobut we must get over the ground as quickly as possible for when once nine oclock tomorrow morning has passed we may make certain that theyll be after us so we must reach the coast by that time or soon after it if we wish to get clear off and in this manner with walford slung in his impromptu hammock between them george and tom set off upon the wearisome journey which lay before them and which they fondly hoped was to end in the absolute recovery of their liberty tramp tramp splash splash on they trudgedstumbling over the roots of trees tripping over the long tough straggling creepers which crossed their path sometimes broughtup all standing and halfstrangled by the cordlike llianas which hung festooned from tree to tree their naked feet and legs torn by thorns and stabbed by the spines of the wild cactusin thick impenetrable darkness for a couple of hours and then the clouds suddenly vanished away on the wings of the landbreeze the stars reappeared the soft silvery rays of the moon streamed down once more through the gaps in the foliage and the weary fugitives flung themselves down upon the sodden ground for a short breathingspace george was of opinion that from the time they had been tramping through the forest they ought to have very nearly reached its southern skirts but as far as the eye could penetrate in the uncertain moonlight through the sylvan vistas there was no sign of break or opening of any kind nothing but an apparently endless succession of trees and dense undergrowth seeing this leicester began to feel uneasy he knew that they had been travelling through the timber in anything but a straight lineindeed to do so would have been simply a physical impossibility and he began to fear that in spite of all his efforts to avoid such a misfortune they had been journeying along the arc of a circle instead of progressing steadily in a southerly direction the wanderers were beginning to feel thoroughly fatigued what with their days work in the fields their exposure during the storm and their painful tramp afterwards but george felt that fatigued or not they must push on liberty must be secured first when that was won they could afford time to rest but not until then the first thing to be done however was to get a definite idea of whereabouts they were it was obviously useless to continue plodding on they knew not whither besides it was frightfully fatiguing and painful work this marching through the forest and george felt that it would be a positive advantage even to deviate somewhat from their direct course if by so doing they could earlier gain the open ground once more so looking around him he picked out the most lofty tree he could find and leaving tom to keep watch by walfords side nimbly scrambled up its trunk and was soon among its topmost branches a single glance around sufficed to show him that his suspicions were correct they were only about half a mile from the northern edge of the timber and consequently rather worse off than if they had never left the wrecked waggon at all and worse still george found that after all their travelling they were little more than three miles from the estate the whole of which was distinctly visible from his lofty standpoint this was rather discouraging but there was no help for it he now knew exactly where they were and how much greater than even he had imagined was the necessity for immediate action so he turned his glances in a southerly direction and sought to discover the most direct road out of their unpleasant predicament here he met with an ample reward for his trouble in climbing the tree for he saw that if they pursued their way due southas they could now do directing their course by the moonthey would have to travel through at least seven miles of forest whilst by heading in a southwesterly direction keeping the moon a little on their left hand they would only have to traverse some two miles of forest after which there seemed to be tolerably open ground as far as the eye could reach about three miles eastsoutheast of him he detected the gleaming white walls of a number of buildings which he judged to be a portion of the town of santiago beyond it rose a curiouslyshaped doubleconed mountain away on his right lay the tableland of mariel andjoyous sightthrough a break in the rising ground to the southward he caught a glimpse of the sea with far away on the utmost verge of the horizon an appearance of land which he conjectured must be the isle of pines noting all these matters carefully and making a rough mental sketch of the lay of the land george rapidly descended to where he had left tom and walford and rapidly detailed to the former the result of his observations we must be off at once he explained for we have no time to spare we have lost nearly three good hours blundering about here blindly in this wood it must be now nearly or quite midnight and if so it leaves us only ten hours at most to reach the sea if we are to do so without being overtaken accordingly weary and stiff as they were they again shouldered the pole from which walford in his hammock was slung and once more set out upon their journey which now that they were favoured by the light of the moon they hoped would be of a somewhat more prosperous character than it had hitherto been another painful and toilsome tramp of a couple of hours and they emerged to their unbounded joy from the southern side of the forest on to comparatively open ground trees and dense straggling clumps of bush were still abundant enoughfar too much so in factbut there were wide patches of grassland between over which their progress was tolerably rapid once clear of the thick timber george again shaped his course due south intending to pass through the break in the rising ground which he had seen from his lofty lookout but somehow they missed it and this involved a great deal of toilsome climbing at length they plunged once more into a belt of timber which stretched seemingly for miles across their path and here exhausted nature gave out tom declared his utter inability to walk another yard george felt scarcely better than his companion and so notwithstanding the terrible loss of precious time which it involved they selected the first suitable spot they could find and flinging themselves upon the ground one on each side of walford gave themselves up to the sweetest sleep which had ever sealed their eyelids george was the first of the trio to awaken and when he did so he found to his dismay that the sun was already several hours high in the heavens he immediately aroused the lad tom and greatly refreshed by their sleep the pair once more shouldered poor helpless walford and his hammock and resumed their flight they were as hungry as healthy men usually are after great exertion and a fast of several hours duration but they had not a particle of food with them so they were compelled to subsist for the present upon hope the hope that ere long they would meet with something more substantial they felt no particular anxiety upon this score as george knew that wild fruits of several kinds were tolerably plentiful on the island and about half an hour after they had started they were fortunate enough to fall in with a wild plantain the fruit of which was just in the right condition for eating no time was lost in securing a goodly bunch of this very nutritious fruit upon which they feasted as they went along until their appetites were completely satisfied after trudging manfully along for about a couple of hours they found themselves upon the crest of a range of low hills from which they caught through a break in the scrub a glimpse of the sea sparkling invitingly under the noonday sun they also caught a glimpse of something by no means so pleasantnamely a town of considerable dimensions immediately before them and only about two miles distant to avoid this they were compelled to make a wide detour and much valuable time was lost in this way and in reconnoitring for they knew there would be several plantations in immediate proximity to so important a place and through these they would have as it were to run the gauntlet and notwithstanding all their caution they failed to effect their passage entirely unobserved through this dangerous district it unfortunately happening that just as they emerged from the bush and were about to cross a highroad which they had been watching for nearly half an hour a vehicle appeared in sight suddenly wheeling into the road close to them from a bushpath which they had failed to observe this vehicle was occupied by two persons a white man and a negro driver and as it was utterly impossible to avoid the observation of these two persons george told tom in a few low hasty words to continue moving to carefully conceal all appearance of chagrin and to leave him to answer any questions which might be put to them as the vehicle approached the fugitives its owner signed to his driver to pull up but he immediately changed his mind and passed on contenting himself with a careful and prolonged scrutiny of the travellers this disagreeable incident caused george and his companion to push on with renewed vigour and it was with sincerely thankful hearts that they at last plunged into a shallow ravine which promised to lead them directly down to the sea then not more in leicesters opinion than some four or five miles distant the sun was by this time sinking low in the heavens and the travellers unutterably weary as they were pressed eagerly forward hoping to reach the coast before nightfall and to discover a craft of some kind which they could appropriate and in which later on when the night was well advanced and they could hope to do so unobserved they might venture to put to sea this was the only effectual method of escape which george could deviseto put to sea upon the chance of being picked up by some passing vessel he knew that when once the fact of their escape became established the news would travel faster than they possibly could the whole country for many miles round would be apprised of their number and appearance and recapture would be certain to get afloat therefore as speedily as possible was their first object after that they must trust to chanceor providence ratherfor their ultimate rescue as they advanced along the ravine it grew deeper whilst its sides became steeper and more rugged until at last the place assumed quite the appearance of a mountaingorge or defile with rocky precipitous sides to which a few scattered shrubs clung here and there at length in the deep silence of the breathless evening the thrice welcome sound of the sea breaking upon the shore came faintly to their ears it was the merest faintest murmur it is true but their experienced ears told them in a moment what it was they were within the sound of the sea and in a few short hours at most please god they would be safe from pursuit a bend in the defile was before them about a quarter of a mile distant and toward this they eagerly pressed believing that when they had passed it they would find themselves face to face with the sea in their eagerness they broke into a run notwithstanding their terrible state of fatigue and soon rounded the bendto find themselves in a culdesac with a perpendicular wall of cliff in front of them nearly two hundred feet high with a groan of bitter anguish and disappointment they deposited walford in his hammock on the ground and turned to ask each other what should be done in the face of this new difficulty as they did so the deep bay of a dog smote upon their ears from the higher end of the ravine the sound was instantly repeated again and again in a slightly different key proving that the cries were uttered not by one but by several animals the dogs the dogs exclaimed tom they are after us by jove and here we are caught like rats in a trap george glanced eagerly about him up and down the ravine to go back was simply to throw themselves into the arms of their pursuers for that they were pursued he did not for an instant doubt to hide even if a hidingplace could be found was impossible with those keenscented brutes upon their tracks and to remain where they were was to await inevitable capture could they go forward that meant scaling that terrible wall of rock as george glanced despairingly up the lofty perpendicular cliff he thought that an active man unencumbered might possibly accomplish the feat at all events were he so circumstanced he would try it and what he could do he knew the lad tom could do also but there was walford unable to walk much less to scale that awful precipice as he stood thus the baying of the dogs again came floating down the ravine and how much nearer and clearer were now the sounds the brutes must be coming down after them at a run as of course they easily could upon a redhot scent the sounds decided george to make one more desperate effort for freedom look here tom said he after coming thus far we must not be taken for want of a little extra effort if we are you may be sure we shall never be allowed to make a second attempt now our only chance is to scale that cliff we must do it and we can do it if we only go resolutely to work it will be difficult fatiguing and awfully dangerous for we must take poor walford with us but liberty awaits us at the top the sea is not half a mile off i know by the sound of it and we can reach it before those fellows can ride round to intercept us so let us set to with a will my lad and we shall scrape clear yet you take my word for it now out with your caneknife and cut away at the grass we must well pad poor walford all round with it so that he may not be hurt by bumping against those rocks then well lash him hard and fast in the canvas lash ourselves one to each end of him and away aloft we go chapter seventeen on the face of the precipice the caneknives were speedily at work the grass was long and abundant and as the two men were working for libertynay probably for life itselfthey were not long in cutting a sufficient quantity for their purpose walford was then lifted carefully out upon the ground the grass was thickly and evenly distributed over the inner side of the hammock and then the invalid was again deposited within it and securely lashed up his head only being left free this done two lanyards were securely attached to the extempore hammock one at its head and the other at its foot well done thats capital exclaimed george as the last turn was taken making all secure now slip the bight over yourah here come the dogs by all thats unfortunate we must defend ourselves with the caneknives ill tackle the first one you take the next andmind we have no time to waste luckily there are only three of the brutes as yet we must kill them and be up out of reach before the others or their masters arrive keep steady tom my lad and strike so that one blow shall be sufficient now thencome on you devils as george finished speaking the dogsthree superb specimens of the cuban bloodhounddashed up to within about ten feet of the fugitives and there stopped not attacking them as they had expected but merely baying loudly this will not do exclaimed george if we turn our backs upon them for a single instant they will seize us and we cannot afford the time to stand looking at them i will take the dark one you attack the light fellow and mind what you are about for they are as strong and active as tigers now at the word both men sprang forward with uplifted caneknives and made a slash at the dogs the creatures tried to dodge the blows and one of themthe one attacked by tomsucceeded george however was more fortunate he made a feint and as the dog sprang aside he followed him up recovering his weapon smartly at the same time and bringing it down in another second on the creatures head with such strength and effect that the skull was cloven open and the poor brute with a yell of agony rolled over dead tom meanwhile was battling ineffectually with the dog he had attacked and george turned just in time to see the hound spring savagely at the lads throat and hurl him to the ground with a single bound leicester reached toms side and raising the caneknife above his head and grasping the handle with both hands he brought it down with all his strength across the dogs neck taking care to avoid the thick leather collar which protected it the blow clove through skin and bone dividing the spine and nearly severing the head from the body but even then it was difficult to free poor tom from the iron jaws which had seized him with a vigorous wrench however this was effected and george then dragged the lad to his feet are you hurt panted leicester no gasped tom the beast only seized me by the collar of my jacket and then come on at once interrupted george the third dog has turned tail like a craven luckily for us now slip the bight of the lanyard over your neck and follow me leave the caneknives they will only encumber us and perhaps throw us down the face of the precipice now look out im going to start as george spoke he approached the face of the precipice and taking advantage of whatever projections he could find began the task of scaling it tom following behind and walford slung in his makeshift hammock between the two they worked desperately these two men knowing how much depended upon the next few minutes and an onlooker would have been astounded at the progress they made encumbered as they were with the weight and bulk of their helpless companion in one minute from the time of starting they had gained a height of forty feet and then the sudden trampling of horses hoofs and the loud shouts of their pursuers told them that the latter had rounded the bend and that they were seen in a few seconds the sounds ceased at the foot of the cliff and in another instant the voice of the head overseer was heard shouting to them hola there giorgioyou miscreantcome down or i will fire keep steady tom gasped george let them fire the chances are ten to one that they will miss us do you feel nervous lad not i answered tom never felt steadier in my life capn this rope is cutting into my shoulders awful bad though so it is into mine returned george but we must grin and bear it now until we get to the top andwhatever you dolook up boy if you look down youll grow dizzy and likely enough slip then down we must all inevitably go are you coming down you rascals shouted the overseer it dont look much like it i reckon senhor chuckled tom to himself hoisting himself over the edge of a good broad ledge of rock as he spoke a ledge some ten feet in width now exclaimed leicester as he helped the lad up well rest here a minute or two and recover our breath they may blaze away at us as long as they like now were as safe from their bullets as if they were a dozen miles away the overseer and his companions however seemed to think differently for the fugitives had scarcely settled themselves comfortably when a regular fusillade was opened upon them but as george and tom were completely sheltered by the projecting ledge none of the shot came near them they were now about halfway up the cliff and from this position an excellent view presented itself for some distance up the ravine which they had just left but both george and tom now that they were sitting quietly down and had leisure to think about it felt the sense of empty space immediately before them and of the sheer precipice which they knew lay beyond that narrow ledge to be exceedingly trying to the nerves presently the clatter of horses hoofs came ringing upward to them from the bottom of the ravine and peering cautiously over the edge of the rock george saw that the party of manhunters accompanied by four bloodhounds had started off at a gallop on their way back to the entrance of the culdesac he at once guessed that their intention was to ride round over the hills and endeavour to pick up the trail again at the top of the cliff the act of looking downward from so great an elevation and the sight of the sheer precipice on the very edge of which he was hanging with absolutely nothing to prevent him from falling over and going whirling headlong down to the bottom produced in george a sudden attack of vertigo the whole landscape appeared to rock to and fro the ledge upon which he was standing seemed to sway suddenly forward over the abyss and threaten to launch him into space he felt himself wavering upon the very brink and an almost uncontrollable impulse seized him to spring off and take that terrible downward flight another glance downward and the impulse became irresistible he drew back a step braced himself for the terrible leap flung his arms above his head and uttering a piercing cry was in the very act of launching himself forward over the edge when tom happening to glance at him and to detect his suicidal determination just in time sprang up and with a cry of amazement and horror dragged him forcibly back against the wall of rock behind why capn exclaimed the lad as soon as he had sufficiently recovered from his astonishment to speakwhy capn whatevers the matter with yer what was you goin to do for the moment poor george was too unnerved to speak the instant that he was dragged back from the ledge the horrible fascination lost its hold upon him he suddenly realised in its fullest extent the frightful peril from which he had been so providentially snatched and covering his face with his hands as the revulsion of feeling came upon him he shook and quivered like an aspenleaf a minute or two more and this dreadful feeling also passed away his calmness and selfpossession returned to him and placing himself upon his knees there on that narrow ledge of rock he humbly returned his hearty thanks to god for his preservation and prayed for help and deliverance for himself and his companions in their present sore need then turning to tom he said thank you tom you have saved my life as surely as ever mans life has been saved by a fellowcreature in this world i was in the very act of springing off the rock when you dragged me back and but for you my body would at this moment be lying mangled and lifeless a hundred feet below i do not know how it was but when i looked down over the edge i turned giddy and sick all in a moment and then i felt that i must fling myself down the precipice let this be a warning to us both my lad for it shows that steady as are our heads aloft at sea they are not to be too much depended upon when climbing precipices on shore but come it is high time that we should be moving again those fellows are halfway to the head of the valley by this time and if we are not smart they will have us yet do you feel sufficiently rested to tackle the other half of this cliff ay ay capn im ready answered tom but for the lords sake sir and for all our sakes dont you go for to look down and get tempted to jump off again perhaps i mightnt be able to stop you next time you know all right tom never fear answered george ill take care not to run such an awful risk again you may be sure now are you ready then take your end of this poor fellow and let us be moving but now that they were ready to resume their ascent another terrible difficulty presented itself on looking upward for a projection by which to raise himself leicester for the first time became aware that the ledge on which they stood marked a change of strata below them it was all hard rock above the ledge he could see nothing but a vertical unbroken face some twenty feet in height of soft crumbling sandstone so soft indeed that it scarcely merited the name of stone at all but might be more fitly described as solidly compressed red sandy soil of such slight tenacity that it was possible to scrape it away with the naked finger to climb this smooth crumbling face even with the aid of a ladder george at once saw would have been utterly impossible for though it has been spoken of as vertical it was not strictly so it inclined slightly forward so as actually to overhang them and a ladder would therefore not have stood against the face how then could they hope encumbered as they were to surmount it the task was an obvious impossibility and george saw that it would be necessary to seek for a practicable place elsewhere accordingly walford was once more laid upon the rock with tom to watch him and guard against any possible mishap whilst george went off upon an exploring expedition he first tried to the left passing along the ledge very cautiously with his face turned to the wall so that he might not again be exposed to the terrible temptation from which he had so recently escaped at first he had great hopes of success the ledge beginning to slope upward as he passed along it to the eastward but when he had traversed some fifty yards or so it suddenly narrowed away to nothing under a projecting angle of the superimposed sandstone and in endeavouring to get a glimpse round this angle the soft material crumbled in georges grasp he lost his hold staggered reeled struggled ineffectually to recover his balance and fell for a single instant he gave himself up as lost and suffered in anticipation all the agonies of a frightful death but he had not fallen more than six feet when his outstretched hand encountered a long stout flexible twig or rather a young tree shooting out from an interstice in the rocks he grasped it with the iron grip of a drowning man grasped it with both hands and though it bent double with his weight it held out bravely and enabled him to regain his footing on the face of the precipice in another moment he had scrambled once more on to the ledge where he lay panting breathless with torn and bleeding hands but safe the appalling peril from which he had thus a second time so narrowly escaped inflicted a terrible shock on georges nerves and it was some time before he could find courage to once more raise his head and look about him the reflection however that two men one of them utterly helpless were in the same perilous situation as himselfhaving indeed been brought directly into it by himhelped him to once more recover the command of his nerves and somewhat ashamed of their unexpected weakness he scrambled to his feet and set out to explore in the opposite direction by the time that he had once more reached the point where tom sat patiently awaiting him the dusk was closing down upon the landscape with all the rapidity peculiar to the tropics and shrouded as they were in the deep shadow of the precipice it was already difficult for them to see each other clearly this meant still another danger added to those which already confronted them and george felt that unless a way of escape could quickly be found they would be compelled to remain where they were all night a prospect which involved so many horrible contingencies that he dared not allow his mind to dwell upon it but turning his attention strictly to the matter in hand hurried away on his quest to the westward in this direction he was more successful the ledge at a distance of some thirty yards running into a steep earthy slope some ten or a dozen yards in height above which the precipice again rose sheer to the top and as far as he could see in the quickgathering darkness this precipice again presented a rocky face up the inequalities of which it might be possible for them to climb but a single glance was enough to assure george that the most perilous portion of their journey still lay before them in the first place the slope was frightfully steep rising at an angle of fully fifty degrees from the horizontal and in the next place it was covered with a long thick growth of grass rendering its face almost as slippery as ice and its lower edge terminated abruptly in a vertical overhanging face similar to that which towered above the place where he had left tom and walford so that should either of them slip in traversing this dangerous part of their journey they must all lashed together as they were inevitably slide and roll helplessly down and over the edge into the depths below as george contemplated the fearful dangers attending their further progress the idea occurred to him that perhaps after all now that their pursuers had gone and the ground was left clear below it would be better to retrace their steps and endeavour to find another and more practicable way out of the ravine but a few seconds consideration of this plan convinced leicester of its utter impracticability they had by superhuman exertions succeeded in climbing up the precipice but he knew that they could never get walford safely down again there was nothing for it then but to go on and upward even though they should find their pursuers awaiting them at the top a contingency which so much lost time rendered only too probable before going back however and attempting the passage up that awful slope encumbered with walfords helpless body george thought it would be prudent to essay the passage alone so that he might learn from actual experience the full extent of the danger and thus be the better able to guard against disaster accordingly down he went upon hands and knees and forthwith began the ascent his first attempt proved to him that he had in no wise magnified the perils of the journey for his knees slipped helplessly from under him the moment that they touched the grass and it was only by clinging desperately with his hands to the long tough herbage that he escaped being shot down to the bottom and over the edge returning once more to the friendly ledge which after the dangers he had so recently passed through seemed to afford a position of absolute safety george began to cast about in his mind for some means of overcoming this new difficulty and at last he hit upon the idea of making a narrow pathway up the slope by pulling up the grass by the roots this however he soon found would be a work of considerable time but he also discovered that it would be possible without any great difficulty to remove small patches of just sufficient size to give a precarious but comparatively secure foothold and this he at once proceeded to do half an hour of arduous labour in this direction enabled him to safely reach the top of the slope where to his great gratification he discovered another platform of rock about six feet wide passing along this he came suddenly upon an irregular fissure in the rocky face of the precipice this fissure was about four feet wide at the bottom the walls sloping inwards like a roof until they met at a height of seven or eight feet from the ground george at once unhesitatingly entered the opening and found that it widened somewhat as it receded from the face of the rock until at a distance of some five and twenty feet inwards it abruptly terminated in a small cavelike aperture some six feet in height and perhaps twelve in diameter being as nearly as he could ascertain by the sense of touch only roughly of a circular form george was inexpressibly thankful that he had been guided to this place of refuge for here he resolved the party should pass the night as they easily could with the most perfect safety it was by this time far too dark to attempt the awful risk of a passage up the precipice and he felt sure that even could they succeed in safely reaching the top their pursuers would be found there awaiting them but this cavernous fissure afforded them the very shelter they required its existence was in all probability absolutely a secret and even were it not so it was inaccessible to all but those who chose to risk their necks in an effort to reach it and lastly they could seek in it the rest they so absolutely needed without the haunting fear of rolling over the precipice in their sleep thinking thus leicester rapidly but cautiously made his way back to tom whom he found in a state of the greatest mental perturbation owing to his prolonged absence hastily describing to the lad the fortunate discovery which he had made george made what few preparations were required for the short but dangerous journey before them and then the two resumed their load and with cautious steps wended their way along the ledge to the treacherous slope it was by this time as dark as it would be throughout the night but this circumstance rather lessened than increased their peril for it prevented their realising as fully as in broad daylight the giddy height of the narrow path along which they were travelling whilst the brilliant light from the stars overhead was sufficient to enable them to pick their steps and find the bare patches in the grass in which it was so imperatively necessary for them to plant their footsteps at last after nearly a quarter of an hours arduous labour and several narrow escapes from a disastrous accident the welcome shelter of the cavelike fissure was reached and feeling their way cautiously into it they laid walford down released him from his uncomfortable bonds and hungry thirsty and utterly fagged out as they were with the arduous labours of the day threw themselves down beside him and with a halfunconscious thanksgiving for their preservation trembling upon their lips fell at once into a profound slumber their sleep lasted until late on in the following day the sun being already low in the heavens when george was awakened by walford with a querulous demand for food and drink he at once rose and proceeding to the mouth of the fissure effected a cautious reconnaissance the result of which was the establishment of the satisfactory circumstance that no one was visible in the ravine below the next point to be ascertained was whether his pursuersany or all of themwere still maintaining a watch for them on the cliff above george had not the slightest doubt but that when he saw them riding up the valley on the previous evening they had resolved to ride round and intercept the fugitives or pick up their trail at the clifftop if possible the question to be settled was whether having failed in both these objects they would establish a watch upon that part of the cliff at which the fugitives might be expected to make their appearance or whether believing that pursuit had been baffled and an escape effected they would return discomfited to the estate leicester was of opinion that failing to detect any sign of the fugitives and the dogs being unable to pick up the scent a suspicion might occur to the minds of the pursuers that their prey was still lurking in some precarious restingplace on the face of the precipice and in that case no doubt a strict watch would be maintained for some hours but as to how long it would be before the patience of the watchers became exhausted or before the conviction should thrust itself upon them that the fugitives had escaped he could of course form no opinion but having thus far evaded capture he thought it would be only prudent to make sure that the coast was clear before proceeding further in the prosecution of their flight having come to this conclusion he returned to the inner recesses of the cave acquainted tom with his intention to make a trip of exploration as far if necessary as the top of the cliff and forthwith set out upon his mission georges first act on issuing from the fissure was to cast a look aloft in order that he might judge of the nature of the task still before them the sight was anything but encouraging the task of climbing that vertical faceperfectly smooth to all intents and purposes the projections and inequalities being so slight as to be barely distinguishable beyond a height of twenty or fiveandtwenty feetseeming to him even after his recent experience of cliffclimbing a sheer impossibility to climb it even unencumbered as he then was was a task not to be lightly entered upon and he determined that before attempting it he would seek further and endeavour to discover a somewhat less difficult path to the summit with this object in view he continued his way along the rocky platform upon which he was then standing until he rounded a sharp angle where it abruptly came to an end and gave place to a rough jagged and broken face very similar to that which they had ascended on the previous evening casting his eye over and up this uneven face in an effort to pick out the most suitable path his gaze was arrested by the sight of a bush growing out of the face of the rock the bush was only some ten feet distant and he was therefore close enough to it not only to see that it was evidently a species of wild raspberry but also to discern the very welcome circumstance that it was literally bending beneath its weight of ripe fruit he was not long in making his way to the spot where it stood and then removing his jacket and knotting the sleeves round his neck he with a seamans readiness of invention converted it into a sort of bag which he rapidly filled to its utmost capacity with the cool ripe refreshing juicy fruit with this he hurried back to the inmates of the cave and laying it before them bade them eat freely returning himself to the bush since it lay exactly in the way he intended to take to satisfy the cravings of his own appetite chapter eighteen the fugitives make good their escape having partaken of as much of the fruit as he deemed prudent george at once betook himself to the task of climbing the precipice and was agreeably surprised at the rapidity and ease with which he accomplished the ascent now that he was unencumbered with walfords weight and was free from the horrible dread which had before haunted himthat a false step on toms part might precipitate all hands to the bottomhis confidence in his own powers enabled him to coolly approach and successfully surmount obstacles which under less favourable conditions he would have dreaded to face and in a few minutes he was within a foot or two of the top here he deemed it prudent to pause for a moment and survey the path by which he had ascended so that in the event of danger he might be able to effect a rapid retreat the glance downward which he permitted himself to take though only momentary brought on again though happily only in a mitigated degree the same feeling of vertigo and nausea from which he had before suffered and he was obliged to close his eyes for a short time clinging convulsively to the rock meanwhile to avoid falling headlong to the bottom having at length once more recovered his steadiness he rose cautiously higher and higher until his head was level with the top edge of the precipice and then he ventured to raise his head rapidly cast a flying glance round and dip it again but the latter precaution was needless the ground still sloped upward so that he could see for a distance of some forty yards only but all the visible space was perfectly clear there was no human eye to detect his presence there once more raising his head and this time taking a more leisurely and deliberate glance round to make assurance doubly sure he proceeded to make his way up over the edge on to the comparatively level ground at the top this was a task demanding the utmost caution for a depth of some eighteen inches of light soil crowned the rock thickly covered with long rank grass which owing to the lightness of the soil afforded but a very precarious and uncertain hold the soil itself too crumbled away immediately beneath his touch so that at the very top of the precipice he was unable to find anything to which he could safely hold for a short time it almost seemed as if these apparently trifling obstacles were about to baffle him altogether and it was not until he had actually laid bare the rock immediately in front of him as far as his arm could reach that he accomplished his object and stood safely on the top of the cliff he now threw himself flat on the ground in the long grass thus effectually concealing himself from the view of any chance passerby and crawled to the crest of the hill where he again peered cautiously about him the ground from the spot whereon he knelt declined pretty steeply to the sea only a quarter of a mile distant slightly to his right there lay a valley with a tiny river flowing through it into the sea and on either bank of this stream there stood two or three crazy wattlehuts scarcely worthy the name of human habitations with a net or two spread behind them on poles in the sun to dry three or four fishingcanoes and a boata ships boat which looked as though it had been picked up derelictwere moored in the stream but human beings there were none visible in line with the river commencing at a distance of about two miles from the shore and extending right out to the horizon there lay a group of islets some forty or more in number and far away beyond them lying like a thin grey cloud of haze on the water he could see the isle of pines so far so good thought george the spot was evidently a lonely one inhabited by a few fishermen only there was no sign of any watch being maintained on the chance of the runaways putting in an appearance so the chase had doubtless by this time been abandoned as hopeless there was a capital boatwhich in his urgent necessity he felt he need not scruple to appropriatelying in the stream below and everything promised favourably for a successful escape from the island but though the scene below looked so quiet and deserted and though the boat lay there so temptingly within sight leicester felt that the evening would be the most suitable time for making their final effort they were in no immediate hurry now and it was scarcely worth while to risk detection by putting off in broad daylight besides the seabreeze was blowing half a gale and in their exhausted condition they would scarcely be able to drive the boat ahead against it whilst by waiting until sundown they would have it calm to start with and the breeze when it came would be off the land and in their favour thus arguing the matter with himself he rose to his feet and sauntered leisurely back to the cliffedge on his return journey he was surprised and greatly disconcerted now to discover how easy it was to miss the spot at which he had made his ascent the strong breeze sweeping over the grass had obliterated every trace of his recent passage through it but he confidently walked in what he believed to be the right directiononly to find himself mistaken the bare patch of rock which he had cleared to facilitate his passage over the edge was of course when once found an unmistakable landmark but he was quite five minutes walking to and fro on the cliffedge before he hit upon it and quite long enough to have insured his capture had he been surprised and closely pursued having at last found it however he forthwith began his descent and here again he was disagreeably reminded of the much greater difficulty which is experienced in the descent than in the ascent of a cliff his difficulties began with his first attempt to lower himself over the cliffedge and notwithstanding his utmost care he several times found himself in positions of the most appalling peril he however got down safely to the cavern at last and after detailing to tom the result of his observations threw himself down on the rocky floor to recover in sleep if possible the strength and nerve necessary for their final ascent when george awoke the sun was within about an hour of setting there was therefore time for him to go out and secure for his companions and himself another meal of the wild raspberries which he accordingly did the fugitives had all their preparations complete in good time and when everything was quite ready leicester went out and stood at the entrance to the fissure watching the shadows creep gradually higher and higher up the eastern side of the ravine as the sun declined toward the horizon at length the last golden gleam vanished the entire landscape assumed a hue of rich purplegrey rapidly deepening in tone as the darkness of the tropical night settled swiftly down and the supreme moment had arrived returning at once to the interior of the cave george briefly announced that it was time to start walford already securely lashed in his hammock was at once hoisted up between george and tom as before and issuing from the mouth of the fissure the fugitives forthwith began the last and most perilous part of the ascent they had scarcely risen a couple of yards when rapid hoofbeats were heard in the valley below and pausing for a moment to glance down george saw a mounted figure galloping rapidly up the valley he recognised it at once as one of their former pursuers and saw in a moment how completely these pertinacious manhunters had outwitted him it immediately became clear to him that failing to pick up the trail at the top of the precipice these fellows had jumped to the conclusion that improbable as it might seem their prey must still be lurking hidden somewhere on the face of the precipice and doubtless during the previous night the individual just seen had returned and secreting himself among the bushes below had maintained an untiring watch on the face of the cliff there could be no doubt that he had seen georges ascent of the cliff that morning and observing him to be alone had rightly concluded that the journey up the cliff had been made for the purpose of a reconnaissance and had therefore remained perdu satisfied that before long his patience would be rewarded as it had been by witnessing the attempted flight of the whole party these reflections flashed like lightning through georges brain and helped him to an instant decision we must go on now he exclaimed to tom they have discovered our hidingplace and if we were to return to it they would simply blockade the top and bottom of the precipice knowing that sooner or later we must inevitably fall into their hands and in addition to that they would spread the information of our position all over the country and perhaps offer a reward for our capture in which case we should have perhaps a hundred watching for us instead of halfadozen we have a chance yet for it will take them fully twenty minutes to ride round by which time if we are fortunate we can reach the boat now tom my lad do your utmost in twenty minutes we shall either have won our freedom or relapsed into slavery for ever not another word was now said by either of them until that awful climb was over and they had after countless hairbreadth escapes safely reached the top of the cliff when at last they once more stood on comparatively level ground they felt as though their limbs had no strength to carry them another yard upon their way so exhausting had been the superhuman efforts which they had put forth but there was no pauseno rest for them yet onward they must still press at their topmost speed or all that they had hitherto endured would be in vain the short journey from the top of the precipice to the summit of the rising ground was a cruel one the slope gentle though it was telling upon them terribly as they staggered forward over the long slippery grass panting breathless staggering and stumbling at every step and dreading every moment to hear the triumphant shout announcing the arrival of their pursuers upon the scene but so far save that of their own laboured breathing not a sound of any kind broke in upon the deep stillness of the evening hour and when at last they surmounted the crest of the hill the scene below was one of peaceful solitude now one moreone supreme effort tom and in five minutes we shall be free gasped george muster all your courage and resolution and let us make a run for it can you do it ay ay sir ill try was the scarcely articulate reply and without more ado they set off down the slope at a run a run well yes it was a run if it was anything at all but such a run their limbs felt like lead and walfords weight seemed to them enough to drag them down to the very centre of the earth every individual blade of grass seemed to be invested with the toughness of a hempen cable and to trail directly across their path for the express purpose of retarding their progress and tripping them up their breath was gone their mouths were open and gasping their hearts were beating like sledgehammers against their ribs and pumping the blood in a great redhot tide up into their heads their brains reeled their sight began to fail them and what little of the scene was still perceptible to their disordered vision was apparently whirling in a mad dance up and down round and round them until they could not tell whether they were going right or wrong yet on they still staggered and stumbled first one then the other falling prone to the earth but up again in an instant and on once more at last they were at the base of the hill another halfadozen yards and they would be beside the stream another twenty and they would be in the boat hark what sound is that the dull thud of horses hoofs upon the turf with what headlong speed the riders are pressing forward andha there is the exultant shout which tells that the prey is in sight thank god there are no dogs with them thinks george are there not then what means that deep sonorous baying sound which breaks with such startling distinctness on his frenzied ear on on for the love of god press on gasps george and with something almost like renewed effort the fugitives once more spring forward hark now you can hear the deep panting of those hellhounds as they lunge forward at a gallop silent now that their prey is in sight their flaming eyes fixed upon the flying men in front of them and their jaws champing in horrible anticipation one more bound and the boat is reached poor walford is tumbled unceremoniously into her george and tom follow the latter wrenching from the foetid mud the stake to which the rotting painter is attached whilst the former with a last desperate effort sends the crazy craft into the middle of the stream as he rolls in over the gunwale a heavy splash is heard and some cumbrous body scurries from the slimy bank into the water whilst at the same moment the foremost hound a magnificent creature as big and as lithe as a panther springs boldly after the receding boat he almost reaches her not quite his front paws catch upon the gunwale but the rest of his body falls short and drops into the water a thrust from one of the oars sends him clear of the boat and with a baffled howl he turns and swims for the shore he is within three feet of the bank when a something which looks like a log of charred timber rises to the surface behind him two gleaming eyes glare at him and with a horrid snap a pair of serrated jaws close upon his hind quarters and he is dragged back and under to furnish a meal to the terrible cayman but the fugitives have no time for more than the merest superficial glance at this canine tragedy for their human pursuers are now close at hand the thowlpins luckily are already in their places left there by the fishermen who have been too lazy to remove and stow them snugly away the oars are therefore hastily caught up and tossed into their places the boat is spun round like a top until her head points seaward and with vigorous strokes the two men send her foaming out along the narrow riverchannel toward the sea the pursuers rein up upon the bank and with one accord draw their pistols and open a fusillade upon the flying boat fortunately it is a harmless one one bullet lodges in the stern transom a second chips a shaving off the loom of georges oar a third passes harmlessly through the planking of the boats bow and skims a few yards along the surface of the water beyond and the remainder fly wide but after so long and persevering a hunt these men are not disposed to sit still tamely and witness the escape of those whom they have sworn to take back with them dead or alive to the plantation so after a few minutes of hurried consultation three of them dismount and hauling one of the canoes to the bank enter her and start in chase the way in which they handle the paddles and send the light craft surging down the river in the wake of the boat proves that they are no novices in the boatmans art but neither are the two of whom they are in chase george and tom have already nearly forgotten their terrible fatigue they are fast recovering their wind their legsthe members in which they suffered most severelyare now comparatively at rest an entirely new set of muscles is brought into action and as they are perfect masters of the art of handling an oar they are getting a surprising rate of speed out of the old boat without very much effort in a couple of minutes they are clear of the rivers mouth through the rollers which are breaking on the miniature bar and heading fairly out to sea but human endurance has its limits and after they had been tugging away for half an hour at the clumsy illmade oars their exertions began to tell upon them their strength began to flag and the canoe which they had hitherto contrived to keep at a distance began slowly to gain on them though how much they could not well tell as it was by this time quite dark and they could only distinguish her as a small dark shapeless blot on the surface of the water with a tiny luminous ripple under her bow they were just beginning to discuss their probabilities of success should it come to a handtohand fight with those three armed and unfatigued men when a faint puff of warm air fanned their faces thank god exclaimed george fervently thank god there is the first puff of the landbreeze with that he began to fumble with one hand at the lashings of the sail which lay stretched fore and aft along the thwart beside him working his oar with the other hand meanwhile and after a little difficulty the knot which secured them was cast loose and the turns partially thrown off now tom you must finish the job exclaimed george you can reach and throw off the rest of the turns where you sit the sail is a lug by the feel of itat all events here is a yard of some sort lying alongside the mastand when you have cast off the lashings and are ready to step the mast say the word and lay in your oar then ill scull the boat whilst you step the mast and hoist the sail hurrah here comes the breeze hot and strong get the canvas on her and at last we shall be able to enjoy a rest if those fellows are wise now theyll bout ship at once and make for the shore five minutes hence it will be blowing fresh and if they dont look out theyll be blown off the land altogether are you ready then in oars step the mast and sway away upon the halliards so said so done tom tossed in his oar seized the mast and stepped it the halliards were already bent to the yardlaziness again the fishermen evidently having been too indolent to cast them adrift knowing that they would only have to bend them on again when next they wanted to use the sailand in another minute tom had the sail mastheaded the tack lashed down and the sheet aft in georges hand whilst the latter sinking down in the sternsheets with a sigh of ineffable relief and too tired yet to ship the rudder steered the boat with the oar which he had used for sculling whilst tom was busied in the operation of making sail the canoe meanwhile had crept up to within her own length of the chase and oaths and exclamations of mutual encouragement were freely mingled with peremptory orders to the fugitives to surrender and threats of the punishment awaiting them when caught but no sooner was the sail set than the boat drew rapidly away and in ten minutes more the canoe with its occupants still paddling furiously out to sea was invisible george confidently expected to be saluted with a parting shower of bullets but he was agreeably disappointed owing possibly to the circumstance that in the hurry of pursuit the crew of the canoe had omitted to bring their ammunition with them for the first four hours of their flight the voyagers were sailing continuously among the group of low islets which george had seen from the top of the hill but about midnight as nearly as they could guess the last rock was passed and they found themselves in open water and now the want of a chart made itself disagreeably manifest george was quite seaman enough to be able to steer a tolerably straight course using the stars as a guide by night and the sun by day but unfortunately having nothing but his memory to go by he had only a very vague notion of the proper course to steer and of the distance which they would have to travel his plans moreover were by no means fixed one of his ideas was to stand boldly out to sea in a southeasterly direction in the hope of hitting jamaica where they would at once find themselves among friends able and willing to help them but against this plan there were several grave objections the chief of which was his uncertainty as to the exact position of the island and the consequent probability that from its small size they would miss it altogether then again they were absolutely without food or water it is true there were a few scraps of putrid fish in the boat and tom had found a fishingline under the bottomboards forward so that having a line and the wherewithal to bait it they might possibly succeed in catching a few fish but then it would obviously not do to rely on such a mere chance as that another idea was to get into the open water southward of the isle of pines and look out for either an english frigateone of which would be pretty certain to be cruising in that directionor an eastwardbound merchantman from honduras this plan seemed to george the most feasible under the circumstances and in favour of it he finally decided the first matter to which they devoted themselves on finding that they had no longer anything to fear from the canoe was walfords comfort the poor fellow made no complaintindeed he had scarcely opened his mouth to utter a word since the moment when he received his injurybut it had for the last two days been growing increasingly apparent to george that his unfortunate rival was rapidly sinking into a very critical condition under the combined effects of the injury exposure and want he was wasting visibly away his strength was so completely gone that he was quite unable to move without assistance and george had once or twice asked himself the question whether he was justified in involving this poor weak demented creature in the sufferings which there was only too much reason to believe still awaited them would it not have been truer kindness he asked himself to have left walford in some sheltered spot where there would be a certainty of his being speedily found and taken care of but reflection satisfied him that it would not to have left him in the hands of the spaniards would have been to leave him in slavery for the remainder of his life and judging by himself leicester felt that death itself would be preferable to such a fate then again there was the possibilitya slender one it is true but still a possibilityof their speedy rescue in which case with the care and nursing which he would be sure to receive there was no reason why walford should not recover both his health and his intellect so comforting himself with the reflection that he was doing the best he could for the unfortunate man george arranged a comfortable berth for him in the sternsheets of the boat and deposited him thereon still lashed up in his canvas hammock the grass packing of which formed a comparatively soft and comfortable support to his emaciated frame chapter nineteen death claims a victim the breeze continued fresh until about midnight after which it lessened a trifle and came off from the larboard quarter daybreak found the boat off the northeastern extremity of the isle of pines and about five miles distant from that curious chain of islets called by the spaniards the islas de mangles which curves out like a breakwater across the northern face of the island their hunger which had to some extent been appeased by their last plentiful meal of wild raspberries and which had been altogether forgotten in the excitement of their subsequent flight now returned to them in full force and the breeze failing them george determined to put the line overboard and try for a few fish he was successful beyond his most sanguine expectations halfadozen fine but grotesquelooking fish speedily rewarding his efforts the idea of devouring them raw was rather repulsive but as there was no possible means of cooking them they had either to do that or go without breakfast so selecting the most temptinglooking they cut it up and after making a wry face over the first mouthful or two managed to satisfactorily dispose of it that is to say george and tom did but poor walford on being offered a share shook his head murmured that he was not hungry and closed his eyes again in patient suffering the balance of the catch was carefully cleaned and strung up on the yard in the hope that it would dry in the sun their great want now was water their hunger being satisfied thirst began to assert itself and george would have landed upon the isle of pines and endeavoured to find fresh water but for the fact that he caught sight of several people on the shore who appeared to be watching the boat with pertinacious curiosity in this strait he tried the plan of dipping his shirt into the sea and putting it on again dripping wet and to his great delight he found that this proceeding had a very sensible effect in mitigating thirst upon this tom tried the same plan with equally beneficial results and then they well soused poor walford with seawater hoping that it would to some extent revive and refresh him by midday the isle of pines was broad on their starboard quarter the last cay on the jardines shoal had been passed and they were fairly at sea and in deep water they might now reasonably look out for a frigate at any moment but as it would not do to depend upon this source of rescue alone george continued to stand boldly to the southward and eastward hoping that by so doing he would not only improve his prospects of falling in with a british frigate but that he would alsofailing the frigatemeet with a friendly merchantman by sunset they were fairly out of sight of land but so far nothing in the shape of a sail had greeted their longing eyes once or twice a white speck on the horizon had temporarily raised their hopes but it had vanished the next moment being probably nothing more than the sunlight flashing upon a seabirds wing george was hourly growing more and more anxious for a speedy rescue not so much on his own account as for walfords sake the condition of the latter being such as to give rise to the liveliest apprehension he had eaten nothing since the previous day pleading want of appetite and as the sun went down he watched its gradual disappearance beneath the purple waves with wistful eagerness murmuring the last time the last time then as the solemn darkness swept down over the sea and the stars came out one by one in the great blue vault above the little consciousness of his surroundings which he hitherto retained left him and he fell to murmuring snatches of songs mingled with babblings of his childhoods days the word mother was frequently upon his lips and once he burst into a passion of hysterical tears murmuring childlike that he was very sorry and that if she would forgive him he would be a good boy for the future and would never do it again this state of things gravely alarmed george who began to fear that the last great solemn change was at hand it was therefore with a feeling of intense relief that he heard a hail of sail ho from tom whose sharp eyes had at last caught sight of a genuine and unmistakable sail broad on the boats lee bow there was nothing however to be done but to carefully watch the helm of the boat she was already under canvas and steering the best course possible for intercepting the stranger the only thing therefore was to steer straight otherwise the chances were that the ship would be missed after all the strange sail was steering about eastsoutheast being closehauled on the larboard tack and from her position george thought it just possible that he might intercept her or at all events near her sufficiently to permit of her crew hearing his hail as they passed as the night deepened the breeze freshened and by the time that the strange sail had been in sight half an hour it was blowing so fresh that it was as much as they could do to keep the lee gunwale above water yet they dared not shorten sail for the breeze which was threatening at every moment to capsize them was also hurrying the stranger more rapidly along and consequently lessening their chances of intercepting her thick clouds too began to gather in the sky threatening more wind and by obscuring the light of the moon rendering it just so much the more unlikely that the crew of the approaching vessel would see them at last a heavy squall burst about a mile to windward of them and george was reluctantly compelled to order tom forward to shorten sail unfortunately the halliards had somehow got jammed aloft in the sheave and the sail would not come down tom tugged and tugged at it desperately but all to no purpose there it stuck with the squall rushing down upon them like a racehorse cast off the tack tom and let the sail fly shouted george and the lad had scarcely time to obey the order when the squall burst furiously upon them the sail streamed out in the wind like a great banner from the top of the mast lashing furiously and shaking the boat to her keel the crazy craft careened gunwaleto notwithstanding that george had put his helm promptly up and in another moment she would undoubtedly have gone over with them but just as the water was beginning to pour in over the gunwale crack went the mast and the thwart with it over the side the boat was nearly half full of water and in their anxiety to free her and get her before the wind the mast and sail parted company from the boat and they never saw them again the squall lasted about five minutes and then passed off leaving only a gentle breeze behind it as soon as this was the case they had a look round for the strange sail and made her outa topsailschooner about a mile and a half distant george saw that there was still a chance for them so they out oars and pulled vigorously all was going well when to their intense surprise the craft after approaching to within little more than a quarter of a mile of them suddenly put up her helm and wearing round stood away upon a southwesterly course with one accord george and tom started to their feet and shouted lustily and repeatedly ship ahoy ship ahoy ship ahoy until their throats were so strained that their voices failed them and they became unable to utter another sound it was all to no purpose their cries attracted not the slightest notice the schooner ran rapidly away from them and at last george in despair laid in his oar flung himself down in the sternsheets and covered his eyes with his hands to shut out the tantalising sight half an hour afterwards the reason for this extraordinary conduct on the part of the schooner became apparent the upper canvas of a large ship under a heavy press of sail appearing in the southeast quarter that this ship was a manowar was evident at a glance from the cut of her sails and the course which she was steering together with her large spread of canvas showed that she was in pursuit of the schooner the first impulse of those in the boat was to out oars and pull toward her but five minutes work sufficed to show them that their chance was almost hopeless the frigate would pass them at a distance of about six miles and with every eye on board her intently fixed upon the chase what prospect was there in that uncertain light of so small an object as the boat being seen at so great a distance nevertheless they toiled on with dogged perseverance and did not abandon their efforts until the frigate had passed them and her topsails had sunk below the horizon then indeed they laid in their oars and directed their whole attention to walford whose condition became more alarming every moment not that he made any complaint the poor fellow indeed seemed to be quite unconscious of his pain and weakness but his ghastly pallor his laboured breathing and the convulsive shudders which agitated his frame from time to time were to george a tolerably clear indication that dissolution was near at hand he was still quite lightheaded his mind wandering in feverish haste from scene to scene of his boyhood as was evident from the rapid disjointed sentences which poured uninterruptedly from his lips george was able to gather pretty clearly from them that even as a lad walford had been wilful headstrong and obstinate prone to go his own way without much consideration for the wishes of others and there were occasional wild words and broken exclamations which seemed to indicate that even whilst little more than a mere child he had allowed himself to be betrayed into actual crime and as he lay there gasping his life away the follies of boyhood and the graver offences of more recent days seemed to be in some way jumbled up hopelessly in his disordered mind with a confused idea of the urgent necessity for speedy repentance of both there could be no doubt that notwithstanding the disordered state of the unhappy mans intellect conscience was busily at work with him that he was already beginning to dimly see the error of his ways and the hollownessthe utter unprofitablenessof his past life and possibly also the critical nature of his position but the mind was too completely shattered to avail itself of these promptings and the remorse and regret which had tardily come to him found expression only in the simple pleadings for pardon which a child offers to its grieved parent this distressing state of things lasted at intervals all through the night and well into the following day when the dying man utterly exhausted sank into a fitful troubled sleep the pangs of hunger andstill worseof thirst again making themselves felt george once more put the fishingline over the side and after waiting patiently for nearly an hour had the satisfaction of feeling a smart tug at it he gave a sharp jerk to strike the hook firmly into his fish and at once began to haul smartly in but he had only gathered in a foot or so of the line when there came a terrific pull at it which sent the cord flying through his fingers in spite of all his efforts to hold it he promptly called tom to his assistance but even with this aid he was unable to hold the fish and as a last resource he threw a couple of turns round one of the thowlpins the result was disastrous the line snapped short off at the pin and when they came to investigate further they found that they had lost the whole of it except a bare fathom which still remained in the boat this was a misfortune indeed as it deprived them of their only means of obtaining that sustenance which was now becoming so urgent a necessity to them but sailors are not easily disheartened and they forthwith set to work to manufacture a new line out of the rope which they still had in the boat tom carefully unlaying the strands and jointing the yarns whilst george tried his best to manufacture a hook out of a nail drawn from the gunwale of the boat this task occupied them for the remainder of the day and when it was completed the hook and line together constituted such a very makeshift hopelesslooking affair that george in spite of his hunger could not repress an incredulous smile at the idea of any fish with his wits about him being beguiled by it they tried it however but it was an utter failure they could not secure even the barren encouragement of a nibble and at last the attempt was given up in despair shortly before sunset walford once more opened his eyes and began to stare blankly about him for a minute or two there was a look in his eyes which encouraged george to hope that reason was returning to her abandoned throne but the look quickly passed away and the incoherent mutterings recommenced the sun went down nights mantle of darkness once more descended upon the sea and then the full moon in all her queenly beauty rolled slowly into view above the horizon flooding the scene with her silvery light and investing it with a magical beauty which was not without its influence even on those poor faminestricken creatures who were watching with such sympathetic solicitude beside their dying companion suddenly walfords mutterings ceased an expression of joyous surprise lighted up his ghastly wasted features he seized georges hand with a firm clasp in one of his and raising the other exclaimed hark what was that i heard nothing ned answered george tremulously he knew instinctively now that the last dread moment was close at handi heard nothing what was it my mother answered walfordmy mother calling to me as she used to call me when i was a little innocent child when sheha there it is again it is her own dear wellremembered voice she is calling me to go to her i must not stay out at play any longer i did so last night you know and it grieved her she said i was a naughty disobedient boy and i made her cry but she forgave me and kissed me after i had said my prayers andandour father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as the first words of this simple beautiful prayer issued from walfords dying lips george and tom threw themselves upon their knees in the bottom of the boat their hands clasped their heads bent and their hearts earnestly uplifted to him who was thus mercifully taking the poor sufferer to himself the first sentence was spoken with childlike simplicity but after that every word was uttered with increasing fervour and an evident conception of its momentous import until the clause was reached and forgive us our trespasses which was breathed forth with a solemn intensity that thrilled the very souls of the listeners then the voice suddenly ceased and as george looked up with startled eyes he saw walfords lips tremble a radiant smile parted them for an instant and he sank heavily back on the boats thwart dead george gazed long and earnestly in the face of the dead man his thoughts travelling rapidly back to that eventful evening when they two metthe one going humbly and doubtingly to declare his love the other hurrying triumphantly away from a successful wooing and leicester grieved as he pictured the sorrow of that loving womans heart when the news should be taken to her of the sad event just past he thought too of the strange meeting in midocean of the helpless state in which walford had remained since then of his own vow and all that it had cost him and as he reverently gathered the folds of canvas about the lifeless form he felt comforted with the reflection that though he had failed he had honestly done his best to keep that vow he did what he could to dispose the corpse decently and to prepare it for its last long sleep beneath the waves it was not much that he was able to do but he did what he could for lucys sake as he kept on muttering to himself and when all was ready he turned to tom the poor lad utterly wornout had sunk down in the bottom of the boat and with one arm supporting his head on the thwart was fast asleep well better so thought george to himself he is enjoying at least a temporary respite from his miseries i will not disturb him and murmuring a short but earnest prayer he raised the body in his arms lifted it over the side of the boat and allowed it to pass gently away from his grasp into the peaceful depths below god have mercy on his soul he murmured and with clasped hands stood and watched the shrouded form passing slowly out of sight for ever chapter twenty mr bowen unexpectedly reappears about an hour afterwards a fine breeze sprang up from the northeast and putting the boat before it george seated himself in the stern tiller in hand and steered as near a southerly course as the boat without canvas would go very gloomy and despondent were his thoughts as he sat there idly watching the crispcurling waves racing past one of the trio had passed away and without food or water without mast or sail with their strength rapidly ebbing away the situation of the remaining two was hourly growing more critical had they not had the misfortune to lose both mast and sail george would have endeavoured to return to the isle of pines but to do so with the oars alone now that they had scarcely strength to use them was impossible there was no alternative therefore but to wait patiently and hope that they might be picked up before it should be too late the boat drifted on hour after hour the sun rose the wavecrests sparkled and glanced under his cheering rays and still the horizon remained sailless at last tom after stirring uneasily awoke from his stupor glanced with eager haggard eyes around him and uttered a groan of despair then it is not true after all he gasped and george noticed with consternation the difficulty with which the poor fellow articulatedit is not true it was only a dream what was a dream tom asked george and he started at the hollow sepulchral tones of his own voice i dreamt that a noble ship had hove in sight and was bearing down upon us under stunsails she was painted white from her truck down to her waterline her canvas was white as snow she was flying a great white flag from her mainroyalmasthead and the people on board her were all dressed in white it was a grand sight to see her sweeping down toward us with the cool clear water flashing up under her sharp bows and there wasah see it was no dream after all hurrah she comesshe comes and the poor fellow pointed away to where the rays of the sun fell upon the water in a broad white dazzling glare merciful heaven muttered george this is horrible the lad is out of his senses gone mad with hunger and thirst sit down tom said he coaxingly sit down theres a good fellow i can see no ship what you see is only the glare of the sun on the water but if we are only patient please god a ship will come and pick us up before long but we must be cool and steady and keep a sharp lookout so that when she heaves in sight we may be ready to signal to her tom passed his hand wearily over his forehead shaded his eyes with his hand again peered long and anxiously over the gleaming sea and shook his head despondingly the bright vision had vanished and he sank moodily down in the bottom of the boat his arms resting upon the thwart and his head bowed upon them oh that terrible time of waiting with the sun beating mercilessly down upon their uncovered heads and scorching up their brains with the hellish tortures of hunger and thirst already unendurable momentarily increasing in intensity with a horrible feeling of deadly weakness fast paralysing their energies and dragging like leaden weights upon their aching limbs what wonder that each moment lagged until it seemed an hour each minute a day and that the hours stretched themselves out into eternities of overwhelming anguish at last george feebly felt with a curious mingling of despair and relief that his own senses were leaving him soon the boat wasto his disordered visionno longer drifting helplessly upon a lonely sea she was tranquilly gliding under silken sails up the winding reaches of a gently flowing stream the crystal waters of which flowed over golden sands and between banks of richest flowery verdure with overshadowing trees whose boughs drooped beneath their load of blushing fruit whilst in the distance palaces of whitest marble gleamed amid the manytinted foliage and all the air was musical with the songs of birds he no longer felt the agonies of hunger or the fiery torment of thirst he plucked the ripe fruit as the boat swept gently past and his pangs were assuaged he no longer suffered from the scorching rays of the sun for a silken awning floated over his head and the cool breeze crept refreshingly beneath it and gently fanned his aching brow and he no longer suffered from weariness for his body reclined upon cushions of the softest down and he felt himself gradually sinking into a luxurious slumber under the soothing influence of the most entrancing melodies ou ay hell do weel eneuch hes comin roun brawly its joost a plain common case o starvation an exposure theres naething complicatit about it at a pairfect rest and a guid nourishing diet ll set him on his pins again in less than a week such were the words which fell upon george leicesters ear as he once more became feebly conscious of the fact of his own existence the words came to him mingled with other sounds to witthe creaking of bulkheads the rattling of cabin doors hooked back to allow the free passage of fresh air the grinding of a rudder and the clank of rudderchains the sonorous hum of the wind through a ships rigging the flapping of a sail the distant subdued murmur of mens voices and the soft plashing of water he at the same time became conscious of a gentle swaying and pitching motion such as is felt on board a ship closehauled with a moderate breeze and a correspondingly moderate sea for a minute or two george felt languidly puzzled as to his whereabouts but he was by no means anxious for enlightenment upon the subject he was in a state of blissful comfort and he was quite content to remain in passive enjoyment of the same to feel the gentle current of air softly fanning his brow to yield himself to the easy luxurious swing of the cot in which he was lying and to listen dreamily to the soothing sough of the wind and the plash and gurgle of the water along the ships side it was whilst he remained in this semiconscious state of beatitude that another voice broke in in cheery response to the words of the first speaker with thats capital news doctor i heartily congratulate you on the successful result of your efforts and the other one is also likely to do well you say ou ay hell do weel eneuch too thoughmind yethe puir laddie has had a narrow escape but theyre a richt the noo i ken richt weel what tae do wi baith noo that i hae succeedit in bringin back some signs o life in them and noo captain if yell excuse me illeh weel hoos a wi ye the noo my mon this exclamation was elicited by the circumstance that george had at last mustered sufficient resolution to open his eyes and look curiously about him and this is what he saw he saw that he was the occupant of a snowwhite canvas cot which hung suspended from the beams of a ships roomy aftercabin the situation of the apartment being manifested by the presence of sternports fitted with glazed sashes all of which were open there were also two sideports one on each side of the cabin out of which grinned a couple of eighteenpound carronades the carriages of which as well as the whole of the gun inside the port were painted white the walls of the cabin the deckbeams and the underside of the deck were also painted white with gilt mouldings a few picturesone of which was the portrait of a ladywere securely fastened to the walls the floor was covered with fine matting and a large writingtable with three or four solid substantiallooking chairs completed the furnishing of the apartment but the chief objects of attraction to george were two figures which stood beside his cot one of these was a tall lanky individual clad entirely in white with red hair prominent cheekbones and a pair of piercing grey eyes surmounted by shaggy eyebrows the other was a shorter stouter man lighthaired and blueeyed a genuine saxon all over his fair complexion tanned to a rich ruddybrown hue and with a hearty kindly genial expression of countenance which won georges heart in an instant this individual was also in white his clothing being reduced to a shirt and a pair of white duck trousers supported at the waist by a belt george had no difficulty in deciding that he was on board one of his majestys frigates and that the persons who stood beside him were her captain and the medico hoos a wi ye the noo my mon repeated the doctor placing his fingers upon georges pulse iiscarcely know stammered george drowsily i feel all right and very comfortable is anything the matter andand where am i ye feel a richt do ye returned the doctor ignoring georges question yere no hungrynor thirsty eh not particularly answered george and yet i think i could take some breakfast if it would not be troubling brackfast hear til him brackfast why mondrawing out a huge turniplike silver watchits nearly sax oclock pm will a bite o dinner no serve ye as weel hech hech and the queer grumpylooking visage of the really genialhearted doctor beamed into a smile as his lips uttered the strange sounds which with him passed for laughter doctor pearsons laughter was infectious perhaps because of its singularity george smiled in response and captain singleton smiled too then turning to the doctor the latter said my dinner will be served in a few minutes doctor if you think it would not injure your patient i will send him in something from my table weel responded the doctor with the caution characteristic of his countrymen ill no commit mysel by any positeeve statement just ill wait and see since yeve been so vera kind as to ask me to dine wi ye but i think i may venture to say that a wee drappie o soup will no hurt the chiel and noo wi your leave captain ill just tak the sma leeberty o turnin ye oot o your ain cabin as theres been an ample suffeecency o conversation for the present the captain laughed goodnaturedly and turned with a friendly nod to george to leave the cabin doctor pearson also turned to go but paused for an instant to once more feel georges pulse and then with an amiable grunt of satisfaction he also walked out saying as he went never fash your brains my mon by wonderin whaur ye are yere in guid hans ye may tak my word for it and in guid time when yere strong eneuch to talk youll be told everything noo lie still and keep your ees open for a few minutes and ill see that ye hae a decent bit of dinner sent in til ye the worthy doctor was as good as his word a substantial basin of nourishing soup with a small quantity of fresh white wholesome cabinbiscuit broken into itsoft tack was a comparatively unknown luxury at sea in those daysand a glass of port wine being brought in to george by the captains steward about ten minutes later and having demolished these the patient once more dropped off to sleep and passed a comfortable night three days more of doctor pearsons skilful treatment sufficed to put both george and tom upon their pins once more and then and not until then captain singleton asked of the former an account of the circumstances which had resulted in placing them in the desperate situation in which they had been found well said the captain at the conclusion of georges story i heartily sympathise with you mr leicester in all that you have suffered and i as heartily congratulate you on your plucky escape it was rather a clever trick the way in which those rascals took your ship from you i must say that it is a wrinkle which possibly i may some day play off in turn upon their own countrymen by your description of them i should say that the fellows were undoubtedly pirates the sea swarms with them all round about hereindeed we are now cruising for the purpose of putting a stop to their depredations and were returning from an unsuccessful chase after a very suspiciouslooking schooner when we picked you up there is one craft in particulara barque of undoubtedly english buildwhich we are most anxious to lay our hands upon her crew are a peculiarly bloodthirsty set of ruffians and have perpetrated an unusually large number of atrocities bythebye did you not say that your vessel was barquerigged and a fast sailer i should not be at all surprised to find that she is the identical craft we are so anxious to get hold of would you mind giving me a particular description of the aurora george of course readily acceded to this request detailing with seamanlike fidelity every peculiarity of hull and rigging when he had finished captain singleton said thank you the set of the spars and rigging and the cut of the canvas does not coincide with the description with which i have been furnished but your description of the hull tallies with mine in every particular and i have not a doubt that it is the same vessel and now to turn to other matters what do you propose to do with yourself when we land you at kingston well said george i scarcely know but i suppose i shall endeavour to get a berth on board a homewardbound ship or work my passage home there is nothing else that i can do for i am absolutely penniless well said captain singleton if a sufficient sum to defray the expenses of your passage home would be of any service to you i dare say i could manage to raise such an amount and you shall be heartily welcome to it thank you very much returned george but i could not possibly accept your exceedingly kind offer even as a loan for i could not be certain of ever being in a position to repay it no i shall have to get a berth of some kind four days after the above conversation the cruise of the hebe terminated and on the day following george and tom found themselves cast adrift as it were in the sandy streets of kingston they were not absolutely penniless however for in addition to a good serviceable suit of clothes apiece out of the slopchest captain singleton had insisted upon georges accepting a tenpound note to meet their more immediate needs and being in a friendly port now the two seamen had very little doubt of getting employment of some kind or other before long their idea was first to make the round of the various shipping agents offices and endeavour to obtain a berth on a homewardbound ship if that failed then george thought they might possibly aided by captain singletons influence obtain work in the dockyard at port royal and if the worst came to the worst they could always depend with absolute certainty upon being received on board a manowar in pursuance of the firstmentioned plan they were wending their way along the street when as they passed the entrance to a large general store they were violently jostled by a man who was making his exit from the place with considerable precipitation beg pardon shipmates no damage done i hope i ought to have kept a better lookout when crowding sail to the extentwhywhyno it cant be and yethang me if it aint after all well this is a pleasant surprise and no mistake capn how are ye and you tom how did them damned slavedrivers treat you it was mr bowen the late chief mate of the aurora he was dressed in the somewhat rough garb of the mate of a coasting schooner but was looking well and hearty nevertheless and certainly had nothing of the appearance of a man who had recently been suffering the horrors of slavery george and tom both shook hands heartily with their old friend and then mr bowenwho seemed to be pretty well acquainted with the townled the way into a quiet respectable tavern near the waterside having called for some sangaree in honour of the unexpected and very agreeable meeting george at his friends request proceeded to recount all that had happened since the eventful morning when they were separated for life as each then feared in the square at havana when he had finished the story he added and now bowen my dear old friend let us know how you fared among the dons badly enough capn badly enough was the reply but you shall hear the whole story such as tis maybe you happen to remember the chap as bought mea tall thin feller with a nose like the beak of an eagle and a wicked look in his glittering black eyes well as soon as this here don christovalthat was his nameas soon as hed bought all the slaves he wanted we was all chained together and started on a march to the southard we travelled the whole width of that cursed island taking two days over the trip and was then shipped across in a little flatbottomed sailinboat to the isle de pinos where this here christoval had a big baccy plantation it took us a whole day after wed landed on the isle of pines to reach the place and on the following morning we were set to work as it happened i was the only white slave on the plantation and whether twas on this account or whether twas because i was an englishman i cant tell but i soon found out that all hands from don christoval downwards had a special spite against me and seemed determined to make the place as hot as they could for me i was put to all the heaviest and dirtiest work about the place and if there was a job that had to be done after knockinoff time i was the man that had to do it there was nothing but spanish spoke about the place so i very soon got acquainted with the lingo whether i liked it or not and almost the first thing i understood was that mr don christoval had boasted that fierce as i was hed tame me so that in six months i wouldnt dare to say my soul was my own well you may be sure that my temper hadnt grown much more amiable from being made a slave of and this palaver about taming just made me worse than ever i vowed by all that was holy i wouldnt be tamed let em do what they would and a pretty miserable time of it this stupid vow and my own obstinacy brought me they used to amuse themselves by seein what they could do to rouse me the overseers as they were riding by would pull up and begin to abuse and scoff at me flicking at me with their whips all the time and i dare say you know pretty well how clever those same overseers are with their whips theyll hit a fly twenty feet off and when theyd see my eyes begin to sparkle theyd just let out with the infernal whip fetching me a regular stinger across the shoulders and gallop off laughing i can tell you they made a regular devil of me before all was done well one morning there was a regular rumpus on the estate don christoval had sold some cattle the day before and had been paid for em the money was stowed carefully away by him when he turned in that night and next morning twas gonesomebodyd crept into the house during the night and had stole it well as there was nobody about the estate but the regular hands it was clear enough that some of these must have got hold of the cash and the lying scoundrels had the impudence to say that i was the thief they came down two of the overseers did and searched my hut fore and aft from deck to keelson but of course they didnt find it for the simple reason that i hadnt took it howsever they would insist that i knew where twas and at last they dragged me up to the house and told the don that id took it but that they couldnt find it because id hid it away somewhere the don happened to be just starting off for a ride and was mounted on a splendid black horse he sat there in the saddle and listened to all that the overseers had to say and when theyd finished he spurred his horse at me and swearing that hed get the secret out of me if he had to cut my heart out to find it raised his heavy ridingwhip and made a slash at me well capn and tom old shipmate you neednt be told that i had already been made pretty savage by all this business and when this hawknosed don christoval struck out at me why it just roused all the devil there was in me i put up my handsoas if to ward off the stroke and as the whip came down i caught it in my hand wrenched it out of the dons grasp and as quick as lightning returned the blow with all my strength lashing him fair across the face and cutting his cheek open he reeled backwards in his saddle and i first letting out right and left at the two overseers who stood one on each side of me and bowling them over like a couple of ninepins sprang upon him seized him by the collar and dragged him out of his saddle and leaping upon the frightened horses back gave the poor brute a lash across the flank which sent him flying down the road through the baccy plants and out upon the open country like a shot out of a shovel well i dont know that id ever been on horseback in my life before but somehow i managed to stick to the saddle it didnt seem at all difficult and on i went straight ahead as fast as the horse could gallop for an hour or more and then we fetched up somewhere on the shore there was a schooner in the offing with the british flag flying at her gaffend and as luck would have it id just managed to hit the spot where a boats crew belonging to her were ashore filling up their fresh water i told the middy in charge who and what i was and he shoved off at once with me took me aboard and told the lieutenant in command all about me and after knocking about with em for a fortnight i landed here just six months ago and that ends my yarn and what have you been doing since then asked george after congratulating bowen on his escape well capn was the reply i never once forgot the promise i made to you the day we were separated in havana i felt certain that youd manage to get away somehow some day and i felt just as certain that sooner or later youd turn up here in kingston so as soon as i was landed here i made inquiries and not being able to learn that anything had been heard of you i just looked about me a bit and got a berth on board a little coaster sos to be on the spot whenever you might happen to turn up id told our story pretty freely here in kingston so that even if id happened to have been at sea at the time theres plenty of people that would have taken you in tow and provided you with the needful until i came in again now that youve put in an appearance of course i shall throw up my berth and well all sink or swim together thanks bowen thanks thats just like your disinterestedness answered george but what are we to do the only thing i can see for it is to get berths if possible on board some homewardbounder homewardbounder exclaimed bowen with contemptuous emphasis why but there i suppose you dont know anything about it or you wouldnt talk like that about what asked george completely mystified why about our prize that we took that dark night on the passage out the privateer brigthe jeune virginie shes lying down there at port royal safe and sound with a british crew on board her and all youve got to do capn is to make your claim and establish your identity and the ship or her value will be handed over to you is it possible exclaimed george then we are lucky indeed but you must explain the whole affair to me thats easy enough answered bowen the very first time i entered port royal harbour i saw the craft lying there and knew her again at once thinks i to myself now dick bowen my lad your first duty is to recover possession of that prize on behalf of the skipper so off i goes to the admiral stated my case and made my claim thats all very well my fine fellow says he and i dont doubt but what youre telling the truth but you see says he you cant prove it now i must have something beyond your bare word before i give up possession of the brig when you can bring me something in the shape of proof that what you say is true come to me again and ill see what can be done in the matter of course that was all right and straightforard enough so i went away and troubled no more about it the craft is safe enough theyve been using her as a cruiser and taking care of her and i dont doubt but what shes in just as good order as she was on the night when we took her and now all weve got to do is to go to the admiral again and make our claim theres three of us this time so that therell be no difficulty at all in getting her delivered over to us chapter twenty one the aurora turns up again that same day george waited upon the admiral and formally laid claim to the jeune virginie he was very well received his statement patiently listened to andto make a long story shortin about three weeks afterwards the claim was actually allowed and the vessel handed over to her rightful owners george was agreeably surprised fornotwithstanding bowens implicit confidencehe fully anticipated that there would be some trouble over the matter legal possession once obtained leicester had no difficulty in raising money by means of a bottomry bond and with this he provisioned the brig for six months intending to take out letters of marque and endeavour to make good his lossesa resolution in which he was cordially seconded by bowen but though all this gave him plenty of occupation he had not forgotten his old crew and he foundor rather tooktime not only to prepare a complete list of the names and a full description of all those who were stillso far as he knewin a state of slavery but also to put it into the hands of the proper authorities with such an urgent representation of their probable sufferings that the matter was at once taken up and he had the satisfaction of knowing before he sailed that negotiations were already in progress for their discovery and deliverance considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining a crew for the brig good men being scarce but at last this was overcome and on a bright september morning the anchor was hove up and the virginie started upon her cruise the shoals outside the harbour were cleared in due time the brig working like a top and sailing like a witch to the unbounded delight of all hands and then george hauled sharp up on the port tack his intention being to cruise for a few days in the windward and caycos passages before shaping a course for home for the first five days of their cruise they were singularly unlucky seeing nothing but a manowar schooner which on speaking they found had been equally as unfortunate as themselves on the morning of the sixth day however being then in the neighbourhood of the hogsties the lookout aloft reported at daybreak a couple of sail dead to windward hoveto close together on the usual inquiries being made the lookout further reported that one of the strangers was a barque the rig of the other which happened to be lying endon he could not clearly make out but from her size he judged her to be a ship mr bowen whose watch it was at once went below and informed george of this circumstance and then leaving him to don the most indispensable portions of his attire returned to the deck and proceeded thence aloft to have a look at the strangers for himself by the time that he had seen all that it was then possible to see and had descended again to the deck george was awaiting him there well bowen what do you make of them was leicesters first inquiry well theres two of em there sure enough close togethera good deal too close together to be up to any good to my thinking was the reply what do you think they are then asked george one of em is a privateeror a pirate and tother is her prize in my opinion answered bowen then well make their further acquaintance said george perhaps if we trim the canvas a bit slovenly and act as though we had not seen these craft we may coax down towards us the privateer or whatever she is thatll be the best plan no doubt acquiesced the chief mate and he proceeded forthwith on a tour round the decks easing up a brace here and a halliard there with a touch also at the sheets and bowlines by way of insuring an agreeable and harmonious result when he had finished the brig looked like a collier and her speed had decreased from eight to a little over five knots there said bowen to george with an admiring glance aloft at his own handiwork i think thatll do pretty well we look helpless enough now for anything masthead ahoyto the lookout aloftwhat about the strangers now theyve dropped alongside one another sir was the reply very well keep your eye upon them and let us know when you see any change in their movements the stereotyped ay ay by way of reply was duly given and then george and bowen side by side and with hands folded behind them began to trudge fore and aft from the mainmast to the taffrail patiently awaiting the course of events about a quarter of an hour elapsed and then the lookout hailed again on deck there the barque has cast off and is standing down towards us theyre busy getting the stunsails upon her now sir all right stay where you are and lets hear if you see anything worth reporting replied bowen a few minutes later another report was made to the effect that the other saila fullrigged shiphad filled and was standing to the northward under all plain sail that was the last news from either of the vessels and the barque shortly afterwards becoming visible from the deck orders were given to clear the brig for action and the lookout was ordered down on deck there was a capital working breeze and not much sea it was consequently not very long before the barque had raised her hull above the horizon as soon as she was fairly in view george brought his telescope to bear upon her and ten minutes careful scrutiny sufficed to satisfy him that though her spars were heavier and she now showed a wider spread of canvas than of old she was undoubtedly as he had suspected his own old ship the aurora he further noted that she was not very deep in the water being in fact just in her very best sailingtrim and remembering her former capabilities he was not long in making up his mind that if her present crew happened to become suspicious of the character of the virginie and shunned an engagement it would be a very difficult matter to bring the aurora to action but if those in possession of the barque entertained any misgivings they certainly gave no visible indication of them on the contrary they came sweeping down upon the virginie under a perfect cloud of canvas and in a manner so obviously threatening that in order to maintain the illusion to the last george thought it advisable to exhibit some slight signs of uneasiness and he accordingly ordered the royals to be loosed and set and edged away a point or two off his course at the same time however checking his weather braces to such an extent that the brigs speed was not very greatly improved by the manoeuvre in the meantime the decks had been cleared the guns loaded and the crew fully armed with cutlass pike and pistol the portlids however were kept carefully closed so that the presence of the guns on board might not be revealed until an action should have become inevitable mr bowen had in the midst of all his work been watching the approach of the aurora with grim satisfaction gradually developing into a condition of supreme exhilaration he rubbed his hands gleefully laughed softly to himself and exhibited in short all the outward characteristics of a thoroughly gratified man then he would draw a pistol from his belt and carefully inspect the priming pass his thumb meditatively along the edge of his cutlass or casually test with his finger the sharpness of a pikehead and at these times the expression of his countenance boded no good to the approaching enemy the virginies crew were kept carefully out of sight except some three or four hands who were ostentatiously posted on the forecastle with orders to assume an appearance of deep interest in the approach of the barque but bowen had carefully placed each man exactly where he wanted him and as the aurora came sweeping down upon the brig invisible hands on board the latter gradually tautened up halliard brace tack sheet and bowline until by the time that the two ships were within a mile of each other every trace of slovenliness on board the virginie had vanished every sail was standing as flat as a board and the brig was once more in a condition to be worked to the best advantage this done the men were ordered to their guns and all was ready for the commencement of the struggle when within a distance of about threequarters of a mile from the brig the studdingsails of the aurora were seen to suddenly collapse and in a few seconds they had entirely disappeared being taken in all at once manowar fashion this showed george not only that his old craft was heavily manned but also that she was in the command of a man who knew how to handle her but the sight did not greatly disturb him he had had time to discover that his own crew was a good one he had studied the brig and mastered her little peculiarities and he awaited with perfect calmness the conflict which was now inevitable as the auroras studdingsails fluttered out of sight she sheered broadly to port a flash accompanied by a puff of white smoke issued from her side and in another instant a ninepound shot skipped along the water and across the virginies bow george decided to take no notice of this hint and the brig held steadily on her course another shot followed with a like result and the pirates then decided apparently to waste no more powder and shot upon so contumacious a craft but to make short work of the affair by simply running alongside and taking possession the aurora was accordingly steered in such a way as would admit of her making a wide sweep and shooting up alongside on the brigs weather quarter she was handled magnificently there was no doubt of that and presently with a graceful sweep she came surging up alongside with the water spouting up in a clear transparent sheet under her sharp bows her yards swinging simultaneously to meet her change of course her white canvas gleaming in the brilliant sunlight six long ninepounders grinning through her bulwarks and her deck crowded with men as fair yet as evil a sight of its kind as the eye of man ever rested upon at the same moment a bloodred flag streamed out over the taffrail and soared away aloft until it fluttered out from the gaffenda fit emblem of rapine and murder red this time by way of a change remarked bowen to george in allusion to their encounter with the pirate schooner which fought under a black flag well a change is good sometimes he added philosophically shall we give her a taste of our quality now capn shes just shooting into the right position to get the full benefit of the dose of round and grape ive prepared for her yes give it her answered george drawing his cutlass with one hand and a pistol with the other throw open your ports lads commanded bowen and at the word the portlids flew apart six twelvepounders were run out on each side and as the barque was in the very act of sheering alongside the virginies starboard broadside was poured into her with murderous effect as was evidenced by the frightful outburst of yells groans and imprecations which at once arose on board her the broadside was returned but without inflicting much damage the pirates evidently having been taken completely by surprise by the sudden and unexpected unmasking of the brigs guns the next moment the two vessels collided with a crash now look alive with your grapplingirons and heave boarders follow me cried george dashing to the rail and making a spring thence in upon the auroras deck mr bowen at the same time leading his detachment on board by way of the forerigging the englishmen were met by a very formidable party which had evidently been told off to board the brig and in an instant a fierce and sanguinary melee arose on the auroras deck the spaniardsfor such they proved to bethough taken by surprise and greatly disconcerted by the unexpectedly warm reception which they had met with from the brig fought with the fury and desperation of demons and for perhaps five minutes the crew of the virginie had all their work cut out to maintain their position on the deck of the barque the pirates with that sanguinary symbol floating over their heads and believing that they had been entrapped into attacking a manowar felt that the halter was already about their necks and that there was literally no alternative but victory or death for them and they pressed forward with such recklessness and ferocity that the deck speedily assumed the aspect of a human shambles and the planking grew so slippery with blood that it became difficult to retain ones footing upon it there was one spaniard in particular who appeared to possess the gift of ubiquity he seemed to be in all parts of the ship at the same time notwithstanding the crowded state of the confined space wherein the fight was raging and in him george speedily recognised the truculentlooking individual who had led the pirates on the eventful night of the auroras capture and who had so brutally illused poor bowen on the morning of the sale in the square at havana there could be no possible doubt as to his identity there was the same ferocious cast of countenance the same mahoganybrown skin even the same filthy red handkerchiefnow more filthy than everbound about his ragged locks apparently the same broadbrimmed straw hat in short every mark of identification nothing was wanting this individual dashed from point to point apparently by a mere effort of his will encouraging here chiding there and helping everywhere the mere fact of his presence the mere sound of his voice appeared to endue the pirates with renewed life and courage and george speedily saw that there would be little hope of victory until this man could be placed hors de combat he therefore pressed in toward him plying his cutlass vigorously with one hand and laying manfully about him with the butt of his empty pistol with the other and calling upon the fellow by every despicable epithet he could think of to turn and meet him he had very nearly reached himthere were only some halfadozen people between the twowhen another voice that of bowen was heard and the next instant the chief mate his eyes literally blazing with fury appeared forcing his way into the thickest of the throng with the strength of a madman he seized and dashed aside all who ventured to bar his path and in a single moment so it seemed to george forced himself within reach of his especial enemy at lastat lastyou bloodthirsty scoundrelyou whitelivered cowardyou who were not ashamed to strike a chained manat last we meet again as i told you we shouldand the time has come for me to pay off part of the debt i owe youno you dontskilfully guarding a savage downstroke from the spaniards cutlass and take that he added launching out a terrific blow with his left fist catching the spaniard fairly between the eyes and felling him to the deck senseless as neatly as a butcher fells an ox in another moment george was at bowens side and placing themselves back to back these two managed to successfully defend themselves until the crew of the virginie inspired by their leaders example had pressed in to their assistance when the pirates becoming scattered were driven irresistibly to opposite ends of the ship and some were actually driven overboard then recognising that they were defeated and suddenly losing heart they threw down their weapons and cried for quarter but the worst passions of the virginias crew were by this time fully aroused they thought of nothing but the fact that their enemies were pirates men steeped to the lips in crime of the vilest description and guilty of unnumbered deeds of bloodcurdling atrocity and many of the spaniards were ruthlessly slaughtered before george and bowen could induce them to stay their hands then when order and authority were once more restored heads were counted and it was found that out of a crew of over eighty twentythree pirates onlytheir leader includedremained alive and these were promptly clapped in irons and bundled unceremoniously below strange to say notwithstanding the desperate character of the fighting the virginies crew had suffered but slightly in comparisonnine killed and thirteen wounded being the total of the casualties a short breathingspace was allowed the men to recover themselves after their extraordinary exertions and then all hands set to work to clear the decks of the sickening evidences of the contest the crew were next divided equally between the two ships and with mr bowen in command of the aurora both craft then made sail to windward in company the third craftthe fullrigged shipmeanwhile was still in sight from aloft dodging about under easy canvas and evidently waiting for the aurora to rejoin there could be little doubt therefore that she was in the possession of a prizecrew of the pirates and george earnestly hoped he might be able to reach her in time to save the lives of some at least of those to whom she rightfully belonged a couple of hours later they were alongsidethe virginie on the weather and the aurora on the lee quarterwith ports open guns run out and the english ensign flying at the peak the red flag having been allowed to remain aloft on board the aurora until ranging alongside the strange ship when it was hauled down and the english flag run up on board the barque and the brig simultaneously the pirates in possession were completely paralysed by the turn events had taken they had evidently been under the impression that the aurora and not the virginie had proved victorious and now that they found themselves under the guns of both ships their mistake was past rectification accordingly at georges order they backed the mainyard and hoveto the ship upon which a strong party armed to the teeth proceeded on board and took possession the ship proved to be the vulcan of and from liverpool bound to kingston with a valuable general cargo and several passengers she was a noble ship being of nearly a thousand tons register and a regular clipper on boarding her george found the state of affairs pretty much what it had been on board the aurora after her capture by these same pirates her crew and the male passengers being discovered scattered about the deck lashed helplessly neck and heels together or chained to ringbolts in the deck and bulwarks whilst the pirates had taken possession of the cabin and had held a regular saturnalia there in the progress of which the unfortunate lady passengers had been subjected to the vilest outrages and one poor little child had been cruelly murdered before its distracted mothers face the captain and the chief mate of the ship were both found in the cabin in a dying condition they having been mutilated in a most cruel and horrible manner in an ineffectual effort to wring from them the secret of the hidingplace of a large amount of specie which the pirates had somehow ascertained was on board a tall and burly negro the identical one who had acted as lieutenant to the spaniard in charge of the aurora on the occasion of her first capture was at the head of the gang and had been the instigator and chief perpetrator in the many outrages which had followed the capture of the vulcan no time was lost in freeing the passengers and crew from their exceedingly unpleasant situation and this done the pirates ten in number heavily ironed were transferred to the virginie and stowed carefully away below the vulcan then proceeded on her voyage in charge of her second mate by whom george forwarded a letter to the admiral at jamaica informing him of the capture of the now notorious aurora george now felt that with two ships and so many desperate men to look after he had his hands full and he therefore decided to make the best of his way to england forthwith he accordingly hailed bowen requesting him to give the auroras stores an overhaul and to ascertain whether her provisions and water were sufficient in quantity to justify them in making a push across the atlantic in about an hour an answer was returned to the effect that not only was there an abundance of everything but that the ship herself was more than half full of a varied and very rich cargo the spoils doubtless from many a missing vessel upon the receipt of this intelligence orders were at once given for both ships to fill and make the best of their way to the northward in company and by nightfall they were clear of the caycos passage and standing to the northward on a taut bowline under a heavy press of canvas the virginie and aurora made an excellent passage across the atlantic they stood to the northward until the trades were cleared when they fell in with fresh westerly winds which carried them all the way across and as the weather was fine they had no difficulty in keeping each other in sight during the whole passage the two craft regulating their spread of canvas so that neither should outsail the other the passage was consequently an uneventful one nothing worthy of note occurring until they were in the chops of the channel then indeed an adventure befell them which proved george to have been wise in his determination that the two vessels should make the voyage in company it was the last week in october they had just struck soundings when the two craft ran into a dense raw fog which compelled all hands to seek warmth and comfort in their thickest jackets and necessitated as a matter of prudence the immediate shortening of sail the fog lasted a couple of hours and when it cleared up the aurora was discovered about two miles astern of the brig and a large ship was at the same moment made out directly ahead the stranger was hoveto under singlereefed topsails with her head to the northward her topsailyards being just visible from the deck the fact of her being hoveto in such a position seemed to point to the conclusion that she was a manowar and this supposition was confirmed when george took a look at her through his glass from the foretopgallantyard she was a frigate and french apparently from the cut of her canvas but of course it was quite possible that she might be in english hands the english often taking french prizes into their own navy and sending them to sea again with little or no alteration still george thought it best to be on the safe side and he accordingly at once ordered the virginie to clear for action the aurora being signalled to do the same his intention being to attack the frigate if an enemy since as far as he could make out she carried only twentyfour guns in the meantime however the brig and the barque had been discovered by the frigate which at once made sail and manoeuvred in such a manner as to intercept them bowen on the other hand guessing at once what was in the wind crowded sail upon the aurora and soon recovered his position alongside the virginie approaching the latter vessel within hailing distance in order the better to concert plans for the possible coming engagement these were soon arranged but not before it had become pretty evident from the comparatively clumsy handling of the stranger that she was indeed french their doubts such as they were were set at rest when the frigate had approached within a mile of them by her hoisting a tricolour at her gaffend and soon afterwards she sent a shot across their forefoot as a polite intimation that they would oblige her by heavingto they however did nothing of the kind a piece of discourtesy which so preyed upon the french captains mind that without more ado he bore down upon them and opened fire from his starboard broadside the three ships at that moment formed the three angles of a nearly equilateral triangle the sides of which measured each about a quarter of a mile the virginie and the aurora occupying as it were the two ends of the base and the frenchman being at the apex this allowed both english ships to attack their enemy on the same sidethe starboardand compelled the frenchman to fight them both with only half his battery he soon saw how great a disadvantage he laboured under by this arrangement and did all he could to get between them but it was all to no purpose george and bowen were fully as wideawake as he was and they successfully defeated every effort of his in this direction principally it must be confessed by some lucky shooting on their part whereby the frenchmans spars and rigging were so cut up that the craft soon became practically unmanageable at length after a brisk fight of about twenty minutes the frenchmans fore and maintopmasts both went simultaneously over the side the frigate luffed into the wind and obstinately remained there and she was at georges mercy the virginie at once made sail and took up a position across the enemys bows the aurora placed herself across his stern and from these two advantageous positions a raking fire was opened which in less than five minutes caused the frenchman to haul down his flag and surrender the prizewhich proved to be the twentyfourgun frigate cignewas at once taken possession of by boats from both the virginie and the aurora her crew secured and her damages repaired and about midnight the three vessels made sail in company arriving without further adventure at spithead on the day but one following chapter twenty two alls well that ends well the anchors were no sooner on the bottom than george found himself a busy man there were certain authorities to be communicated with as to the disposal of the french prisoners other authorities to be consulted as to the disposal of the pirates and still others again to be seen and arranged with as to the disposal of the prizes then there were the owners of the vulcan to be dealt with in the matter of the salvage of that vessel so that altogether he was kept going to and fro from morning until night then there was lucy to be called upon but knowingor thinking he knewthat the sad news he had to communicate would go far toward breaking the heart of the poor girl he eagerly availed himself of every excuse which offered to defer his visit and so it happened that whilst lucywho had heard with astonishment and joy unspeakable the news of his strange reappearance and good fortunewaited impatiently for the longedfor visit george was postponing it day after day until nearly a fortnight had passed and in truth he was so worried and harassed with unexpected difficulties that even if he could have found the time he lacked the heart for such a call to his intense surprise he learned that though he had arrived at spithead with three ships neither of them belonged to him to begin with the virginie having been captured whilst her captors were under the protection of a convoying squadron was claimed as being actually the prize of that squadron though not one of the ships belonging to it had fired a shot or struck a blow to aid in the capture then as to the aurora having not only bought and paid but also fought for her george was strongly of opinion that she at least was his but here again it appeared that he was mistaken she had been taken from him by pirates and had been out of his possession more than twentyfour hours she was therefore de facto a pirate and the lawful prize of the virginie or rather of the virginies owners namely the convoying fleet aforesaid and the same reasoning applied with equal effect to the cigne the naval authorities certainly were good enough to admit that george and his crew were in virtue of their having been the actual captors of these vessels entitled to a certain moderate share of the prizemoney accruing therefrom but further than that they would not go but if george found himself a busy man he also found himselfoutside the circle ruled by official jealousyfamous the story not only of his gallant achievements but also of his misfortunes leaked out as such stories will and he soon found himself a muchsoughtafter man quite a lion in fact to such an extent indeed was this the case that even the curiosity of royalty itself was aroused and in the very midst of all his perplexities leicester received a summons to present himself at court this summons george of course dutifully and promptly obeyed and whilst there not only told the whole story of his adventures but also laid before his most gracious majesty the grievances from which he considered himself to be suffering he was well rewarded for his pains for when the king came to be fully informed of the details of the case he took the matter in hand himself with the result that a speedy and on the whole fairly satisfactory settlement was arrived at he was also offered a commission in the navy his majesty sagely remarking that so good a man ought to be serving his country in some better way than by commanding a mere merchantship and this time george was sensible enough to accept the offer at his suggestion a commission was also offered to and accepted by bowen all this business being at length satisfactorily concluded george had no further excuse for shunning sea view and accordingly on the first opportunity he set out with considerable perturbation of spirit for alverstoke it was about seven oclock in the evening and quite dark when george reached the house and passing through the gate strode up the wellremembered pathway and administered a sounding rattat at the door a smart freshlooking maidservant answered the summons and on his inquiry for miss walford showed him into the familiar parlour and asked for his name captain leicester answered george yes sir certainly sir said the girl eyeing george with such undisguised curiosity and admiration as showed that she had undoubtedly heard some portion at least of his story missus ll be down in a minute sir please to take a seat sir george settled himself comfortably in a chair near the fire and looking round at the wellremembered pictures and curios which still adorned the room fell into a reverie in which his mind travelled backward and took him again in imagination through all that had happened to him since he last sat in that room from this he was brought back abruptly to the present by the opening of the door and the entrance of lucy ah how georges heart leapt within his bosom as he looked at her she was just the same charming girl as when he had seen her last and yet there was a subtle difference she was a trifle more womanly her form was more fully developed and if she was a shade paler it only made her loveliness more distractingly bewitching than ever lucky ned thought george to have been the chosen lover of such a woman as thisay though only for a few short hours how willingly would i change places with you so you have come at last captain said lucy offering her delicate little hand i was beginning to think that with all the honours which have been showered upon you you had quite forgotten your former friends no lucy i have not answered george i have not forgotten one of themleast of all have i forgotten you forgotten why i have never ceased to remember you i do not believe a single waking hour has passed over my head since we last met that i have not thought of you lucy laughed blithely she saw by the earnestness of his manner that he was speaking the literal truth he had not forgotten her and all would yet be well fie fie captain said she it is easily to be seen that you have been to court you have learned so thoroughly the art of flattery ha exclaimed george have you heard of my visit to his majesty then yes indeed answered lucy i have heard not only that but i believe your whole story is it possible you are ignorant of the fact that your name is in everybodys mouth and that your story is public property so you have heard all about me remarked george then i hope to heaven that you have also already heard the sad news which i came over to break to you this evening i see you are in black yes said lucy growing very grave at once i am in mourning for poor mother she died nearly a year ago but what is the sad news of which you have to speak to me you have not heard then said george well it is about your cousin edward i regret to say that i bring you bad news of him are you referring to his death asked lucy with just the faintest suspicion of a tremor in her voice because if so i have already heard of it and of all your noble selfsacrificing behaviour on his behalf and as a relative as indeed his only surviving relative let me here and now thank you george in all earnestness and sincerity for your devotion to my unfortunate cousin by jove she bears it well she cant have cared so very much for him after all thought george no thanks are necessary i assure you was the reply i only did for him what i would have done with equal readiness for a stranger but i had vowed that i would be a protector to him and that i wouldif god willed itrestore him to your arms and i am grieved that i failed to keep my vow believe me it was through no fault of mine that i failed lucy i did the best i could but god willed it otherwise yesyes answered lucy in a dazed sort of way yes god willed it otherwise butwhatever do you mean george by talking about restoring him to my arms any one would think to hear you speak that i was married to him well said george betrothal is a sort of marriage is it not betrothal exclaimed lucy looking more bewildered than ever pray explain yourself captain leicester i assure you i have not the slightest idea of what you mean it was now georges turn to look mystified no idea of what i mean he stammered whywhyyou were engaged to your cousin edward walford were you not a new light suddenly flashed into lucys mind all along she had been convinced that there was some reason for georges failure to visit her on the occasion of his previous arrival in port and now the matter was assuredly on the eve of explanation so she looked up into georges face and said quietly no george i never was engaged to my cousin he proposed to me but i refused him explicitly and in most unmistakable terms you did panted george his heart throbbing tumultuously when was that on the evening of the day when you last arrived in portsmouth harbour in the industry then all in a moment a suspicion of the truth dawned upon george and it was on that same evening that i met him out there close to the church and he confided to me as a great secret the circumstance that you had just accepted him you were so near as that and yet you never called for shame george exclaimed lucy well you seeithat isin fact i could not thethe plain truth is that ii was on my way to you at the time to try my own fortune with you and when i was told that you had accepted your cousin i well i felt that i couldnt meet you just then stammered george with desperate energy poor george murmured lucy how well my cousin understood your unsuspicious character he knew it would never occur to you to doubt his word and he told you that tale to keep you away fromfrom from what from whom asked george oh lucy is it possible that if i had carried out my original resolution that night you would have accepted me yes george i would indeed was the murmured reply i have loved you and you only for a long time but not longer than you have loved me she added roguishly as george took her in his arms and but avast there whither are we running it is high time that we should bout ship and haul off on the opposite tack if we would not be regarded as impertinent intruders lovemaking is a most delightful pastime particularly when it comes in at the end of a long period of suffering hardship and misunderstanding but it loses all its piquant charm if it has to be performed in the presence of strangers no matter how sympathetic so we will leave it to the lively imagination of the intelligent reader to picture for him or herself according to his or her particular fancy the way in which the remainder of the evening was spent merely mentioning that the lovers found time to come to a thoroughly and mutually satisfactory understanding and that when george left sea view that evening he wasto make use of a somewhat hackneyed expressionthe happiest of men my story is now ended or nearly so the intelligent reader aforesaid having doubtless already anticipated the little that remains to be told the pirates were tried found guilty and executed as a matter of course the evidence of the crew of the virginie alone being sufficient to insure their conviction captain bowen went at considerable personal inconvenience to witness the execution being desirous as he said of assuring himself with his own eyes that the wretches were so effectually dealt with as to render any further trouble from them an absolute impossibility george leicester did not accompany
